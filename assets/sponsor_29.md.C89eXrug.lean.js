Since then I have taken over 7,000 pictures and I am so glad it's still going. I plan on getting a new camera, but only because technology is improving so rapidly. This camera has been wonderful and survived many drops, hits, stratches and throws. Kodak is a great company and helped me whenever I needed it, including sending new battery doors to replace the ones I've broken when dropping the camera 4+ feet. Great model, great company, great memories. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a completely useless camera","review":"this camera's lack of any battery life at all makes this camera absolutely useless. with the rechargable batteries that it comes with, as soon as you insert them fully charged, it indicates half battery life and the camera lasts no more than maybe 4 pictures. i've replaced the batteries with new kodak rechargable ones, but the same thing happens. what's the point of a camera if it is impossible to hold enough energy to use through a single session?i see that many other consumers are complaining about this as well (even the consumers giving the camera four stars!)absolutely DO NOT BUY this camera because you'll be finding yourself bringing bulk packs of batteries to your next family gathering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great So Far","review":"I knew nothing about digital cameras before I bought this. I really just wanted something to take quickie pictures that I can use online. This is perfect for that. It's simple, easy to use, and the pictures turn out well for the price you pay. I am extremely satisfied. This camera is not for the serious photographer. You'll need a mre expensive, flashier model for that. But but if you are looking to make good pics for web pages and e-mails quickly, I don't think you can do any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera","review":"Great camera for the price. All the advice I heard was \\"don't go below 3mp.\\" My budget was small, so I decided to take the risk anyway. The resolution on the camera viewing screen isn't all that great, but I have printed off a lot of pictures, all sizes and they have turned out wonderful! Great camera for the casual picture taker."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it weren't a gift I'd send it back...","review":"Even with the little screen on the back of this camera you can't tell that a picture you've taken is blury. Not to mention it is particularly confusing having a switch on the side to determine whether its in focus for close ups or distance photos. The low megapixels make it impossible to enlarge anything you've cropped to any extent. Finally and probably the worst problem has to do with light. If you are unfortunate enough to have to use the flash, it only lights up the center of the picture often washing out the middle and leaving a circle of darkness around the edge. I was almost broken hearted when I realized there was nothing I could do about this. I imagine that for as much as the gift giver paid...it was probably still too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small wonder with wrong cable","review":"I received the camera today, and the size of it just amazed me. It is very small (even though this oculd be tricky, because you could lose it or break it in an easier way). The quality of the pictures seems OK on the LCD. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to download them from the cam, because the cable seems to be the wrong size. I'll probably solve this problem, but the first impression wasn't the best, and that's why I took a star out of my review. With all the features the cam has, it was really a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall pretty good","review":"This camera is easy to use and is good quality for the price. However, one disadvantage is that it does not have a zoom lens. Also, what you see through the viewfinder is a little different then how the picture ends up; the final picture has extra space on the right that you don't see when looking in the viewfinder, so be sure to keep that in mind when trying to center a picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Choppers: Tommy Ivo's T Bucket?","review":"Not sure. But that looks a lot like TV Tommy Ivo's Buick powered T bucket street rod that Arch Hall, Jr is zipping around in.This story of young car thieves doesn't completely flop thanks to the film's somewhat business-like pace. There's a kind of sincerity of effort to 'The Choppers' that makes you stop laughing at the amateurish acting and dialog long enough to pay attention. The ex-Playmate of the Month in the role of the insurance guy's always hungry secretary provides another reason to pay attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poorly Made DVD","review":"This movie is a Juvenile Delinquent classic, but its such a poorly made DVD it's a cryin' shame. The print is the worst I've ever seen, looking like it was put through a Cuisinart. The Chapter Search doesn't even have titles, like the distributor was too busy to bother working on this disc and getting it right. Get the Something Weird DVD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Is Missing From The Choppers","review":"Although The Choppers does look great, it's unbelievably missing nearly ten minutes of footage. The first cut scene brings up the stakeout plan and the last has Arch Hall Jr. singing \\"Monkeys In My Hatband\\" (which another reviewer mentioned.) The longest takes place at the Chick-A-Dilly with Marianna Gaba playing detective while enticing the gang in order to find out the owner of the hotrod the police are after. It's her best scene where she does more than just look sensational. The Choppers is entertaining and would have been even better without these cuts. Cutting ten minutes out of a movie that ran only 66 to begin withmakes absolutely no sense to me. A couple of other versions are available, but I don't know if they are complete or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I loved it, my kids love it, pairing it with Horton Hears A Who is just a bonus as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Streaming Video","review":"There isn't much I can add to the reviews already here.

In the actual show, however, the Grinch is definitely YELLOW. Obviously a bad transfer to DVD. I've put this DVD on several DVD players and it is always YELLOW, so it's this version of the Show, not the DVD players. This version of the show should have been recalled.

This is the Grinch of your youth, order with confidence! As for the critics of the Grinch's color I can only assume one of three causes for their concern: 1-The DVD has been remastered recently due to complaints, 2-Their equipment is faulty, or 3-Ingestion of way too many consciousness altering substances, in which case STOP NOW!

Damu Doru??)is a song that fits in just perfectly. HORTON HEARS A WHO, the second cartoon feature in this video is a delight too with a \\"catchy\\" moral and oddly scary villains.

Still, the author uses clever stylistic devices to weave in realism and drama - she writes anonymously, uses a second-person view point, and adds a twist in the peripheral plot where the anonymous author is reported to disappear (the press smoked out the real author eventually).Although disappointing, it is enjoyable as a quirky exploration of the contradictions in married life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Before I've read this book, I've read reviews where it claims that this resembles a \\"classical\\" read, and it's \\"right up there with the Victorians\\" in terms of women having no voice. Well, when I finally sat down and read it, I thought those reviews were overrated in its praise. The only ressemblance of the \\"women having no voice\\" bit was the author not using her name on the cover. The book follows the 'mass literature Harlequin' formula and I thought the main character was a little bland in terms of her \\"wanting more\\". It is also not feminist of the main character to run off in her life; it was more cowardice in her part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erotic and Real","review":"I had never heard of the author Nikki Gemmell before I purchased \\"The Bride Stripped Bare\\", but I'm very glad I did. It's about a suburban housewife who feels stifled in her marriage and yearns for something more. Sounds familiar and trite, but the book is not. In diary format it tells the story of her journey of self discovery of her sexual needs and desires and is beautifully, even lyrically, written. As I read I kept thinking, \\"Yes, this rings true, I recognize these feelings.\\" There are graphic accounts of sexual pleasure, so be forewarned, but there are also sharp insights into intimate relationships. This book may be classified as erotica but it is literature, unlike the currently popular \\"steamy\\" novels. The book will probably appeal most to women, but any man reading it will get some insight as to what goes on in a woman's head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was very dissaponted in this book.

Although the author captures the breadth of what can be hidden in the average housewife's heart and mind, she tried too hard to be shocking and \\"taboo\\", thereby discounting the truths that were touched upon. Having a husband who is a robot in bed naturally leads to... cab driver orgies? Note to the \\"bride\\": Freedom and self expression do not die when you get married unless you let them. Also, investing in a vibrator would have been a wise first move before jumping head on into the whole virgin/sex slave dynamic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book is terrible. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would get better. No such luck. And the ending is terrible, unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"Maybe it was all the hype around the expose of Nikki Gemmell as the author, but I had expected this book to be much better.I think the concept of the book was excellent, but Gemmell didn't appear to have the intelligence, erotic experience/imagination or skill as an author to deliver what could have been an intriguing book.The plot is not fully rounded and the characters lack depth - both plot and characters have potential but it is never achieved.A great book if you want an easy holiday read, but don't expect something confronting or groundbreaking - better to go for something like Hollywood Wives which doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is.I think it would have also been cleverer if she had, at some point, either linked back to, or acknowledged, the source of the plagarised title (Brian Ferry Album).My conclusion on reading book was just that it's silly. Nearly as silly as the staged 'discovery' of the author and her pointless disclaimer at the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"This is the WORST book I have ever read. It could have gone so many wonderful ways, but it just kept getting worse and worse.Anyone who thinks this is a \\"heartbreaking tale of a good wife\\" needs to seriously seek some help.This book is NO insight into a real respectful or intelligent woman. This book is however insight to a woman who becomes a manipulating, lying, control freak.I threw it away- a first ever for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intimate Conversation With A Friend","review":"I had no expectations, no preconceived notions when I opened this book on my beach vacation. (I'm not even sure how I came to own it-- Kismet?). I found the story engaging, the prose alternating between lush and stark. The intimate experience of reading the journal-like entries was not unlike having a very close friend perched on the beach chair next to me. At times I wanted to hug the writer, at times cheer her on. Warn her! Gripe-and-moan with her! Serve as her \\"beard!\\" Throttle her when she made dumb choices. I whipped through this book in one indulgent morning and although I still feel the author \\"settled\\" . . . and, perhaps, paid the price of that compromise . . . I missed her sorely when she was gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Was a slow read and not as intriguing as online synopsis it seem.

This particular scanned and reprinted copy has very splotchy and difficult to read text. Although the physical product is adequate (good paper with a paperback binding), the print is an eyestrain at best and almost unreadable at worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired story, but cool Mummies!","review":"Katie Macalister has a ton of fans, so I'm thinking that maybe this book just wasn't for me. I'm a fan of the Anita Blake series, Mary Janice Davidson and Michelle Rowan so I though, hey let's give Sex Lies and Vampires a try.I finished the whole book, but I couldn't get into it. There were some really great parts-- Mummies etc. Macalister can be terribly funny. The problem lies in the repitition and the dialouge. The characters seem empty and the story tended to repeat itself a lot. They spent a LOT of time traveling from one place to the next. Every couple chapters there was a \\"on the train\\" scene. AUGH!Anyway, a gagillion fans can't be wrong-- Macalister is doing something right, and there is no denying she's a gifted writer... the story just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book is inane and stupid. I would advise everyone who has an IQ over room temperature to avoid buying or reading this book. The heroine is a complete ditz with whom you will be unable to develop any empathy. This book continually lacks a reasoned plot. This should be at the bottom of the bargain bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I love this book because it throws a bunch of different myths not just vampires into the book,which adds so much to the book in general. I would diffidently recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly entertaining!","review":"While I haven't been a huge romance novel fan, I found the Dark ones series very entertaining, keeping me up a little too late in some cases.

I was pleasantly surprised with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to give more stars -- really I did","review":"I've enjoyed the rest of this series. The Dark Ones are a funny take on another as well known series that is mentioned by titled. The humor is cute as button, we have a herione that you would love to have to tea. A very short tea.Here's the problem. The characters don't seem to actually be IN the story. Our narrator seems to be narrating from four or five steps back and never quite clicks with anythingHumor is reached for, a little too hard - case in point - the mummies.This seems to have been dashed off to make a deadline or fill a contract, the real passion and fun in the other two books of this series are just not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great vampire book by Katie","review":"Ehm not vampire, but dark ones :)The only reason for giving this book four stars is the fact that I liked Sex and the single vampire better. For the rest this was a book I could not put down. I had to know what was going to happen to the hero and heroine.I really felt for the two, and I was happy to see the story end the way it did.I so look forward to the next story in this series. Katie writes great vampires! Eh, dark ones that is :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I love all her books.

Her characters, as in many of her books, are flat, lacking in depth and vapid. They have very little going on in their lives, or at least they certainly do not mention anything approaching real here, nor do they develop personalities during the book. The plot was nearly non-existent and the vampires were unimpressive. If you want to read a real vampire book check the real horror section. If you want romance from this author try Corset Diaries or Men in Kilts and skip all the rest.I wish someone had shared this with me before I picked up Diaries, loved it and kept trying to find another gem in MacAlister's other books. I did not find one, other than Kilts, I am sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Feast from Project Greenlight.","review":"Just a warning, this isn't the \\"Feast\\" from \\"Project Greenlight\\" even though I found it listed under \\"Project Greenlight\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Not That Hungry","review":"First of all, the DVD of \\"Feast\\" is very poor. The picture and sound quality are below that of a VHS tape. The picture is seriously grainy and has many VHS style dropouts and the soundtrack in tinny. The whole production was a low budget one anyway and you can hear the director giving directions to the actors on at least two occasions. The acting is also very poor and the main lead is best known for her roles in porn films. The entire movie seems like an attempt by pornographers to do something other than film people having sex. I guess this film is best compared to H.G. Lewis's \\"Blood Feast\\" in overall production and acting value, although, \\"Blood Feast\\" is kind of fun to watch. The gore content is seriously lacking and most of the film is filled with bad acting and lame comedy attempts. It is not even in the so bad its good category.

Unfortunately, the stories of this anthology all fall far short of their potential. It is sad to say that the best of the stories in this volume are all the most humorous ones. The ones that attempt tragedy or drama all fall woefully short, and are, often, painfully cliche.Add this to the ABYSMAL editing (The same word was mispelled no less than three times, in the same way, in three different stories, the font size changes from story to story, and the grammer in some of the tales is terrible.)and the end product is not terribly satisfying.All in all, this book was actually painful to try and finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economical quality","review":"Always reliable.

Highly recommanded, I will definitely but it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, light, and stylish","review":"I bought this watch because I wanted something inexpensive, but still professional looking. I like the lightness of the watch, the thin size, and the simple design. It does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than I would like, but still not very noticeable.If you haven't seen other comments about getting the watch sized, pay attention. I took it to a professional jewelry repair shop, and they still couldn't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches. I would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while. The jeweler I went to has a good reputation, but does not sell Skagen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable, elegant, accurate","review":"I've owned this watch for about two months now, and have very few complaints.Contrary to the information in some of the other reviews that caused me some concern before my purchase, I've actually dinged the crystal a couple of times without any evidence of damage whatsoever. I've knocked the face of the watch on pieces of glass (reaching out the window of my car), a table, and a desk, and you can't tell there was any trauma to the watch.It's a great watch that goes with a wide variety of wardrobe pieces, from suits to casual. And importantly, in two months it has been accurate to within a minute.The minor complaints? The font of the date is a little hard to read, the dark face can make it difficult to read the time in low light, and the knob to adjust the date and time is hard to pull out while wearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch! No un-needed frills.","review":"After 6 years I finally managed to break the crystal on the stainless version of this watch (I usually destroy them after only 1 or 2 years and this one didn't have a scratch.) I couldn't be happier that I decided to stick with Skagen and upgrade to the titanium version. Its understated but elegant appearance is great for everyday or dress wear and it does seem light as a feather compared to similar stainless watches. I would highly recommend it to anyone but especially to those looking to move away from the bulky, over-featured dive watches that seem so popular. Give it a try. It will quickly become your favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is Below Par","review":"This is my third Skagen watch. It's quality is far below the other two which, by the way, were significantly less expensive.The band is a total pain to re-size and has an unfinished, rough-edged feel. Can't return under Amazon's watch policy or I surely would.Stick with a model with a woven or leather band and you'll be far more satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"I was pleased about the weight of the watch and the way it looks.

I wish it had been a better watch -- I wasted $70.It's a very attractive watch. BUT -- the clasp is useless. I had to adjust it several times in order to keep it clamped shut, and now the little holding-tab is so soft that I can move it with my thumbnail.Also, the \\"super hardened mineral crystal\\" (that's what it says on the case) is all scratched up.Skagen has a limited lifetime warranty on its watches -- but it doesn't cover the strap or the crystal.What good is a watch that you can't wear? One star, and that's being generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but loud","review":"An excellent watch in general. Very light and incredibly classy looking. The one flaw is that the second hand is quite loud. Not everyone will experience this as I'm sure it varies between watches, but it's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful watch, some difficulty with adjusting band","review":"Bought this watch as a gift which was well received, but my friend ran into problems when he tried to adjust the band length to fit his wrist. No department store could deal with these types of links and he had to go through a couple jewelry stores before finding one that was able to work with the band. Just a heads up, which we didn't have. Otherwise the watch itself is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this watch.... with a few reservations","review":"First let me say that I love this watch. It is very comfortable, lightweight, elegant, and gets comments all the time. However, there are two significant drawbacks that I've learned to live with because I have yet to find a watch thats as easy to wear.(1) The watch is next to useless at night because the luminescent coating on the hands is non-existent(2) The clasp constantly comes undone... i don't know if this is because I had the band too tight or what.That said, I lost this watch a few weeks ago and after wearing my others and trying on plenty in stores am re-ordering the same one because honestly nothing I've tried under 300 bucks comes close.... which begs the question of why simple designs cost so much. On another note, they make this watch in all black... (model# 105LTMXB) and black with a white face (model# 105ltxmw) both of which look very nice as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cheap Timex watch works better.","review":"I bought this model because it looks great. I paid $100 for it from one of the department stores. From the day I bought it the watch has lost about 10 to 15 minutes a day. I thought it was the battery so I replaced it for $10 but that didn't help. In order to get it repaired I had to send it to them via special delivery which cost me $12 more. I checked my mail today and they sent me a letter asking for $8.95 for the cost of repairs or else I won't get the watch back. I'm trying to figure out why I'm being asked to pay for repairs for a watch that is clearly under warranty. I'll be calling them tomorow to find out. In the meantime.. don't buy a Skagen watch unless you like cheap junk and lousy service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price Jump!!","review":"Wow! I paid $67 for this exact watch on Amazon just a few weeks ago! I was shocked to see that the current price is $112.50. It's a great watch at $67, not quite as good at the higher price - note that CostCo sells them for $69.95. The links are truly a bear to remove. I suspect that the link removal device sold on Amazon may not work due to the particular design of these links. You have to push the linking device out from inside the band rather than from the outside edge of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"The watch appearance is not the same as the photo","review":"The watch color does not correspond exacrly to the web photo.The case and bracelet is in fact graphite color and not steel, as it appears in the photo."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love everything about the watch but why...?","review":"Great watch, extremely light, nice sinister metal color. I'd rate it as more than acceptable for dress wear. My friends are green eyed envious and want one. My only question is why doesn't the secondhand click evenly on the numerals on the watch face?

Keeping in mind the tight budget and limited resources that these filmmakers had, this movie is particulatly well done. The DVD is a masterpiece in itself as it offers 3 fully dubbed versions of the film in 5.1 Dolby Digital sound (Russian 5.1, English 5.1, French 5.1). It even offers the menus in these 3 languages. In addition, the subtitles are privided in 11 languages (including German, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, etc.) The dubbing for the film is done really well, which often makes one forget that this is a foreign film.

It worked, but only because the book sent me to sleep. Bad for three reasons. Firstly, it's ridiculously overwritten, with massive tangled descriptive passages that give no sense of place and induce headaches in the reader. Secondly, none of the characters were at all interesting, and I couldn't give a damn about what happened to any of them. Thirdly, Norfolk keeps showing off his historical knowledge, rather than weaving it smoothly into the text like, for instance, Barry Unsworth.

Very true. But if you have a hankering for a book outside of the normal formulaic mainstream, this is definitely worth a try. The plot is atypical, wide ranging and will make you think; but the language is often intoxicating once you have the measure of it - like Wilde it has rhythym and flow and can be wonderful read aloud.

The writing is unpleasant, pompous, and inflated, making it almost embarrassing to read. I finished chapter one but could stomach no more. I do recommend a modest alternative though: Silvio Bedini's The Pope's Elephant, which relates a wealth of facts and a few enjoyable anecdotes about Hanno the elephant. It includes a chapter about a rhinocerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Monteverdi ?","review":"This title is one I purchased because I thought that any version of a Monteverdi opera would be worth having. I was mistaken and I think that the scoring and playing is probably the main flaw though the vocal performances are also flawed. You may not be a renaissance buff, but I think that almost anyone will agree that the apparently continuous use of winds, especially brass, and percussion along with wide vibrato and sloppy singing in the voices does not do Monteverdi justice. The story is, of course, the return of Ulysses to his home on Ithaca as told in the Odyssey. I found little to recommend this production except as the only available video of this opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of favorites","review":"This was an enlightening look at some classic poems that I was already familiar with, and a number of new ones.

This particular entry makes very poor use of the \\"technology\\" of peek a board. I would consider a \\"good\\" use one that has a dog or cat peeking through the die-cut holes in the pages. None of the holes in this book have anything peeking through. The cleverness here, if you can call it that, is that the colors match up through the hole. I guess they're trying to hide the fact that the holes exist.The whole point of these books is to \\"peek-a-boo\\" through the holes, and there's nothing to peek a boo in this book. As well, the colors are muted and the text is weak. I recommend you avoid this peek-a-board book if your child likes to peek-a-boo things thru the holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover","review":"This cover doesn't fit our double jogging stroller perfectly, but it does the job.

I still had not found anything that made this book worth all the hype. Lots of childish material and misery-loves-company stories fill this book. Augusten definitely finds comfort in his role as a victim of society, molestation, family dysfunction, and just about every other form of abuse and/or disordered relationships you can imagine. I found the book only mildly interesting for the craziness of his upbringing, but the rest was very slow going. Not a memorable memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running with Scissors","review":"My disappointment by page 163 was complete. Into the trash.

The book was anything but funny. I read about half, up tothe point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore.I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me. The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but Ihad to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it. I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will someone please point out a single funny sentence?","review":"Not only did I not laugh, I didn't find anything in this book even remotely amusing. And, after re-reading the reviewers on the back cover (GQ, Entertainment Weekly, San Francisco Chronicle, Boston Herald, etc), I should have known to take what has been touted about this book with a grain of salt. I guarantee that much of this book was,if not completely fabricated, greatly exaggerated. The author is habitually smoking marijuana throughout the book, making his memories suspect at best. If your IQ is average or above, you will not enjoy this \\"memoir\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I found this story to be over the top and extremely hard to get through. I wanted to put it down multiple times but have trouble not finishing a book. The book has little plot from beginning to end. Each chapter builds on insanity and often hard to beleive 'facts' (a MD parading down the street with balloons tied all over him?) I would not waste your money on this memoir. It has no plot or lessons learned. Augusten I don't doubt your childhood was strange, but take this book to a therapist and spare us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped it in the trash","review":"As another reviewer commented:\\"I have only read a couple of books that I didn't want to give to charity because I pitied the poor soul who'd pick it up and read it, this was one.\\"It was painful book. I brought it to the gym this morning to give it one more try. One more chapter. I got off the treadmill and dropped it in the trash.It wasn't very funny (to me). It's hard to shed humor on such disturbing scenes. It was indeed written with colorful imagery but the humor was out of place. The story was going nowhere. I enjoy humorous books/movies but this was just awkward (and I consider myself hard to offend). After reading a few of the negative reviews, I'm so happy I didn't waste the time to finish the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just how much worse can someone's life get?","review":"I read this book with a sense of horror and amazement--horror that someone's life could be that terrible and topsey-turvey, and amazement that he could not only survive it, but come away so articulate and matter-of-fact about it all. I felt a lot of guilt, too, because I could relate to the craziness of his mother, and I fear, could I be marking my children the way Augusten's mother marked him? Still, there is hope admist all the chaos and clutter, in that the author comes away seeming somewhat normal. The ending is a little bit abrupt, but then, life does sometimes come out that way, and this book is about real life, however warped it may be. Read this book, but only with a strong stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from this book...or take your scissors to it.","review":"The reviews on the cover of this book were wildly misleading; I found no pleasure or humor in reading this tragic and twisted memoir. I actually felt sickened and violated after being exposed to the author's graphic depiction of his first and abusive sexual experience. I actually wish the toxic memory of this book could be erased from my mind. As a result, I will NOT donate this book to Goodwill to pollute anyone else's mind...it will go straight to the TRASH where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifying and Extremely Entertaining","review":"The best summation I can give for my impression of this book is that I alternated between these two thoughts: 'This is too crazy to be true.' and 'This has to be true because nobody could make this up.'

I'm looking forward to Dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people think this is funny?","review":"I read this book thinking it would be a funny look at a crazy life, since that was what every review I read had to say about it. I found the book neither funny, nor entertaining. First off, the book was very hard to believe, could anything be this crazy? It seemed like it was embellished quite a bit. It is quite possibly not, but that brings me to the next problem, the writing style. Burroughs only has an elementary school education, and it shows.I read this book for a book club, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it, it just wasn't compeling enough to hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I bought this book for my husband for Christmas because the reviews were so good.

It was more of a list of crazy things that supposedly happened. The poop scuptures? Come on. I kept waiting to find out who Augusten is & never did. I can't understand how so many people liked this book. I feel it was a waste of time. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Book","review":"There are only two words that describe this literary work: \\"Empty Book\\". The book is empty of thought and after reading it, yoo will know you have been had. There are no thought provoking ideas in this book, just graphic narrative. There is no redemption only but stories that are not believable. As to why this book is even considered a read, is beyond what a normal thoughtful person considers reading material. Augusten Burroughs poor writing style and storying telling is evident. Don't bother reading this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.... but the movie could be good","review":"Halfway through. Want to put it down, but it's like a car wreck. You don't want to look, but you have to.The book could have been funny, but it was a little too disturbing. Disturbing is ok, I don't want to be a moralist, but it was NOT what I wanted when I bought the book. Many people choose books based on their mood at the time of purchase. This was DEFINITELY NOT what I was seeking when I bought this book.I would probably go see the movie. I looked at the Preview and you can already tell that it is wildly different than the book. Generally this is a bad thing, but NOT in this case.Because the things that make the book disturbing WON'T BE ALLOWED in the movie (a six year old boy giggling while a dog licks his genitalia - don't think that scene will make the cut!), it might be good. It will probably actually be funny in a \\"Meet the Parents\\" kind of way, more like the book I THOUGHT I was purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad memoir","review":"As a therapist who works with children and adolescents, I couldn't help feeling sad for Augusten Burroughs's adolescent experiences. I didn't find the book funny or entertaining. I think the adults in his life failed him and exploited him. This book is just another depressing tale of a dysfunctional family life experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent and cruel","review":"It must be very hard to grow up with a mentally ill parent but I'd like to think that if my mother was so psychotic she was eating candles and cigarette sandwiches, I might actually be grateful, down the road, to know that , while teetering on the edge of sanity, she tried to find a safe place for me before she completely lost touch with reality. I can understand that Burroughs may not be able to forgive his mother for all the trauma she put him through but to actually write a book detailing the things she did while she was in the midst of a severe illness seems like a bit of an invasion of her privacy to me if not down-right cruel.This was a dreary and poorly written book; chock full of humor of the \\"eew gross\\" variety, obvious attempts to shock and far too many uses of the word \\"polyester.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragicomic, minus the comic","review":"I love the work of David Sedaris and similar 'tragicomic' authors and memoirists. We can find in their brave ability to laugh at the horror of what they've endured, some hopeful statement about the absurd nature of the human condition.I read this book in one sitting and, having done so, I didn't feel a bit like \\"wow that's some zany stuff\\" rather i felt very sad. Forced attentions from a man double his age, dropping out of school, tons of cigarettes, examination of feces -- it was simply too believable, too real, too harsh.So, in this, I say this is a tragic book told with a survival-required sense of detachment, it's not detached because it's funny, it's detached because the world is so cruel.That said, for other survivors of abuse this may be a great read to find a kindred spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too absurd to be true?","review":"The author's story is amazing and also depressing-if true. I have to question whether all the events happened exactly as stated, because some of them seem just too convenient. All in all, a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can this book be getting 5 star ratings?","review":"I read this on a plane, and have rarely felt so dissapointed in a book.I have only read a couple of books that I didn't want to give to charity because I pitied the poor soul who'd pick it up and read it, this was one.I have heard the author compared to David Sedaris, which I think is completely innacurate and a blow to David Sedaris. I REALLY like Sedaris, I did not like this at all. It was listed as comic, I think I cracked a smile once during my read. I don't mind sexual content, I did think this went over the top in explicitness but I've read worse and not found it quite so unpalatable. For me what made this book memorable is how unpleasant it was... I cannot think of one person I know who would like it.. I'm really surprised that so many people have liked it.I'm not surprised that they made a movie of it, but that's another story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judyblue","review":"I bought this book because of various reviews that described it as hilarious. I expected a somewhat tragic story, but one written with wit and humor. Instead I found the book to be sickening and disturbing, but not even vaguely funny or amusing. I have never been able to watch the Jerry Springer Show for more than a few minutes before I change channels. If the Springer Show was put into book form, this is it. I had a hard time finishing the book. The author attempts to make child molestation and abuse entertaining. It just doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jerry Springer of literature","review":"This book is to literature what Jerry Springer is to meaningful social commentary. It's poorly written, pointless, vapid, and gratuitous. Defiantly the worst book I have read in a long time. I was sucked in by the hype. Sure, some will say that I just don't \\"get it,\\" but there are a lot of people out there too dense to see that just because something is bizarre doesn't mean that its profound. This is drivel.The events described are too bizarre to be believable and, even if they are true, they're not interesting. I suspect that this is a \\"memoir\\" in the same sense as \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" i.e., a fraud. I recently read an interesting article about how the family in this book is suing the author for defamation. Burroughs is clearly milking the dysfunctional bandwagon for all it's worth.If this is what passes for \\"genius\\" these days (as one reviewer described Burroughs), then our civilization needs to be destroyed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"One of the best books I ever read, it made me feel like my crazy family was almost normal up against Mr. Burroughs' life and family. He made me laugh, gasp, and I never wanted to put the book down. I highly reccomend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A read you should put down, but can't.","review":"Against better judgment, I kept reading after it became more disturbing with the relations a young Augusten had with a much older and mature Bookman. The humor enlightens a very deep and depressing life that he went through and this story chronicles his life throughout the early teen years. Being pushed off from his mother onto the crazy Finch family, it just keeps getting more unbelievable. From the sexual promiscuity to the love of McNuggets and yard sales turned to living quarters, you can't get more bizarre than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read and I can't wait to read the sequels!!!

This book accompanied me on a recent vacation to Cuba, and called me back to my hotel room each afternoon to pick back up where I started off. I devoured it in a couple of afternoons. What a wonderful truthful writer Burroughs is! It is reminiscent of Gerald Durrell's laugh a minute, \\"My Family and Other Animals\\". You never quite feel that you are laughing at them, but more with them. With all the love in the world. Thank you for a wonderful lighthearded, clever, laugh-out-loud, read, Mr Burroughs.

Seemed that this is where the book branched off from really good to really yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Hard Childhood","review":"One of my clients was Augustan Burroughs' employer when he was writing Running With Scissors. On his recommendation I picked up the book and I'm glad I did. Burroughs really lived a rough childhood, whether there were exaggerations or not . . . his mother was mentally ill, he was unwanted, unloved, and found solace in the arms of a pedophile. That's just the beginning.Smoking, drinking, drugs, and the life of a wild stoner dropout. While some of that was choice, he's a lucky man to have survived all that with baggage. This is a road map to dysfunction and everyone who has to deal with maladjusted juveniles should read it, should understand what can be endured and what children can be subjected to.I tell people this is a hard, hard read. NOt because it's not good, but because it is really well-written and it's like a crash in slow motion, you know it's going to get worse and yet you have to know. Page by page you have to know.- CV Rick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Believe...","review":"I picked up this book as the next selection my book club had decided upon. I had never heard of it before and did not know what I was getting myself into. I can safely say that it kind of let me down. It was a quick read, but the events and situations the author found himself in were sometimes just too over-the-top to believe. The family he comes to live with just seemed too off the wall to imagine that they actually existed. To me, deciding to cut a hole in the roof for a skylight on a whim is not something my father would have condoned, like the father in the book did.Overall, the book kind of let me down. I don't think it turned out to be my kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I have never before written a book review, but felt the need to express my contempt for this horror story. Augusten's story is one which should have been dealt with in the comfort of a therapist's office, not a book. If indeed Running with Scissors is a memoir, how has Augusten managed to live a functional life (assuming that he has)? I have never read such a dark, graphically sexual book in my life. I did not find a bit of his story touching, affectionate or humorous, just sad and pathetic and not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult for me to believe.","review":"I am generally skeptical when reading \\"memoirs,\\" so take this review with a grain of salt, althought I must admit, I love the genre.Running... brought me back to A Million Little Pieces with regard to the overall story being believable. Without giving away the content, I simply don't believe Augusten Burroughs account of his life. Do I have proof, NO. He comes across sensationalizing everything, and to me it was not an honest account of his life. Was there dysfunction in his home, defenitly, but I can't say that I know anybody who had a perfectly functional upbringing.It is also quite coincidental that I just read how the publisher is including a blurb in each book going forward, a disclamer of possible embellishment in all of Burroughs books.Bottom line: Augusten should change his last name to Frey.I am still awating a memoir where an author proves facts of their life, so I can finally classify it a true memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really let down...","review":"I laughed out loud several times while reading the first half of this book, however...

I was put over the top my the author's description of his first (homo)sexual relationship, at 13 with a 30 year old pervert. That was something that I had no need to ever read or learn about. Perhaps others will find this to be interesting reading but I would rather have spent my time doing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-rated gay train wreck","review":"First off, don't misconstrue this as a homophobic rant. I was not prepared for the rather explicit gay sexual content in this book (especially when it starts off a chapter in graphic detail).

Not enough to make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unsettling","review":"I felt truly sick after finishing this book. How could someone be even partially sane after living as Augusten did during his childhood and adolescence? Do people as emotionally bereft and unbalanced as the characters in this book really exist? Surely somone other than the waitress at the diner had the good sense and compassion to intercede in the insanity? Wouldn't the neighbors in the psychiatrist's neighborhood have registered numerous complaints with the authorities? My heart is unbelievably heavy at the thought that anyone, especially a child, has lived or lives like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curiously unaffecting","review":"The world of literature is rife with outrageous and funny coming-of-age stories (Winterson's \\"Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit\\" comes immediately to mind, as do David Sedaris' biographic essays), and though this qualifies on both counts, it's curiously unaffecting. Neither as funny as it could be, nor as moving, the book is authored by a merely so-so, not great, writer who seems to keep his emotions--and us--at arm's length. Could have been both wrenchingly poignant and hysterically funny, and it's neither. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny!","review":"If this is truly not another Frey problem with veracity I cannot believe that anyone would find this book even slightly funny, not to mention outright hilarious. I am not offended by the mental illness presented, or by the gay relationships, or even the doctor who apparently had multiple \\"wives.\\" What I was offended by was the idea that the situations presented in the book were a source of entertainment. This was much more tragic than comic. I am shocked by the fact that these situations went on for so long and that the general response is to laugh in reaction instead of cry. If it was one of your own children growing up where roaches infested the home, people defecated on the floor, and no one seemed to eat anything with much nutritional value wouldn't you cry and turn to authorities? Why are we looking at this as something funny?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book is kind of sick. If you like to laugh at child molestation and pedophelia, I guess it's for you.

The composition is passable, the narrator is likeable, psychiatry is dismantled, tacky consumerism gets a checkered flag, and lurid secret-telling is never dull, although ultimately Running With Scissors can't surpass cheap daytime TV, and it will leave you with the same sort of banal sickness in your stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped","review":"Very disappointed with this book, expecially after all they hype I've heard. Nothing but a compilation of events, with a few strings holding the entire story together. There is absolutely no imagery or wit in this book to emotionally magnify or detract from the squalor in which virtually every awful character lives. The author's attempt at wry humor, shock, and sarcasm don't convince me for a minute that this book is clever. Don't waste precious summer time on this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and NOT funny","review":"Not only was this book not funny, I found it truly disturbing and could not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The \\"bowel movement\\" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running With Scissors","review":"I didn't like it - I consider the time reading it-- WASTED! Even the compost heap rejected it. Yuk!I thought I could read, and learn from, almost any kind of writing. There is nothing new here, there is nothing good here.And I believe there is not much truth here. My money won't be paying any more of Mr. Burroughs' bills! Thanks for the oppor-tunity to spout off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He went from one Psycho Family to Another","review":"In every chapter, almost every page, I kept thinking 'You're kidding, right?\\"I found this book to be entertaining, and I could not put it down. I couldn't help but wonder if it was true. I strongly suspect that most of it was.I'm not sure whether Augusten is a gifted writer of if his crazy childhood simply gave him some great materialI love reading non-fiction books, because they are often stranger than fiction can ever be. This is certainly the case with poor Augusten's bookIt appears that Augusten went from one totally messed up family to another.I wonder what his life would have been like had his mom went to a psychiatrist who was focused more on helping her than in getting into her pants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifying Humor","review":"Running With Scissors is a memoir of Augusten Burroighs' snarled childhood, although some of the events described in the book are so over the top that they must surly be the inventions of a twisted mind. But no; the story is said to be factual.Bourroughs grows up gay in a degenerate family -- a lesbian mother and a drunken father. He is sent to live with a perverted psychiatrist and his dysfunctional family in a home that always has dirty dishes in the sink.The saving grace of this memoir is the writing. Burroughs knows how to lead the reader from one ridiculous situation to the next with unexpected twists and turns told with horrifying humor.Among the memoir books, Running with Scissors gets a well earned 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"how is this book a bestseller?","review":"I started reading the book and found the character unlikeable. Soon after, I found it boring. When things really started getting crazy for him, it was so disfunctional that you feel bad for the main character. I kept reading, hoping that the end would make the book worth it. It didn't. Also, there is no humor in this book. Some very graphic disturbing sex scenes weren't pleasant to read either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I have only read rave reviews about this book. I fancy myself to be an open minded person, and have read my share of bad childhood books. Its not the content of this book that was bad, because a child is never responsible for the decisions that are forced upon him, but I found the authors callous treatment of serious issues to be a drain. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book I enjoyed","review":"I didn't particularly care about or like the characters. The author didn't make himself very likable - maybe that was on purpose. I had trouble connecting with him or any other character because I didn't care about them.I also didn't enjoy reading graphic descriptions of his sexual experiences. That would have been true even if he wasn't gay - the sequences seemed gratuitous and just made me feel even more disconnected from the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Full disclosure, i put it down 1/3 of the way through. It's not a bad book per se, it's like a much less funny David Sedaris novel - and frankly one of those is great, any more is over doing it. Weird, wacky childhood novels are a bit of a dime a dozen.If you haven't read David Sedaris, do that first. If you feel the need to continue then maybe this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entertaining or funny","review":"This book, although advertised as funny and entertaining, was not. The sex depicted was appalling and gratuitous and the story elicited more pity than amusement. I regret reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate that book","review":"that book is the worst book everthe first 75 pages were good then he goes off having sex with a 33 year old guythenn he describes in GREAT detail how it happended anddd in GREAT detail he describes seeing his mom having sex with a ministers wifei stopped reading the book rite after he wrote about the second sex he had with the old boyfriend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Disturbing","review":"I was utterly disappointed after reading this book There was so much hype about it that I had expected something more profound. Instead, it's basically a book about sexual child abuse in very graphic terms.In my opinion, there were no redeeming features at all: it was not funny and the writing was mediocre, as is usually the case with so-called memoirs.I found it disturbing that there seems to be a public hunger for books that are real-life experiences consisting of sadistic and cruel events. This kind of writing belongs in text/study books.The art of the novelist is certainly changing, perhaps even dying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The horror overcame any humor","review":"Our book club decided to read this and relied on the back jacket reviews of a humourous coming of age story- even the movie was portrayed as an outrageous comedy. I (and the group) agreed that we got stuck on the difficult growing up situation, the utter lack of any responsible adults in the story , the graphic nature of the descriptive writing (which is excellent) and the pedophilia - not the homosexuality. I reveled at Augusten's ability to overcome the tragic situation but didn't even chuckle once. This was a hard read becasue it was true- this actually happened. We didn't see the humor in it. I cannot recommend this to the average reader and defintely not to the faint of heart. Burroughs is a very rare individual who overcame the worst of circumstance, was essentially self taught, and went on to turn the dross into gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read more interesting billboards.","review":"I am neither a prude, nor a profligate, but I was disappointed after I received and read this book. Nor, am I a homophobe, in fact I sing in a Gay Men's and Women's Chorus, because they needed my voice and I enjoy their friendship. However, I was not impressed with the graphic description of oral and anal sex between the main character and another male, quite a bit his elder. In many places, this would be considered Statuatory Rape. As a Lesbian friend said, when discussing BrokeBack Mountain, \\"Graphic scenes like these give us a bad name.\\"Anyway, for what ever reason, I feel previous reviews have overrated this book by a great amount. I didn't find any part of it humorous or even enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Story? I don't think so..embellished and sick in parts","review":"When I started the book I was thinking it was funny and twisted in an unusual and humorous way. But then comes the child pornography. It's not where someone just talks about being molested and moves on. The author graphically describes how the boy enjoys anal sex and getting blown by a backyard pedophile...from the lubrication, to the sounds to the enjoyment...pages of it...almost glorifying it. It read like porn between two consenting adults and made me sick to read it. Because you were reading porn like material and realizing it's a boy being molested (even though he enjoyed it, he's still a boy) and it's sick with the graphic nature of it.Also, you can tell the things being said and done were not something a kid that age would come up with thinking. So when you are reading it, you are thinking yeah right, this is a \\"true\\" story. Thats when I put the book down and decided to stop wasting my time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"crud","review":"Well, join my voice to the chorus of those who feel this was a pile of self-indulgent crud.I found it extremely hard to get a groove going with this book: I found the setting and the descriptions hard to visualize. Perhaps that's not the author's fault: perhaps his upbringing was so kooky that it's just hard to make it come alive to people who weren't there. Fine, but isn't that the author's job.I don't believe the author has any insight into others or himself. At least not enough to write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY wanted this book to be good.","review":"Okay so you have read enough of the reviews to get the idea of this book...if not DO so...they are right here, easy to find. Rather than rehash that...a waste of electrons....let me just suggest that I really wanted this book to be good. It sounded like a wildly entertaining danse mababre. It was funny at times, sometimes outrageous. But it the end it was a hollow experience.I found it to have a pervasive sense of hollowness. It was as though the author was willing to shed light on his experiences but could not explore the shadows that light creates. I understand that it was a work of humor but what happens when the humor is just not that funny and you are left with the pathos?Laugh out loud funny.....nah....but I did smile a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I gave it a solid 50 pages before putting it down. AB just goes on and on about his outrageous teen years and probably embellished events without discernable humor. This is another one that makes me ask how did it ever end up on the best-seller's list. I suppose its popularity is due to its being compared to Sedaris but it is not near as good. Though I'm not a huge fan of Sedaris either at least there are occasional points of humor that are completely lacking with Burroughs who just plays up his disfunctional family and sickening events of his childhood..yada..yada..yawn. Sick/crazy/unique childhood doesn't alone doesn't make entertaining writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all funny to me.","review":"I thought this was going to be a funny/sad/ecentric story. To me, there was not much funny about it. It was disturbing to me that he was raised in this situation and everyone seemed to just accept the doctor and the household."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"If this is a memoir, it has to be embellished. Not all memories are real or accurate. I just don't buy it.This book palled in comparison to other memoirs, such as the Glass Castle and David Sedaris books. The writing was OK. If not for the pure insanity of the content, I'm not sure the book would have made it on its own merit.It got tons of rave reviews, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. Everybody said the book was funny. It's not. Not even in a dark twisted way. Not even in a clever way. Wacky and unbelievable characters and situations don't make a book funny.Finally, I'm probably one of the least homophobic people in the world, but caveat emptor if you have a problem with graphic and overly-descriptive man on man love. I just don't like reading too many details about sex period. It is a lazy and unimaginative writer who needs to describe sexual details so graphically where they add nothing to the story.This book was highly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would that there was a lower rating than 1","review":"This is an utter cow pie of a book. It is dreary badly written, badly edited (if it was edited at all). A tedious whinging that goes nowhere and tells the reader nothing. I didn't throw it out because it would taint my garbage, so its now back at the publishers. 200 some odd people trying to offload used and new copies of this book? Not really surprising, they don't want in their garbage either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Unfortunate for this author","review":"Maybe writing this book was therapeutic for the author, however it is very disturbing to me that it is considered entertainment for the rest of us. Although the antics of the people surrounding this unfortunate child sound as if they are right out of Hollywood, they are not funny. I feel pity for Augusten and disgust for his parental figures as they disregarded their greatest gift in order fulfill their own desires and self-destructive behavior. I guess it is fitting of Hollywood to continue to exploit this man's horrific childhood by making it a movie and calling it entertainment. I will be skipping this DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book while spending some time in the airport during a lay-over. The copious, enthusiastic reviews convinced me that this would be an enjoyable read.While the story was interesting, albeit disturbing, I failed to find any \\"laugh-out loud\\" passages or anything which merited more than a smirk. The entire book simply failed to live up to the hype - now I see its being made into a \\"major motion picture\\" with Gwyneth Paltrow - what role could she possibly play?"},{"rating":"1","title":"like the title & that's about it","review":"Well, the good news is that there is one movie I can cross off my list of potential DVDs to rent. This book is awful. I checked it out after reading that the author's style was similar to that of David Sedaris. Ummm.......NOT! It's just not funny at all & on top of that, it appears to be a bunch of hogwash as (according to recent press reports) the family of the pyschiatrist has successfully sued Sony over the movie & a lawsuit against the author & the publisher is still pending. That isn't surprising because it seemed like a lot of the story was 'embellished' for effect. Like putting lipstick on a pig, if you ask me. Even as a work of fiction, it wouldn't work (for me) because there wasn't a single character in the book that I liked or cared about & that included the author himself. My advice would be to spend your hard earned money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks","review":"Total waste of 4 hours of my life. I kind of have to believe that anybody who enjoys this book probably doesn't read very many GOOD books. Or, perhaps, they just don't usually READ. ;(It was an easy read.. Around page 130something I finally felt a little bit interested. A lot of it is kind of depressing and I laughed maybe 3 or 4 times out loud when someone said something kind of funny. I don't see anything really funny about his life or what went on. There are just so many awesome books out there that are more deserving of your time.. Right now I am reading 'Kite Runner' and I just started reading it but it's already much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running with Scissors","review":"In a word, disturbing. I just couldn't find the humor in this one, nor could I get more than half way through the book. I was just too sad. As a teacher I just felt for the author and as a parent I did not understand how a mother or father could be so misguided in raising their child. The author knows his craft, but I just did not enjoy the book as well as I hoped to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a comedy, just a sad tale","review":"Augusten is a great writer, but this is an awful tale of child neglect and abuse. It is amazing he survived to be a successful author. The comparisons to David Sedaris are way off, the only thing they have in common is both being gay. While I was reading the book, I couldn't help but think of James Frey and \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" and wondered how much of this story was really true, and what was embellished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizzare, but Entertaining!","review":"When I picked this book up I never realized how intense it was going to get. It is still hard for me to believe that this book really happened!Augusten's life was both tragic and entertaining. throughout the book I was so bothered by both his mother and the \\"shrink\\"---bot were such abusive relationships for him, but he still held it together. Amazing!I am still curious to know what happened to his \\"boyfriend\\"--did he ever reconnect with him? WOuld he want to after the way he was treated?I recommend this to anyone who likes tragic true stories, like A Child Called It. It has the same kind of feel to it. It definitely contains profanity and graphic sexual content. NOT FOR EVERYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"Amazon usually provides me with great reads and reviews; either I read the reviews wrong or other readers are amazingly simple; this book jumps from one psychopathic locale to another more disgustingly and sick one. I know this is supposed to be a true story but I have a hard time believing any of it to tell you the truth. The sick descriptions of sexual routines between characters are enough to make one vomit; I only read about forty percent of this book, then deleted it from my Kindle. If this guy is an author, look out, classic authors! There is no plot, no clear setting, no clear theme, no clear anything in this twisted book. Actually, I am not sure that even one star should be on this book; should be zero. Basically, I love Amazon and buy all of my ebooks there because of the great service I receive, but, if you are considering buying this book, know that it is not a PG rating-more like R."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't funny. It isn't interesting. I don't buy it.","review":"I kind of felt like all he did was combine the most disturbing things he could think of into as few pages as possible for the shock factor rather than tell a story, and the effect was, of course, that nothing was all that appalling. It also was kind of sucky that he spent so little time actually getting into his own head--something I quite enjoy about memoirs--everything just seemed to be about adding this shock factor and this shock factor until nothing really mattered at all. It wasn't funny either. There wasn't a single moment I cracked even a smile at anything that was \\"supposedly\\" funny. Augusten Burroughs seems like he'd be a really boring person to hang out with.That being said, the book was readable and I got through it in merely two days. It wasn't terrible. It was pretty weird. But for me, it wasn't all that interesting. Thankfully I didn't buy it and just got it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for me.","review":"They say \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" I've also learned not to judge a book by its title. It's probably my fault that I didn't do a bit more research into what this book was about before I purchased it, but the title caught my eye and I tend to be an impulsive buyer when it comes to books. Unfortunately, I also feel compelled to finish what I start and so struggled through this book to its completion. I'm normally a thriller, mystery, horror kind of guy, but enjoy a good comedy when I can find one. I would not classify this book as a comedy. Some others have obviously enjoyed this story, but I found it disturbing and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"um....isn't this abuse??","review":"As I sat reading this book, I was seriously sickened by what Augusten went through (if in fact true) and the lack of a response from the system regarding what can only be described as utter abuse and neglect. Whomever that psychiatrist is, well, he clearly shouldn't be in the field given his own mental instability and poor judgement.As a therapist (social worker) whose clinical work has focused on and specialized in treating trauma and sexual abuse, I just can't see this book as funny. It's nearly nauseating, thinking about what the family went through. That Augusten came out alive is a testament to his strength, but to see this book in a comedic light is just impossible for me to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. I read reviews about how hysterically funny it was....it was not. I did not laugh once while reading; rather, I recoiled in horror throughout most of the book. I did not find humor in the homosexual rape of a 13 year old boy, or in the psychiatrist's assistance in faking the suicide of that same 13 year old boy. Twisted, disgusting, inane, lewd...all words to describe this incredibly overrated memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully obvious...","review":"...that Burroughs only has an elementary school education. Superficially written, no challenging ideas, emotions, or vocabulary. His childhood wasn't eccentric, it was criminal. A collection of shockingly sad short stories portrayed as grotesque humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable and fascinating","review":"Feels like the most over-blown, ridiculous piece of fiction one could read. And yet it is supposedly based on truths of two truly messed up families. The story is told well and the details are whimsical, comical, and creatively spun. And still, it is heartbreaking and even stressful to read at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"As increadible as it might sound, this book's the athor's real story. You're sorry for not being part of the novel to participate even more to its madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book","review":"ok, the bad ratings are a little ridiculous for this book so i had to comment.READ THE DESCRIPTION ONLINE BEFORE GETTING THE BOOK!It's not a book for children and if you read the description- it's obviously a pretty messed up, way dark humor book and that would be so clear if you just read the description!really good book. easy read read it in two nights because i couldnt quit turning the pages. its so messed up its hilarious. touching and heartbreaking in some parts. its a really good read.also, i saw the movie the day after i finished the book...didn't like the movie as much! def. read the book first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY BETTER THAN THE MOVIE","review":"This book is hilarious! Witty! Charming! Somewhat Disturbing -- but taught me that I'm not the only person with a disfunctional childhood. I feel like Augusten Burroughs could easily be a long-lost sibling or cousin. His writing is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!","review":"Reading this book is like walking through a nasty, smelly dump. Yes, dumps are a part of life, but I'd rather not spend time there. It's sad that this is a true story, with emphasis on the anger and bizarre behavior. Spend your time reading something else that isn't as depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I finished it...","review":"A (very) exaggerated memoir in which I have a hard time believing anything in the plot had to do with someone's reality at any point. As with other reviews, I agree the sex scenes were a bit much. Although I am usually a pretty forgiving and understanding reader, thinking \\"Well it must be significant to the plot\\". Not so much. We get it, you're homosexual Augusten. That's fine, good for you. I would have been just as offended had it been a heterosexual person writing about their sexual conquests in such a manner. I honestly had a hard time finishing it, I was so disgusted. The rest of the book made sense and fit, but the sex descriptions had no bearing on the plot and were just in there to make it \\"edgy\\", I guess. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"This book was awful, I appreciate a book about \\"nutty\\" families, but this was over the top. My family looks like the Cleavers compared to these freaks. This book is downright depressing, and ridiculous, they are so insane, it's unbelievable I love to read all different kinds of books, but I can't think of one good thing to say about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I wish my friends who read this book had told me not to waste my time; I guess I should have interpreted their lackluster endorsements as attestations to the book's mediocrity.There are no sympathetic characters. The book is too fantastical to be a memoir. The depiction of mental illness is shallow and contrived. The writing style is amateurish. I'd give zero stars if an option.i.e. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, couldn't read it all the way through!","review":"Read through first 75 pages or so then last chapter. Had to put the book down 3 times because it was so disturbing. Threw the book away.

It was a sad and pathetic story. And as such, I had no pity for the characters. I thought it was well written and I could picture the characters and the scenes, but didn't really care.

It is written in a way that makes the reader want to keep reading, however, nothing good ever comes of it all. I felt like I needed a mind cleansing after reading it. I read a lot of books about difficult topics, so I am not squeamish, but this book had no point.Also, I always question \\"memoirs\\" that use a lot of direct quotes (which Burroughs does). Was he carrying around a tape recorder all of his childhood? Or meticulously keeping a diary with exact words that people had said? It made me very dubious of the content of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"fabrications of an unimaginative mind","review":"This book is nonsense. As fiction it does not entertain. As a memoir it is not credible. It has no educational or amusement value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing.","review":"I found this book very disturbing. The pedophilic relationship and the graphic description of the sex acts was especially nauseating. I am a mother of two young boys and this made me angry and sad. I read the whole book although I almost threw it in the trash after the sex chapter. I think the book was interesting, shocking, and amazing that the author is a functioning adult. However, I wouldn't recommend the book due to the graphic content (and I am no prude). I DID NOT find the book funny as the reviews stated. I found myself disgusted with the characters, especially the adults, who really allowed and encouraged this sick lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I finally read this book after receiving several recommendations from friends. All I can say is that I now question their taste in books, and I'm somewhat ashamed that I believed the hype. Like another commenter, I kept waiting for the good part but found that it never came. Sure, Burroughs had a messed up and extremely odd childhood. However, the sequence of shock and awe, boring filler, shock and awe, boring filler, etc. is not enough to hold this book together. Apparently, a bad childhood does not a great writer make. Don't waste your time on this immature, repetitive, and underdeveloped work. The writing is so poor that you'll think Burroughs wrote it during his teenage high school dropout years."},{"rating":"1","title":"about the worst book I have read during 2008, NO, I did not even finish it.","review":"I tried to read it, I gave it a good shot but.... it's total trash.nothing funny about it, plain trash.I wish I could get my money back.I just threw the book in the ......

I would not recommend it to my fundamentalist Christian friends or homophobic friends. But anyone else should appreciate the dark humor. The author somehow manages to reflect lightheartedly on what would otherwise be considered a tragic childhood by today's politically correct, over-reactive, society. Yes, what happened to this guy was awful, but his ability to look back on it and make us laugh is wonderful. I was captivated the whole time, never really wanting to put this book down. I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Burroughs really knows how to tell a story, and since it's based on truth, I really appreciated the epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Ho hum and so whatI really really can't remember when I was so bored.Like a rip off of Sedaris...without the humor.Why don't they let you give no stars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This book is great.

Absolutely horrifying and disgusting accounts of the author's childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"either a hit or miss, depending on the reader","review":"I was sure this would be a hit for me. I love disturbing comedy, memoirs, and at the point where nothing is shocking. I wanted to like this book, but it not funny, not believable, and sometimes just gross.There's nothing wrong with being gay, but the graphic descriptions of the affair between a 13 year old boy and his 36 year old boyfriend provided by Burroughs belong in a Nambla Forum.I stopped reading this 1/3rd of the way through. Had it been funny or believable I would have skipped the smut. Big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and disturbing","review":"I thought this book would be funny. I bought it in a collectibles store for $3. Now I know why it was there. It's rude, crude and disturbing. I made it halfway through the book and threw it in the trash. Don't waste your money. There are much better books out there that don't make you feel like you should take a shower after putting the book down. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, sorry piece of \\"literature\\"","review":"Please do not waste your time on this book. It is not funny at all, author uses techniques of \\"shock value\\" in this book which instead of being funny turns out to be totally disgusting and felt really sorry for each of crewed up character in the book. I could not finish the book; I felt dirty and wanted to take shower after reading half of it. I am not overly sensitive person, but this book over the top. Because there is not a drop of intelligence, author uses \\"shock value\\" to draw the attention to the book. There is no substance at all. This book is about degradation of characters and not sure how anyone can find it funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written well... with distasteful content","review":"I personally did not enjoy this book. In fact, i found the content to have some what traumatized me. Seriously, I do wish i hadn't exposed myself to such vile, disturbing details in which he describes his \\"Sex life.\\" Purely disgusting and unimportant. Nevertheless i read on, hoping to find an ending worthwhile, only find the book ending abruptly without satisfying me. I almost thought about burning it when i was finished reading it, as to spare someone from such nastiness. Instead, I traded it at a book store for another book. In a word - yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I was so excited to read this \\"hilarious\\" book. How disappointing. It was disgusting. I ended up ripping it up to keep any of my kids from finding it and making the same mistake as I made, which was reading it until I decided it wasn't going to get any better, but by then having disgusting images in my mind. (It's one thing to say \\"I came home from school and caught my mother engaged in lesbian activities.\\" Quite another to describe and dwell on them. Seems to me he was trying to sensationalize, not just vent, about his childhood. How sad this was popular enough to be made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"genius","review":"More entertaining in a fascinating way than hilarious but still worth every minute spent reading.

VERY bizarre. And there is a lot of homosexual sex in it along with loads of mental illness and somethings that will make you want to puke. I'm serious. All in all. It wasn't horrible but it made me think my life is pretty damn normal and this guy belongs on Jerry Springer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much....","review":"I too love memoires of dysfunctional gay men, but this story didn't do it for me. I just KNEW that I would love it, but I think I have chuckled once, maybe twice. The very graphic relationship between the 13 year old and 36 year old was a bit much to stomach....and I can handle crazy and dysfunctional. I would go with Mr. Sedaris for a good dysfunctional laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THOSE BOOKS THAT LOCKS YOU AND KEEPS YOU","review":"I read this book in a day and a half and only because sleep got in the way from me finishing it the day I bought it. I can't say I've done this with a book in a long time; it was one of those books you come across only a few times in your life that you can't put down. This book will make you laugh out loud, gasp in shock, and take you to another world. I highly reccommend it to anyone who is willing to take a look into the life a teenager who had a completely upsurd and corruptive upbringing, yet somehow survived and can share his story with a bit of irony and humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get into this book.","review":"I'd heard so many good things about this book that I ran out and bought a copy.

I disliked it so much, that I threw it in the garbage when I was done reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing is an understatement","review":"I eagerly dove into this book, as I've heard great things about it from reviews and friends. However, this is one of the few books that I wish I could have a time machine to make myself never read this book. While the writing style was initially interesting, the book's contents soon took a nose dive to bizarre-ville. The brash, disgusting characters of the book make me wonder whether they were exaggerated or not. I found little humor in the blatant abusive childhood the author grew up in. Unlike ANGELA'S ASHES, which was depressing, yet humorous, this book is just depressing. The lack of humor I was promised by the back cover made it difficult for me to read the author's story of abandonment, rape, and neglect."},{"rating":"1","title":"running with scissors","review":"The book running with scissors was about agusten burroughs crazy child hood. Augusten goes from living with both of his parents to living in the house of his mothers pyscatrist and theres lots of crazy stuff in bettween. i disagreed with the critics rateing of this book. The book was on the new yorks best sellers list for 70 weeks and i thought it was lucky the book got published. I didnt think the book really had hte edge to make you not want to put it down. I also didnt care for the writing style of the author.

I hope the author of the book has a Day Job!The physical condition of the book was fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running With Scissors","review":"As a teacher of young children, some of whom have suffered from severe neglect and abuse, I found this book offensive. Trivializing traumatic events in the lives of the most vulnerable among us disturbs me. It is only an optimistic nature that propelled me through this book, hoping for some relief from the constant betrayal this boy endured. The dispassionate description of the atrocities and neglect in this boy's life is frightening. If this guy really lived this life, I am astounded neighbors did not report the whole menagerie to CPS, the police, the medical licensing board, the truancy officer, and anyone I've not mentioned who represents the well being of children and mentally ill adults in this society. This is no laugh riot; this is the story of a child who disassociated himself from the pain of abandonment and abuse. I hope writing this was therapeutic for him, but it didn't do me any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and pathetic!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend whose principals and taste I generally admire. I'm disappointed in her taste in reading material. The author's life as a young boy was in no way amusing or funny. In fact, it was outright offensive. I followed it to the end hoping for some redeeming moment, but never found it. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhhhhh","review":"I hate this book.

So there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"when I read about this story in Vanity Fair magazine, I was curious to actually read it. The author has to have made up most of what he claims happened during his childhood. It is impossible that what he describes is fact. It is the most disgusting crap I have ever read, and so obvious that he just wanted to make money. But the fact that he would damage the only family he ever really had is pathetic. this reader doesn't believe a word of it and hope augusten gets what he deserves. I finished the book last night, and this morning, it was put out with the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sedaris should be offended","review":"I only got a few chapters into this book, but soon I realized that it wasn't going to get any better so I went downstairs into the garage, took the lid off the garbage can, and buried it deep inside. Although I could have resold it, I guess, I thought it would be much better to eliminate at least one copy from worldwide circulation. I'm glad to hear that I was not alone in this -- other members of my bookclub did exactly the same.I was greatly offended at the author's attempts to humorize painful, disgusting, and evil behavior. I do not believe that if you have had a crappy childhood you are never entitled to laugh, but it is very wrong, I think, to make light of or make jokes about morally deviant and evil behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"This was a disgusting book.

I remember the day when that store wouldn't sell certain CDs because of their language and content -- good old Sam Walton was a principled man. Well, Sam's gone and WalMart's principles have slipped. This book is flat-out obscene. Pornographic. It's not some whimsical, quirky story of an American childhood. Parents, be warned. This is NOT a book even for teens, in my opinion. WOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar and crude!!!","review":"I was surprised at the gross, vulgar passages I found by simply turning to several random pages. I didn't even dare read it because of the crude parts I came across. Definitely not for someone with a clean mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written, However Extremely Disturbing","review":"Augusten Burroughs is a truly gifted and amazing writer.However, the subject manner is so disturbing that I often found myself feeling sick. The fact that it's a memoir, breaks my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I had just finished reading \\"A Glass Castle\\" when I picked up this book. My stepdaughter recommended it to me as part of her assigned book club reading. I am not into this kind of life. I found the author's descriptions of some activities really disgusting. In college, we had to read Henry Miller's \\"Tropic of Cancer\\". I found that more maturely written than \\"Running with scissors\\". I found no humor in this book. To be honest, I did not even take the time to finish it. I will be more careful in my selection of titles and not accept the New York Times Best Sellers list without question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page turner, but no substance","review":"The book is a memoir rather than an autobiography so it is more episodic (no pun intended) than linear and while each character is certainly colorful, there is no sense of exactly who each person is beyond a set of very weird behaviors. The author mentions a series of quirks (some funny, some very disturbing) with no foundation. Why does the family save its turkey bones and break its dishes? How long did they live outside? How many pills did he take?In the end, the people are interesting anecdotes, but I just don't care enough about them to read the sequel.For those who are looking for a memoir that seizes humor out of tragedy, I would recommend \\"Angela's Ashes\\" rather than \\"Running with Scissors\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing lower than 1 star?","review":"What can be said about this terrible book? I really tried to find something redeemable in it. I'm not one to tell someone that the horrors experienced in childhood never happened but I kept wondering how in the world a person could speak so nonchalantly about these kinds of experiences. Am I crazy or wouldn't most 12 year olds have run away from this weird group of freaks. There is something about the writing that doesn't ring true to me. I like others, had to trash it. I felt as if someone was getting screwed here and it wasn't just the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but too disturbing!!","review":"Well written, very visual and interesting characters. If reading about a boys first homosexual experiences in detail and scooping human feces out of the toliet and setting it out in the sun to dry sound like something you'd like to read about...this is the book for you!! It wasn't for me...So, bizarre I wonder how much is even true. They say truth is stranger than fiction...but, not something I enjoyed reading...The disgusting segments out weighed the credible writing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"disturbing...yet funny?","review":"I shared this book with a couple of my friends because I wanted them to tell me what I thought of it. While they enjoyed the book, I think they found it pretty disturbing. It's a response to a crazy childhood and dissillusionment with people in a position of trust. There were moments where I was laughing out loud, and the next hoping it was fiction yet wondering where someone could imagine such whackiness.There are very few people that I would recommend this book to, not because the book isn't well-written, but because I don't know how some people would react to Augusten's world. The great thing about this book is that it is written with dry humour instead of the pathetic \\"poor me\\", parent-blaming BS that I have to listen to from other individuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, not funny","review":"This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. Simply recording (and/or \\"glamorizing\\" as one reviewer put it) mental illness is not entertaining or funny--it's disturbing. The book has no structure, and reads as if the author simply transcribed his journal entries. I almost gave up 3/4 through, but decided to finish it in the hopes that some sort of revelation would occur to the author, something that would make wading through all the crap (sometimes literally) encountered so far worth it. No such luck. Leaving does NOT constitute an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny but I read it anyway","review":"Any comparison to David Sedaris does Sedaris a HUGE disservice. Sedaris is hilarious. This is not a funny book, but I did feel compelled to keep reading it--I think for its bizarreness factor. About halfway through I realized that there was no way this was a true memoir. No one would live on a street with the Finch family and not call the authorities. I am not at all opposed to homosexuality, but as the mother of two sons I am thoroughly appalled at how anyone can think that the abusive molestation of a 13 year old boy by a sick, shallow, self-absorbed adult is funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"when you finish this book , you wish you hadn't read it.","review":"Burroughs is a fine writer and i feel for the guy. but, gotta say it: the book's disturbing, and not in a good way. the autobiographical material he had to work with is so... sick. unless you are a reader who has grown up in a similarly drug-oriented, sex-focused environment where mental health is in short supply, w-a-a-y too much disclosure.most telling is the epilogue, in which Burroughs goes thru a where-are-they-now with all the main characters. some are dead, some are disabled, only one or two seem to be at all functional. this book makes you wish Burroughs all the best in his life because he's already experienced a sort of hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my time","review":"I decided on reading this book based on the fact that I enjoy memoirs where the author has risen above the rubble to experience fulfillment or something positive. With that being said, this book is beyond terrible. Burroughs is extremely distasteful in his descriptions of a family that took him in from his off-her-rocker mother and humiliated everyone who came into contact with him. I also wonder if anything in the book is even true because he writes with a detachment that either alludes to him needing MORE therapy or none of these things having happened at all. Sorely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content is fine - book in terrible condition.","review":"I ordered a *new* book that was obviously used! There are pen marks in the book and some bizarre crap that's causing pages to stick. Disappointed with whoever is responsible for the book's production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running with Scissors","review":"Amusing story of wild and crazy families. Hard to believe one could survive the growing up process. Intelligent and creative talent has a way of protecting those that choice to survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your $","review":"I made it about half way through this book and said forget it. I took it down to the local library and donated it. I don't know the last time I started a book and didn't finish it but this book just wasn't worth even that. In fact I felt I was somehow doing myself a favor by stopping. I hated every character -- there wasn't a single person that I cared about in the least tiniest amount. Reading this book was like having to eat your least vegetable out of the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing - yes, Entertaining - no","review":"Sorry, can't jump on the bandwagon with this one. It's a catalog of neglect and abuse thats writing may have proven cathartic to Mr Burroughs, but reading could only be deemed amusing to the sadist in training."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Journey No One Should Take","review":"I always look to memoirs as opportunities to walk in others' shoes and learn from their experiences. After reading this book, not only do I not want to walk (or run) in these shoes again, I want to get rid of them forever. True, the author went through many bad experiences but he was a willing participant in many of his bad experiences. They call this book Dave Petzer with Laughs. I have read all 3 of Dave's books and while they were disturbing, there was at least a payoff. This book is one big self-delusion that I was sorry to be a part of. Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running With Scissors","review":"This could have been an interesting and humorous book if the author had left out the very graphic, and disgusting sex scenes.I don't think those sections of the book added anything positiveto the book, but certainly made it what I would call \\"undesirable literature.\\" I often wonder how books likethat even get published. It was a waste of time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running with Scissors","review":"i found this to be a sad and depressing book about one of the worst cases of child abuse and i am horrified that anyone would call it comedic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated \\"X\\"","review":"The author blatantly seeks shock value. I feel like each chapter is one lude Saturday Night Live skit after another. The characters in the book are disgusting and dysfunctional. I guess that's the point, but it's over-the-top.**WARNING** If you do not like reading graphic and frequent homosexual sex scenes and references DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. It has language more vile and crass than any book I've read or movie I've seen. Don't waste your time because it's not written well enough to override the crudeness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filed it in my circular file","review":"This book was advertised as darkly humorous. I found it dark but not humorous. It was the only book I can remember throwing away because I just couldn't see any redeeming value in it. The author fills us in on whats happening but not really how this affects him emotionally. I must admit I kept wondering where the neighbors were through all the weird goings on at the \\"old victorian house on a nice street\\". Also, the scenes between Neil and the author were just a little to graphic. I'm not asking for sugar coating, I know these things happen, but just a little less detail would have been better. I was disappointed with this book and wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before I bought it. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing . . . and not funny","review":"I felt the writing was forced--as though Mr. Burroughs was begging for a laugh. I don't understand how anyone could laugh at the most horrifying childhood anyone could imagine. Why does the \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" debacle creep into my mind? It's the lack of genuineness--the way the story is pieced together with the hopes of entertaining. It's shocking, disturbing and disgusting--and mostly, lacking veracity. There's something off kilter here and I can't quite put my finger on it . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable...","review":"I did not enjoy this book. If it is true it is incredibly heartbreaking and tragic. If it is not, it is overdone and distasteful.

I enjoyed his book Dry much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for those who think their lives are crazy","review":"For those of us who might have ever believed that our childhoods were somewhat dysfunctional this book serves as the ultimate in dysfunction.

That's the only thing that'll keep your attention.The book is coarse, vulgar and disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A frantic yet intricately and tightly written yarn","review":"I read this book last month by order of a book club I've joined. I'd heard of it in passing, but didn't know a lot about it. I was hooked within minutes of beginning the first chapter, and took on a bad habit of sitting in the bathtub long after the water had gone cold because I didn't want to close this book even long enough to get out and move to the couch. Burroughs' book seems to have electricity running through it. It's raw and real and viciously funny. Half of me wondered where CPS was, and the other half felt very dirty, like I had picked a lock on someone's precious diary."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST","review":"Callie Sawyer, fan of Non Fiction,Running With Scissors is a remarkable book within the memoir/biography/abuse genre. The book is all telling and yet there is a rare look at the abuse suffered with dignity and at times humor. I have read many such books. Running with Scissors compares easily to that of 'Nightmares Echo' (agree with prior reviewer),also due to the details of the book I compare it to Dry,The Privilege Of Youth, and A Million Little Pieces. In each of the afore-mentioned books you find a compelling story, sometimes sad, and sometimes they laugh within themselves at the 'luck of the draw' they got from childhood on. Yet, they never give up the fight for courage and determination."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an act of self gratification","review":"I bought this on a whim because a few people had told me it was \\"hysterical\\" and it was a best-seller, so I figured it must be pretty good.How a tripe, narcissistic, uninspired story like this ever became a best seller is beyond me. I can only imagine that its reasoning lies in the books graphic and completely un-romantic portrayal of homosexuality or its ability to remove all emotional impact from things like rape, mental disease or the pain of a broken home.I finished reading it thinking that this author should probably seek psychiatric help in order to be able to connect substantially with any human being. Which is all well and good, but hardly worth the price of buying his dumb book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"Nice wordcrafting is about all I can say about this book. In my entire life, I have only put two books down without finishing them. This is one of them! I did not care for the graphic account (smells, sounds and tastes) of a young boy being sodomized (willingly?) for the first time - and on and on and on. Blechh! If this is a purging memoir, then fine, but please, please, please, don't tell me I should like it. I found nothing endearing, uplifting or gratifying in any of the 164 pages I made myself read before deciding I had better things to do with my mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Running With Scissors","review":"An alcholic father, a psychotic mother, a neglectful therapist/foster parent and a pedophile are only a few of the odd characters in Running with Scissors.

Overall, this book is well written and an engaging look at family dysfunction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not for me...","review":"I heard so much buzz aboutRunning with Scissorsthat I had to try it. I generally enjoy memoirs, was prepared for some difficult stories, and expected David Sedaris-like wry bitterness. What I got was a headache. I just couldn't find myself engaged.

The story is outrageous and sad and my hat's off to him for surviving (and, apparently, surviving alcoholism as per his new book), but it's just not well written. You can tell he and his editor thought his writing was witty and perhaps even funny, but it's actually quite forced and self-conscious. As another reviewer said, it reads like a trashy novel. Bummer.

David Sedaris has subtlty and wit and relevence. This book, not so much. Even on its own merrits though, I couldn't recommend it. The writing is about comparable to a university memoir seminar writing course. Meaning that it's not poorly written, but it's not great either. More important though was that Burroughs doesn't really make the characters human enough to care what it is going on with them. I'm fine with dark comedy and writing about difficult times, but not when I couldn't care less about who is telling the story and who is in it. The final message about learning to survive and taking those survival skills doesn't come until the last line of the book. The rest of it just feel like treading water. The pay off wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Augusten Burroughs has to have one of the driest wits (read \\"Dry\\" and \\"Selevison\\" ) of any writer of today (and maybe other days).

It was not disturbing - although one could argue that the author's life stories could be considered disturbing but if you love sarcastic, witty, dream-like stories (and have ready any of Augusten's other books) you will like this one. I am already in line for the next one. I wonder who will play who in the movie of the book - although some scenes may need cut out because John Q Publicjust wouldn't get it.

I realize the pedophile is mentioned on the back cover, but he does much more to the narrator than \\"befriend\\" him.It's also poorly edited - \\"Queen Helene\\" in a chapter heading and \\"Queen Helen\\" in the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Flash , No Heart","review":"This book is packaged as a memoir of sorts ,but it reads more like a John Irving novel in early pre development . Flatly episodic , each page seems to be trying to be more outragous than the last , but unlike the typical Irving novel ,there is no build up ,little character devolpment ,and after a time the reader grows weary of incidents which try too hard to be shocking.What is mostly lacking though in this supposed memoir is any true picture of the individuals involved ,any sense of sympathy for them as people - instead we are left with one strange incident after another ,an example of which finds various characters attempting to divine the future from their feces ;indeed an entire chapter is given over to detailing this dubious eneterprise.Finally , Scissors is like a Henny Youngman vaudeville routine - occassional flashes of humor escape from onslaught, but in the end what we are left with is an empty and unsatisfying experience , all flash and no heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever tried to read","review":"I finally gave up on this mess after multiple tries. I'm sympathetic to the subject and the subject matter, and I was looking forwarding to a moving but humourous read. Boy, what a disappointment. For one thing, the author's copious self-pity mixes poorly with his attempts at humour. For another thing, it's just not a very well-written book; very pedestrian and absolutely no panache. Don't waste your time on this one. (P.S. Amazon, please add a zero to your rating system. My rating of one is waaay too high for this one!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humm....","review":"Do you know what its like when someone shares too much information about something really inappropriate? That is how I felt after reading this book.. I didn't think it was funny and frankly it was quite sad. I read this book because it was compared to David Sedaris books, believe me, they are not the same style at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Very disappointing and disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Humor","review":"I cannot see where the humor is in this story. We have a psychotic mother, a molested child, a monster doctor, a child molester and a father I cannot find a word for. That the author survived and became a productive adult is testament to the survival instincts of a person. Yes, Augusten Burroughs tries to puts things into a lighter mood and he's certainly not a crybaby, but the horrors describer in this book are anything but funny"},{"rating":"1","title":"How this man got published we'll never know","review":"I found RWS tiresome, shallow, and poorly written. I should have counted how many times the author employed such devices as \\"I looked like I had been run over by a truck...\\" -- how do YOU know how you look? Aren't you inhabiting your own body?This was a sophomoric response to an incredibly traumatic (and often unbelievable) childhood; I pity the author, but should not have wasted my 4.5 hours reading his self-obsessed drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Fiction","review":"The toilet bowl message concerning this book points down.

Ha! I can't wait to go check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An AWE-SOME READ!","review":"Don't buy this book if you're a prude with a narrow mind, Augusten is saucy and raw to the core! He's witty and I love his snazzy remarks, bravo!

Really though, this book, and the enjoyment I felt just reading it stuck with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful book","review":"The most self-serving, unbelievable book I have ever read. Although engaging at times, it was gross, and very hard to believe. I hope he gets sued for lying about other people and his life.

Don't waste your time or your brain cells on this liar."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good- despite the reviews...","review":"After reading rave reviews of this book- here on this website and in other publications, I recommended this for my book club to read. My mistake- now they all second guess my suggestions- not one of us liked this book. It has an intriguing and wild life story, but not one that I necessarily wanted to know, or can honestly believe. The writing, while having a few having a few great moments of description or insight, was elementary and made the reading even harder- a bit like reading a high school students fiction story or autobiography. This is one that shows that the reviewers are not always to be trusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"as a writer burroughs talent is barely above a zero","review":"if you want to read some one's self obsessed drivel about why their childhood was so weird without actually being given any insight into why it was (am i the only one who doesn't thing that camping out on the lawn on a hot day is a pretty normal thing to do, that having dirty dishes in the sink and lazy people who have no interest in washing them is pretty typical?) by someone who may have been given some good source material but still seems to not be able to do anything with it this book is for you. Burroughs self-obsession with the drivel he writes about his lifeseems to be most notable for the fact that he dropped out of high school and did nothing for several years. What Burroughs does demonstrate is a strong gift for marketing - not only did he get an ad agency to sign him in NYC but he was able to get some publisher to actually publish this book. Glad I just found it lying around an airline bathroom and didn't actually spend real money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I consider this memoir thoroughly disgusting. The author was the victim of a pedophile, his mother guilty of profound neglect. The psychiatrist should have been reported to the authorities years before he had the chance to damage so many lives. It would take a taste for really sick humor to find anything funny about this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"running with scissors","review":"One of the most offensive things I have ever encountered. With this type of literature and movies, we don't need war, Hitler or anything else. We can destroy ourselves without help. The movie was as shameful as the book. Complete lack of story material, offensive; Annette Benning has finally proven to everyone that she is very good at being a lunatic. If this is the only thing Hollywood can do, and rewards the actors for taking parts in it, I say we go back to the old system where the studios made sure that families can once again go to the movies. Benning should hang her head in shame knowing that her children will see what she promotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much info","review":"The book looked hilarious so I bought it. Halfway through, I had to get rid of it. I couldn't stomach the descriptions of gay sex--and I'm no homophobe.

Anyone who thinks this book is funny scares me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, not entertaining","review":"This book is just mildly amusing & more disturbing than anything else. There is one \\"gross out\\" scene after another not to mention pedophilia, coprophilia, substance abuse, animal cruelty, rape, & child abuse. This is supposed to be funny?Perhaps it would be a more bearable read if the author were somewhat articulate, but regrettably, this is not the case.If you are looking for a really funny read in this vein, try David Sedaris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrible","review":"I only read the first 6 chapters and had to stop. Each chapter was leading you further down with the bottom nowhere in sight. Like some stunt from Fear Factor, the author makes you wade through a pool of filth to gather the randomly placed 'nuggets' of humorous or otherwise emotionally touching moments. I finally had to drop out.Early in the book you are treated to such gems as the \\"Masturbatorium\\" chapter where his parents' therapist describes the acts he performs alone in his special room with photos of Golda Meir. From there, each chapter tries to outdo the one that came before it. Truly a race not just to the bottom, but somewhere way below it. Many passages left me with that feeling I've sometimes experienced after a very long plane ride: I just wanted to take a shower and put on some clean clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow self-indulgence","review":"I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection. So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the\\"shrink\\" bashers of the world. This \\"play for effect\\" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped , depressing,\\"Sex & the College Town\\"","review":"Have to admit, I read only half the book, then stopped. Kept wondering \\"Exactly where is it suppose to get funny? When the boy's describing the forced oral sex? or when his dad is getting drunk and physically abusing his mom?\\" I skipped to the end to see if it got any better, and it doesn't. There's gay erotica out there that's not as descriptive as this book! Very misleading, and very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about your weird childhood","review":"Burroughs absolutely, no doubt, hands down for sure had one of the weirdest childhoods I've ever read about. It elevates the word 'dysfunctional' to a whole new level. For scary, surreal, and sexual, Running with Scissors (what a great title) takes the cake.Starting with the divorce of his wacko parents, an already violently bad situation only gets worse when Augusten is sent to live with his mother's psychiatrist (who treats his mom's problems with visits to a motel), a wildly bizarre egomaniac. I mean, hello? Most of the remainder of the book documents his years spent with the shrink's family, including his initiation into homosexuality by a family member who's 20 yrs older than he is.It's hard to find a single word to describe this book, so I'll go for a string of single words: scatalogical, sexual, bizarre, scary, depressing, hilarious, pathetic, hopeful, illuminating - and really, really interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I found the light hearted manner that the author used to tell this story very difficult to deal with and the story to be simultaneously depressing and appalling to the point of disbelief (even though I understand that it is based on true events). I think it is probably good for people to be aware of the terrible situations in which some children are raised but this book almost seemed to bask in the grotesque events of this boy's life. I can't think of the last time I could not finish a book but it happened with this one. I also found the writing to be somewhat amateurish and the continuity between certain chapters to be non-existent, further adding to the difficulty of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star","review":"This book may have been hailed as a memoir, but it was also not only disturbing, but borderline pornographic. I took this book on vacation and ended up throwing it away half-way through because it was just too graphic and pointless. Seems the author was more concerned with shock value and self-disclosure, than in having it make a point or comment on mental illness and/or dysfunctional parenting. I kept waiting for it to have some meaning, but instead it just became more pornographic as it continued. A crewmember on the ship I was vacationing on saw me reading it and commented that he was just as disturbed. That's when I finally decided my impression was not off, despite the \\"great\\" reviews and praise for the movie. YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a tawdry after-school special","review":"yes, it's got some funny situations and it's got some \\"interesting\\" characters. but it just felt artless. it's written without much nuance and i did not feel any sympathy for any of the characters. it felt forced. sorry - i don't get what the hype is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This is a true story about a boy struggling to grow up in very difficult circumstances. I thought that the writing was well done but the story line means that it is also difficult to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but Sedaris is EONS above burroughs.","review":"Not just as a writer, but as an interesting person. And he's pretty much a normal person. It's amazing Burroughs is even halfway normal at all. Sedaris' family was eccentric, maybe a little strange. Burroughs' family, extended and real were certifiable, and I mean that in the most literal sense of the word. The fact that any of them were running around loose in the world is damn near terrifying. The Finches should have had the authorities called on them not only for promoting statuatory rape, but for living in filth and exposing children to potentially dangerous people and situations. Yes, there's a dark humor throughout the book, but overall, there's more of a sense of disbelief. It's truly a miracle one of them didn't really turn out to be a mass-murderer. Not a feel-good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was excited to read this book, I thought it would be a good laugh after reading the reviews. I was disappointed. The book was more disturbing than funny. Infact there were very few funny parts in the book at all. It was captivating in a dark way, at times I found it hard to put down. But it is certainly a book I would not go out of my way to recommend for someone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Hilarity kept me up at night.","review":"I've lost many hours of sleep trying to finish this book! It's so good! I know he's compared to David Sedaris a lot and I'm not sure why? Burroughs is very funny, in a dark way, but he's unique to himself. Highly reccomended reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I guess the literary world may find this book funny but as a medical professional I found it very sad. Writing it may have been therapeutic for the author but how other people found it entertaining is beyond me. I felt the author was trying to shock the reader more than anything. I am beyond being shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Disturbing","review":"This is a disturbing account of Augusten Burroughs childhood.His mother is a whacked out artist and his father was a unloving jerk.He was sent to live his mothers \\"psychiatrist\\" and his family full of misfits.It is funny at times, but overall a depressing memoir.Its sad to read about his troubled childhood, and how he basically was sent into a world all on his own.I would definately reccommend this book, especially so you can read DRY, which is the follow up to Running with Scissors.If you enjoy the author, this lays the blueprint for all of his other novels/memoirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty yet sad","review":"wow- very original. His voice as a 14 year old is incredible. I have really loved this book, in the \\"watching a car wreck\\" kind of a way. I can see the story, and I think that is rare. I am cheering for even the most despicable of characters, and loving even the most pathetic. It is incredibly graphic with abusive sex scenes, so buyer-be-ware... but it has an incredible reality to it. I am drawn in by his raw and real loneliness and desire. You almost can't believe it, but you can. I couldn't put it down. Great quick read:300pgs done in two evenings.I would say that this book really gave me a much greater insight to the plight and life of a young gay man. I am really thankful to have this perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Another book hopping on the \\"my life is screwed up because of my childhood/adolescence\\" ficto-auto-biography wagon.The book reads almost formulaically, in the vein of Sedaris. I didn't find the writing interesting or engaging or particularly humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like weird, this is a book full of weird","review":"Personally, I preferredHello Dolly: Growing up in the late 1930s in Fall River, Massachusettsas an honest memoir that connects better with reality. Hello Dolly draws you in and keeps you in its world. Running with scissors seems to have come from another planet where every moment is a wacky weird adventure. That makes for a very fun read, but at times it's hard to believe. I'm not accusing Burroughs of making this stuff up, I'm saying, even if this were presented as a work of fiction, there are times when you fall out of the story space because it seems too unrealistic. That said, I enjoyed reading the book and had a hard time putting it down. Depressing, but funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow what a child hood","review":"I did not grow up like the Brady's but after reading Running with Scissors my life was a party compared to Augusten's life. My hat off to him just for the fact that he lived through that madness. The book was an emotional read I had to keep reminding myself this was not a story that was made up but the author had to live through of that. I finshed the book and now I am reading Dry. I would recommend both books to anyone that is an avid reading like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Robison Reinvents His Name, Life","review":"Untrustworthy, poorly written and with every other sentence calculated for maximum shock/funny value, this obviously fictionalized memoir leaves me totally puzzled. I can understand why 20-somethings would find this work wild and outrageous, but people who should know better seem to embrace it as well. Most disturbing is that 'Augusten Burroughs' (the name is also made-up) took a bona-fide troubled childhood, filtered it through a commercial copywriter's sensibility and transformed it into a glib, Sedaris-like (albeit third-rate Sedaris) rollercoaster ride of non-stop jolts and outrages. The experience is ultimately tiring. It appears Burroughs is primed to crank out many more years of \\"true stories\\" but discriminating readers will opt for more grown-up writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running With Scissors","review":"Running With Scissors is a very intersting read, the author has risen above incredible odds. Well written and an eye opener regarding his upbringing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read.","review":"I finished this book quickly. It was a good read. The movie did the book no justice.

Once I came to the sordid gay sex scene between a thirty-something year old male and a minor (thirteen, fourteen?), I was done. There's no moral to the story. If the author was out for shock value, then he's got it. If he wanted the world to think that he had it bad, that his life sucked, then he could have just said.... \\"I came from a dysfunctional family, I moved in with an even-worse family, I had gay sex with mixed feelings about it, my friends were as messed up as I was, and there's nothing I want you to take away from my book.\\"This book came highly recommended by a friend. Now I'm ticked off at my friend.I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Depressing","review":"I'm one of those that completes a book no matter how bad it is. This is one of those occasions.

I found the sexual parts a bit of an overshare, detail-wise. Also since, if his experiences were actually true, that part amounts to basically sexual abuse based on the age differences of the parties involved. It's hard to believe there are people so clueless in this world that they would actually raise their children in the manner described in this book.

I found it to be incredibly disturbing with disgusting descriptions of the various caracters' sexual lives. I am no prude. I really don't care that he talks about his homosexuality, his mother's lesbianism, etc., etc., etc., but I really grew tired of the vivid descriptions of those events that I had to endure. Those descriptions completely ruined the book for me and I ended up actually throwing it in the garbage because I was so disgusted with it.

Our group has been meeting and discussing literature for over ten years and have enjoyed a wide range of books. The author showed a high grade of talent in describing his dysfunctual childhood and in making the characters vivid. However, the details got to be a bit too much, especially the episode with the feces examination. Most of my group tired of the craziness and stopped reading.

I did not find any part of this book funny and I am surprised that anyone could or did. Augusten endured a horibble childhood at a terrible cost. The fact that he survived it is a miracle; it is obvious to me that he paid a terrible price. The writing is very detached and rather than feel as if Augusten was telling the story, it seemed it was someone else. There are many times he describes how he detached himself from the events that were happening in his life. This is a common response to abuse and emotional neglect. I, too, wondered when just ONE responsible adult would step in and save not only Augusten but the children of Dr. Finch, who obviously was completely nuts himself. I thought the sexually explicit nature of some of the narrative was unnecessary and offensive--too much information. I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"true to its word","review":"Book I ordered was just right.

If you are the type of person who can find humor in a grisly train wreck, then you'll love this book. If there's any truth to the story at all, I believe it's been embellished until it's unrecognizable. I didn't finish the book - I'm waiting for the musical, or perhaps the comedy channel will pick it up.

Burroughs is not a decent writer (clearly he should have read and written more in school- or gone to school, for that matter.) He has trouble adopting a clear, authorial voice (odd as the book is a memoir) and judiciously balancing tragic elements with comic (the latter consisting mainly of adolescent potty humor.) I also resist buying into the veracity of this book as a retelling of real events.Flip ahead to the page where he alludes to \\"running with scissors\\" and the passage reads flat, unclimactic, almost neutered. And why did the publisher show a box covering a boy's head when the image should be a boy running with scissors? Sad to see the popularity of this book given how many better efforts are out there. Clearly, Burroughs' readers skipped as much school as he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, no stars","review":"I bought this book, because of the great review I read in the paper. Yet, the writer of the review forgot one thing. That you could also find it in the \\"Adult Porn\\" or \\"Gay Porn\\" section of your nearest bookstore!!! I didn't even finish reading it, and took it back to where I purchased it for a full refund. It started out as enjoyable reading, funny, odd, etc., but in no way did I expect to read the detailed descriptions of the authors trysts with a gay man. Couldn't he just have hinted at what happened, did he feel that he needed to give the reader every disgusting detail of what happened? Did he mentioned any of these parts of the book during his book signings or tv show appearances? How many books would he have sold then? I don't need trash like that in my house, thank you. Maybe we need to put ratings on books like we do with CD's and DVD's for sexual content, etc. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"Augusten Burroughs has an interesting story to tell, but is incapable of telling it interestingly. He is a poor writer and has only his material to work with; if not for the facts of his childhood he wouldn't ever have written a book. His sentences are simplistic, childish, he has no distinct style to speak of at all and his imagination is utterly impoverished. I was taken in by all the hype. It's no wonder he's compared to Sedaris; neither writer has an edge. Reading them both is like shaving with a dull razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!","review":"I am really glad I didn't waste my money on this one; I checked it out at the library. Better yet, I didn't waste my time actually reading it; I listed to the CD version while I drove to work. I agree with the other reviewer that wondered how this book made it to the bestseller list.

I started to read this and at first it was interesting but as you cross one hundred pages the memoir shows its true colors.The book goes into so many disturbing sequences its hard to find a spot that doesnt contain it, its wrong and its described so graphic, I immediately threw this book into the thrash can and later I could never get it out of my head because it just made me feel very disgusted.If you dont mind reading about mature topics and if you(the reader) enjoy twisted books then go for it, otherwise if you dont then your taking a risk when you start reading this book, its pretty disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away from Running with Scissors","review":"Disturbing, if true, and even more so if not -- who would make up this stuff? I read lots of different kinds of literature, fiction and non-fiction, and have never had to stop reading a book because it was so disturbing. Such unbelievable tales of physical, psychological, and emotional abuse of a young child...it was more than I could take. The title \\"Running with Scissors\\" makes it sound like this is somehow amusing or at least someone enjoying living dangerously. I fail to see the amusement. I certainly hope that writing this book was therapeutic for the author. It did nothing for me but cause me to give thanks for what seems more and more like a normal, reasonable childhood experience -- but then, compared to the one in the book, everyone's experience falls in the realm of \\"normalcy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I simply can't go on...","review":"reading this piece of trash.

So many are saying they couldn't like it because of his humor and that a thirteen year-old was in a relationship with an adult, but that is the point. He has a comical view on his past, but you can't put dislike a book on moral grounds when it's a memoir and somebody has lived it.

I bought the book based on the blurbs on the cover, expecting a David Sedaris type book. There were moments of humor, but the overall feeling the book left with me was a troubled one--thoughts of broken lives and seriously disturbed individuals. Let me clarify that I am far from prudish, but I fail to see any humor whatsoever in the adult sanctioning of abusive sexual relationships with underage adolescents.It's even more disturbing to realize this is a memoir and not a work of fiction. Perhaps it would better serve as a \\"beware of therapists\\" tome rather than as a book promoted to be filled with hilarious coming-of-age tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Read but not Enriching","review":"Although you can read this book very quickly and it is disturbing enough to keep you turning the pages when I was finished I was dissappointed. There is not one character that you can root for. Every character has so many problems it is hard to believe that they are all true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic, horrific, horrible","review":"This book left me feeling raped as a reader. The sexual encounters are described far to graphically. There is a way to document these encounters without being so descriptive that the reader is left feeling like they need a mental shower. I had to put it down. It was far too horrific to continue on. The writing felt sensationalistic and detached, which perhaps was indicative of the writer's state of mind after having endured the childhood that he did. Burroughs missed the mark with this one. This had the potential to be an incredible book but it just isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"No David Sedaris...","review":"I found this book too disturbing and rarely funny.

The only thing this book seems to offer is a portrayal of a lot of really screwed up people with a twisted view of life. How the jacket has the audacity to compare this to David Sedaris is beyond me. None of the characters is appealing nor is there a major conflict to be resolved. It's also poorly written.It just seems to be poorly disguised pornography except for the fact that pornography is meant to excite the reader and the repeated sex scenes are huge turnoffs. Sex is described as something unpleasant to be tolerated because at least it's not boring.Save your money or go buy a Sedaris book if you want to enjoy reading about dysfunctional people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing - Nothing like David Sedaris","review":"After learning that people who enjoyed David Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day reccommended this book, I immediately bought it. However, this book is not humourous nor clever, it is quite disturbing. This book has few, if any, funny parts. I will admit this book is unique in that I cannot compare it to anything else I have read. I would not suggest anyone read this book unless they are looking for a sick, twisted, disturbing tale. IT is hard to imagine anyone thought this was funny, it is not even a dark comedy - it is just dark. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess what, it gave me the creeps!","review":"The book started out light and quirky with a lot of potential, but it takes a rather dark turn when Burroughs moves in with his psychiatrist. Disturbing incidents, insanity, crudeness, and graphic sexual encounters ensue. Somewhere among the chaos is the story of how Burroughs starts writing, but it gets hopelessly lost by the more shocking occurrences.While I can appreciate the author's attempt to find the humor in some very bad situations, the book does not read as humorous. I saw it more as a way for Burroughs to gain some closure over a dreadful childhood. Whether or not the book is completely true, and I have my doubts, it is vulgar, over the top and anything but subtle. I'd try to give an age appropriate suggestion for this book, but I'm 24 and I think I lost a little more innocence the day I read this book. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...","review":"How on earth can a story about pedophilia, homosexuality and interracial lesbian love affairs be so godforsakenly BORING? I made it to about page 200 before I just flung the book across the room and said \\"FORGET IT!\\" Badly written and chock-full of stereotypes, it tries too hard to be \\"shocking\\". Not to mention that the writing \\"sounds\\" like a ten-year-old, which made it impossible for me to read. You're a child. I get it. You don't have to WRITE like one! RWS is emoporn at its finest - only presented as a comedy as opposed to a tragedy. Why do people love to read about children being molested much, anyway? The fact that our country eats garbage like this up with a spoon is just further proof that America is in serious moral decline - that, and R. Kelly's new album going gold in one week. (And I'm a liberal!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh. My. God.","review":"I cannot believe how hard this book is making me laugh, especially since the subject matter is truly horrific. But the writing is sensational and hilarious. I saw a great review of it this morning in The New York Times, so I bought a copy at lunch. And I've done almost nothing else but read it all day. I'll probably be fired tomorrow for getting no work done, but I really don't care. It's worth it. This is Dave Eggers, but readable. David Sedaris, but funnier.

The psychiatrist patriarch was a character of interest and the main reason, along with misleading praise on the back cover, for my bothering past the second page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the same league","review":"To compare David Sedaris to Augusten Burroughs is to compare Woody Allen to Adam Sandler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain disturbing","review":"This is one of the few books in my life that I could not finish. How anyone could find it amusing is beyond me. I got about halfway through, expecting some redeeming value in it due to the many good reviews, and also because I have enjoyed several other memoirs recently (The Liar's Club, The Glass Castle, Oh The Glory of It All, all of which I highly recommend).However, when the psychiatrist he is living with starts reading meaning into his bowel movements, and has his adult daughter scoop them out of the toilet and save them on the backyard picnic table (no, I'm not making this up), I could not bear it any longer. It doesn't matter whether the story is true or not. This is nothing but trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal and Dark","review":"Told from the perspective of a young man coming to grips with his homosexuality, this memoir is a horrifying account of alcoholism, molestation, mental illness and abandonment in the setting of an intensely dysfunctional childhood.Some have compared Burroughs' strong prose to that of David Sedaris, but Burroughs' is much, much darker. He hits all the politically correct notes, however, which may explain his success. As a result, the reissue of this bestselling book may reach a new crop of readers - or not. Personally, despite an affection for humorous stories about crazy families, I found this to be extremely depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking & Hilarious","review":"While reading this book, I believe 50% of the time my hand was over my mouth in disbelief and the other 50% of the time I was smiling or laughing to myself. Augusten Burrough's childhood is unlike any I have ever heard of (and I thought I knew some fairly dysfunctional families). I was always looking forward to reading it and frequently was reluctant to put it down. I'm not in the middle of his follow up, Dry. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At times, funny, but I skipped some","review":"I lived in Northampton, Mass., once where this memoir is set. Often, I saw Finch, the crazy psychiatrist dressed like Santa Claus strolling downtown. I enjoyed the local mentions sprinkled throughout this youth memoir of a highly dysfunctional family. There were several or more chapters that I thought were tedious and I simply skimmed them. But there are others that are quite humorous. The author has a nicely ironic style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read from a great talent","review":"Both poignant and funny, this is a really entertaining read.

I started reading Running with Scissors with an expectation that the story would be as well-written and moving as the other two books. I was disappointed and put the book down halfway into reading it. It's not bad, but it's not good, either. The characters are somewhat shallow and unattractive. That's not to say that characters must be deep and attractive to enjoy, but these ones were not interesting to me. I also did not find the story very funny. I suppose what gave the story a flat quality was the narrative voice. Not that reflective, or insightful. Reads more like a highschool essay than a great memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I read this book awhile ago. And hated it.

Some of the more graphic descriptions of homosexual sex escapades didn't border on repulsive - they WERE actually repulsive (e.g. talking about brown smears on underwear - too much unnecessary information). The story would have been interesting, but the disgusting parts were so distracting to me that they overtook any interest I had in what was going on. Also, the narrator is probably the least talented audiobook narrator I've heard to date. His delivery seems very stiff and uncomfortable. He definitely didn't make the book any easier to listen to. Overall, I feel like this is nine hours of my life that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run into a grippingly Mad World","review":"Warped and Enthralling, Running with Scissors sucked me along--each odd event out-doing the last. The characters are so stark and richly developed that you can almost touch the hunchbacked mother, Agnes, sweeping absently around the 7 month old christmas tree. So many great quotes from that book, so many moments that make you want to yell--beware of reading it in public, or you may be locked away yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Crap. What a waste of time. I am actually embarassed to say I read this one. The good thing was it was a quick read, due to the simplicity of his vocabulary. This was due to his poor education, which was due to his own lack of motivation. The worst thing about this book and his story, is how he turns on the family who essentially adopted him. This family treated him like one of their own, yet he seems to be much more forgiving to the Child molestor he had an affair with. Plain garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe everything you read...would give zero stars if possible","review":"I knew this family and you should never believe everything you read. While they were far from conventional, this book would be better categorized as a fiction.

If you insist on reading it, at least check it out from the library so you won't feel ripped off.I bought this book to read on the train to work after reading a couple of other really great memoirs on the 'highly recommended' shelf at the bookstore. How this book is held in such high esteem by so many readers and critics is beyond me.Mr. Burroughs is a talented writer, and has a knack for bringing the reader right into the situation as if you were really there.

Perhaps I'm still living in Puritanical America, but the graphic descriptions of homosexual acts was unnecessary and served only to shock the reader.

Flatly episodic , each page seems to be trying to be more outragous than the last , but unlike the typical Irving novel ,there is no build up ,little character devolpment ,and after a time the reader grows weary of incidents which try too hard to be shocking.What is mostly lacking though in this supposed memoir is any true picture of the individuals involved ,any sense of sympathy for them as people - instead we are left with one strange incident after another ,an example of which finds various characters attempting to divine the future from their [excrement] ;indeed an entire chapter is given over to detailing this dubious eneterprise.Finally , Scissors is like a Henny Youngman vaudeville routine - occassional flashes of humor escape from onslaught, but in the end what we are left with is an empty and unsatisfying experience , all flash and no heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age in a Distorted World","review":"This memoir provides unusual insight into the distortion of mental illness: what's feels \\"normal\\" truly isn't normal within the standards western society. Mr. Burroughs is buffeted by love that abandons, love that controls, love that abuses. Yet, he survives and many times is the only sane person in his world.Amusing, heartbreaking, at times uncomfortable, finally hopeful.Running with Scissors (great title!) expands your perspective and in the end leaves you with a greater capacity for compassion to fellow man. Childhood can be hell, some worse that others.p.s. For a novel with similar themes, check out White Oleander by Janet Fitch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By His Brilliant Storytelling","review":"Although Augusten Burroughs is a brilliant storyteller, I just couldn't get past the first third of the book. It was too toxic, and I'm not talking about the toxicity of the subject matter. The toxicity: The author is exploiting his own story - the story of his horrendous childhood of abuse - for twisted and immature motives. He writes with a lack of perspective and a lack of a healing message, and for me that makes his story non-redemptive. It's like junk food - the value is in the flavor and the crunch, not in the nutrition. Not surprising that he was successful in advertising.Part of why I didn't finish it, however, is that I already read the whole of his brilliant but ultimately vapid semi-sequel, \\"Dry,\\" and I wasn't about to get fully fooled a second time. I hoped this book would be different. It wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unmemorable Memoir","review":"In one word, I found this book to be \\"junk\\". It's a perfect example of how vacuous our culture has become, and what now passes for good writing is a shallow piece of nothing like this. Whether it's true or not, there is absolutely no depth of feeling or analysis. After awhile the quality of shock wore off, and I put the book down thinking to myself: \\"Who cares?\\"The accolades poured on this book astonish me now that I've read it. I will be extremely vigilant about picking up a \\"memoir\\" from now on. It seems people have become a little too navel-gazey for my taste, thinking their story has something unique or special or in this case, quirky, that the world must know about. Perhaps that should be one of the criteria for a writer undertaking a memoir of him/herself: how badly does the world need another one of these, and am I really so special that everyone needs to know about me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious??","review":"I take exception to those who deemed this book \\"hilarious\\"...far from it. I rated the book one star, not because of the talent that it took to produce it, but because the content is so shockingly painful to read.

Luckly he didn't charge me because he understood my concern.Again after a year crystal was broken, I really worried about this time. So one day I found customer support number on Skagen website and called support person. I explained about the situation and I asked to talk to Manager.

The very first night when I set it gently on my bedside table, the entire crystal face cracked in a big circle all the way around. Warranty didn't cover problems with the face but the store owner took pity on me and gave me another. Two nights later I set the new one gently on the bedside table in the dark. When I woke up, the exact same pattern of catastrophic break.Now the owner said that nothing like that had ever happened before but it happened twice in a row and in very short order for me.

The main reason why I bought it is because it is solid titanium and won't irritate his metal allergy, but when I opened it I found that the clasp was stainless steel, which can cause problems. Nevertheless, he hasn't had a problem with it, but some other people might.I also agree with the people who say that the watch could use something to help visibility in the dark. They're right. The face is almost impossible to read in the dark even though it does look very handsome in the daytime.It is also loud. He never takes it off, but I can still hear it, particularly at night.

I've never smacked this thing ridiculously hard and one day I looked at it and there was a big crack across the crystal. This propagated and got worse until it was almost completely unreadable. Plus, about halfway through its life the ticking got really noticeable. Sometimes loud enough to bug me when I was trying to sleep.

That is simply NOT TRUE. When you see a JB tune with \\"part one\\" after the title, that just means you've got the hit single version. Back in the day JB recorded the long versions solely so he could cull 2-3 minute singles from them. Sometimes the track was split into part one and part two--or the A side of the 45 and the B side (or in the case of \\"Make it Funky\\" spread over two singles in a part one, part two, part three, and part four). Most often, however, the entire track was NEVER MEANT TO BE RELEASED.This cd comp is a collection of \\"hit singles,\\" not a dip into the vaults as most JB cds of the past couple of decades have been.

This book provides a broad overview of the history of Auschwitz, compiled from eyewitness accounts, transcripts of war crimes trials, and the memoirs of Rudolf Hoess and other Nazi's involved in the camp. While it lacks the emotional impact of a more personal account, this book helps shed some light on the scope of the horrors of Auschwitz and Birkeneau and the holocaust in general.

The original watch still works fine but the metal fibers in the band started to fray and was catching on her clothing. Was looking for a replacement band which I could not locate.

Initially it did for about half a year, than it stopped, I had the battery replaced, then it only worked sparodically, keeping time for a few hours to a few days at a time accurately before it slows down or stops entirely requiring the time to be re-set & it'll re-run again; so I replaced the battery a 2nd time thinking it may be a faulty battery & the same thing happens.

Skagen didn't repair well either.","review":"While this watch is very nice looking and I love the design, it doesn't work so well. The small hand in mine doesn't keep up and always looks an hour behind. I had it repaired once after only owning it for 9 months. EVEN UNDER WARRANTY, Skagen charged me $13 to repair it plus shipping cost. After less than a year, it's broken again and I went to the website and they want $34 to repair a watch. Plus I have to pay to ship it to them. The watch costs less than $100 so at this point, I'll just toss the thing.

Through bloody, and often stomach churning prose, Seymour describes their rampage through the centre of local rivals Derby's city centre, and with almost child-like glee revels in the telling of wanton violence and destruction. As a concerned parent, and Derby County fan, I am appalled that this kind of material be so easily and readily available for young children to read. I had to stop reading the chapter devoted to the Smash-Up breaking into the Fat Cat Cafe Bar beer cellar and urinating into the Speckled Hen as it was too distressing to carry on. Awful.

It has several typographic errors that should have been caught. The writing is also occasionally stilted, and it could be a little more organized.That said, this is an excellent book, especially for potters and students who are interested in using local materials in their glazes but don't really know where to begin. It is thorough, and provides not only the basics (ie., how to do line-blends), but also information on calculating a material's specific gravity, Seger/unity formulas, building your own ball mill, and more.A recommended read for potters and students wanting to know more about glazes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply AWESOME","review":"This is a great album mashing lyrics and instrumentals of different songs.

This is the first Tapply mystery I've read, and it will definitely be the last. The plot is contrived, the characters are not much better than caricatures, and the dialogue is plodding and predictable. Really, a lightning strike, amnesia, and 18 months in a government hospital was the best the author could come up with? Set in Maine, with both saltwater and freshwater fishing as possible themes, Tapply gives them short shrift, with little description of the outdoors and next to no fishing action. Add to that the objectionable element of the hero's adulterous relationship with a woman whose husband is gravely ill, and the book falls flat on almost every front. Stoney's dog is the only honorable character in the book, unfortunately. I came looking for a trophy rainbow, and it seems that all I have hooked is an old fisherman's boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"tapply has a way of relaxing the reader with simple language, the action scenes don't seem to provoke a lot of excitement from the main character but maye that's how Tapply wanted to portray his character. Nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitch Creek","review":"Interesting main character and terrific description of Maine. it is not a rushed sort of book, which means that one can get slightly Mainiac and into the way of living in a rather remote house with just a dog and an interest in fishing. Which means finding a lost young man in Bitch Creek suddenly wakes one up to pay attention to what happens from then on. Which is a lot!Linda Sheean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Muller for theatre students","review":"This is an excellent collection of Muller for anyone seriously interested in theatre. The German author's remarkable work spans political changes before, during, and after the fall of the Berlin Wall and represents a pivotal time in German society and theatre. With new treatments of classical texts (like Hamlet and Medea) as well as innovative works exploring themes of devotion and sexuality (like Quartet), this collection of short plays is a great starting point for theatre enthusiasts interested in tackling Muller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should know about Heiner Muller!","review":"I studied theater production in college, and the anthology of drama I had to buy for my theater history courses included the play Hamletmachine. Hamletmachine was not included in the required reading for my course, but I happened upon it one day flipping through my textbook, and fell deeply in love. If you are interested in feminism, socialism, or Brechtian theater, you will adore this book. It includes a history of Heiner Muller for beginners, interviews, and his most \\"influential\\" plays. Truthfully, I haven't read them all yet. I keep coming back to Hamletmachine, as I find it so beautiful that I read it obsessively over and over (I've even gotten Ophelia's monologue tattooed over a large chunk of my body!) It is awesome to hold this book in my hands and feel this man's energy, and learn more about him, and what moved him to create such beautiful poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"For an Allen Craig Card","review":"Got this for my daughter to keep her favorite players card in.

Where did the scenes go and why? I expected the DVD to have more, not less than the TV version."},{"rating":"1","title":"real time plot made me wish movie was really over","review":"I got the movie because I think most movie try to neatly tie up things that happen over years time in 90-120 minutes. This movie was even worse. I did check my clock to see if really was real time but more often I found myself watching to see how close it was to being over. Christopher Walken is here, looking his usual emaciated self, as if they don't pay him between movies and all he exists on is water. He carries the movie, not Depp. Depp had help along the way but I kept wondering why these people would want to help him. Most people, if they see you on the side of the road with a flat tire won't help you. They won't even call for help on their cellphone. So why would they help someone who might get killed? I did kind of like the bathroom scene. That was the only suspense, but the filmakers threw in a fantasy scene that took away from the action. The female villian was entertaining as a reluctant babysitter. Try it. You might like it"},{"rating":"1","title":"no thrill","review":"This movie has an unrealistic story that was not helped by the mediocre acting. I should have been warned by the enthusiastic review on the box - only from some unknown radio station's critic. It was not utterly boring, but I was not thrilled for a second. It was so much \\"film-like\\". Want to see a real thriller? Try 'Seven', 'Jacob's ladder', or even 'The game'."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLOCK WATCHING","review":"NICK OF TIME is a very absorbing and well made movie. Director John Badham orchestrates a tight, nerve-racking thriller, using \\"real time\\" to accentuate the hero's plight. Johnny Depp is very good in the lead role, embodying the torment and anguish of a man put into a terrifying position. Christopher Walken is as evil as he can be, his ruthless \\"quest\\" always a constant threat; Charles S. Dutton as a shoe shiner is remarkably good; Marsha Mason does a fine job as the governor, Peter Strauss well playing her ambitious husband. Rona Maffia as Walken's accomplice also brings a cold-hearted chill to her role.A tight, well done thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I love Johnny Depp. That being said, I had high hopes for this obscure movie that I'd never heard of before finding on Amazon. Wow! It was one of the worst written, acted, directed, produced movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie saved Johnny Depp's career","review":"Thankfully, this movie seemed to scare Depp back into doing the characters he was created for. :) He makes do with what little he's given here, and Christopher Walken puts in his always tremendous performance as the off-the-edge bad guy. Unfortunately, despite the gimicky real-time plot line, there's just so little to work with for both of them.There's little suspense because the outcome is never really in doubt, and the plot stretches are HUGE. The political commentary was transparent and heavy handed. My friend and I had a bet going as to whether the lead character was actually going to be named \\"Nick.\\" I was a bit surprised to find that I had won and that Depp's character was named \\"Gene.\\" The rest of the movie is so formulaic that I wouldn't have put it past them.Completist Depp or Walken fans will want to see this, but don't go into it expecting too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This movie was very disappointing. Not only is the plot cliched, the characters irritating, and the gimmicks incredibly annoying and unoriginal (clocks everywhere, Christopher Walken looming around every corner), but the whole film comes off as incredibly amateurish. It seems like some kind of student exercise in making a thriller, not an actual movie that people would pay to see. I'm really surprised that so many people reviewed it well, because I watch a lot of movies and I like most of them, and I was predisposed to like this movie because of Johnny Depp, but I really can't get past the faults in the script, generic-ness of the characters, and over all B-movie quality of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will want to see how it ends","review":"NICK OF TIME's story flaws will distract you. But you will nontheless want to see how this thriller ends.That's because director John Badham keeps the energy level high. NICK OF TIME delivers a lot of excitement.Several reviewers have been right to compliment NICK OF TIME co-star Christopher Walken. Walken has been there supporting and upstaging come-and-gone stars (Sean Penn in AT CLOSE RANGE, Matthew Broderick in BILOXI BLUES) before. In NICK OF TIME he's second-bill to Johnny Depp. Ten years from now, let's see if Depp's still starring in many films; I know Walken will.NICK OF TIME also features strong performances from Marsha Mason and Charles Dutton. With Mason, Dutton, Walken and the action-packed talents of director Badham, NICK OF TIME will hold your interest to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"good transaction","review":"I recieved my dvd in perfect condition even though it was used and actually better than 2 new ones I purchased directly from amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Nick of Time","review":"A different sort of role for Johnny Depp but I really enjoyed it.

It rips off other action flicks, most notably 'Diehard'. The movie is entertaining, though. However it's ridiculous and obvious election-year propagandizing ruin it's weak plot and undermine much of it's enjoyablilty. The director should have spent less time pushing his personal politics and more on the movies' plot. The 'liberals good!', 'conservatives bad' kindergarten propagandizing are insulting and demeaning. Too bad the director feels compelled to treat the audience as idiots."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bomb with eye candy","review":"* You would think with stars like Christopher Walken and Johnny Depp that the movie might be fairly good, but not only was it the hokiest conspiracy theory to end all conspiracy theory movies, but it took low blows as to pull on tear jerker heartstrings by putting a cute little girl in mortal peril. The only minor redeeming quality to this movie is Depp's hotness, but then again that can only distract you for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock would have loved filming it","review":"... yes this is in HIS tradition(working against the clock - bizarre mix-ups... - yup - working within a strict disciplin)...Johnny Depp is in his first REAL mainstream role; but fortunately - it is a good 1...

However, there is the option of watching with the original Russian dialogue with English subtitles. The transfer is great, and is presented in its original ratio. Cinematography and colours are lush, and the film hits a brilliant chord of childlike fantasy. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the classic Snow Queen story.","review":"I was very disappointed in this production of the Snow Queen. Considering the time it was produced I can see why all religious elements were deleted from the tale. However these are major features of the story as Andersen wrote it and are essential to the very core of its significance and symbolism. The additions made to the story did little to make up for its loss of deeper meaning. I found them rather silly. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone who has read and loved the original Snow Queen in all its simple elegance.

Of course the warranty ended right when the problems started occurring, and tech support was absolutely awful. Stay away from this unit unless you don't mind buying a new one every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Working (Tried 2 Drives) For An Experienced Person","review":"My opinion of TDK burners are that they are awesome. I bought my own 40x and used it on my Dell. It would not load any type of disc I put into it (all settings/jumpers were correct). I have installed numerous cd drives before, and so I decided to return it and get another 40x burner. Same thing happened (DOA). I upgraded the firmware and software, but no luck still. I returned this second one and got the TDK 48x burner, and it works like a dream! Ran properly from the start. MY ADVICE: Just get the 48x burner and hopefully avoid the bad batch of 40x burners I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of the 80's --Are you Kidding?","review":"At first glance, this compilation deserves a listen to. With rockers like Some Like it Hot, Switching to Glide and the infectious groove of Jeopardy it even appears rather intriguing.However, it is at that very moment when you realize this isn't what you thought is was! Switching to Glide is pared down to a whopping 2:22, which is only about the chorus of the song. Add to this that there are no other rockers here (the title is described as Rock) and the Cd fizzles. Pop-crap like Break My Stride, St. Elmo's Fire, and Love is a Rock, make this a CD of B-sides and wishful thinkers. Certainly not anything close to a \\"Best of\\" label. Maybe 10th or 11th best, but give us the FULL VERSIONS OF THE SONGS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with my iPod","review":"Funny, the other reviewer bought it specifically for their iPod, and had no trouble. I bought this card for the same reason, but it doesn't seem to work with my iPod. WinXP beeps and recognizes that a device was hooked up, but it never fully connects and iTunes just locks up on me. Oddly, I discovered that now my USB1.1 ports seem to be working just fine to download tunes to the iPod which they didn't seem to be working before. This is all probably just my computer or my iPod or lord knows what sort of evil combination of devices. The card does appear to work fine with my other USB1.1 devices plugged through a Belkin 4 port USB2.0 hub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great slice of 70s blues rock","review":"Largely unknown and very difficult to find this album is well worth a listen. As far as I know its the only album the band had ever cut, I'd found the disc in a bin for about a dollar a few years back. I finally listened to the thing a few days ago and what a great surprise. A whole album of great guitar blues-rock with a touch of Memphis and hard rock edges to the songs. It's highly reminiscent of Rory Gallagher, Cream and Grand Funk if the latter had a better musical talent and were from Memphis. On that note the musicianship is a notch or two higher than I'd expected, especially the great guitarist.A real find if you're a fan of great blues-rock or hard-rock from the early 70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the subject","review":"This book is the best of its kind!

Let me just say that one of the things I'll give them credit for is taking a lot of chances with stuff in this movie, many of which succeed, and some fail. Yes, I agree some of the special effects are downright distracting. I really dis-liked the hot-rodded air balloon. But, weigh those annoyances against the absolutely awesome dueling scene between the two woman in ancient Egypt. Buy the DVD just to watch that scene over and over. Nice to have some talented action females, not just poseurs (Charlies Angels, ugh). Also, there is some really decent non-action stuff going on - a kid actor that does a nice job, especially interacting with his captors. Lots of positives with this flic, so don't let some glaring special effect errors ruin having a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Movies in the world!","review":"These are the best movies in the world. \\"The Mummy\\" is touching and thrilling. \\"The Mummy Returns\\" is funny, touching and thrilling too.

I have used Toshiba for many years but never owned a Go Video product before.What made me get this one was the cost and the ability to read DVD+R media, which is doesn't read I must add.

My unit had trouble reading store-bought DVDs after 7 months. There was no response to an on-line service request after 8 days. When I called (after waiting on the phone for 40 minutes) I learned that it would cost more than the purchase price of the unit to repair, since the \\"labor\\" part of the \\"parts and labor\\" warranty had run out. That means the warranty is effectively worthless after 90 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful photographs but poor quality","review":"This tells a history of the U.S. during the late 1700's and early 1800's with an emphasis on events and people that influenced architecture and interior design.The photographs are excellent, however I question the accuracy of the text. A couple paragraphs disagree with known experts without any comment. Some sections repeat themselves word for word. Entire paragraphs are printed twice, which calls into question the writing and editing of the work.Finally, before I had even finished reading the book, it had fallen apart in my hands. So regrettably, what could have been a beautiful volume to display is now a bunch of loose leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off!!","review":"I am extremely upset with my purchase of this book Classic America by Wendell Garrett.

It doesn't make sense that the girls were so concerned with pleasing their unpleaseable mother. The mother turned out to be a huge hypocrit. The love relationship was predictable. I wouldn't have finished if I didn't spend good money on the book and as a punishment I forced myself to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag for the Price","review":"This camcorder bag works perfectly for my Canon XH A1. It's big and roomy and has plenty of storage for extras. It's been my carry-on at the airport a number of times and the shoulder strap is very comfortable. My one qualm and reason for the 4 star rating is that it lacks a solid bottom layer. It would have been a lot nicer if they would have just used some firm plastic for the bottom of this thing, but instead its just fabric and padding. I think if I ever dropped the bag and it landed on concrete, it might cause damage. But that's what I get for buying a soft-case. You just have to be a bit more careful with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not perfect","review":"I've had this bag for about a month now, it does a good job of protecting the camera and equipment, but there are a couple of minor annoyances. First, the carry handle - it is attached to the zippered lid and pulls on the zipper when carrying. A double handle attached to both sides would be better. Second, the plastic snaps - they are a pain to attach/detach compared to velcro - especially the interior strap that holds the camera in place. Third, the bottom - the sides are like armor plated compared to the bottom, which sags when even a light camera is inside. They should put some of that plastic armor thats on either end on the bottom, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality Buy!","review":"Well I just got this bag for my Panasonic ag-dvx100b and it works great! I will say straight away however I have only had this for a few days, but from what I've seen, it works amazingly. The bag's corners are very rigid to protect it from even moderate hits and the material the outside walls are made of seem very durable. The inside is a nice yellow padding felt like fabric with three dividers. two horizontal shorter ones, and a long one that runs the whole length of the bag. The strap is large and very comfortable, spreading the weight of a possibly heavy camera. All in all this bag looks like it will protect your equipment from certain degrees of pain. It is no metal case, so don't sit on it or toss it, yet for what you pay it will give you a very nice sense of security with easy access and comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dating Guide Ever","review":"rather than pulling the dos and don'ts of dating out of nowhere, Tommy Nelson completely and throroughly analyzes the Song Of Solomon and gives a beautiful picture of how God intends relationships to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly an amazing and deep book!","review":"I recently read through Song of Solomon truly paying attention for the first time. It was an incredibly romantic and poetic read. Then I found this book and read through it, only to find that I had missed SO MUCH in Song of Solomon and the meaning behind what was said! This book is amazing, and Tommy Nelson teaches it in plain english and doesn't resort to \\"preacherspeak\\" so many other authors go for. This would make an excellent Bible study for any singles' group interested in talking about proper dating, courtship, marriage, and beyond. This is, by far, the best Christian book I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference to teach with.","review":"I prayed for God to use me for his will.

This is not what Solomon says in his Song; this is what Tommy Nelson interprets Solomon as saying. It is disrespectful and demeaning. Those looking for a sound, Biblically-based interpretation of the Song of Solomon would do well to read Watchman Nee's \\"Song of Songs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you've ever wanted to understand what God truely meant marriage to be, this book my Tommy Nelson is a great start. If you couple reading the book with his podcasts available through iTunes, you can get a great bible study for singles, those recently engaged, or newly married persons. This book gives a great perspective on Godly marriages and has some very similar themes as books from Eric and Leslie Ludy. Purchase it today and you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-read\\" for all ages","review":"This book gives an incredibly insightful view into how a relationship should work;starting with the all but forgotten ideals of courtship & takes the reader up to and past actual marriage ~I would recommend this book for young teens to grown adults!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Daneille (non celiac that cooks for 3 celiacs)","review":"I ordered the ener g brand because that is the brand of bread we had a Disney and the kids (and one adult celiac) were very excited about everything they had there. These brownies do not measure up to the bread that ener g makes. I've never met a brownie I didn't like but I couldn't eat it (even with ice cream). The clear sign was when I had to throw some away.

The brush head died.In the mean time, I picked up a BISSELL lift-off upright from Costco for $150 (BRAND NEW) to try while trying to figure out what to do with the Oxygen (maybe get repaired). I used the Oxygen on thursday before it died and used the BISSELL 3 days later on SUNDAY. I picked up 8 cups FULL of dirt, dust, and junk with this NEW vacuum AND I don't even own any pets!!!!!!

I took it to an Electrolux repair shop and it would cost about $150 for a whole new, hose and wands etc. Poor design, it had a loose wire or connection. So, these refurbs not such good deal, and the new model I understand is not much better. Guess I am buying a new vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still an Electrolux, though not my favorite","review":"This, as with all Electrolux products I have owned, is still a solid performer in the vacuum arena. Stylistically, the unit is attractive and is very functional. There's a solid feel to each of the pieces, though the \\"on board\\" storage of brushes is somewhat awkward. One feature I particularly like is the ease of access to the suction strength control on the handle and for the dual split in the extension tube--it's very nice (and easy!) to remove the length of tube you need for the accessory you're using. As with all Electrolux items, the replacement accessories (bags, filters, etc.) are expensive! But, thank goodness for Amazon and free shipping on orders over $25. Overall, if you're old-school (like me) and prefer a canister vacuum to an upright, you should have no trouble liking this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware of the warranty!!","review":"The vacuum has good suction but it was refurbished and had some minor problems. I took it to authorized dealer and they said it won't cover by warranty because the warranty time is ALMOST over. Huh? I thought 1 year means 1 year not a week less!!!

Could it be that Ms.Bennerstrom has wrapped her glorious vision of the world in seductive shapes and colors so that we'll come inside and experience it with her?This book is just as inviting as Bennerstrom's paintings and contains rare insight into her work. For example, I would not have guessed at Bennerstrom's influences--Italian painters of the 20's and 30's. The writers of this book have made me curious them, too.It is rare to be given a perspective on a painter who is in the midst of producing her best work. Hopefully, there will be future editions of this book that will keep up updated on Ms. Bennerstrom's world view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"The cover states that there are forwards written by Dick Brannan, Arnie Beswick and Hayden Proffitt. My copy contained no forwards of any kind. Actual facts and research are words that can only be used loosely to describe this book. Most of it reads like a compilation of material pulled together from previously published sources, and written poorly. I was anticipating this book, but once I knew who the authors were (read some reviews on their other titles), my expectations were lowered accordingly.

We both enjoyed it. Very nice. Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Mistakes","review":"Extreme has become an overused word. These cars were not the norm, but they were available from certain dealers. Agreed; no forewords in the book. What really bothers me is the numerous grammatical errors and misspellings. Here's an example: 'the block was bored to .30'. I'm sure it means 0.030 over, but bothersome to me. This makes me suspect the other \\"facts and figures\\" in the text. Obviously the proof reader was absent that day. They even misspelled one driver's name when the proper spelling is very clearly seen on the car door in the picture. I expect better. I do give it good marks for the pictures; many, clear and interesting. Money better spent elsewhere.Update 1-12-08:Factory Lightweights is a much better book, it's available right here at Amazon and is the better value within the same category of cars/ interest. You can tell more research and author excitement went into this publication. I recommend it over this particular book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"This atlas is an invaluable resource for any serious study of the bible. Care in incorporating the latest scholarship along with large full color topographical maps, chronological charts and brilliant pictures bring the geography and historicity of bible to life. If you thought atlases were just about maps, you are mistaken. 3D cutout of battlefield terrain, satellite maps, breathtaking aerial photographs, archeological schematics and artist renditions of cities all add valuable visual input and vastly enhances the geographical perspective in the study of the bible.

I love rags to riches stories to this day. I think at this point I'm more like the Fairy Godmother than Cinderella.

Following in the footsteps of 'Everything or Nothing' this title allows you enter the world of James Bond as the original Bond, Sean Connery.The graphics, gameplay and overall feel of 'From Russia With Love' is very similar to it's predecessor but with that classic touch and feel to it. The game is not overly challenging or difficult but it's pure 007 fun. The sound and music are also top notch as well. If you enjoyed 'Everything or Nothing' and are a Bond fan, this is a game that's not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"sean connery as..........007","review":"wow sean connery in a video game how much better could it be his moviesgreat and so is his game. it is the first 007 game that you can have nore controll over your person you can buy weapons clothes and upgradesas shown in the movie.another thing about this game that makes it better than any other 007 game is that there are a bigger selection of weaponsand the aming is great allong with the controller configuration. the only disadvantage to this game is thatyou can not drive as many cars and the levels are some what harder witch i guess that can be a good thing if you like difficult games.so my word to you is if you like the previous 007 games you will like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written at a basic level","review":"While the book did a good job introducing basic economic principles, the writing was reminiscent of a young adult fiction novel. The mystery is intriguing, but is overshadowed by the simple writing style. This would be a perfect book for freshman in High School, but if you're looking for a serious novel with an economic aspect, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous way to learn economics","review":"I know of no more enjoyable way of learning sound economics than by reading Marshall Jevons's murder mysteries. Jevons's deep understanding of economics is evident throughout, and his ability to weave economics into engaging plots is stunning. Read these books and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mystery, good economics","review":"This is a good mystery with a very creative plot. In addition, the characters are intriguing and fun to read about. There are great subtle touches, such as the way one hotel guest examines his bacon. (Yes, I know that sounds strange, but if you read the book you will understand)It was the authors first effort, and being such it is not quite as good as the following two books, which I would rate at 4 1/2 and 5 stars. Still, it is a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a pleasure!","review":"Origa never fails to impress. Having heard some of her more recent albums, I didn't give this album the full 5 stars because I get more impressed with her music with each new album. That being said, this album provides an excellent blend of pop and classically inspired meditative tunes, often starting slow and soft to build with strong, impressive endings. Her sonic/soaring vocals and perfectly balanced/blended harmonies are pure joy to experience. The production values are always excellent and never disappoint.I highly recommend it for those who appreciate a great musical experience, even if you don't understand Russian (like me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"seiko watch","review":"The watch was sent very quickly, and performs as advertised, very nice style.

We are told that she was a private person and she must have been because most of the info seems to be from public records. I myself would have liked to have had more insight on how the lives of Pa, Ma and her sisters were in later life instead of so much talk about Lauras daughter Rose. Halfway through the book I felt the story began to center on Rose and her dislike of her mother. If you are looking for a book about Laura Ingalls Wilder I do not know if you will like this, there are better ones out there. When I was done reading the only thing I got out of the book was that Rose Wilder was a depressed woman who disliked her mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful, in-depth look at my idol","review":"This book contains almost TOO MUCH information about the famous Laura. Many myths and legends about her and what kind of person and writer she was are dispelled by this book. I found it fascinating, but almost TOO in-depth. Every little bit of info about the writing of her Little House Series is squeezed out and put into this book. The book is extremely detailed about the entire process of writing and editing the books, and how Rose and Laura worked together on them. You can even see some pages before and after Rose edited them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, yet flawed biography","review":"I enjoyed this, but like others, was aching to read more about Laura and Almanzo.

You learn she was a private person and she must have been because most of the information about her life seems to be from records of what organizations she belonged to. I did not like the way that the book seemed to turn into a bio about her daughter Rose Wilder Lane about halfway through. Not only did the author talk more about her than Laura he painted a picture in my opinion of a depressed unhappy woman who did not really care for her mother deep down. I also felt that since most of us \\"know\\" Lauras' family from the Little House books the author could have given the readers some more detailed information about how their lives turned out. That would have interested me more then hearing about Roses' depressed and seemingly unhappy life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full-blooded","review":"I read this collection of \\"Big Bend\\" lore (relating to TransPecos Texas south of the first rail line, roughly south of the Davis Mtns) during a recent visit to the region, and was able to pick up on a lot of the cultural elements of this fascinating country. The publishing date (1955) gives it a peculiar added interest, namely that of a snapshot of west Texas at the outset of the \\"civil rights\\" era; Ms. Madison, like most intelligent white Southerners (yes, Texas was a \\"Southern state\\" at that time), varied between cultural liberality and defensiveness, a \\"we have problems, but we can solve them ourselves\\" sort of thing.

The Spanish version is the first cut and the English version (singing in English is a rarity for Gabriel) is the last cut. A cross-over artist he is not, but Gabriel's English version is so sweetly sung that you can't help but love it. If you're not looking for wild and fast music like the \\"Hasta que te conoci\\" medley in Gabriel's 1990 Bellas Artes CD and videos, you'll find that this CD rates among his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music To Lose Yourself In","review":"I find myself popping this one in my car's CD player more times than I can recall.

But it is a world class stinker.There is nothing that would make me suggest anyone watch this. It is clumsy, silly, and tedious. Brendan Fraser is supposed to be wooden--casting coup--but he is more than that, he is patently ridiculous. Absurdity piles up on ludicrousness until the ending, where you just say \\"What the ****?\\"The Reflecting Skin was not a great film, but was almost interesting.

I recommend that you pick up some of Chris Lynch's other works, which prove to be much more enjoyable reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading and viewing","review":"I love John Prentiss Benson's work, and learning more about his wonderful life and background and having the color images to leisurely view is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning to the Uninitiated","review":"This book should not be used for dydactic purposes. As I have stated empathically for the second edition, this book (now even in revision) fails to teach. Though the book presents an admirable breadth of topics, it should not be considered a classic. The author frequently omits vital steps, and there are simply too few examples. Unless the reader has previously been exposed to the material, reading and understanding is a torturously onerous task and a waste of time.The problems are usually challenging but occasionally a bit tedious. It seems to me that the use of Jackson as a standard text book is a bit akin to the use of wooden paddles in fraternity ceremonies. The professors got wacked and so must the next generation of uninitiates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic but difficult and impenetrable treatment of E&M","review":"Jackson's text is widely considered a classic in the field,but it's not intended for the first-time student ofclassical electromagnetism. Instead, one must approach witha firm physical and mathematical grasp of Maxwell'sequations. Then Jackson becomes an indispensable referenceas it covers almost every significant classical topic,albeit only in a cursory survey. Read Jackson to getadditional insight after you know the stuff; he definitelyhas things to teach you, if you're capable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Third Edition is Disappointing","review":"Will the fourth edition be clearer? Jackson remains a standard text but not a good one. The only improvement in the third edition is that Jackson has finally conceeded and uses S.I. notation at least for several chapters. More examples would be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"As the other reviewer had seen, this thing does not skim very well. Same micro bubbles, same over flowing, same raising out of the water as much as possible. I would set a good height that seemed it would make some good skimmate, to return later to find it overflowing. I did find out that the black knob at the top of the cup is a drain for the cup, but I have not seen if it keeps in skimmate or fixes the problem. The only redeeming quality of this skimmer is that it does come with a small powerhead, so it isn't a total loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but...","review":"I was excited to try out this skimmer for my 10g nano reef. It seemed to work fine for a few days, but in less than a week it was both constantly throwing micro bubbles inside my tank and the cup was constantly overflowing. I eventually had the skimmer part as far out of the water as I possibly could, nearly 3 inches above the 'suggested water level' and still the cup would overflow within two hours. Adding extra filter floss helped stop the micro bubbles but also caused mad overflow from the cup. Having had it for a month I have yet to have it do any real skimming and it is now in a box under my tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as intended.","review":"Its a simple Tube thermometer, with a little grill over the bubble.

I proceeded to calibrate them with ice water - not that difficult. Not even a full 24 hours later, they were both reading. They also did not come with correct size screws for installation. Basically, this product is an utter waste of money. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"I bought two of these thermometers and they show different temperatures by several degrees. The tube in which the indicator fluid is can be moved up and down relative to the scale printed on the thermometer, so you can make it show any temperature you like.On the plus side, the scale is clearly printed and easily readable, not that it matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"this doesn't work - don't bother with it","review":"I bought this thermometer recently. It doesn't show above 68 (even when in the 80s) and below 60. Have tried everything and nothing gets it to show correct temperature. Also, difficult to read. 3 times bigger than my little thermometer of >20 years that broke and yet harder to read. Cost more to buy a padded envelope to return it than the cost of the thermometer (it came in an envelope not a box). Also, as per other reviews the screw that come with it to hang it up is too big - after all this time you think they'd fix that problem also. Not worth the money - not worth being given free (in my opinion). It just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless hanger","review":"I picked this for the price and size but the hanger on the back is too small for the screw provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"inexpensive but good, works well, only difficult to handle if you want it to move from spot to spot, because is to rounded and difficult to grab.

Opened the package and found the screw came with it is too big and the hole on the back of the thermometer is way too small to match in there. I had to find my own screws to hang them on the way.Cheap product and certainly you got what you pay for. Just hope it will actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The screw mount does not work","review":"There is a supposedly removable tab on the back to then screw to a wall and then mount the thermometer. The tab did not come out on mine and I had to cut it \\"jerry rig\\" to make the mount work. The thermometer probably works fine, but I recommend going with a different model unless you have your own nails or screws to mount with smaller heads because the one they provide is too big when the tab does not come off like expected and probably designed. I know, that was a run on sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought 3 of these earlier this week. All 3 broke when I tried getting the wall mount plate off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good deal, but doesn't mount properly","review":"It's nice and cheap. Unfortunately it is unclear how to mount the thing to the wall. There is a hole to put the screw through, but the little plastic mounting bracket refuses to detach from the thermometer, making it impossible to actually screw in."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't move","review":"Regardless of real temperature, it doesn't move much. Most of the time, it stays around 60 ~ 65 degrees. Eventually, I bought a digital one which is more accurate and sensitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"I ordered two of these. They display a one degree F difference between them and are one and two degrees F above my more expensive thermometers. I can't swear to the accuracy of any of them. I picked one to mount over an A/C vent to monitor my A/C efficiency. I put the other on my shop wall. The mounting was easy and quick. You must pry off a little part with a hole in it and screw it to the wall with the enclosed screw. Then fit the thermometer back onto it. For the price, they are a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for indoor use","review":"This thermometer is simple, inexpensive and lightweight. The problem is that the tube is held by two rubber rings and can slide freely if you push it a little bit by accident or if [big] kids play with it.The temperature given by my thermometer is now uncertain by something like 2F or 1C which is not good enough for measuring indoor temperature for most purposes.I would not recommend this item for indoor use. I guess it can be OK as an outdoor thermometer to get an idea of how bad the weather is, or if you own a reliable thermometer that you can use for recalibrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tells temperature, wall mount doesn't work","review":"This thermometer comes with a screw to mount it, but the plastic mount that the screw is meant to go into was stuck in the thermometer. When I tried to pull it out with a pair of pliers, it snapped in half. The plastic on this thing is kinda cheap, for for $2, it's hard to complain about it too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative, Brillant and Controversial","review":"Prof Terry Tucker, Senior Doctrine Developer, Saudi Arabian NG Modernization Program;The author presents a balanced, provocative and well presented case for how victory or defeat occurs in battle.

Either way it has immense value.The thesis of this book is that force employment, or the doctrine and tactics by which forces are used in combat is centrally important.

It is well balanced and worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Navajo history, at last!","review":"A coherent, cogent and lengthy history of the Navajos was much needed. Well worth purchasing and reading. The average American does not know much about our native peoples unfortunately.

No other word can adequately describe this movie. John Cusack and Tim Robbins have excellent chemistry as two best friends. The handshake is enough to make you want to watch this movie. The one-liners in this movie are classic. Perfect example: The fellas ask for another drink, and the bartender says, \\"Brothers Against Drunk Driving have been busting my a**. So you need to have a sobriety test.\\" The fellas say, \\"Ok, ok what is it?\\" Bartender says, \\"Say the alphabet backwards, skipping all the vowels, and give me the sign language version for each letter as you go past.\\" The fellas just whip through it like they do that every day.

Too bad, it's entertaining, immensely likeable, and even kind of inspiring, (Cusack's character is brimming with confidence and a warm sense of positivity). Lots of genuinely funny moments, a terrific soundtrack, and great chemistry between the cast members make 'TAPEHEADS' worth a look for those who prefer their comedy offbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a good movie. I'm sorry.","review":"I love John Cusack. I like Tim Robbins. Mike Nesmith and Jello Biafra are just short of deity status. And the soundtrack includes the Dead Kennedys, Fishbone, and They Might Be Giants (the greatest band of all time). This HAD to be a good movie. But it wasn't. It was very pretentious, Cusack's character really wasn't his type, and story was just plain dumb. I laughed at parts (hence the second star) and I wanted to like this movie desperately, but I couldn't. I'm sorry. A lot of people like this movie, enough to raise it to \\"cult\\" status, but apparently I'm not enlightened enough to get it.

In reading this book so far, Leo Levitt seems jealous of Mark Fuhrman's investigation and writing ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"big ego and not enough information","review":"I agree with Alison--this is an ego book. Mr. Levitt's book seems to be an afterthought. It focuses mostly on himself along with a few personal vendettas he seems to need to air. His attempt at a tribute to Frank Garr is apparent but perhaps he should have written a biographical account of Mr. Garr's pursuit of this case. Instead, he jumps back and forth between what he learns, his own life, what Garr learns, and their friendship--throwing in lots of irrelevant information about other subjects. There are so many facts missing about the case itself that the book was just plain boring. Since the case has been extensively written about at least Levitt could have given a real report on the trial itself--but he didn't take this opportunity to do so. Give me Mark Fuhrman or Domenick Dunne (two Levitt takes digs at) anyday over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conviction","review":"One of the three suspects was convicted in 2004.

Thus chapters 3-end of the book are not worth reading. This is a shame,because the topic of judgment by God is so important. The US is now a post Christian country and no longerdeserves to be blessed by God. If we're not blessed, what remains is curses. All that can save us is God, andthus Christians need to pray and repent for the sins of the US.The author says that times of prosperity precede God's judgment, and that the prosperity is given so the people will repent. I don't agree. Prosperity will lull us into enjoying the good times, followed by greed andseeking power. Look at the book of Revelation and notice the God brings judgment so people will be led to repent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does he fail to mention Christ's role?","review":"Wilkerson refers mainly from the Old Testament. He holds up Christ as a prophet. When someone speaks about God's judgment it matters greatly where they speak from. Wilkerson claims to know God's voice. He says that God is going to purge America, because God's holiness demands it.Wilkerson has not represented Christ as God's only Son and our Lord who was crucified, died, was buried, arose again from the dead on the third day, and shall come to judge the living and the dead. Wilkerson has chosen to speak about God's judgment and he has chosen not to acknowledge Christ's role.

How absolute the knaves. Bill Murray is the only thing happening in this fiasco, of little their is to see of him. Where are the clever, non-scatological writers in Hollywood?

A former bowling champ ends up a haplessly hook-handed (and bald) bowling manager for an innocent Amish man, who has a powerful swing. Blood relative of DUMB AND DUMBER (with the same two pinhead directors) has a lot going for it, some outrageous gags and laugh-out-loud punch lines, others just plain disgusting.

Woody Harrelson is such a lovable and wonderful actor and Bill Murray is one of the funniest guys around. Kingpin is a vulgar slapstic comedy that should make anyone with a pulse laugh until they ache. This film also has a heart.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the plot, the humor, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!In short, Kingpin is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much funnier than Mary","review":"How does anyone dare compare a flick with Bill Murray in it to \\"Something About Mary?\\" Whether you love bowling or hate it, this is a great movie, in which Murray does a great job of playing the egomaniac bowling star (is there even such thing as a bowling star in real life?) Overstepping all bounds of decency, this film flies in the face of all stiff-uperlipped PC viewers, and appeals to those who just like to sit back with a beer and a bowl of popcorn and laugh. A little slow in some portions, but worth the wait, especially to watch Harrelson drink \\"milk\\" from a bull, and Murray's toupee slowly peel off his head in tournament.

But when I saw \\"Kingpin\\", I even considered trying \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" again to give these wonderful men another chance. \\"Kingpin\\" is very similar to the pair's other movies in that there is indeed some disgusting humor, but unlike other efforts such as \\"There's Something About Mary\\", there is an actual story here, with a plot, character development, and even a fair amount of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Funny","review":"This one will be played millions of times down the road and joins the ranks of the classic comedies - Animal House, MASH, Blazing Saddles, Caddyshack.Great movie, laugh out loud riot, and won't catch all the jokes first time through.

Although, it was a good copy, it was a homemade DVD probably dled off the Internet. The case, was flimsy and the actual DVD was plain silver, without the title o the movie on it. The picture was perfect clear, and it was an excellent copy, however not worth the price of a new, original DVD, as was stated when I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay No Attention to The Review At The Top Of This Page!","review":"Tom Keogh slams the movie. What the heck is that all about? This is truly one of my favorite comedies of all time. I have watched this movie probably 30-40 times and I still find it enjoyable. You don't feel like you are watching the movie. The performances, storyline, and perfect soundtrack make you feel as if you are in it. It's true. There is some dumb slapstick humor. At the same time, you start feeling sorry for the characters. As soon as you think they have hit rock bottom, they fall further into the well. I won't spoil the ending. Just give this one a chance and prepare for some good old fashioned \\"Brunswick\\" fun. Disco Bowling? That's a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than these folks think","review":"I'm a highbrow type guy, really. My favorite film is \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" This movie is stupid and very simple and very, very funny. I didn't like \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" at all, but I laughed and cried and had a great time watching \\"Kingpin.\\"I firmly believe the intellectual deconstruction of cinema is rewarding, it leads to the combination of new ideas, indeed a new vocabulary. The elements of really fine films have invented this vocabulary of visual thinking. . . but hey this ain't no art film, so what the heck am I taking about. Watch, enjoy, you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny with a Captiol F","review":"I have seen the future of Film. It's name is Kingpin. It is not a movie where one debates the essence of comedy while drinking wine and eating brea cheese. Ernie McCracken, as played by Bill Murray steals the movie. Woody Harrelson, as Roy Munson & Randy Quaid, as the naive Amish boy, are entirely successful. If you want sublte nuance your barking up the wrong movie. If you want a movie where beer comes out of your nose, welcome aboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to give it one Star - That is as low as they go!","review":"There is only one reason to watch this movie. And that is for Bill Murray's performance. Horrible story line, with an ex-champion bowler (Woody H.) who loses his hand because he con'd some high rollers in a bowling game.Now 17 years later he is a boozed out, washed up bum. Murray is wonderful in his part as a slick, fancy talking bowler. I can't believe I watched the whole thing. There should be a minus rating on this one. Do the dishes instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointlessly gross","review":"As Monty Python suggested, \\"eating a lump of freezing cold poison\\" would be more pleasant than watching this film.

Bill Murray was the only enteraining part inthe movie, but this trash pummels at every aspect until it reaches the status of one of the worst movies ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I ordered from this person because other reviewers had given this seller a good rating. I haven't really bought anything on ebay before so I had no point of reference except for those reviews. I received the package much later than the person said they would send it. It wasn't a huge deal since it was a Christmas gift that I ordered in early November - I still got it in plenty of time for the holiday thanks to my planning, not the seller's. The description said the dvd was \\"like new\\". I suppose that's right if you consider \\"like new\\" things to look like they've been run over by a truck and have other people's names written on them in permanent marker!

But, this one is so bad it makes me want to cry not laugh. they make fun of a religion they know nothing about. I am Amish and was deeply offended by what they thought was funny. I am warning you, don't see this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the two worst movies I have ever seen","review":"This movie is not only bad, it will make you feel like taking a shower after watching it.Let me first say that I think that most comedy like South Park, George Carlin, Monty Python and the like are great -- I'm not easily grossed out or offended, but this movie was staggeringly bad. Awful writing, unforgettable (in the worst sense of the word) lower than bathroom humor, and just a mean, depressing, completely unredeemable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie of all Time!","review":"\\"Kingpin\\" showcases some truly disgusting humour as well as some flat, 1-dimensional characters stereotyped with personalities. The actors--even without such an immmature, grotesque script--are utterly terrible in their roles. Woody Harrelson unsuccesfully portrays a bowling-trainer who lost his arm due to an assault by bowlers whose money he had not inadvertently won in an unfair manner. After I saw approximately 50% of this low-brow motion picture, I left the theater in utter disgust. NEVER SCRUTINIZE THIS UNINTELLECTUAL MOTION PICTURE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting movie.it grossed me out","review":"there are just so many nasty parts in this movie.if they would of left those out,i would have liked this movie.like when woody harrelson threw up.and when randy quaid was flossing and chunks of food flew everywhere and all over the mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Murray IS Charles Nelson Reilly","review":"Bill Murray as Ernie McCracken copped his look from Charles Nelson Reilly from 1970s era Match Game shows. Check out Match Game reruns on the Game Show Network and marvel at the pure creepiness of CNR. My only reservation about Kingpin is the whole Amish angle with Randy Quaid - it detracts from the perfectly depicted rivalry of the sad sack versus the slimeball."},{"rating":"2","title":"The controversy rages on; but I'm in love with it","review":"The very fact that nearly every review here is either five stars or one star says it all. I don't really understand how a film as sweet and funny as Kingpin could turn people off as much as it has- although I can understand the humor being a bit too gross for some folks (although even the negative reviewers here say they usually enjoy gross humor). Nevertheless, I'm proud to be one of the chosen who can love it like an angelic, ugly child, and I offer no excuses or apologies for my taste. I recommend that everyone try it out. If you aren't into it after the first fifteen or twenty minutes, turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, great big guilty pleasure!","review":"This film is funnier that \\"Something About Mary,\\" I'm sorry. But it's true. Woody is the perfect Farrelly hero (he's repulsive, yet charming in this film). And Murray is one of the all time great comic villians here. Has there ever been anyone worse than him in a movie. The film also has my favorite condom joke of all time- \\"Glow-in-the-dark condoms: I mean those things are fun even when you're by yourself.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"From the makers of Dumb and Dumber comes another work of art","review":"This movie had me cracking up from begining to end. It's is crude and disgusting but it is absolutely hilarious. The team behind Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary two really stupid, gross-out films that worked and were quite funny also made this really stupid, gross-out comedy that is just as successful in getting laughs. Woody Harrelson stars as a former bowling phenomenon with a hook for a hand, and Randy Quaid is an Amish farmer with a hidden talent for pins. The two join forces and get a sexy business partner, and the film starts looking more and more like a jokey variation of The Color of Money. Bill Murray provides some much-needed relief as Harrelson's ex-partner turned rival. Now I don't know why the critic for Amazon.com didn't like this, but let me tell you, if you liked Dumb and Dumber, then you'll definetly love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guys you hate to love","review":"Both Bill Murray and Woody Harrelsen are guys I hate to love but they were cast perfectly in this. The flopping comb-overs, slapstick and unlikeable but you can't help but feel sorry for them and also they somehow are likable, there's no reason that this works except for the genius Farrelly brothers. I was entranced by this low-brow ... disco-bowling flick andlaughed my way through it - several times. It's good through and through to the end. GREAT sound track. Again, sheer genius and the casting couldn't have been more fitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine comedy","review":"Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) is a former state bowling champion whose hand was destroyed by gamblers. Years later, broke and down on his luck, he gets a second chance when he meets an Amish bowling whiz named Ishmael (Randy Quaid). The two head for a million-dollar bowling tournament in Reno. Bill Murray is excellent in a small role as Munson's nemesis.The Farrelly brothers are quite good at making raunchy, disgusting films with characters that we can still care about. This film also boasts an excellent soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Ern rules ......","review":"Woody Harrelson plays a one-handed former bowling champion trying to con an Amish boy (35+ Randy Quaid) into becoming a pro bowler. Vanessa Angel and Bill Murray's (Big Ern) performance are one of the films best attributes. But Roger Clemens guest cameo as \\"Skidmark\\" is one that could (and should) be forgotten, just like his waistline.Love the land-lady too, she has become quite a memorable character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crude but Screamingly Funny","review":"While I don't ordinarily like scatological humor, Kingpin is one funny movie. Harrelson and Quaid prove their worth as comedians in their roles as a tacky small time bowler and an Amish \\"clean as a whistle\\" farmer who just happen, through circumstances totally beyond belief but which are somehow believable in the movie, to find themselves in one another's company. The results are wonderfully funny in a crude sort of way. Bill Murray is in his sleaziest role yet, and be sure to watch his hair, particularly at the end. This is one is a classic in its own way, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still hits the spot","review":"I bought this album when it was first released. After playing it continuously for months it was locked in my heart. The freshness, the soul, the tastes from so many different genres - music and literary. It got me thinking and feeling. I enjoyed everything else by Scritti after that but STR was my first love. Today I nervously relistened to it and it moved me again. There is no '80s' embarrassment. I have got to have it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went way past me.","review":"I am only a physical scientist and not an expert on literature so I am not afraid to say that I found this book entirely unrewarding. I would really like to know where the supposed hilarity was in this book that at least one reviewer referred to.I read this book prior to a trip to Iceland, in part on the great reviews. The irony is that while on the trip I met a woman who read the book based on the same reviews I read and likewise found it immensely disappointing. My son gave it a go and couldn't finish it, saying that it seemed to him like an Icelandic version of Fargo. So if you are not particularly erudite, amused by quirky characters, and drawn in by quasi-surrealism, you might read the Amazon reviews with a bit of skepticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gack!","review":"After enjoying Independent People, I picked this up and...dang...the bizarre, peculiar fable lost me completely. I nearly didn't read another Laxness book, which would have been a shame, since Iceland's Bell, for example, is a total charmer. Try his other books first, the ones that earn him a place alongside Marquez and Dickens, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps better in Icelandic...","review":"Even though I was intrigued by a review of this book in my local newspaper, and even though I often buy books, I checked this one out of the library. I'm glad I did. It may be \\"one of the funniest books ever written\\" in Icelandic, and I can only suppose that Susan Sontag, who reviewed it, reads this language fluently. How else to explain the discrepancy between the English translation, which is clumsy, full of archaic words, and often muddled, and the praise heaped upon the novel? Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"if you already own their self titled album released by solid state records than this album basically the same with \\"a little sugar on top\\" (sorry about the bad analogy.) anway, love herren shows a small humorous side to blindside, it sounds like it might be a cover of some swedish hymn maybe. blindside is one of the premiere hardcore bands, Christian or not. the lyrics on this album are very deep and very insightful, i recommend this cd to anyone who like hardcore. especially korn, deftones, or selfmindead."},{"rating":"2","title":"more great grooves from ESL","review":"Although several of these tracks have been available on vinyl for quite some time, this disc flows well. Following in the tradition of the earlier 18th street lounge complications, modular systems is put together like a night out at the club. Opening with sophisticated continental sounds, and sliding into heavier beats as the evening wears on... sit back and enjoy, until it's time to go buy the next ESL release, which is the debut CD from Nicola Conte coming soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming UK/Celtic folk songs","review":"Coal mining is a subject that holds a continuing fascination for UK folkies, both as folklore and as a topic fit for all upstanding class-conscious lefties. (The Thatcher-era miner's strike was one of the last great British labor struggles of the 20th Century... Scotland's gruff-voiced Dick Gaughan, who contributes several excellent performances to this disc, revisited the miner's plight on a couple of albums that came out in the mid-1980s.) At any rate, this is a fine album, featuring an celebrated Northumbrian ensemble anchored by Alastair Anderson on concertina, along with Johnny Handle, Colin Ross and Tommy Gilfellon. Gaughan sings on a couple of songs and Lancashire's Harry Boardman on a couple others -- the whole album is nice, with goofy, sprightly, humorous songs and lots of that oddball Celtic musical charm. I thought this record would sound really dry and academic, but was pleasantly surprised at how fun it was. Definitely worth checking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Railroads: The Great American Adventure - Hardcover","review":"I was very impressed with transaction. Book was exactly as described.

Although quick, it does lack in content and depth. I'm disappointed that the scriptural references are so few under each entry, and I'm disappointed that some entries are not as extensive as one might think (take \\"blood\\" for example). Some individuals may see this advantageous however. The brief explanations given are very poignant and refreshing to read because of their simplicity and short length.My core complaint, however, is the lack of scriptural index. With thousands of verses referenced, a scriptural index would be inestimable. On the good side, it is a cheap book, and quite handsome. I recommend it for those beginning a study of biblical typology (because it is easy to follow and simple to read). Another up-side to the book is that it is arranged in alphabetical order.Two stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old and New","review":"I actually own these albums as separate entities. Nada Personal may seem dated in its approach -- heavy, rhythmy guitar w/standard 4-beat drums -- but most songs hold up well including the title track and the reggae-ish \\"Cuando Pase El Temblor.\\" Canci��n Animal is better (perhaps b/c it's newer). \\"En El S��ptimo D��a\\" is an odd time signature absolute JAM -- easily one of Soda's best ever. \\"Hombre Al Agua\\" features a pounding bass background line accented by Gustavo Cerati's phenomenal guitar. \\"T�� Para 3\\" is pure Cerati poetry at its finest -- a simple, relaxing ballad."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I bought these chips thinking that I had found a bargain, but it turns out that they are lower quality than many other chips that I've played with.

The photographs in this volume remind me of the kind of guns most law enforcement officers carried when I started police work. In fact, my first duty gun(Colt 38 police special)was one of the models in this book. Off duty I used to carry a Colt 38 Detective special. Most officers today use and carry semi-autos, but the author does not explore this topic in this volume. Some of the chapters in this book are: Adapting your gun, weapons for concealment, personal defense weapons, service weapons, guns for combat practice, fun guns, holsters, quick draw, and the psychology of gun fighting. In conclusion, this book is interesting because of its historical value.Rating: 3 stars. Joseph J.

If that was my home, I'd be running as fast as I could to get anywhere else. The prose is nice, but not for a young child.

Zoo Story(his first), an amateurish two-man drama, where one is a raving psycho and the other is a man drawn in and then repulsed. That would get only a star. \\"Death of Bessie Smith\\" is a message play, where racism is just oozing from most characters. It critizes, and it is ugly, but yet..feels so empty. Perhaps it is because Bessie never speaks for herself, only her paramour does pre-accident. Finally, \\"The Sandbox\\", which is the only good play in the book. It's about death, and our fear of it.

If the church's debt to modernism is so bad, why buy into postmodernism in such a wholesale fashion? What is really unexamined in the book is a theology of relating to the world. Rather than capitulating to the latest trends, shouldn't we be a bit more discerning and affirm some things whilst rejecting others?

So much for doing research ...... Yes, Mortal Kombat has females, even as far back as the first game with Sonja Blade. In fact some narrow-minded people objected to her at the time as she could kill or be killed. Street Fighter II which started this whole genre of games had a female player character and almost every game after it has had one or more. Recently released \\"Dead or Alive\\" features three females on the cover -- just the girls, none of the guys. Next time, check the facts.

There was nothing wrong with Stephen, or Laura, for that matter, but the story was dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME","review":"I have found this author to be hit or miss and this one was a definite MISS. I spent .25 on it at a used book sale and feel that was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ennui","review":"This novel seems to be an homage to Georgette Heyer's wonderful novel Sylvester or the Wicked Uncle which features a novel with an uncle trying to kill or banish the true heir to the estate.I generally enjoy Jo Beverly's work, but this dragged. The characters are poorly drawn, they jump to illogical conclusions and they spend far too much time thinking about themselves. It was, however, a great cure for insomnia.Do yourself a favor and read Heyer's Sylvester instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond disappointing","review":"One gets the impression that the author was being pushed to finish this novel. It lacks the attention to detail shown in her other Rogue books. I found Laura's obsession with sex, or lack of, repetitive and boring. This book was like eating chocolate chip cookies without any chocolate chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Reading","review":"I have read all of the previous Rogue books, and thoroughly enjoyed them. I kept wondering as I was reading if it was the same author, because this book was boring, and just plain tedioius. I thought the plot was really kind of dumb and there was really little romance. I would definitely not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skylarking-2 1/2 stars","review":"This book was not worth the wait for fans of the Company of Roques. The mystery and romance are slow moving, the conclusion anti-climac. Also unlike the other Roque books the other members of the club are hardly seen and have little to do with solving the mystery.The book is not a total waste since Jo Beverley creates some likeable characters. I enjoyed the philosophical debates between Stephen and Laura. I liked the inclusion of Harry in parts of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Boring doesn't begin to describe this book. I wanted to stick with it in deference to this wonderful author, but I found it impossible to do so, it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"I am a big Jo Beverley fan but this is her very worst book. She gets too involved in the sub plot and the romance is very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad...","review":"This story went round and round with dialogue on several pages of the same conversation.

I was like, get to the point of it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of contradiction and inaccuracy","review":"If you're looking for a feel-good book full of some guy's rambling statements about god and spirituality, this is the book for you. However if you actually care about the validity of the statements in the book I would recommend you look elsewhere. The book is full of armchair philosophy, and scientific \\"proof\\" that is hardly empirical. The funniest part of the whole thing is that the guy says several times that you can't try to reason your way into faith... and then he tries to give you reasons to believe... gave me quite the chuckle. I don't recommend this book for any serious reader. (It was given to me as a gift by my pastor... I'm trying to find out if it was supposed to be a joke)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very inspiring","review":"I was given this book by my ladies in my book club group who are mostly Catholic, in the hopes they could sway my atheism. I gave it a good try, however the book has left me even more convinced that there is no God.The author misquotes Carl Sagan, not to mention that much of his science is incorrect an misrepresented.Science does not want to disprove the existence of god it simply wants to explain the nature of our world and universe. Science will hopefully continue to work to unravel the mysteries of nature and if religion would just allow scientists to do their work we can move closer to a better understanding of ourselves.It seems to me that when I see these books their tendency is to attack science as an enemy to religion, when religion is really the enemy to science. Science, it seems to me, has no interest in the existence of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect accent to a strong faith","review":"When reading this book one should not expect to have proof of the existence of god for if any person could prove the existence of god the values of faith would be void.As a devout catholic I read this book as a way of saying \\"I'm opening my mind,what does this person's experience with god say and how does it relate with my own experience.\\"He focuses too much on science and not on faith.He tries to do the impossible instead of doing the very simple.I believe the benefits of faith he mentions,but the long chapters filled with scientific information as well as confusing messages lead to very mixed messages.Still, if you are atheist or theist read this book!I also side with the book that a renaissance of religous thinking is soon to come. A difficult but enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Deliver the Goods","review":"This book does not deliver the goods promised in the title. It turns out that one of Glynn's pieces of \\"evidence\\" is nothing more than the anthropic principle which notes that we live in a very unlikely Universe. Change any one of several fundamental constants of physics, and the Universe could no longer support life. However this reasoning is akin to the winner of a lotto ticket noting that if any of his numbers changed, he'd not be a winner. Hence God must have been behind his winning. Even if you grant the supernatural, the anthropic principle cannot be used to claim that we humans are the intended purpose of the entire creation. This isn't evidence at all. Carl Sagan, tongue in cheek, formulated a \\"lithic\\" principle because rocks could assume that the entire creation was intended for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book. It purports to give evidence for god's existance that made this atheist believe!Then I read chapter 1.I'm no expert on physics or cosmology but I know enough to realize Dr. Glynn's assertions about modern physics are very weak. He is too quick to account the anthropic principle to god because science can't currently explain it. That is not evidence, it's just annoying. The section that sticks out the most for me is when he calls the possibility of multiple universes \\"pure products of scientific imagination.\\" Maybe he should consider that it's possible his god is the pure product of his imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better apologies out there","review":"This is evidence provided by the author that he studied to go from an atheist to a Christian. Although there are many interesting facts and points, the book lacked any connection and Glynn should really try his hand at something besides writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile reading","review":"I found this book very worthwhile reading. Glynn is good at making his case easy to follow, even though it involves some complex scientific concepts especially in the first chapter. It's not a proof of God's existence, of course; no one is capable of doing that. (Some reviewers seem to consider the book a failure because it's not a proof, but I don't understand why.) Rather, its strength is in demonstrating how, given the facts available, one must really strain to come up with an alternative explanation of the facts that doesn't involve a God. Sadly, if Glynn's account of the views of certain scientists and philosophers is accurate, those people seem to prefer to put their faith in strained explanations and theories, while actively refusing to consider the explanation that's right in front of their faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Refutation of Atheists","review":"Our society is so skeptical that sometimes we refuse to stop and see the apparent. Dr. Glenn presents a valid case for the existance of God citing a new scientific theory, the anthropic principle, near death experiences, and a strong refutation against Freud. Although this book does not present nearly as much of an analytical approach as C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity did, it does allow for open argumentation with atheists on the very basis of their disbelief, science. This is genuinly a wonderful book, and I advise everyone to read it for it can be a guide in reaching a true spiritual connection. Atheists must sit back after reading and reason once again. Hopefully this time however, they will reason in favor of Glenn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive dribble","review":"This is not what I expected it to be. I noticed that some paragraphs from the introduction were thrown about throughout the book. It seemed like this was a 25-page book at best, and the publisher forced him to stretch it out for 170 pages. I'd have to say that it was boring and repetitive - you can easily get the gist of the book after the first 30-40 pages. In my opinion - don't waste your time buying this.My other complaint is the Christianity anthropocentrism. Had the author allowed other religions to be in the mix, it would be more readable and believable. Finally, I found his egotism to be in the way of his writing. At times, I felt like he was looking down upon some of the greatest minds of our century (e.g. Hawkings, Freud, Einstein, etc.) Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atheism is dead","review":"The book contains a simple outline out of which generates many theories and countertheories, so that you may intelligently form your own opinion. Even so the evidence presented here and with the evidence that is making itself more evident is that God is alive and that atheism and empircism is on its trumeted retreat. For all non-Christians or atheists you should seriously review this book (myself being a Christian), for in it is compiled serious evidence no intellectual can overlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Evidence?","review":"While I was initially encouraged to read a book written by someone who had once been atheist, in the end it was just another excercise in Christian rhetoric. The assumption that the original followers of Christianity were \\"good people\\" insults the intelligence of the reader. That along with the fact that Glynn presents absolutely NO evidence, makes this book a HUGE dissappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"no games","review":"This book moves above the fray of the philosophical debate and provides simple reasons to believe that God exists, and how modern thought has missed it. Some of the information is misused to draw conclusions about the *nature* of God, but the academic currency is used well and with authority. Don't hand this book to your pluralist friends, or a militant athiest, but a good challenge for an agnostic or thinking athiest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed in the 2nd Edition","review":"While the 1st edition of David Poores \\"Bible\\" of Zippo guides was outstanding his 2nd edition falls short.

The thrust of the bookconcerns the idea that kids are kids no matter where they live. The pictures, of children all over the world doing similar things (playing ball, caring for animals, and more), are joyous and luminous. The text is so simple that my five-year-old could read most of it by herself. Each picture is labeled with the name of the country in which it was taken, and my daughter enjoyed matching the pictures with the map in the front of the book. This is a display of multiculturalism that avoids being either sappy or politically correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"My best PSP game","review":"this game has nice graphics, and good gameplay.

But she rarely releases an album and prefers releasing dance tracks in general.I actually liked this song, but the reason I am giving it two stars is that it almost sounds like the original - and Dannii really did not add much to this to make it more sound like a \\"Dannii track\\". It is fun to dance and listen to - but I am sure it is not the best of her. She needs to release a full-length studio album to reflect her true talents and present a unified Dannii album with novelties as well. I am really sick of her single cds with 12 remixes in it. The price is very high too - I would prefer buying an album including this track in it , rather than hearing countless versions of a song which almost sounds like its original."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special too expensive!","review":"Are you kidding me?

They all shine on this collection, and though you have to be attentive to follow the long narratives and sometimes rather complicated ...metaphors, this disc has a lot of bang for the buck (if you'll pardon the expression...) The original 1966 release was just a split EP with Lloyd and Briggs, but has since been expanded to include material by the other artists -- presumably of similar vintage. All three of the Anne Briggs tracks -- \\"Gathering Rushes In The Month Of May,\\" \\"The Stonecutter Boy\\" and \\"Martinmas Time\\" -- have since been gathered on retrospectives of her work, but the overlap is negligible, considering how delightful the other songs on here are.

You're better off with Britney Spears or Bon Jovi, those people are more honest about who and what they are.

It's pretty evident that Anti-Flag is not \\"shoving their opinions\\" down peoples throats, they're putting a message out to give people a different side of what they hear everyday, and whether it's accurate or not is something that you have to decide for yourself.

Wait, seriously, before you pass this review off as another cliched insult of Anti-Flag, hear me out... Anti-Flag honestly writes lyrics like those you may find in a rebellious fifth grader's diary or something. Whatever. Listen to the Broadways for an actually good emotional and socio-political band. Their lyrics are extremely well-written, clever, and are not \\"in your face- our beliefs are better than yours\\" propaganda.

They speak out against censorship of the press, yet they have no shame in censoring their own music. Now, I personally don't buy into Anti-Flag's message, so If I had the choice I would probably get this over their explicit version. I meen, hey, ultimately its the music that counts.

Well, and besides, Tess Carlisle is driving him nuts.He gets as far as the Director of the Secret Service's inner office only to be told that Mrs. Carlisle called the President and wants him back. What choice has he, but to go.Doug thinks he's going to be tough on her, but the battle of wills between the two of them has none other than the President mediating when Tess can't win herself.The film's a battle royale between two very strong-willed characters, but in the end when the chips are down, these two people take care of each other.\\"Guarding Tess\\" is one of those surprise films that ends so well the bickering at the front's almost erased.

Cage is equally effective in his role. He hates his assignment and he and MacLaine don't get along well at all. But when the President himself (voiced by director Hugh Wilson) insists on their pairing, what can Cage do? Other than the expected pivotal kidnap plot, there's not a whole lot that goes on, but the film surprisingly shows what it must be like to surrender your privacy due to your notoriety and MacLaine's attempts to find such private moments is poignant. A solid supporting cast makes it work too, although Edward Albert's character of MacLaine's son is rushed over too much to bring any significance to the role. All in all, a pleasant enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley and Nicholas good combo","review":"Shirley MacLaine once again shows her versatility as an actress as Tess, the wife of a Late President still receiving government protection.

When the President calls Doug rises to the task. When Tess is kidnapped, Doug and his team take the steps necessary to find her, even when the odds are against them. You'll laugh, cry and see two strong willed people overcome life's adversities.

The handle is made of stainless steel with G-10 inserts which give it a really good feel. The handle also forms to the hand quite well and feels good to hold. It's a little on the heavier side, but i like that because it gives the knife some heft. The blade come quite sharp and the tanto point is great and really gives the knife a real tactical look and feel. The finger guard/flip assist is great and allows you to open the knife very quickly and when it acts as a finger guard it's very useful. The knife also has ambidextrous thumb studs if that's what you prefer. The knife come with a right-handed point-down clip which is what i prefer, but you may not.

I have no doubt this will be a recurring event, might as well just throw it away. This isn't the first Gerber knife I've had this problem with, their paraframe II did the same exact thing, but with that knife the damage from losing screws was far worse since it was a paraframe.

Went to go replace the motor and found that the track system on the 2000 grand prix I was working on had a completely different design from what was shipped. Had to return part. Refund issued. Take a look at your door and make sure you have a single track design like what is picture here before you buy. I had a twin track design that was incompatible.

I installed it myself. The only complaint I have is that one of the brackets that slips on the window was a little different than the factory one. It made for a tight fit and I didn't think I was going to get it on for awhile but finally muscled it on. Once installed though it works great. I only wished they make them for the back windows, because I've had to replace both now and had to scour the junk yards to save a little money."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Choices","review":"This collection is from the early Aussie years.

The colors are not the Air Force colors, the patch is more of a baby blue and the yellow is more of a highlighter yellow. Overall not satisfied at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"Skocpol's \\"comparative analysis\\" leaves out only one minor detail: people. It seems never to occur to her that social revolutions are ultimately the consequence of human agency--that is, people taking history into their own hands. Marx's famous dictum from the opening of the \\"Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napolean\\" that \\"men make their own history, but they do not make it exactly as they choose,\\" is lost on Skocpol. Rather, such phenomena as socio-economic classes, states, political institutions, etc., exist for her as if they were variables in Euclidian geometry. By comparison, Stalin could pass for Kant, if not Hegel, and Althusser might as well be Lukacs. If you care about this subject, look to Barrington Moore, Jr., E. P. Thompson, and more recent studies of each ofthe three revolutions Skocpol compares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I paid $20 for this game and beat it from start to finish in less than 30 minutes.

Inside meaning writing addons, macros, etc. It is not a book about how to use all of the features of the IDE.

If you need to create Addons this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Examples, Not Much Meat","review":"This book may have some content that is hard to find anywhere else but overall it was a big disappointment for me. I was looking for some real insight in how to write effective macros for manipulating text and this book only had 1 chapter on \\"the code model.\\" The chapter was devoid of any decent example of using the TextSelection object.I also didn't like the fact that the 3 author approach was so obvious. Some examples were in VB and some in C#. You would think they'd write the whole book in 1 language. I don't care which one but pick one. Since macros have to be written in VB.Net you'd think the whole book would have been in VB.Net.This one missed the mark for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the most frustrating and poorly informative book I've ever read","review":"Title pretty much says it all. For each item covered the coverage is peurile and sparse. Each example tantalises you with lore, only to keep most of it hidden inside the authors' brains.Admittedly attempting to document the dog's breakfast that is Visual Studio was always going to be an impossible task, but I think the authors have managed to fail to live up to even that low ceiling. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had so much potential","review":"This movie started off on a really strong note which is maintained through much of the film. I had been prepared to give it four stars. However, the ending ruined it all. The action sequences and haunting were well-done, especially when Mikey beats up Marnie's current lover, but the ending was just so cliche and sloppily done. I just did not buy the way Mikey was defeated, it was utterly anti-climatic, and this movie ended up disappointing me gravely, which is sad since it started off so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Lame","review":"This movie has way too many stupid characters. Not like lame characters, just ones without brains. The most stupid character is Famke Janssen. We know that she killed her husband because he was abusive. When his ghost shows up and starts beating her again, she doesn't even tell anyone. She lies about her injuries. This isn't a spoiler FYI. You're stuck in your home with a violent ghost and you don't tell anyone why you're bruised and cut?For a gore fan, there is a horrific death scene, but other than that, I was just gritting my teeth wondering how someone can make so many stupid decisions.If you're not concerned about the story being anything close to decent, I guess, go ahead and watch it. But if you get picky with stupid plots and horrible characters, this movie is saturated with both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"I paid $1.22 for this flick and I still feel like I got ripped off. It is one of the slowest horror films I've ever seen...a real yawner and a totally unbelievable plot...just pure hokey pokey stuff. It's a great film to have on for background noise while you're cleaning the house or cooking your dinner...not a film to sit down and watch. Horrible acting and a silly script...especially when the Father comes to the house to collect a bagful of money, but won't bless (exorcise) the house. It gets one star because I had no other choice. 100 Feet is exactly where this film belongs...100 feet underground!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 Feet","review":"I'm not sure why this movie got such high ratings. The story was stupid, simplistic and very predictable. The graphics, however, were ridiculously crude and contemptuous; a cartoon for horror effects, how bland and stupid do they think we are?The actor playing her dead husband's dumb cop of a partner (Bobby Cannavale) looks the part, as he's a stupid idiot.The movie had potential but as it goes on and on, the story goes into the toilet.Of course, the ending left me with a \\"I'm going to puke\\" impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitle or Closed Captioned","review":"Just recently start play, turn out there is no Subtitle (Not even in Spanish too) or Closed Captioned.

Most traveler's dictionnaries don't have the words I need when reading books or newspapers. So I wanted a dictionnary that was small but still really useful. This Harrap's Mini has by far the best coverage of any mini-dictionnary I have found. It is smaller but a bit thicker than an average paperback book. So it won't fit in a pocket but goes nicely in my small fanny pack.

But it was compiled by three top scholars who are endowed with an insatiable drive for discovering the human details of ancient civilizations, a wonderful style for sharing their excitement with their readers, and, most surpising of all, a sense of humor seldom associated with this level of erudition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on what you want in a \\"guide\\"","review":"This is a wonderful book, but I want to offer the caveat that if you're looking for a general introduction to the period, or for a comprehensive reference book, this is neither. The essays are somewhat specialized, and the alphabetic section, while it offers many articles on unexpected subjects -- Nudity and Refugees, to name just two -- is by no means encyclopedic. Thus there are articles on the literary figures Ausonius and Sidonius, for example, but nothing at all on Rutilius Namatianus or Prudentius. Horses get a heading, but dogs don't. The emphasis is on social history, not events, so you won't find anything here on the battle of Adrianople.If you don't know much about the period, I'd recommend first reading Peter Brown's The World of Late Antiquity, a superbly written and well illustrated introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I was very dissapointed.

My father passed away last year after a long battle with alzheimers, and I too was on a quest of sorts. I was never able to get my father to open up about his war experiences on the beaches of Normandy and beyond, and know now that their generation was truly the \\"great generation\\" of our time. This book really hit home. The content was interesting enough that I read the book at one sitting, and it provoked questions of a very personal nature to me. For those of us who are members of the \\"baby boom\\" generation I hope we all start asking our Fathers, Mothers, Uncles, Aunts - anyone with personal experiences about this remarkable time in our history to share their stories with us while they are able. We should also give them a sincere Thank You for their sacrifices."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the real deal!","review":"It's never a good thing to need a product like this for a loved one, but this was a home run.

The sound quality on this disc is so awful, I felt cheated. Fortunately I didn't give up and found \\"Then Play On\\". Gets one star for actually playing in the CD player, the other because Peter Green is the baddest white boy on the gitfiddle this side of Stevie Ray Vaughan. (though it doesn't show on this disk, at least that which I could hear). For completists only.If you are looking for a great Live Mac album, check for the Recall - import double CD issue of the Fleetwood Mac \\"Boston Blues.\\" These are the sets from which the \\"Live at the Boston Tea Party\\" re-issues were issued, and you won't be dissappointed. Plus you get two of those three discs for the price of one-and-a-half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live @ the Marquee","review":"It is a neverending search to try to find good quality recordings of early Peter Green and this is not the end of that search. The sound quality is fair, at best, and Green stays in the background too much for my taste. This maybe due to Danny Kirwan not being on this one, leaving too much Jeremy Spencer. I am glad I have this recording though as Mean Woman Blues is GREAT despite the sound quality. Green is dynamite at the end of it. So far, I still think you're better off with the Live at the Boston Tea Party discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible sound quality","review":"I have a \\"Collector's Gold\\" disc of this recording. What a joke. Putting out an absolutely terrible recording on a gold disc. The performances might be very good but it is too hard to tell with sound quality as bad as this. Probably was recorded with a mic in someone's pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Completists Only","review":"When one is shopping for arhival music, one has to balance sound quality with performance quality (one assumes you already have a passion for the artist...). Not including the rockabilly throwback Green and Spencer loved to perform, there are a little over 250 officially released unique Fleetwood Mac w/ Peter Green tracks available off and on in the market place. This recording is for the completist only - while the performance is a rare glimpse of the very first formal incarnation of Fleetwood Mac (Bob Brunning on bass, not John McVie), and a view into the famed Marquee club atmosphere, the sound quality is at the bottom of the aforementioned 250+ tracks one can collect. BTW, while Green would always play backup to Spencer, the reverse was rarely true. Much Peter Green listening requires attention to subtleties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The diamonds were quite yellow, so much that I debated whether to give them to my wife, and she visibly debated taking them.

So then I tried the Linksys USB200M ver. 2 thinking there was a mistake with what Tivo recommended and that didn't work either. I looked all over the place and couldnt find anyone who sold the other Linksys adapter that Tivo recommends. I finally tried this Netgear adapter that Tivo says might work and it recognized the adapter and connected instantly with no problems at all. So if you want to connect your tivo to a home network definitely get this adapter.

Starting \\"Re: A Person I Knew\\" an anagram for Orrin Keepnews as well as an elegy for the late bassist Scott LaFaro, Evans' playing grew in intensity with this classic album. It was also the \\"Best of the Month\\" in the Hi/Fi Stereo Review by Nat Hentoff or was it Joe Goldberg? Regardless this version of this original by Evans remains the definitive one and reason enough to get this album but there are other treasures to behold the ear from \\"the Chopin of jazz/contemporary piano\\". Rarely heard gems like \\"In Love in Vain\\" are coupled with the fresh re-workings of \\"It Might as Well Be Spring\\" and \\"Polka Dots & Moonbeams\\" plus a classic Evans original, \\"Very Early\\".

The head of the brush is very wide therefor making it more of a brush to your gums than to your teeth.

It works just like every other brush I've owned in the past 30 years. There's nothing new here, its just a re-invented re-invention of the same old thing, again. The new twist is the tongue cleaner which feels like (and works not quite as well as) a tab of velcro (it scrapes the insides of your cheeks).

She is a delightful character who has embarked on an adventure beyond her wildest imaginings and whose life will never be the same again. To relate to her and her situations was very easy.

If you want to waste your money, just set it on fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paramount is the pits","review":"Great show, but as is the case with many Universal/Paramount releases, they simply stop releasing DVD's after a few seasons if they think that the show isn't selling well enough: Even if the low sales are because of splitting seasons into volumes and ultimately charging twice as much per season. They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Night Gallery, Cannon, etc... If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Universal/Paramount in the first place. They're the the worst, and obviously couldn't care less about their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced to watch ads!","review":"If you buy this you will be forced to watch commercials for other DVDs and you cant skip over them.

I am one of those people. I adored season 1 and could not wait for season 2 mainly for the Lovecraft tales which I had never seen.With that being said there are some true gems in this collection. \\"The boy who predicted earthquakes\\" comes to mind and various others.Now with the praise out of the way, on to the problem.Sadly I found myself getting more entertainment out of the EC Archives I was reading while the dvd was playing. Most of the stories or \\"paintings\\" are some of the most guessable, contrived muck ever put to film. Nothing shocked, surprised, or even amused me 89% of the entire season. Even most of the funny 5-10 minute ones fell flat in a big way.On top of this was the picture and sound. Watchable but nothing to be awe-inspired about. Sound was decent at best.To finish there are some true classics in this season, but the rest drowns it all in obscurity for good reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better then the shows on today!!!!","review":"These shows should be considered classics and preserved in a museum somewhere!!!!!And don't take that lightly!

Amazing how campy it looks now, but some of the episodes still hold up.Four stars is only because I wish they had more extras. They do have commentary by Benicio del Toro on a few of the episodes, so that adds awesome points in my book.Great for memory lane, but if you didn't grow up watching these, I recommend Hitchcock or Twilight Zone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"Finally all three seasons are available. And well worth the wait. The transfer was clean, sound good etc... The only thing about Night Gallery, is there either \\"really really good... Or there stupid\\"...

It did not offer much in the way of speeding up your run or fixing problems. Ok for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Drumming CD for Journeying","review":"I really like this CD. It is the best one yet that I have found for journeying. The sound of the drum is as close to a live drum as I have heard in a recording and it captures the over and under tones beautifully. The artwork and sentiments of the makers of the album are a nice touch too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for journey practice","review":"This is an excellent tool to load up on your iPod and practice your journeying, especially at a beginner level. You can set up the play list on your favorite player to do a complete cycle of the invocation, journey drumming, callback, and closing.An essential part of a portable shamanic kit! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The drumming on this CD is just WAY too fast. I've experienced much slower drumming, which is more hypnotic, a much quicker trip to that relaxed state that we need to journey. The speed of this drumming is so hyper that there's no hope to slow down your thoughts or allow a calm centering. If I had been able to listen to a bit of it before I purchased it, I never would have wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great! I love buying my books on here!

Everyone seems to like him because he's clean but can't you be clean and funny at the same time? I guess not. The only reason my friends and I laughed was because he was so bad. I was so embarrassed for this guy it made me feel uncomfortable the whole time. I felt bad for the people who payed money for his show or even this DVD.

This book has helped me to better understand why prototype railroads arranged track in certain ways. Excellent book, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers the Basics and Some Langaippe, too,","review":"I don't think anyone in the model railroad hobby can say enough about the contributions of the late John Armstrong. His layout designs are masterpieces of getting the most out of a given space and working with the tradeoffs we all enevitably face. The book gives an overview of prototype operations and then goes into countless ideas and pointers for design and operation. I found the section on curve planning (p. 76), schematics (Chap. 8), and laying out an \\"easement\\" (p. 116) particularly useful. I recommend this to anyone planning a first layout or for anyone building a second layout after messing up their first. It is a good companion to \\"Classic Layout Designs,\\" also by John Armstrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in every respect, worth every penny!","review":"This is a really fine book! I wish I'd encountered it when I first started in the hobby. Our first layout is okay, but had we had this guide we would have done so many things differently. There are many books on track layouts, but they generally just present someone's ideas for a layout and tell you how to build it. This book, on the other hand, tells you WHY things are certain way and HOW to make things for this or that track activity. It makes total sense and our next layout will be much better because of this book.The book has two major parts. The first part of the book describes basic railroad operations, such as loading and unloading, assembling cars into trains, moving trains, etc. The second part looks at how to design a practical model, what standards to use, minimal curves, layout shapes, etc. It has a lot of great ideas, with many pictures and schematics to satisfy both advance and novice modelers. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the series","review":"This book in the series has multiple plots going on relative to several relationships: Cody & Annabel, Glenn & Riley, Olivia & Merris, and finally Chris and Melanie.This covers the full cycle of live from giving birth to dying and how each member of the cast plays their parts.Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return it after 2 weeks!

This knife is a little large for average pocket carrying but would be an excellent choice for military, law enforcement, etc.The My Tighe has excellent steel for the blade, an assisted opening mechanism, and strong blade lock. I was impressed with the thickness and edge of the blade. The pocket clip is sturdy but I dont believe it can be switched for lefties. CRKT also makes a slightly smaller version of this knife, the mini my tighe.The assisted opening is not overly sensitive like on the Kershaw Onion models so the blade doesnt come open in your pocket. I am very impressed with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above and beyond-","review":"Saw this knife for a bargain on cyber Monday and liked the look of it so on an impulse decided to snag it. Needed a solid work knife and the price was right (that and it screamed badassery to me & I couldn't very well let my friends out knife me now could I?)

The T770 did a fair job of trimming and a terrible job of collecting the hair via the vacuum missing a good 30% of the hair.This model is much better at the main job which is trimming the beard. It is very precise and trims the hair effortlessly.The vacuum feature is improved and only misses about 10% of the hair now. However, it seems that if you are going to have to clean up any hair why bother with a vacuum feature at all. Cleaning up is cleaning up. It makes little difference cleaning up a little or a lot hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well designed all-in-one trimmer","review":"I used an older version of this trimmer for years. This one was much cheaper than the original. It appears to be better constructed and with the exception of the vacuum collection tray, it is even better than the first. The previous iteration had a drawer in which the trimmings were collected. This version has a door that opens and the trimmings fall out - a little messy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trimmer - Versatile","review":"Works great and keeps a good charge. Much better than corded versions and the vacuum function really works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous packaging","review":"The performance of the Norelco T780 is adequate, but not as powerful as an older Norelco trimmer it replaced.

This is my first trimmer and I am very happy with it. The battery life seems to last a long time, I used it twice a week for 2 months and it was going fine but I had to recharge it as I went overseas for 2 weeks. This is the only negative point for me, it only works on US voltage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Added Convenience is a Plus","review":"The trimmer works fine and is easy to use on my beard.

Will buy again if I lose this one.","review":"I had an old norelco trimmer. Lost it in a car accident [no!! I wasn't trimming anything (:p), I just lost my toiletry kit]. Anyway, now I use this one.

Better than not having it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice unit","review":"This is a replacement for a previous generation trimmer I had. I am sure this is the newer, updated model. The form factor is about the same. The vacuum power is stronger on this one. I was perfectly happy with the other that worked great for at least 5 years. Ultimately, it would no longer hold a charge. I think these are the best trimmers I have encountered. To get 5+ years out of one is an exceptional value. I have no reason to believe that this one won't last just as long. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"The T780 trimmer is a good product. It is not perfect but it does make trimming facial hair a lot less messy. While it does contain most of the trimmings, a few do escape. I would estimate the efficiency of capturing the clippings to be about 90-95%. It cuts easily and predictably with the adjustable head. In fact, its shortest setting is very short; shorter than some other trimmers I've used. Personally I like a narrower head, but the Norelco's size isn't much of an issue. Battery life is more than adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than anything I've used before","review":"I have been using simple (aka cheap) hair trimmers for a while. When the battery in my last unit gave up I searched around and found this. This is a great product, trimming is smooth, you don't feel anything against the skin. The charger is convenient. The much hyped hair catcher doesn't do a good job, which robs it of a star. I use these things at home so travel pouch is not a great loss.

The only way to not accidently hack holes in your beard is to hang onto the adjustment ring when in use. The guard is also designed in such a way that it is really difficult to get that patch under your nose (poor detail control).A $15 plug-in is worth more than this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy wife","review":"Two things about this trimmer.

Conclusion: either the accumulator should be improved or get rid of the vacuum!Second, one cannot get a close cut! Min. length that you can get is 2.5 mm , so think twice if it's enough for you!Third, yes it looks good on the picture, but not in reality! It feels really cheap in one's hand.

Good battery life between chargings, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacum Trimmer","review":"I have put off reveiuing this trimmer until I have had it long enough to make a qualified call. I have found it to be better than the previous model in the fact that tht vacum feature allowes me to get completely dressed before shaving. and the battery holds a good charge. The only problem I have so far is shaving around my nose with the vacum there. but I am learning more how to do it and feel that it can work that out.So I am very pleased with the vacum feature and the fact that you can clean it (I use a small pant brush) after every few uses.Also the way it maintains it's charge.I also found in my search for my replacement for the previous Norelco model that Amazon had the best price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend","review":"I had a Norelco trimmer for a number of years and was very happy with it. The T780 works OK and I really like the vacuum concept.What I DON'T like is, the adjustment ring does not come with any marking to show the relative depth of cut. Thus, I'm merely guessing from one cut to the next.Also note (and this is not part of my rating), when you use Super Saver Shipping, they sit on the order for a week before they ship, so don't select it if you're in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Trimmer","review":"I think other reviews peg the good quality of this trimmer very well.

The thing is all plastic which I could live with if it only had some ease of use and features that were little more than poorly executed gimmicks. The parts are very smooth, light and hard to hold onto. They were constantly falling off. The button to turn it on is too close to the button that allows the removal of the head piece so I was constantly popping off the head piece when I turned it on. The piece would invariably bounce off the counter and onto the floor or worse, into the toilet. Also there is no travel case to carry all of those parts so what do you do with them if you want to bring it with you on a trip. Finally threw it all into the trash and am looking for a quality replacement.

They taste just like regular wheat pretzels. I think even people who are not eating GF would not know these pretzels were not \\"normal\\" pretzels.

This means that the unit keeps the temperature much more constant. It also allows you to bring in outside air, or not, at your choice.Overall I am extremely satisfied with this air conditioner.NOTE: After a month or so it started emitting a disturbing odor.

The unexpected bonus is in the full-color repros of Ernst's artwork of the era, many of which I haven't seen before.The downside is the book is rather dry ad goes into WAY too much detail on different ships and boats they travelled on. There is no way to document much of this (or any) era of Ernst's personal life, so the detective work the author did on this is greatly appreciated. And it reads like a detective wrote it. There are times it's very engrossing, but the sheer weight of ancillary detail robs the book of much of it's \\"zing\\"Still, I'm glad I have it and would recommend it for students of Ernst's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed cooktop !","review":"I received the cooktop directly from Sunpentown which is the manufacturer but order through Amazon.com.

I believe another review said that it DIDN'T change their skin color, so maybe it IS just me.My favorite colors are sapphire blue and silver, and I absolutely love the Trinity symbol of the ring, so this really is a gorgeous ring to me.Update: About 5 months later, the bottom of the ring started wearing thin - the metal is thinning out.

There are very few of the personal stories of individuals (except the major leaders) but there are enough mixed in with the facts and dates to hold your interest. He does include several opinions of his own with respect to some major blunders by both sides.

The book is a never ending list of bloody battles. The book starts with a very intersting account of the events that led to this bloody war but the rest of the book is really hard to read. The book does give an informative account of the war and it may be that the war should be blamed for this unintersting account of events and not the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Primer on WWI","review":"This is a great book for anyone how wants to learn about WWI rather quickly.Of course one book can't capture all the details of the many campaigns fought on both eastern and western fronts.For this, there are individual books covering land, air, and sea battles including politics of the war.One thing I would highly suggest prior to reading this book, is to purchase a good map of \\"Old Europe\\" because the authorwalks you through many battles that won't mean much without it. The map is key to understanding the war's progressionand the vital stategic interests of both enemies and allies.I would also like to highly recommend the author's other book \\"A Short History of WWII\\" which was excellent.After reading these books, I really appreciate the tremendous hardships that the allies went through to protect our Democracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Legend","review":"I bought this CD for the well-known track, \\"She's Royal\\".

The \\"real\\" circus perrformers seem to be imposters. The Pete Townsend interview is interesting, but this is really just a footnote. Jagger & Co showed good sense in putting this in the vault.

Yoko as awful as ever (that she even appears in the commentary is some kind of testament to 60's social climbing), but skip past her banshee howls and Marianne Faithfull's junkie langour and you have a pretty nice performance set.Beats owning the new Phish double-DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"After my Mom ordered this online for me, I finally got it in the mail, yesterday!

The Dirty Mac is a real treat ('Yer Blues' was an excellent choice), and then of course there's the Stones, who are at their peak in this video.

First, for a 5lb fryer, the drippings collected will overflow the basin, especially when you remove it from the oven. You need to place another pie pan under it to avoid sloshing. More importantly, after using mine eight or so times, the teflon is spontaneously flaking off the basin. (Please note I hand-washed the basin with hot water, soap, and a sponge, and made sure to never touch it with metal.)If you're not worried about making gravy with the drippings, this may not bother you. Me, I like making gravy, and it's a real concern.I'm going to get another upright roaster, but this time I'm getting a stand-alone frame I can place in a pie pan, and I'm avoiding teflon altogether. I think it's having trouble with long-term exposure to the ultra-hot drippings."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 week of use and the fan is already rattling","review":"I've been using this power adapter for a week and now the fan is rattling real loud.

After hearing 1 minute, it becomes crystal clear! No one in Europe can understand their weak, trite and banal lyrics. It is obvious why they have no chance of success in an English speaking country. The music is such Euro-pop. This is NOT ROCK. This group should be forced to listen to real rock and sign an agreement to never claim their pop dribble is even akin to the holy word, we so fondly know as Rock. It is amazing how boring a group can be. There is nothing remotely rock in style on this CD. It is as if they removed everything good about rock, and sterilized it for 15 year old girl consumption. This group is most forgetful. The cover of this and other CD is further proof of their pop direction. They appear on the cover of every CD with clean and ironed shirts, and nicely combed hair!!!

The comparison in quality between this and the same songs on the anthology is huge. The other originals have very good sound quality, but this one is terrible.

I have owned a wave since it was introduced. Recently in Iraq my wave and I parted company. Searching the military supply stores I was surprised at the cost of the TI. But, upon searching Amazon I found exactly what I wanted at a much reduced cost. The tool is everthing as advertised. It works wonderfully and is tougher than the Wave. The nylon sheath is sturdy and has the horizontal carry configuration that works with body armor. I also like the addition of the carry clip as now the tool can be carried in a pocket if need be. The additional sockets are well thought out and yes I have already repaired my safety glasses with the small jeweler tool. The locking mechanism is strong and holds the tools in place. The knife is much better than the previous knife blades and easier to grasp and open. The scissors are much tougher and yes they do cut seat belts. Overall another big design score for Leatherman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Leatherman ever","review":"One of the best new features is the ease of opening the outside blades. They open smooth as silk, with much less effort required than the Wave. This, combined with the larger thumb holes, means that everyone can now truly open and close the blades with one hand. Another major improvement is that the pliers are obviously beefed up, and will take loads of abuse without shifting off center. In addition, the handles have much less \\"play\\" when closed than previous Leatherman models. The only thing I don't like is that there is no good place to store the lanyard loop and belt clip in the pouch; none of the pockets have any type of securing mechanism. Overall, the Charge is a serious step above anything else out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpe's Series","review":"I'm 61-that said, I was looking at the sale price and had no idea that there are \\"regions\\" when it comes to purchaing DVDs.

This one is a really useful and outstanding book. It includes, besides the much better and detailed explanation of all of the camera's functions and tips, a mini course in Photoshop, a comprehensive course in digital photography, printing, special effects, filter operation etc., and a bundle of useful software (not only a couple of trial software) including a lot of iNova's own designed special filters for Photoshop, nothing of which goes in Mr. Curtin's book.

And even though I am only 60 pages into the book, I can honestly say it's a page turner. By that, of course, I mean you actually have to turn the pages yourself, which, incidentally, is why I'm only on page 64.

He's channeling the best kind of surreality here--from Woody Allen to Douglas Adams (before you knew Adams' schtick by heart). In fact AOME is a kind of Hitchhiker's Guide to our own universe.

It seems that the author once read \\"1066 and All That\\" and believed that he could recreate a similar work of nonsensical ramblings out of whole cloth. While I admire the effort, Hodgman falls very, very short of the goal.What makes works such as \\"1066\\" so amusing is not that they are a collection of nonsense, but that they reflect our sometimes twisted view of the world. \\"1066\\" is brilliant because it captures that sense of thinking that you know it all, when you in fact do not.

I had seen the author on THE DAILY SHOW and thought it might be fun. I was wrong. Most of his concepts are worn and tired. For anyone who has ever been to a comedy club, you'll recognize the \\"jokes\\" and gags. Nothing new is created and, in fact, many of the premises were funnier when the comedians told them and are somewhat diluted here. It is said that one cannot copyright a joke. What a shame! Were there such laws, John Hodgman would be in debt to a few dozen people who had the original thoughts. And is it me, or does this guy think he is smarter than the rest of us?

It is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. There is no point to it whatsoever. The contents are just rantings of some guy whom no one has ever heard of. The book jacket has the worst typeface ever and you actually have to start reading the book to figure out what it's about. I'll sum it up for you and save you time: it is about NOTHING anyone cares about. Do you really need to waste your time reading about 700 hobo names? What is so freaking funny about that?? Shockingly enough, again the answer is NOTHING.

I recently had the chance to listen to the audio book version, and was bored to tears! I found myself just waiting for the chapter to be over so he'd move on to the next topic.

From out of nowhere? And then you have to put down the book for awhile because you are secretly afraid you have just read the funniest thing you will ever read so what is the point of continuing to read anything again ever? Well this book is that book. And that phenomenon occurs several times throughout it.

The tone is very dry, and much of the humor is based on nonsense, but there are some repeating themes that help hold the work together. I'm reminded a bit of Mark Leyner, though Leyner's style is much more hyperactive. If you like this book the McSweeneys collection 'Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans' might also appeal to you. The tone is similar, and some sections of the book are very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny? YES!","review":"Made me laugh until I puked. This is really good stuff.

Although these are B-grade movies, there is a tangible likeability for Teenage Graffiti and Teenage Mother. These two stories serve as cautionary tales of the responsibilities involved in growing up and acting out in mature ways. Every person should be responsible for their actions, which the movies poignantl share than many people act first and think later. Although a majority of the characters develop into individuals with less than reputable morals, there is a redeeming storyline that should be taken note of by viewers. It is simply to be a person that does not compromise who they are as a indiviual for anyone else. I recommend this double feature for an audience that can grasp the true intent of the story and respect it by learning something from viewig these movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this for TEENAGE MOTHER","review":"I've been a fan of these double feature discs for a couple of years now. Both of these films work ok togethor ,but the main reason you should purchase this is for the uncut version of TEENAGE MOTHER. TEENAGE GRAFFITI is a bit too slow and melodramatic for my taste but it has a few spots of nudity that will make exploitation fans smile. Extras include trailers and an audio commentary by Cinema Head Cheese thats very funny but bound to rub some viewers the wrong way. Overall a great package.

They are very comfortable and unlike the cotton kinds work against cold floors. Mine are two layers of harwood floor with air leaks and even cold in the summer. The liners are soft and stretch and seem to fit properly for the measurements. Not being able to dry them takes longer, but I'm just getting an extra pair. Inside, I wear them around when its not as cold as stretch pants. I wish there was a female version but if its really a problem, the open are can be stiched shut.Considering one pair of these makes up for more than the cost of the cotton type and works, they are also economical despite costing a little more.

Right now, after a month, it is on the shelf outside the garage and I am hoping it will eventually degas whatever it is and be able to come inside. It might work in a larger room with more air circulation but in a small bathroom the smell is not acceptable.

A tale of patriotism and passion for ideals set in a tropical paradise.The author paints an accurate portrait of the life, people and places of Cuba and Miami during the late 1950's and early 60's as a background for a stream of consciousness accounting of a proud people's loss of freedom, and of a young girl's love and her transformation into a mature woman.This writer experienced and remembers much of what Ms Laje describes, and knows many who have similar stories to tell, but she tells it well.This book is entertaining, intriguing, educational, thought provoking...A must read for any student of latin american relations, political or any of the social sciences, A good read for anyone who loves freedom and the freedom to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"FDR, ER & Campo","review":"I was excited when I first saw this book advertised. Anyone who has studied the Roosevelts knows the fundamental emotional foundation this island provided the family. However, when I began to read the book, I quickly became disgruntled. There was little to no new information, insight or perspective offered. The author seems to mainly cover the same formulaic roads covered before-- early marriage, polio, governor, president, & Eleanor on her own. The only difference was this books focuses on those same paths through the lens of Campobello. The problem, besides offering little new, is this lens is restrictive, rather than encompassing. If you're looking for an introduction to the Roosevelts, this may be a good selection. However, if you have studied this couple with any kind of attention, nothing profound or enlightning is likely to be found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising and claims from Pro Therapy Supplies","review":"NO STAND!!!!!

Not all areas/enemies are hostile, and will only attack you if YOU attack them or townsfolk first. Thus making your temper and style determine how difficult your journal will be. You may also talk to various people throughout the game and pick different ways to answer. The game is great and has a memorable soundtrack aswell.

Once and for all, Arthur Herman contends, we can examine - objectively - some of McCarthy's claims which had long been though baseless. The only problem, however, is that Herman seems to rely too much upon a previous work, David Oshinsky's Conspiracy So Immense, which remains the standard book on McCarthy and the McCarthy era. Herman passes off a lot of research as original when Oshinksy explored the themes a decade earlier in his masterful work. For those interested, I recommend A Conspiracy So Immense for the definitive accounting of the life and times of Joe McCarthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great theory but waaaay too long","review":"I've met Arthur Herman before and he's a great guy but so I mean this in the nicest way. It put me to sleep.His theory is a bold and very engaging one, McCarthy was right! I agree with this theory and read his book hoping page after page to get to the good stuff. But it never came. Instead he wastes hundreds of pages on tangent issuses and a rehash of what we already know about McCarthy.He does have some great dacts about how poor McCarthy has been distorted by the media, but these facts are few and fleeting.If you hope to get a different view of McCarthy you will be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching Joe","review":"I would recommend \\"Point of Order\\", a video of highlights from the1954 Army/McCarthy hearings, to anyone with an interest in the Wisconsin senator's methods or personality. I understand that somesort of neo-conservative feeling is behind McCarthy apologism (a sentiment that I never dreamed could even exist before stumbling upon this book). Even if Cohn and Schine caused the senator's -ultimate- downfall (and I would agree wholeheartedly), it only takes ten or fifteen minutes of Joe's TV performances to make you realize that he was an obtuse, obnoxious, overstuffed disgrace to his office. He was an inept and deeply-flawed legislator (and I evaluate him strictly on his performance as a public servant)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bunch Of Conservative Claptrap","review":"The majority of McCarthy biographies have been written from a left-wing point of view (and face it, why would conservatives want to bring McCarthy's name up?). But Herman's book swings the pendulum just as far, if not farther, in the other direction. Nearly every McCarthy action is excused or apologized for, no matter how loathsome. Nearly every action taken against McCarthy is because McCarthy's opponents were all Communists or sympathizers, or had relatives who were Communists or sympathizers (just as bad, according to the author). For a balanced account, Thomas Reeves' 1982 biography remains the standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BOOK","review":"Thoroughly researched and excellently written, this book is a great read.It gives a distinct picture of Joe McCarthy, and also educates the reader about the events occurring.GRADE: A++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relevant to the real (dirty) world of plumbing","review":"I am a professional handyperson (eight years) and am always looking for books to improve my knowledge.

After 4 months the button stopped working all together.Being a fairly resourceful person, I decided to take it apart and see if I couldn't clean up the unit, but no dice. The only way to get the unit apart was to destroy the rubber seal around the bottom which had been glued on.Sorry Oxo, but you really messed up on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny, fidgety buttons difficult to press","review":"My title says it all.Agree with most other reviews.

The replacement lasted for 9 months only because I realized you have to occasionally drip some chain lube down into the lock to keep it turning, but that one recently became junk as well because something inside the lock broke so that the key was stuck inside and wouldn't turn no matter at how many angles I wiggled it.

You can tell a good quality lock from a cheap one by the way the key feels as it turns and also the resistance against pulling out/putting in the \\"U\\" from the lock (the lock being the part which the key fits). The key turns smoothly and the U is easy to remove from the lock. This is definitely worth buying.The only small problem, and I have had this problem with every U-lock from every brand, is that the plastic caddy to attach the u-lock to the bike while not in use breaks very easily. Maybe my bike's vertical frame tube is a different size than normal? Either way it is a pain to have the U-lock dangling on your handlebars."},{"rating":"1","title":"now it is a paperweight","review":"first off there is a youtube video showing how easy it is to pick this lock. nonetheless, both keys that i have now do not work. one key got damaged and didnt fit. then i was using the lock with the second key and now for some unexplained reason the key won't fit in all the way. this is a poorly made device. after reading the reviews, i just used it as an ancillary lock anyways combined with my kryptonite"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks.

But as a result of the rain, some of the interior components rusted and it was dang near impossible to insert my key, and once I got it in, I could hardly get it out. I literally had to ask for assistance to remove my key! I thought that maybe by turning the lock upside down and draining the water, this would help. It did initially until it rained again, then it took me between 8 and 10 minutes to get the lock off on two occasions. I then decided enough was enough. I threw the lock away not only because of the time issue, but because it bent one key beyond use and the second was permanently stripped and couldn't turn the lock anymore.

The idea that some of the deep questions Jayber asks really come from a partially educated man who can then turn around and do some incredibly stupid things, like pretend to marry a woman is preposterous. The story is unsatisfying. Few of the characters are endearing, and none of them stick around longer than it takes for Berry to make a supposedly poignant social commentary about people like that. As a read for fun, 2 stars seems generous for such an purposeless, unsatisfying, and disappointing novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"There comes a point in every story.....","review":"There comes a point in works of fiction where most writers back off of the purely descriptive writing and start moving the plot along. Berry never does that in this book. \\"I'm just saying\\" for those of you who expect the plot to move the story along that you, the reader, will have to do most of the heavy lifting here.About two-thirds of the way through this book I got really tired of the romance of the pastoral life. I grew up in a setting much like what he describes and it isn't all that lovely. People in Africa are tilling the soil in ways similar to Berry's characters and they don't seem quite as happy as the folks in this book.I have often wondered what era people were wanting to go to to find the \\"good old days.\\" Now I know.

This is just a beautiful read with a timelessness quality and some simple clues as to how one person made lemonade when life gave him lemons.

Tons of great reviews, but I was disappointed. I suppose the writing is beautifully descriptive, and it's nice to learn about what it's like to live in another time in America, but the problem is (and a major one at that!) is that there is not plot to speak of. When I read a novel, I like there to be a story- I want it to go somewhere- and this book just sort of meanders along. As I read it, I just never really cared that much about Jayber or what he thought about the Bible or his town or the girl he loved or the people who lived in the town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a wonderful and inspiring book","review":"I so enjoyed reading this book and learning how life used to be. Parts of it were so sad and yet others were enlightening. I supposed if I learned anything from this story about Jaber Crow it would be that life brings great sorrow as well as great love and the balance of the two creates harmony. I wish for the wisdom of the men who farmed the earth in his time. I recommend this book to anyone who is not afraid to think a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best I've Read","review":"I agree with the reviewers who ranked the book a 5. While it contains several themes, it is first and foremost a spiritual book to me. It's beautiful prose captures the essence of friendship, the virtues of small-town America, the calm and terror of the river, the fragility of the land, and the tug of war between Heaven and Hell. It also details one of the most unusual love stories I have ever read. I have read it twice and am beginning it for a third time. I often go to sleep and wake up thinking about it and its meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a great novel- also a sober warning","review":"The deep observations of Jayber Crow should embarrass and shame readers of the modern age who share responsibility for what we've allowed to happen to our rural landscapes and communities. This is more than a great novel with memorable characters. It is wisdom and it should, like Berry's essays, wake us up to protect and value what remains of our land. It is clear just from reading this one novel that we are living in a world run by fools and, more than ever, we need to educate ourselves and our particular circle of influence to what is being lost. We need to guard our communities and change our lives to reflect our convictions. Most people won't realize what we've lost until its gone. Do more with your life than seek easy pleasure and comfort for yourself. Make a difference for the next generations.

You know the sort of thing I mean; little Timmy doesn't yet understand the correlation between numbers and colors, so he just paints the whole page green. Kennedy's work is like that.And the story by John Wagner isn't much better. It's a trilogy of sorts, all putting Fett at the beck and call of a Hutt even more loathsome than Jabba.

The main problem in my view is that the speech is largely unintelligible to Americans. It could just as well be in Japanese or Chinese.

They sound like Britney Spears, with not nearly as much of her own singing as there should have been. There's a difference between being sexy and having side slits on your miniskirt that go all the way up your thighs. Now, I'll admit, I've worn sexy clothes before. I'm not a 35 year old mom with kids who blames Britney Spears for my little girl wanting to dress like a 25 year old stripper. Basically, here's my thing. If you're going to come out and be sweet and pretty and melodic and PG-13, stay that way. If you're going to be sleazy and use your scantily clad body to sell albums, then do it.

I have to point out that \\"as long as you are loving me\\" is such a sweet and wonderful song that deserved more praises that it got.With two great songs opening and closing the albumn, this production is definitely a success.

Another example is his stand on the whole \\"never talk to strangers\\" philosophy. He instead advocates working with your child to learn to assess whether a \\"stranger\\" is ok to talk to.

Despite some others' criticisms, he is not \\"selling fear\\", but rather attempting to dispell unwarranted fear. As with his previous book, The Gift Of Fear, DeBecker speaks authoritatively on a very difficult, and sometimes disheartening topic; the safety and well-being of our children and young people (and our own, as well). With a well-thought-out mix of practical and conceptual content advice, DeBecker gives us all a good hard look at the world of violence toward children.

I thought the third game was amazing, and that the fourth could only turn out better. Well, i guess i was wrong. The greatest thing about the Harry Potter games was how there was so much more than just levels and battles. There was always something to do or explore.

One of the precursors of the late seventies punk movement, Iggy and Co. were lighting a fire underneath every man, woman and child wearing tye dye. If you doubt me, just listen to \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" for proof. Album after album, they delivered high power raucous tunes from beneath the grime.

Actually, do yourself a favor, download I Wanna Be your Dog, Real Cool Time, and Little Doll from iTunes or something. The rest of the tunes on this album are pretty bad and irrelevant. Then go buy the Rhino remastered Funhouse and Iggy's remix of Raw Power. The difference between this album and Funhouse sounds like two different bands.

I've had it for about a month, used it 3 times and it died on me while I was using it the third time. I was trimming my beard when I realized the vibration was getting softer and quieter when it eventually just stopped.

The small shaver is good for removing growth in the parts of the face that you do not want bearded. The trimming system (a small and a large trimmer) are good for trimming beard edges. The large trimmer has a calibrated comb that allows you to trim the hair on the top of the head. That is good for cutting down the number of haircuts that you need. With another setting you can also trim the beard (I wear a fairly short facial beard) The nose and ear hair trimmer works, but not perfectly. It is noisy when you trim in the ears - I was nervous whether there was the potential of damaging hearing. It also requires many passes to get at all the hairs. I use the small trimmer initially to remove long hears and then I follow up with the nose and ear trimmer. The charger is not a hi-tech charger. It only works on US voltages, and there is no protection for the NiCad batteries"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"I've had this \\"system\\" for a couple years now, and I've just had the last straw with it so I threw it against the bathroom wall and smashed it to pieces.

The actual cutting surfaces are dull and pull your hair more than cut it clean. Everytime I use it I end up drawing blood somewhere. It's just cheap... and painful. You can't use it if it is plugged in, which is useless if the battery dies, and it takes a full day to charge. Useless.

But the accessories are made of thin plastic parts. So you have to exercise care when switching them out and when cleaning the whole system. Also, after only using it four times and charging it three times, the rechargeable batteries will not take a charge anymore. Now this almost new trimmer is nothing but a useless paperweight.

The comb guard is so flimsy that you are never sure if it is in right position or how long it will stay there. No surprise the tiny spring broke in a couple of uses.3. The hair length scale is on the wrong side!4. The power cord is so short that you cannot only use the trimmer cordless.5.

I'll admit, when we first got it, it seemed like a dream come true. I wonder if it is worth buying a new one EVERY 6 MONTHS. We have had trimmers before this that have lasted years and the only reason we got the Norelco is that they BEGAN to be dull after all that time and use. I'm very disappointed that this \\"SELF-SHARPENING\\" TRIMMER IS A LIE. We used it regularly maybe once a week.

I tried the other smaller attachment and got the same results. I had a wahl before and never had the issues.

The shaving attachment wouldn't cut butter during the summer in the Sahara. The trimmer grabbed and pulled my hair, and repeatedly cut and stabbed my skin, so much so that it looks like I have minor burns on my face and neck. The UBER CHEAP trimmer attachments that are supposed to allow for precision, known as guide combs, were the worst and most useless part of this waste of raw materials.

I was afraid that because of its age, it might fail on me at a bad time, so when I saw this one which looked very similar, I bought it. Turns out it is identical except for color (the old one is light gray) and the parts will interchange. So now I have a brand new one just like the one I've used and liked for years, plus a bunch of interchangeable spare parts and an spare charger.My only complaint with the new one is the color. After one use, I see why they made their earlier model light gray. The new black one attracts beard trimmings and looks awful after just a short use, especially if your beard is gray. Never even noticed it on the gray one. The new black one is much better looking than the old one, but only for a few moments until you use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, practical, at a very cool price","review":"This product is great, a very good performance for the price.

One day, I dropped it in the sink and it is now completely useless to me because the beard trimmer BROKE! I can use the other attachments , but it is now unable to perform it's main task. For $20 bucks, I didn't expect much, but I certainly expected more. I would advise against this product. The build quality of the main unit is solid, but the attachments are flimsy and break WAY too easily. I own other Norelco products, and I have to say they cut corners wherever they can.

I'm surprised that Norelco would put its name on it. I received it as a Christmas gift and within a week, the adjustment lock on both the beard and hair trimmer had broken so that I could no longer use either on anything but the shortest length. The trimmer itself is adequate, but not up to Wahl or other basic cutters. The parts are mostly plastic and cheaply made. I would not suggest this cutter to anyone. Either spend more money and get something substantial and durable, or spend the same amount on a trimmer without the frills that is better made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Satisfying Surprise.","review":"I purchased this groomer almost a year ago.

Yet I felt compelled to voice my disappointment with this product. I bought this set thinking I was upgrading from my former, standard model in which I don't quite remember the manufacturer. Now I wish I did.The mustache trimmer (the function I bought it for) boasts about it's \\"8 settings\\" but only 4 were actually able to be utilized for a normal-length 'stache. Moving in between the settings required much effort and frustration.Without the attachment, the razor actually pinches the skin! (i've used other razors in which this was not the case). Would NOT recommend using this in \\"vulnerable\\" areas.Overall, this seems pretty advanced if all you're looking to do is maintain short to moderate length facial hair. Keep it simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Trimmer parts break often!","review":"If this trimmer's parts didn't break so easily it'd be a great tool.

So far, Ive used to shave my head and a size 2 haircut for myself as well as facial hair uses and it has been great.The only reason this does not receive a 5 star is because the closest cut isnt very close?

The instructions leave a lot to be desired, and I had to get a magnifying glass (I wear tri-focals) to read some of the instructions and look at the illustrations to assimilate what they meant. Did not feel that they were clear. The first time I used the trimmer, which can be length controlled by a dial, it got stuck on the apparatus it attaches to which is removable so I must use the trimmer in the position that it is dialed. Thank goodness I had dialed it to the length I always use. I am not really excited about the cut it gave or the way the hair looks while growing out. I probably will explore buying another trimmer, and one that does not have all the attachments."},{"rating":"2","title":"swiss army knife of clipping","review":"I've always meant to pick up a clipper. My first purchase was a cheap Wahlthat - while effective - was loud, was a bit awkward to manage with thepower cord, and failed after a few uses.When shopping for a replacement, I opted for the more familiar Norelco nameand the G370. It's small, quiet, and works just great. It's a bitsmaller than expected and requires several passes for an even trim.It's designed to run purely off the rechargeable battery, so plan onletting it charge for 10 hours before initial use or after the batteryruns out. It runs for about 30-40 minutes before requiring recharging.I can't say the instruction booklet was very clear, and it takes a bitof poking around to figure out how things interlock with the accessories;however, it's not rocket science and it is designed rather cleverly.Whether you're saving money on haircuts or pretending you have cancer,this is certainly worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage.","review":"Beware this item is useless in my opinion.

So if you put a little pressure on, you all of a sudden are cutting your beard a lot shorter than you intended.- Got one nasty cut from a bare blade (well, not bare but without any extra guard; the normal way you'd use it to shave your head).- All of the attachments feel cheap and I don't expect them to last.Really sorry I spent money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"just great!","review":"everything i was looking forit is going to be a gift so i havent try it yet but it came in a nice presentation and it is a great item"},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips Norelco G370/60 All-in-1 Grooming System is excellent","review":"I got this grooming kit to replace one a prior Norelco kit I had for years.

The only issue I have with it is the battery. When new it holds a charge for a pretty long time, several head and face trims. But as it gets older its loses charge over a year or two of regular usage. Not a big deal considering the low price.

The book seemed to be in a gray area and very unclear. The only truth that I obtained from \\"E Quake\\" was that Jesus would be with us through everything in our life. Christians know this, and it didn't take 208 pages to bring this new truth forth. Very disappointing!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Revelation of Jesus Christ brings Adoration","review":"As expected, pastor Jack Hayford does a fine job in the book pointing the reader to Christ Jesus as the focus. In the text, he is clear to point out John's testimony of the Revelation of Christ Jesus is understood with a heart of worship. As John admonished in the Revelation, we are reminded to \\"see\\" Christ Jesus for Who He is and to \\"hear\\" what His Holy Spirit is saying to the church. Pastor Jack does a good job of turning our focus upon Jesus, and not the eschatology one often reads or hears when dealing with John's letter. I especially appreciated Hayford's focus on Jesus as the answer for a church found substituting activities for right priorities or promoting religion rather than the grace and glory of God.

In this well written text, Catton covers the footsteps of the army dealing with the loss at Fredericksburg, following Burnside, then Hooker, Chancellorsville and then finally Gettysburg. Catton isn't truly descriptive of the battles and quickly covers the basics, though Catton loves to present the politics involving Union leadership and basically the war itself. While covering the end of 1862 and a majority of 1863, Catton's coverage brings the readers insight to popular sentiment, northern industrialization, the struggles facing the Lincoln administration, the perils of war and much more. Catton never dwells too long a subject and keeps things moving while bringing a bit of humor to uncommon situations or oddities of the war. Catton's books are never boring and either is this one.

The guy got talent!! Most southern rappers today are ONLY rappin about cars, money, girls, jewels... but Chamillionaire is probably one of the best rappers from the south along with Young Bucc, Scarface and T.I. He's rappin about riches but at the same time he's rappin about da streets too. Songs like \\"The Rain\\", \\"Think I m Crazy\\" and \\"Picture Perfect\\" are one of the best from the south rap scene.The beats are tight, the guest appearances are good and best of all most songs got meanings to them (unlike most rappers out today)!Buy the album if u like southern rap or even if u dont like south rappers cuhz unlike other southern rappers Chamillionaire got skills!I think its safe to say that Sound Of Revenge is one of the best albums from the South!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chamillionaire does it again.","review":"This cd is a masterpiece. Koopa is the only GREAT rapper to come out since the passing of Biggie and 2Pac. There's been plenty of really, really good rappers, but no great lyricists. Finally people will understand what Houston rap is all about. They'll realize that people from here don't like Dyke Jones, just people that haven't ever heard good Texas rap do. The guests appearances on here are perfect, too. For all you new Chamillionaire fans, this is definately a great place to start, but you should also pick up everything else he's ever put out (Get Ya Mind Correct, Mix Tape Messiah, Chamillitary, CHC The Army, etc.).

He has an advantage over most of the MC's from Houston or the South for that matter.

(Perhaps as high as 3.5 except as follows.) However, one thing that really needed to be deleted from the book or revised to the extreme is the system for wizards apprenticed to PC's. My biggest issue with the system as presented is that the player can effectively steal experience from the NPC apprentice to make magic items. Does the game really need that many more PC created magic items?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well with 4th edition.","review":"A lot of the ideas in this book are interesting, but it's clear that the authors did not think carefully abut the design philosophy. The result is a big burden for the DM.The powers, feats, and classes presented in this book are more in line with edition 3.5, and do not work well for 4th edition. For example, there are many powers that give substantial bonuses to attack rolls, but it is clear that in 4th edition these should be rare. Another example are encounter powers that impose severe save ends status effects, but it is pretty clear that these effects should be limited to daily attack powers.Some of the stuff is okay, but most of it is horrendously overpowered.

Beall's work is as relevant and fresh today as it was 40 years ago. His logo for the International Paper Co. is in my opinion one of the best examples of identity you will ever see, and its development is documented well in this book.

I've noticed that Koontz's books open with some of horror's most thrilling chapters. Often, however, Koontz's books can sag in the middle, sometimes so much that I'm unable to complete the novel. Darkfall is not one of those. Darkfall delivers thrills from beginning to end.

Our cop hero is Jack Dawson, a detective who is working with his new partner Rebecca Chandler (who happens to be that love interest) on a puzzling murder case. In the wintery depths of New York City, members of the major drug-traffic organization are all showing up dead--and in gruesome fashion--except that they weren't shot, stabbed, or choked, but \\"bitten\\" to death. Jack and Rebecca realize that they aren't dealing with a usual killer, but a force that has the power to do much more damage than any human being. This story is certainly too far-fetched, even for Koontz, especially with the added voodoo aspect of the tale and how it eventually becomes the focus of the novel. Only for those dedicated to Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"In this book, Koontz proves that he is one of the best.","review":"I'm 16 years old and I've fallen in love with reading Koontz's novels.

This novel was drop dead awesome, in fact perhaps 9 is a little unfair. The story delivers a cool plot, characters that you not only believe in, but that you want to believe in, and a battle that is so ambitious that only the most skilled and articulate of writers would dare so much as an attempt. The only thing I disliked was the lack an an actual battle. Instead, there is more of a spiritual confrontation, and perhaps that is most appropriate when one considers the nature of the adversary.

Some believe rats are the cause of this but can a normal rat really cause this much Terror?...Dean Koontz is as interesting as his books.I believe this book is very nerve rattling: everytime you think something is going to happen, something totally different surprises you. Everytime you think you have figured the book out and understand everything it all changes and makes you draw new conclusions. I do think that you must have a large imagination for this book and if your not into suspense and Horror this book isn't for you. I have read many horror books in the past and would recommend this book to everyone that needs an entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always something happenning","review":"I found Darkfall to be very enjoyable. If this had been the first Dean Koontz (DK) book that I had read then I would definitely have given it a 5 star rating but having read most of DK's books, I gave it 4 stars. I reduced the rating knowing that he has written better work but it is still a very good read. The story is non stop action so gets you in quickly. It may be unrealistic but it is never boring. He has the most amazing imagination and style of writing. When I read his books, I can picture all he writes and feel the emotion and tension. It's like having a movie playing in my head.

The bodies appear to be chewed and mangled.Turns out, a voodoo bad guy is out to get the crimeboss and he sends out little demon/goblins to do his dirty deeds.Because the police are hunting for answers, the voodoo man decides to turn the goblins on them; specifically, the children.This makes \\"police man\\" angry and now it's all or nothing. Which man will die?Throw in a few vague references about the devil, God, and hell and you've got a very sub-par Koontz novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I usually like Koontz, but not this one. There is absolutely no suspense, no mystery, and the characters are one dimensional. The most shocking thing in the book had nothing to do with the creatures or voodoo-- it was to find out that the two bland leading characters had feelings for each other.I almost always finish books (including other Koontz books) in one or two sittings. This has been sitting around for a couple of months. I eventually got all the way to the last chapter and haven't yet been motivated enough to read these last five pages.:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. I wouldn't.","review":"This is my first Dean Koontz book and I have to say, it was just terrible. The dialog was just pitiful, the characters were shallow, utterly unbelievable, predictable, and incredibly lame. The conversations between the children and Rebecca, the main characters romantic interest, are painful to say the least. Its beyond me how anyone can defend this book. By the end my friends and I were literally laughing out loud. I got this used as a book on tape for a 1700 mile drive and it barely kept me awake. I'm going to give Koontz one more chance, but take it from me this is not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Koontz' Best","review":"On the positive, the Koontz is very good at writing and pacing the chase scenes. But in writing, he seemed rushed in finishing the novel with an abrupt ending. The character's dialogue seemed kind of 'comic bookish' and stale. The main characters aren't well-developed and seem two dimensional. Koontz is good at action, and the chase scene maintained my interest. But, does anyone see any close similarities between this novel and 'Servants of Twilight'? The chase seemed very similar to me, even down to the blizzard. For a better read, I recommend 'Intensity'. I thought this was a much better novel, with better characters and greater suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Scary but a Great Action Thriller","review":"DarkfallBy Dean KoontzHomicide detective Jack Dawson has been thrown into the middle of a battle between a mafia family and the man who seeks revenge for the death of his brother, this is no ordinary war between factions the man who wants revenge is a Bocor a man who specializes in the the dark side of voodoo. If Jack Dawson does not stop he risks the life of his children and the woman he loves but if he does stop he will never be able to live with himself.I know that this novel is supposed to be scary but though it is a thriller for sure it is far from scary small rodent like creatures that lurk in the shadows with sharp pointy teeth, creepy yes, but scary no. Dean Koontz is a great writer though, he manages to bring to life these creatures and add to the fact that these people are trapped by a blizzard it is a fun action thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darkfall: A Dark Disappointment","review":"This is NOT a Koontz classic!

She left the room.For being a legend storyteller, Dean dropped this one big time! Perhaps because it was one of his earlier works-is the reason for the simplistic approach and plot. One thing for sure, you'll be fast asleep by 9:00pm - instead of the typical Koontz 2:30am page-turner.

But the rest of the story was very poorly written. The main characters were incredibly two dimensional and the dialogue was some of the worst I've ever read. Audible groaning is usually a sign that a book is bad for me. Death threat on your kids? Not to worry, you still have time for a giddy, childish romp with one of the worst written females in novel history. Good idea but bad execution, this truly is Koont's dark fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember Biloxi Blues???","review":"Do you remember the movie Biloxi Blues, starring Matthew Broderick and christopher Walken? This book was exactly the same in terms of a story that takes off in flying colors then completely deflates. It GRABBED my imagination immediately! Within the first few chapters it genuinely tweaked my curiosity hook, line and sinker. I was mesmerized; great suspense. Did I mention this was within the first few chapters? Yeah. The rest of the book went flat and cheesy, especially when voodoo magic came into play. I probably could have lived with that, had the main character not become an instant master himself, saving the day with his own pure self-sacrifice of blood. Sigh. What a weak, unimaginative ending.

Overall the cup is pretty nice. My little boy loves to drink from it and press the button so it lights up.The reason I gave the cup only two stars is that the straw has major issues. The problem comes when I slide close the lid to throw the cup in the diaper bag. When I try to open the straw portion back up the straw gets pushed back too. By this I mean the straw is caught in the sliding portion of the lid. Sometimes I can pull it back out but there have been times I have had to remove the top portion of the cup and pull the straw completely out and reinsert it to fix the problem.I've personally solved this issue by just using the cup around the house and therefore eliminating any reason to slide close the lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"I like this purchase for our 6 month old since she is starting to learn how to drink out of a cup and I like the fact that the straw makes her learn and at the same time, the water will not spill out of it if it is turned upside down. The lights and sparkles are just added fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quietly Menacing","review":"The release of Christie Malry's Own Double Entry, a soundtrack, and The Oliver Twist Manifesto, a solo album, within weeks of each other confirms Luke Haines place - at least in Britain - as an agent provocateur of modern music. Christie Malry's Own Double Entry is the soundtrack to a film about modern terrorism, a subject that has haunted Haines work with both The Auteurs and Baader Meinhof. The instrumental work is quietly menacing - loads of strings and glockenspiel. The vocal tracks are cynical, as always, and more grim than usual. \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\", with the Winchester Cathedral Choir, is horrific yet beautiful, and his remake of Nick Lowe's \\"(I Love the Sound of) Breaking Glass\\" a masterstroke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but.....","review":"These placemats are very beautiful and well made but they have a very strong odor.

The story never seemed to gel either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgia creates such good memories... but...","review":"Nostalgia creates such good memories... but... if one is to be honest, this film is really quite bad. Yes it's interesting to see a very young Laura Dern and Diane Lane but it certainly wasn't as funny or poignant as I remember. It's also odd that many a young female post-punk hopeful find this film such an inspiration when ultimately the movie is about anything but music. I liked Waybill and Welnick, but their parts were tiny, and everyone else's performance was entirely forgettable. When you're 16 this movie might be good, when you're older it's quite horrendous. Maybe that's the point? Either way I was basically reminded of what a lousy era for music the early 80's really were, and that no matter how good the memories you associate with a given film or music, it doesn't make that film or music particularly good.If this is an official DVD release, there'd better be a slew of compelling special features to counter-balance the main feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Next to \\"The Great Rock n Roll Swindle\\", and perhaps equally as \\"D.O.A.-A Right of Passage\\", this film is a top must have for any punk aficionado. The fictional band in the film, The Looters, features 2 sex PistOls (Paul Cook and Steve Jones) and Clash bassist Paul Simonon performing incredible rock, with 2 songs unavailable on any recording. It's worth it for that alone.The film also stands on it's own. A very young Diane Lane (pre- \\"Outsiders\\") turns in a solid performance, and The Tubes Fee Waybil is funny as a Paul Stanley type rocker. Also of note is Brit actor Ray Winstone, who plays the Looters' frontman. As far as underground rebel rock movies go, it doesn't get much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhino to release \\"Fabulous Stains\\" on DVD this fall","review":"Rhino is working on a fall 2008 release, tentatively set for Sept. 30.

It's part rock 'n' roll/media satire, part After School Special on post-feminism, occasionally silly, occasionally overly earnest.

The DVD though is a total wash . The captioning doesn't work, the photo gallery doesn't exist . If you must have a copy of this, wait until a major studio releases it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disorganized","review":"After some years in the IC design business (mostly analog) I needed to teach a course on ASICSs. This book was the text specified by my predecessor. I did not like the book, and eventually read the Weste and Harris book in its 3rd edition. Wolf is not nearly as clear, complete and logically organized as Weste and Harris - no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking lack of editorial oversight","review":"This could be a great book but it is let down by truly awful editing. Wolf writes well but his clarity is lost in the sea of mistakes that made it to press. The text often refers to the wrong figure or to one not present, figures are duplicated, formulas have mistakes in them (including easy to find errors like mismatched parenthesis), node and component names are renamed in place but not another, etc., etc.Basically the editors were asleep at the wheel. In general you will spend easily as much time trying to weed out the numerous mistakes as you will actually learning anything. Or worse give up thinking that the subject matter is beyond you.How this book made it to third edition in such a raw state is beyond me and a black mark on Prentice Hall's usually excellent editorial reputation. Do yourself a favor and avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gattaca Works in English Classroom","review":"As a a high school English teacher, I look for ways to engage my students in not only literature, but ethical debates. After teaching Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, I showed Gattaca. We worked together to compare the two main characters. They were with me 100% and really began to explore their moral values concerning genetic engineering. The film is top-notch in terms of acting, cinematography, and plot. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT SCI-FI","review":"This movie is completely mesmerizing, from its intelligent, thought-provoking script, to its eminently watchable cast and its profound humanity. The stylish look and feel of the movie, with its cool locations set in the not-too-distant future, nevertheless feel very real; indeed the whole premise feels entirely possible. Jude Law, lately of The Talented Mr. Ripley, is simply spectacular in a role that requires an actor of great power. I never understood why this film did not do much better in its initial release; it is a science fiction film with a heart and a brain, more in the realm of Contact. And the Michael Nyman musical score (The Piano)underscores the proceedings with an intensely melancholy theme, punctuating the sadness and triumphs of people not too different from ourselves caught in a world that seems to have forgotten what makes humans human."},{"rating":"1","title":"chopped off the end","review":"I'm sorry, this review is not for the movie itself (an excellent 5-star movie) but this particular version of it. The end of the movie, I believe, it the most powerfull part of it: a list of the people who would not be born if these were our ways, and the message \\"the other birth that certainly would not have taken place, is your own\\". This is the entire point of the movie, and for some rediculous reason, has been removed from this version. Don't tell me they couldn't fit the last 20 seconds onto a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie... but it took so long to come out","review":"I think that Gattica had a great plot and was very realistic. Unlike some science fiction films which are very unrealistic. I don't like movies where you can spot the benting of the laws of phisics (no I am NOT a nerd its just annoying) also it wasn't about space wars it was a underprivleged person who does what he can to accomplish his dream. The only falt I had with the movie is that it took 2 years to make it for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing themes/ messages here","review":"I was thoroughly enjoying this film until the last five minutes. No spoilers, but the end undermined the entire theme that I thought was building throughout. The protagonist Vincent does not create a new system and prove this draconian genetic world wrong. He instead finds a way to simply get ahead within the system. I compare this to Bradbury's classic work, Fahrenheit 451, that depicts a similar draconian, oppressive world, but gives us an entirely different ending. I will not even discuss the message the character of Eugene and his end sends to disabled people..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good flick...","review":"A terrific modern, sci-fi adventure that's great to watch and makes you think when it's over. Gattaca, along with The Matrix and Dark City, belong to a new type of science fiction - presenting compelling, disturbing, alternate realities. In the case of Gattaca, however, part of what makes the movie so terrific (aside from Uma Thurman) is the tremendous attention to cinematographic detail that's evident, right down to the neo-futuristic Karmen Ghia-looking car. Definitely some lurking Kubrick influence here. But unlike Kubrick's film, this one doesn't have any of those slow parts or deliberate dialogue. The most suprising part about the movie, when you stop to think about it, is how little sic-fi is actually in it... but don't stop, go out and get this movie. it'll be a terrific addition to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gattaca (1997)","review":"Written and directed by Andrew Niccol, this provocative sci-fi thriller envisions a world in which society is fixated on genetics and human-enhancement, and everyone of privileged social standing is classified as either a \\"valid\\"--one who is genetically sound--or an \\"in-valid\\"--one whose genotype is lesser than that of a valid's. Gattaca is a strong and very intellectual film that poses questions regarding destiny and our society's burdening quest for perfection. It features an enticing cast (which includes Uma Thurman, Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, and Alan Arkin), a stimulating premise, and fervent execution of the done-over murder-thriller plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gattaca","review":"I used this movie in my, \\"Intro to Moral Philosophy\\" class.

No option for running commentary?! What, you think I'm stupid and don't know what most other DVDs have? Do we have an elitist director never saying a blessed word even during a production documentary about his own movie ever?

Enter Ethan Hawke, the \\"human\\" who wants to go to Titan, one of the moons of Jupiter, but to do so has to convince Gattaca, the corporation involved, that he is a genetically enhanced human. He \\"borrows\\" the vital fluids of a crippled VALID, played nicely by Jude Law, and manages to get to the top of the list of space travelers. The murder of an important director, however, may be his undoing, as his true identity becomes more and more revelant. Critically acclaimed as one of the more intelligent of sci-fi films of the nineties, GATTACA is competently done, with nice performances from Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin and Loren Dean, but ultimately its leisurely pace and lack of true surprises makes it merely an exercise in style with a potential message overshadowed by its manipulation. Not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for insomnia","review":"This film has lots going for it - a fine soundtrack (Michael Nyman), some interesting sets, even Uma Thurman. . . But it is fantastically dull.The basic premise, outlined in detail elsewhere, has been far more entertainingly explored in films like Blade Runner, and 'The Boys from Brazil'.If you're seeking some intelligent dystopia, try 'Brazil' - or if you're really highbrow, read 'The Man in the High Castle', or 'Brave New World'.I hate to slag off a film that has so much going for it (it is good to see Alan Arkin and Gore Vidal up there on the silver screen), but to be honest, I found this lacking in any depth whatsoever. I can hear the groans from here, but I found 'Paycheck' a lot more thought-provoking. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gattaca's genes are \\"Perfect.\\"","review":"As a script writer and student of film, I know how hard it is to convey a futuristic storyline believably and have it contain touches of suspense, humor, romance, and humanity and have it ALL work. \\"Gattaca\\" is a story about flawed people who have great spirits, yet \\"Gattaca\\" itself is as unflawed as any science fiction film ever made. Every scene cleverly pushes the story along and twists many different ideas and possibilities together like a perfect length of rope.The visuals of Gattaca are breathtaking and capture the time of the story in a way that is futuristic but comparable to present day. The acting is perfect for the story and it will touch you from the very opening scene. As far as science fiction stories go, this is as good as any, EVER. If you don't see Gattaca, you've missed out. Also accompanied by a wonderful score. Simply brilliant. Buy it, because if you rent it, you'll wind up buying it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good movie.

It explores various avenues of social class and instability and shows truly how a person can overcome these instances. The best thing about this film is that it is set in the future yet, it feels like it is happening today. Michael Nyman, the composer of the score, does an excellent job in setting the mood.

It is truly an awesome piece of cinema that makes you think about the quality of our lives. The entire movie had an unreal amount of erotism and mystique that kept me glued to the screen.

The plot is totally modern though - what would happen if genetic engineering of humans became de rigueur for all those that could afford it. The film plays out the absurdity and the horror that this way of life would lead to. It is a pretty cold film, lots of polished metal and cool emotions.

For instance, what's that that those guys do in that room tapping computers keyboards ramdomly while watching a pre-rendered 3D animation of a space flight? And how is that we're able to flight really far away in space and have machines that can read the whole ADN map in seconds and we're still unable to cure a broken back? I could go on the 1000 words limit of this review telling all the easily spotting fails of the really weak script but I don't want to spoil the movie to those who hasn't seen it. It's an OK movie to hire on a boring Sunday afternoon or to watch it on cable, but believe me, if you're intelligent enough to notice that Episode I has quite a flop script you'll regret buying this.

I found it painfully boring, trite and almost campy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not remotely compelling","review":"Gattaca has a fascinating premise, but lousy execution, because the director forgot the single most important precept of movie-making: the audience must have an emotional relationship with the protagonist. There are no likable characters in this movie. Not a one. Sure, both Ethan and Uma are fantastic LOOKING, but that's the point of genetic selection anyhow. Their choices, their lives, their whining about the limitations on their priviledged life... none of it speaks to an actual human.Brazil did it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy movie","review":"Was dissapointed with this one.

Don't get me wrong, this film deserves 6 stars if there was such a thing, but the Superbit DVD is absolutely awful. There are no special features, only the movie and captions. No special features means no trailers, notes, commentary, or deleted scenes; just about everything that makes DVDs feel worth buying. Not to sound melodramatic or anything, but I feel so cheated and heart-broken by buying the Superbit version of Gattaca. So this is just a warning to everyone hoping to own this masterpiece on DVD: DO NOT BUY THE SUPERBIT VERSION!... BUY THE REGULAR DVD!... NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE EXTRA FEATURES BUT IT'S ALSO CHEAPER TOO!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent example of an amazing movie","review":"I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it.

Other than a very minor leak in the bar oiler line, it's performed very well. As a woodturner, I frequently rip through the side-grain of large logs (up to 30\\"Dx30\\"L) then crosscut and trim to roundish blanks. It's been a very good saw and worth the money.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it doesn't have the high chain speed of my Stihl 036 - which is like a hot rod of a saw.

I thought the story was about a cowboy-one of Palmer's infamous Long Tall Texans-it's about a secret agent. When you read the back cover the heroine's name is not the same as the inside.This book was clearly not read by any of the editors at MIRA. There were little inconsistent things throughout the text that drove me absolutely crazy.Pass this book up, and wait for a reprint of one of her older books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame!","review":"Ms. Palmer has been writing on automatic pilot for a long time now and this book is Exhibit A. Same type of virtually-misogynous hero, irritating heroine, totally predictable story. Evidently Ms. Palmer has a huge following -- or had one at one time. Maybe she should try showing them a little respect and write a story that doesn't follow her usual formula, doesn't have a hero and heroine one can barely tolerate and a story that actually has a surprise or two! Currently she is a disgrace to romance-book storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful love story of two strong people...Read it !","review":"I read all that I can of Diana Palmer and \\"Paper Rose\\" didn't disappoint me at all.Tate has such sex appeal and Cecily is just the woman that can interest him for a life time.

Diana Palmer brings her characters to life and develops a personality for each character making you grow to not only know them, but to love, understand, and enjoy them. There are some scenes in the book that can be described as \\"sickinly sweet;\\" however, she makes up for these parts by adding humor in just the right places and even a serious, unseen turn of events. The novel even has a bit of suspense and definitely will touch your heart. Overall I feel that Diana Palmer did a great piece of work with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This author touches the soul ...","review":"This is the first Palmer book that I have read in years and I was not disappointed.

I have read Ms.Palmer for years and I was disappointed in Tate & Cecily's story. What century does this woman come from? Tate was lukewarm at best, we all knew he would wack off his hair(heaven forbid if we had a long-haired hero). Colby was far more dangerous and had more sex appeal than anyone else in this story!

This is the third book that I have bought in the past 1.5-2 years that have totally disappointed me.

It is informative and has many practical applications from household to health to cooking.

The \\"basic\\" kit and \\"travel\\" kit are a great general collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not there","review":"This is a good reference book for the physical aspects of aromatherapy. However all positives stop there. She does not explain the oils and their function or contradictions. There is nothing about the effects of the oils on emotions or moods. The recipes include too many oils as I was taught the more simple the recipe the more effective, I.E no more than three E.O's, this book has recipes that have over 6 different oils, and she fails to explain why the oils in the recipe work. Not one mention of Rosewood or Ylang ylang. I disagree with the selection of oils. Over all I was disappointed with this book. It's a good book for a home remedy kit. Not a good book for an Aromatherapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poison for the Cat","review":"I was excited to get this book - until I turned to the chapter on cats. The advice there flys in the face of well-documented information about feline metabolism and liver function.

I will give this book 5 stars in my Kindle review.If you don't own a Kindle, by the book anyway, it is that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit old fashioned!","review":"Its exactly the same as The Fragrant Pharmacy of the same author! I had originally purchased this book based on the recommendations from the website as I was purchasing the Frangrant Pharmacy and the Fragrant Mind. I am now returning all as I find them a bit old fashioned with their choise of ingredients. I believe there is more to the world of aromatherapy than Lavender, Teatree, Peppermint, Chamomile, Eucalyptus, Geranium, Rosemary, Thyme, Lemon and Clove. If anything they are my bottom 10 in essential oils! I absolutely hate Lavender (reminds me of stale nanas!) and it features in pretty much most of the recipes. For a more contemporary flavour, try Judy Chapman's books.

Heck, it was even in my health food store. This book is disjointed, assumes you have oodles of money for 50 plus oils, and gives vague instructions on the way to use these. It may be clear if you already know about this subject. For me, I need a step by step understanding of how to proceed.

It is extraordinarily detailed and extensive in its use of essential oils but is not so esoteric that it is not useful to the beginner. I am cautious about the value of such information though. While the traditional use of essential oils can be soundly based on results achieved over centuries this does not necessarily apply to all the essential oils.

Anyone with her expertise should have known this. And for this reason alone, I give her only 1 star. I am not an expert, but by doing my own research before starting aromatherapy, I found out about cats how fatal oils can be for them. I hate to think of how many cats became ill or died because of her and I don't even own a cat, just dogs. It just sickens me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book for beginners","review":"I was not satisfied with this book.

Many complaints are due to the fact that many readers did not take the time to further research exactly what they needed and just expected this book to provide answers to thier varied problems. Personally, I have found this book to be of great help for myself, my customers, family and friends. There is a great receipe for in-grown hairs, herbal teas and preventative measures for acne. NO this is not an answer all book but it has been useful to my business. The herb salve that I now make has gotten rave reviews. I not only used this book as a reference, but I also did further research to ensure that the information was valid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Incomplete book of Essential Oils ...

I have sawed through a 2x4 with the Charge saw in seconds, the knife can cut anything thrown at it, the serrated knife is a beast, and the cutting hook can tackle the toughest wires. The tools inside are a plus too, I carry around the bit pieces for the screwdrivers and I have never encountered a need to carry screwdrivers around anymore!

There are hundreds of people saying that this has happened to them with the Cybershot cameras, but since my model number wasn't included in the \\"recall\\" for free repair, no one will help. Their customer service stinks. I can pay to send it in to them and pay more than I paid for the camera to get it fixed, or I can trash it and start over.

When the cameras arrived, they did not include media cards which I assume was part of the reason for the lower price. I find this practive deceptive. When you buy a camera, you assume you are at least being provided what is needed to allow basic functions. I was also promised express delivery on my order due to the amount. Instead of the 2-3 day shipping I was expecting, the order took several days to arrive. I thought I was saving time and money, but probably would have been more satisfied by just going to a local store and purchasing the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Picture....but Poor stability","review":"You got to have extremely steady hand, or camera stand to use this camaera.During my niece wedding, I put in a 2GB of memory and we were trigger happy, we must have took over couple hundred of pictures, however, I am very unhappy about the result. 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy, messy, out of focus.On the other hand, for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand, you got a great picture.Size is good, weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size, but to some people that's good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrary to Good Attributes ... wouldn't buy again","review":"Loved everything about this camera... smart looking, took amazing photos with no effort, etc., etc., etc.But it didn't hold up... a few days after initial warranty expired, the camera zoom lens stuck, and kept given a message to 'restart' ... then it would stick again .. The lens doesn't retract back into the body, even with the power off and battery removed. Have followed all instructions and get nowhere. The camera was never dropped, never abused, and always cased when not in use.Not worth the price to even have it evaulated, plus repairs and/or parts ...

Yes I know to hold the halfway for a second to let it focus, it doesn't matter. It's still blurry. The settings are on auto. I've tried other settings it's the same result.A waste of 350+ dollars. My old camera (that had a mechanical flaw so I returned it) was much better, with less megapixels (Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX7). Unfortunately with Sony's camera, I had the feeling it was blurry, but didn't return it in time. Big mistake.In the end it's all about the lens, not so much megapixels.I'll never buy from Sony again. It's overpriced, overmarketed and shoddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived enjoyment","review":"I have just bought the Sony Cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and I have only taken 30-40 pictures, I loved it and then it just stopped working, so I recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. So Thankfully I had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. No it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. Basically worthless. It seems like it might have short circuited. But I was so excitted to buy this camera I read all instructions before use, I haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. SO I am going to try to return it or exchange it. I am hoping to get good service or I will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures.

(I thought the German ambassador was actually played by Lang but apparently not -- they could have been twins.) If you cannot predict the ending from several timezones away, you are not actually alive.I was eagerly awaiting this DVD and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap (even with George Sanders and John Carradine -- maybe I can wash my mind out by watching Viaggio in Italia instead and for the umpteenth time).Anyone want a DVD used once?

The result was a movie that bore little or no resemblance to the original story, and that's a shame, because \\"Rogue Male\\" is a whopper of a story, a real page turner. The movie is almost nothing like it.As a stand-alone movie, \\"Manhunt\\" is okay, but I would recommend that you NOT read the book first, because you will be sorely disappointed by the film.

So you have to enter the set up and change the contrast a lot, and it is still hard to read after playing with this adjustment. Worse display ever. Also, no real built in mic, so you either use earphones or hang this \\"thing\\" around your neck (the supplied portable speaker). What would be nice is an audible built in speaker so you could hold it up to your ear and hear the phrase pronounced, and then try speaking it yourself. Handwriting recognition was also terrible.

Most of the MagicImage books are now collectors items and sell for outrageous amounts on the internet.

Ok, I then put a thermometer inside the unit and closed it up for an hour. The external display showed 41 but the thermometer I placed inside was showing 52. This is all done inside a 78 degree home. I'm more inclined to believe my thermometer then the display. I placed 3 chilled 16oz water bottles inside and left them overnight. Took them out in the morning and they where cool, but not cold. The 32 degree claim on the box is pure puffery in my opinion. The 40-45 degree drop from ambient temperature is also was not confirmed in my test. I'm returning this unit.

Be aware this item only comes with the auto-plug feature, the optional wall plug is only if you buy it seperately, that is, if you can find it.The fridge comes with a temperature display that has never worked, the cup holder is a cheap, roughly hewn soda-can holder that flips open akwardly from the top of the front panel.I have also found the fridge to be miserably under-powered. ALL it will do is lower the ambient temperature of the room slightly, and if you place items in the fridge that aren't pre-chilled, you're wasting your time if the mini-fridge isn't kept in a briskly-chilled room or car.If ever I was to regret a purchase, this is definitely it.To note, I have not tried using the warming feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for drinks!","review":"The frig arrived in perfect condition and looks very nice.

He discusses the history behind each of the councils, including the theological conflicts leading to them. He details the statements of each of the councils and explains the meaning in simple language. He highlights the heresies combated by the councils and goes into some detail regarding the theological issues behind the conflicts. This book is an excellent resource for study of the Trinity and the nature of Jesus as fully God and fully man. The seventh council deals with icons, and Toon offers a well-written account of the conflict relating to icons in the church. This book is highly recommended as offering clear examples of what is orthodox Christianity regarding views of the Trinity especially.

The camera is in a locked position and does not allow you to feel like you're in the game. It's like a really lame version of Gauntlet Legends. The AI are horrendous but are necessary for some of the missions. The game does not follow the book or movie very closely. Altogether it's not worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"ditto","review":"I was a bit disappointed, it was like the last game I played only a few more things added to it....but I am a true fan and played it anyway...go harry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goblet of Fire - Big Disappointment","review":"I had high hopes for this game after playing/beating Prizoner of Azkaban several times. I was looking forward to finding new clues and searching the castle some more...but this game is a big-time letdown.The best part about it is that you can play 3 players at a time. You can't switch between the characters; you are forced to choose one at the beginning of a round.Go out and rent the game - don't buy it!! I'm interested to see how bad they screw up Order of the Phoenix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goblet of Fire is a disappointment","review":"The Harry Potter games just got better and better with each new release - until The Goblet of Fire - when the standard went into rapid reverse. Prisoner of Azkeban was suberb and expectations were high for the Goblet of Fire. What a let down ! The camera angle is limited and irritating in the extreme. There is very little interaction with the other characters and you can't explore the school that we have now become so familar with. The flying experience, speeding ahead of the dragon, is from a bygone era compared to the Hippogriff flying in the Prisoner of Azkeban. I just wish that E.A. games has stuck with the winning formula they had. I had hoped for this to be even better in the new game. More of the same would have been so much better than this step backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"You must be thinking that this game is very cool,you get to play the three tasks and face voldemort. BUT NO! you do not face voldemort in this game. Voldemort just summonds these skulls and you have to kill them.Youu dont really duel him at all.THe three tasks are bad too. The first task you have to run away from the dragon on your broom. THats fun. But the other two are not. YOU just collect gillyweed in the second task. Thats all. The third task is HORRIBLE! You just fight 2 monsters.Thats all. You cant even go around hogwarts. You just keep beating levels. EA games made a piece of JUNK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY WOWOWOW","review":"It's about time. A fun Harry Potter Game. What you have heard is true. This is an action Harry Potter game. I love it. It will keep the attention of anyone who has not been a fan in the past. This is because this is an action game where as the other potter games have been a hunt for and talk to collect-a-thon. Is there talking this time? Yes, but only while you are fihghting. In fact, you do not have to read anything if you do not want to. Excellent audio samples and voice acting. The game is fast, fun and creative. You will casts numerous spells. A big complaint has been that you don't pick your spells, you just always press the same button and perform whatever spell fits the situation. BUt I like it. It would slow down the action if you had to go through some menu, and it would limit the spells if they were limited to the number of buttons.Bottom line: Great action game. If you remotely like the series, you will finaly love the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally different style than first 3...","review":"If you liked the first 3 harry potter games because of the exploring, hunting, puzzle solving, etc. this is NOT the game for you.

The biggest blunder seems to be in the summary of holocaust casualties. The author left out the fact that 3 Million Polish-Catholics were butchered by Hitler. This fact is often forgotten, and very hurtful, especially to the Poles who lost someone in the Polish holocaust or \\"Forgotten Holocaust.\\". A great book to read is Richard Lukas' \\"The Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles Under nazi Occupation.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Surviving Hilter","review":"Surviving Hilter is a great book.

Although it was hard to get through knowing that there was people out there that could do such cruel things to an individual with no remorse. Every time I read up on the concentration camps and the stories of all the victims of the Holocaust, it just makes everything seem so unreal. It's such a detailed and amazing book you are almost in awe of the character.

The reader follows a young boy named Jack through the start of WWII. He is ripped from his happy home in Poland at the ripe age of twelve, and put through things that no one is this lifetime can imagine. The hardships Jack endured, never broke his spirit or desire for survival, so that he could one day reunite with his family. He was sent from concentration camp to concentration camp and yet he remained as positive as possible thriving on his memories. The ending offers a clear picture of how WWII affected families from many different countries. This book will touch anyone's heart as they sympathize with Jack. It will also remind students of how easy it is to go from simple discrimination, to a complete lack of humanity. Valuable discussions, emotions, and connections to history can be made by reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boy Who Lived Through The Holocaust","review":"Surviving Hitler was great story and I liked it. I would recommend this book to people who may want to learn about the past and about history. I think the book was exciting. I think it was exciting because I liked when the author described everything, like the dark black smoke from the cremation of the dead prisoners. When I was reading the book my mind kept on wandering off to where they were in the story. When they talked about pulling the wagon through the mud, I pictured it and it looked like they were having a hard time pulling it and getting stuck a lot. I didn't really like to read about history until I read this story. I hope other people will read this and enjoy it just like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Other reviews said they were disappointed because the blades are plastic. I was not.

There's nothing overly modern or creative being explored here, with most of the tracks just meandering along. The one good song on the album, \\"Love Is the Law\\", also happens to be the most driven and catchy with subtle punk nuances that would foreshadow the bands heavier, more grunge-influenced direction with their follow up album 'Life Explodes'.I wouldn't call this a bad album, especially if classic/funk rock is the kind of music you like. It's just, for the most part, boring to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice CD","review":"I own quite a few CD's of Les' work, and this is the best I have heard. Certainly, out of all his CD's this one affords his soloists--which are all top notch (ie: \\"Mr. Clarinet,\\" Buddy DeFranko, Frank Rosolino, Zoot Sims, etc.)the most room to say what they have to say. Many times I am dissappointed with the amount of solo room his sidemen get--because they are all so good, and the commercial nature of his work, and this CD does some to counter that. Also note that the band as a whole swings a little more than usual, the brass has more sting, the chords slightly more dissonant--good stuff! I would most certainly recommend this CD to anyone who has the slightest interest in quality big band music. For Les, it's slighlty more swingy and a tad less commercial that usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I found this book average. There are a lot of Photoshop books on the market and this one didn't really stand out in any way. I totally agree with the person that called this book flaky.

The story mode is better than the PC version but it isn't as good as GRAW. The graphics are awesome and much better than the drab graphics of the previous console versions. Enviroments provide the right atmosphere for each mission. Character models look great. One of the best features of this game is on previous consoles , which is the swap with other characters feature which doesn't make the game extremely hard. Using vehicles isn't hard at all, just move the analog stick and there you go. Some missions can be hard, but no matter how hard they are there is definetly a way to get past it, for example the third mission where you are a sniper, you have to snipe every living thing and i'm definetly not the best sniper, so this mission was hard for me but I beat it.

The Xbox360 achievements are extremely challenging to get but really inspire you to play the game better. To get them all you have to master every soldier class and vehicle. The achievements are split fairly evenly between multiplayer and single player modes.The single player mode is alright but you'll probably spend most (if not all) of your time playing over Xbox Live.

Instead I found a run-of-the-mill NFL Highlights film that's maybe 25 minutes long. It does absolutely no justice to the real game. Yes, some plays can be seen from multiple angles. Yes you can choose to hear play-by-play from the Denver or Green Bay announcers, but only occasionally - what you listen to mostly is hyberbole from the NFL narrator. Finally, this DVD demonstrates a dark side of DVD's: when you pop the DVD in, you are immediately subject to a 3 minute advertisement for RCA - WHICH CANNOT BE SKIPPED. All DVD controls are disabled for the duration of this advertisement. And if you watch the highlights film to the end, you'll get to watch the advertisement again, whether you want to or not! This DVD should have cost 2.99, not 20.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this DVD","review":"As a lifetime Bronco fan I was hoping for a DVD video of the game. Instead this is nothing more than a highlight film and a poor one at that. There is no continuity and it's hard to follow, even when you already know the plays in the game. A waste of money. Guess I'll have to stick with my own VHS recording for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Bronco Fans","review":"Even though I was expecting to receive the whole game on DVD and not just the highlights, the DVD image quality compared to VHS and its other features make this a must for any Broncos fan. While everyone has seen the video replay of Elway's famous \\"helicopter\\" dive for a first down late in the 4th quarter to set up the winning score, this DVD let's you see it from 8 different camera angles. Moreover, NFL films does a great job on many other key plays of the game. For those Bronco fans who want to keep the memories alive forever of the greatest Super Bowl ever played (no other Super Bowl has been tied 3 times--at 7, 17, and 24) the quality of this DVD, versus the VHS tapes which came out after the game, make this a must to own and enjoy every year at Super Bowl time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For jazz enthusiasts","review":"The Visit a new compelling drama by director Jordan-Pearlman starring Billie Dee Williams and Hill Harper. The soundtrack is a stunning collection of Jazz and Gospel. For jazz enthusiasts and all around music lovers this assortment of songs is as compelling and as emotionally charged as the film. With songs by Nnenna Freelon, Joe Sample, Lalah Hathaway, Wallace Roney, Ramsey Louis and Joe Williams, the album is a true sonic compliment to the on screen performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mortal remains","review":"Very well written book, very different from usual mystery book.

It provides clear descriptions of the specific interventions that address many of these patient concerns. Deveraux and Hammerman have presented material in such a way that therapists are able to select appropriate specific interventions so that therapy can be individualized to address the concerns of a particular patient or couple. Infertility and Identity also describes effective interventions for patients who may still be struggling with the issue of infertility years after a successful pregnancy or adoption. This book is especially relevant at a time when financial constraints often necessitate therapy to be focused and time-limited. This book will be an excellent resource for clinicians who are helping patients deal with the many issues related to infertility."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Characterization Ever Written!","review":"This book was given to me on my birthday over twenty-seven years ago.

Just the other day I was having some trouble with a story character, and piled it up with some others covering the same subject for later use. What a gold mine of incisive instruction! I can't put it down. Although written in 1942 (ironically the year of my birth), absolutely everything Ms. Elwood presents today is right on target.

Depending upon the width of the bristles/fan, the brushes may also touch each other, which isn't always a great thing as that can create kinks. I use this as a shelf storage for my less-used brushes and place my brushes one space apart from one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy","review":"Fits most of my brushes.

They fit perfectly and are pretty much the same size and shape as the VW factory Monster mats. They have oval holes that fit over the factory mat retention posts (which are round on my car). Comparing them to the factory mats I would say they are a little better. They are made of a more pliable rubber material; the factory mats are stiffer and more plastic like. Can't say how they'll wear yet but they seem to be well made. These are a bit more expensive than the Monster mats as you can find a set of 4 of those online for only about 8 bucks more; but I only needed the front two and am not sorry I got these.

Also in this game u cant use spells wenever u want 2 like the previous games. U can only use spells wen it is needed and not wen u want 2. But still this game is really good and fun 2 play. U can do all 3 of the triwizard tasks and in the last level u can have the final showdown with Voldemort. I think EA should look back at this game and mend the problems wid it.

I was a little dissappointed that the plot of the seventh book was revealed by entrance to a hidden passage (near the portrait of the Buddhist-looking nuns on the fifth floor). It was the best thirty-second birthday present ever. I go to school in a small town in New York and all my first period studyhall teacher talked about the whole period was how good the game was and that's all everyone else has been talking about since.

If they make the Order of the Phoenix, I sure hope it would be similar to Year 2. I don't know if the Prisoner of Azakaban was like the Chamber of Secrets, because I never played it.

The camera angles are a pain since you can't change them, the controls while flying are a pain if you are used to reversing them and are not given that option, and this game has taken all the magic out of the experience. As a true Harry Potter fan, the best thing about the games was being able to explore Hogwarts. This game feels like a hit hit hit the button game which is unsatisfying and boring.

ALso, they totally did away with Fred and George's Joke shop and now you use your beans to gain strength through wizarding cards but the whole thing is just stupid. I, like 20+ others that I know, am completely disappointed and feel that the game, was a waste of money. It was absolutely no fun at all to play.

The only difference in this game is the characters look older. Like, 16-7 year olds. Like they do in the movie. They should seriously keep actors that look younger.

As a film, it's certainly a revelation; as satire, it's brilliant, and as entertainment, I can only say that Ryan Reynolds is endearing and makes me care about his fate.

Or if you can't pass the Amazon Deal of the day up at such a amazing price..Buy it...But then do what the film says....Bury it....Deep so that it is never found. Complete and utter torturous to watch. And Im a Ryan Reynolds fan. I would rather take a hot staple in the eye....then have to be subjected to watching this hot mess ever again in my life. Because this system wont let me leave no stars I am unable to. But please do not mistake the forced 1 star for an actual 1 star for this film...No Stars for you Buried...None. Just Dirt....Lots of Dirt and a shovel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A film to be buried","review":"The reviews were so good I thought I would go against my better judgement. Yet so boring. A film with one actor and no action. Even fast forwarding it still made it boring. Worse than watching cricket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie that I have seen for the last year","review":"If I can give this movie -100 stars, I will. I have seen some pretty bad movies, but this one actually makes me angry. Who would spend the money and energy to write and produce some garbage like this! This entire movie is a disguise to shove some political ideal down your throat. I feel like that I had just spent the last an hour and a half listening to a time-share condo's sale pitch. When I got the movie, I was all psyched. A guy is buried with nothing other than a cell phone and lighter, now has to figure out where he is and get himself out, how smart is that! There is nothing smart about this movie, or good for that matter. It may not come as a surprise to a lot of people that Ryan Reynolds is not a good actor. He was over acting in every scene, which made the entire exercise in stupidity even worse. Oh, man, I need something that makes me forget this movie asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Frozen","review":"I just watched the movie 'Frozen' last night and wrote a review saying it did not deserve even the one star I was forced to give it. Buried I'd say is worth the one star, but only because of Ryan Renolds acting, although renting it on Blu-Ray thinking it might be of better quality I have to say it isn't worth the extra cost. The movie has no point whatever unless it was trying to convince Americans not to go to countries like Irag or Afganistan in civilian jobs to make presumably a lot of money. In the end the company Renold's character works for sells him out so as not to have to pay the insurance when he turns up dead. Add to the lack of substance, a margin of gore to the Nth degree and you have yourself a one star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad","review":"Even Reynold's usual quality performance did nothing to help this loser of a movie. I won't add anything that will make this review a spoiler, but will say everything about it is totally unrealistic. A standard, old fashioned Zippo style lighter burns almost constantly through the movie without adding fuel? The cell phone battery which is almost dead from the beginning never dies? He wastes time calling his home to hear his son's recorded voice on voice-mail, instead of seeking help with the phone that supposedly has limited battery life? Ditto a call to his mother who is in a nursing home? People he contacts on the phone are more interested in where he is than in listening to his problem? Those are just of few of many impossible happenings. If you're looking for realism be sure to pass on this bomb. I stuck around to see how it ended, but other than that, a real waste of time. Too bad Ryan is even linked with this movie. He had to have done it just for the money; a real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye catching yet boring","review":"Honestly the movie was eye catching Yet very boring I didn't want to watch it yet I did because I wanted to know what happened. It is definitely not something i'd tell someone to buy. Rent it from the redbox if you have an urge to see it. The title says it all. The entire movie he's burried! Had a good story to it just wasn't as interesting and thrilling as I enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"This is the worst movie ever and there was absolutely no point to it. In addition to the poor story line, there were too many periods of awkward silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The entire movie is filmed in a box","review":"I like the actor in this movie so we thought we would give it a shot. The entire movie was filmed with him inside of this box trying to get out. It had a few parts that were suspensful but I was not excited about the time I spent watching this low budget movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buried","review":"Don't like movies that are confined to one place. Kept losing interest and couldn't keep watching to the end.Gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dark...and too drawn out","review":"This film is way too long for the story it tries to present. Also, it was extremely dark in nature and the audio was UP/down making it quite hard to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting, good plot, terrible ending","review":"In fact the ending actually ruined the whole movie, have no use for this movie now and dont plan on ever watching it again, it would simply be a waste of time. Listen, the plot is great, man stuck in a coffin with a cell phone and very little light & running out of time(air). All great stuff, Reynolds is fantastic and believable, when the ending comes up you could expect 3-4 different outcomes, except the one that they chose to end this movie. For me it made the whole movie a waste of time watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the next movie.....spoiler alert below","review":"SPOILER ALERT!!!This movie is leaving me with nightmares. I was left hoping throughout the entire film that something positive would occur. There are three if at most four suspenseful moments in the film all of which make you cringe in hope this guy comes out alive. Well he doesnt....so whats the purpose in seeing a film like this?! If you want to enjoy the movie for its cinematography then thats about all you're going to get out of it. It takes place COMPLETELY INSIDE A BOX. Therefore there is no bigger picture or excitement or anything other than sadness and hopelessness in the end. I would NOT recommend this to a friend. I rather have watched another movie. I wish I could have my 1hr and 30 minutes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"Very boring and unrealistic. I only watched the whole movie because it costed me $3.99.

DON\\"T WASTE TIME","review":"DON\\"T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!! HE NEVER MAKES IT OUT. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MOVIE. THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"So realistic and frightening!","review":"If you enjoy the nail-biting horror and helpless anxiety from watching Open Water and 127 Hours then this film is for you! The difference is that this film begins at the very instant that the character realizes he has been buried alive. You are with him the whole entire time as he struggles to escape and discover why he is there.This movie was shot very well and Ryan Reynolds portrayed the natural emotions and frustrations that any human would face under these unbearable circumstances. You feel like you are in the coffin with him! Not for the faint of heart or claustrophobic!!! You will have nightmares of being buried alive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent movie but the end was weak","review":"Ryan Reynolds proved himself to be a great actor in this film. Very believable and he held it down on his own which even the more shows his talent, but I truly was hoping for a better ending. The end was weak, but it was a decent movie up until that point. Great thriller/suspense movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"HITCHCOCK IN A BOX","review":"I don't see credit given to the true experience of Roy Hallums who, in 2004, while a contractor in Iraq was captured by terrorists and buried alive. His incredible story is worth finding and reading.That said, the movie version of this similar story is a masterpiece of clever filmmaking. Everything takes place inside a coffin-like box. Ryan Reynolds is terrific as the encased victim and director Rodrigo Cort��s captures everything with a creative use of unexpected camera angles and masterful lighting, sound design and editing. The move never cuts away to flashbacks or actions above ground. As one might expect, this taut tale is extremely claustrophobic, and utterly terrifying. In many ways, this movie, though confined to a single location, kind of reminded me of an Indiana Jones set piece. But it's really more like a Hitchcock murder mystery about a victim in a box instead of a locked room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh... I felt it was a waste of time.","review":"Sorry not for me. I watched the entire thing overall I feel it was a waste of time. Very one-layered. Good acting but then again it was all in a box."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie isn't horribe, not that great either..","review":".I've seen this done much more masterfully by a few other film makers...The whole kidnapped & trapped in one spot thing has been done...Ryan is awesome but the pacing just isn't good enough & the ending sucks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its one of your nightmares that never ends","review":"The Movie is just like a bad dream that you can't wake up from.. and the director really begins to escalate the crisis of being trapped in a box 6 feet under when the sand pours in. I'm still having brain damage from watching it. Do not watch this film if you a guy who might scream.I thought the guy was lucky not to be buried in sand for the first hour. He went crazy kicking and screaming in the box and trying to push the lid off and I said ut oh, what if that....Shzzz.He was a one man show. There was no need to see other actors. The whole story is putting yourself in his shoes.If the movie more re watchable? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and slow moving","review":"I actually thought the movie had broken a few times, with only a dark screen showing and no sound. Being claustrophobic this movie was disturbing to me on that level. On all other levels it was boring and extremely slow moving.Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever!!!!!","review":"The only thing good about this movie was Ryan Reynold's acting.

I was still waiting for something to happen..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freekin Boring","review":"I fast forwarded the first three minutes because there was absolutely nothing going on. Just a black screen. I know why. But it was boring. It never recovered. The dude wakes up in the pine box, gets all panicky. I gave it ten minutes. Lame. Never showed any promise so I just turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"people should get pay to see this movie, i mean cheesy all the way, the dialogue is the worst, i mean its real terrible, you can't get back your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"TRBL","review":"This movie is terrible, it end sad and all you see is Ryan in the coffin.

It is realistic what the US goverment and the company he work for did."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen","review":"This movie was the biggest waste of time I have spent in a long time. I think it actually could have been a good idea, but any good feelings I had about the movie were spoiled by the sick feeling I had in my stomach after it was over. I guess if you like being depressed and disgusted you may like it, but if you want to actually enjoy a movie, do not waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my 1.5hrs back","review":"I usually really enjoy Ryan Reynolds movies - however this one left me with a lot to be desired. It had a Blair Witch feel with only showing the main character in a casket for the entire flick. I was hoping for some resolution by the end, but story line was just not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!","review":"I seldom write a review about anything. However, I just had to for this movie.I rented this DVD through Redbox for $1, plus tax, and I feel CHEATED!!

(People magazine)"},{"rating":"1","title":"aweful","review":"Luckily i only rented this for $1. It could have been so much more better if they showed how he got in the coffin and cut to other scenes of the people trying to find him. Instead it was 90 min of him laying in a coffin making cell phone calls the entire time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, please Dont waste your money and time","review":"I may be shallow minded, but I thought I had seen bad movies, but this one goes beyond bad. It really deseves no stars at all, but that is not an option, so I hate to even have to give one star. In short, if you really one see for yourself, watch the first and las five minutes, and there you have it, unlike myself who I'm just wishing to have my 90 minutes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rate it zero stars if possible","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen! Enough positive reviews out there for you to read to balance my negative one.I am warning you though, you may hate it! I am glad I was half sleeping during the movie and didn't have to waste a full 90 minutes of my life watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Buried' Uncomfortable","review":"Just the thought 'Buried' should tell you how you'll feel watching this movie. It's uncomforable to watch, the entire movie. No 'on the edge of your seat' suspense, just a sick feel. There are no 'good' parts that make it worth while. You 'get' nothing new from this movie, it just reinstates negative thinking about the system. The acting was fine, but there are plenty of things I would have said differently, if I was in his shoes. (Won't say what, in case you just have to see it, no matter how many people say it's not worth it.) It's a sad movie, not one feel good moment and that is just how you feel when it's over. Start to finish, the camera never leaves the coffin. You feel ill and wishing you didn't spend your time watching it. Don't rent it for $1, spend your time watching something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"DONT WASTE UR TIME!!! THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS SHOT WITH 3 DIFF CAM ANGLES IN A COFFIN...

He's trapped, he calls people and they can't help, there is a snake, and they don't find him in time. He dies, so thankfully the movie can end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film should have stayed burried","review":"I can honestly say this is one of the worst and most disappointing movies that I have ever seen. Reynolds performance and the fact that Amazon wont let me put zero stars are the only things saving this from getting zero stars.Taking place entirely in a box is a bad enough idea, but to add on an ending that makes the viewer think \\"Why did I just waste an hour and a half on watching that?\\" to a movie that they knowingly took a chance on watching is just a slap in the face.The film is a fantastic example of what not to do. Confusing marketing campaign makes the viewer think they are getting something else, then the film itself takes a primordial crap on the viewer. I knew what I was getting into before I went to see this, I just didn't expect it to be this horrible.1/5, This movie belongs in the bargain bin next to straight to dvd/bluray releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy Reebok again","review":"I have purchased 2 pairs of the Women's Versa Comfort DMX Max shoes in the past. Loved them-really comfortable shoes. I previously used them for walking. About a year ago, I began a combination of walking/running. I asked Reebok online which shoe is recommended for such exercise. Twice no response. Over the weekend, I shopped in nearby stores and found most Reeboks are now cheaply made with much higher prices. Worse yet, they are completely uncomfortable. Did I also say they are hideously ugly? Decided to buy online today, but find the Versa Comfort DMX Max shoes have been altogether discontinued.I choose the companies and products I buy carefully and I try to buy from companies who are sensitive to customers and make good products. In my opinion, Reebok is no longer among those companies. Won't be buying Reeboks anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Troma Team does their worst with this Kevin Costner t**d.","review":"I thought it wasn't possible but a Troma movie has finally turned my stomach. Horrible acting, boring love interests, not to mention Kevin Costner as a horse trainer. With no identifiable plot and stars changing roles throughout the course of this movie it's virtually impossible to watch. On the plus side this is a Troma movie and it is filled with naked girls for no good reason. Because Of this fact I would highly recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one reason to subject yourself to this junk: Costner at 18","review":"Sizzle Beach is not a \\"movie\\" at all; it's a piece of film that outlastedit's original venue -- Arcade porn videos -- because it contains theearliest views of Costner as a teenager in a movie. Worse than home movies, there are no actors in this film, only anatomy, and the \\"quality\\" of color, etc. is deplorable. That said, for fans of Kevin-the-C you will be amazed atthe quality he projects on screen. It's all there, the handsome sexypersona of the all-American wise guy.

The teasers get scolded in the story, never fear!Our favorite part is the pencil sketches of the president behind the color illustrations.

All are assigned to a retraining program for police, where their assignment may uncover Rebus's own culpability in a crime.

You must keep an eye out and replace bag frequently, otherwise a full bag will break/overload the circuit board (I had that replaced under warranty, luckily). However, its biggest weakness is a PLASTIC handle. I've owned this vacuum about 3 years, and the handle broke in my hand when lifting. On inspection, I noticed the only metal is a screw which holds the handle together, the rest is all plastic - unacceptable for any piece of equipment one expects to own more than a few years.

I bought here on Amazon. I used it 4 times. Not self-propelled, so it felt like a ton to push around. The extender wand tool on the hose has poor suction. And with only one bag and no filter, the exhaust smells dusty. NOOOOO comparison to my old beat up Hoover which was self propelled and tons of suction. And the extender wand seems nice, but its heavy and holding it above your head, and replacing it into hole is hard to do. Kills your shoulders. If you have a large first floor with lots of carpet, and a strong back and shoulders, I still would not recommend it. I wish I could find an identical replacement to my old Windtunnel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Recommend","review":"Even though the Hoover U8311-900 Winteunnel Vacuum Cleaner had very good pickup, it was bulky and hard to push.

It has so much suction power in its bulky body that you must constantly wrestle with the machine. On bare floors it blows pet hair all around instead of sucking it up, and the pet hair attachment is ineffective. The bulky base is useless in tight spaces. I love the wand design concept, but the implementation of the design is flawed. So much suction moves through the wand that it is difficult to control and maneuver. I am returning my purchase after 3 weeks of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two-Time Loser","review":"This thing looks and performs wonderfully out of the box. The filters capture that disgusting vacuum smell, and its fun to watch all that dust and pet hair swirl around in the translucent box.Then it quit working. I figured that was the retailer's problem, not mine, so I returned it.Second model did the same thing and broke after about two hours of use. I had to bang on it and manually spin the rotating filter to get gobs of dirt dislodged (a \\"gob\\" is approximatley one pint. I removed \\"gobs\\").So this model has failed twice. Not what I want from an appliance that costs close to $300 and should last 10 years.Also, the attachments don't stay put and the little plastic keeper for the hose is in just the right spot to snap off on your thigh.

So after purchasing this vacuum on February 1st, 2007, the vacuum is still at the repair shop 1-month later. Part is still not available. Stay away from purchasing this vacuum.

My only complaint is that the tip of the hose is metal and seems to gouge woodwork when going around the edges.All in all a really good vacuum but I'm sure there are better out there that would cost more money.

Here are the shortcomings: The screwdriver bits are prone to getting lost, the retention mechanism just doesn't function well. The saw blade uses different mechanism, but it doesn't function well either. The internal sleeves which provide support and tension to the tools bind and bend easily. The scissors (not a feature I was excited about anyway) don't work. I was excited about the blades being outside, but found that I still reached for my pocket knife instead of my Leatherman for standard cutting tasks.

There you can change how much is allocated to the graphics card.Due to the very competitive pricing by Toshiba (even down to 399$ in some places) I think that a memory upgragde by adding 256 is VERY important instead of diminushing your video capabilities.

I tried padded shorts - no help, and they are pricy.I figured for $15, why not try a gel seat cover - then I don't have to worry about whether or not my padded shorts are clean. And - it really helps! I still have minor pain in my sit-bones, but I did ride 2 days before trying the gel seat cover, so it may have been residual. I don't think it made it much worse.I only rode about 4.5 miles - and it was good for that distance. Towards the end though I started feeling a little numb though, so I give this 4 stars because I don't think it'll be good for very long rides.

It seems identical, with the depression in the middle, but it would barely fit my bike seat after much stretching. It is also noticeably firmer than the first seat, particularly on the sides of the depression. This makes it uncomfortable.

When I started, like everybody I was very saddle sore and thought I needed padding. What people dont realize is experience brings caluses and with that seat cushion, it negates the caluses and also cuts off blood flow. When this happens you then experience numbness and tingling in your lower extremities. Common sense would tell you that that is not a good thing for long distance cycling. Eat you wheaties and tought through it. Also, the cheap drawstring that holds in onto your seat breaks so quicly, that you might as well buy a cushioned \\"Granny\\" seat before wasting your money that is going to fly off a quarter into any long ride!

First, it barely fit on the seat. My primary complaint, however, is that the gel in the back half of the cover is quite a bit thicker than the gel in the front...this essentially put me on a slope. If I let go with one hand to grab my water or tried to sit up straight, the seat would essentially propel me forward -- my pelvis would tilt at an awkward angle and I'd have to grab onto the handles to keep from losing my balance. It wasn't too bad when I was leaning forward resting on the handles, but even then I had to be careful to not slide forward and down the slope of the seat cover. As far as I'm concerned, it was money wasted and I'll never use it again!! I'd rather go without a gel cover at all. Maybe I'll leave it at the gym and hope someone steals it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unconfortable","review":"this seat cover, makes you slip on the seat to the front constantly....... you keep pushing yourself to the back and its very annoying, almost wanting to bend the seat in order to stay in place...

This was a major inconvenience of my last frame, as the mattress would constantly slide after about 20 minutes of sitting.

At two-and-a-half hours, it is excruciating, like sitting through a sermon that drones on and on, making the same point over and over again.In spite of the suggestion of grand houses, this gives every indication of being a very low-budget production: close-ups of the same few rooms, none of the sweep and pagentry of other period movies, minimal music, adequate but not great photography.

I have had it for several weeks now and it has not gotten better. I called their customer hotline and was told they know about it but don't have any solutions. I asked if they had a website I could check periodically to see if they had come up with something and was told to call back in 2-3 months. Right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Exerciser","review":"I have no idea why other reviewers commented on the smell of the parts of this excerciser. It's made of steel except for the plastic pedals and rubber floor grippers (which work great by the way). The rubber grippers come in a seperate plastic bag, which, when opened, smelled a little bit like new rubber, but I don't think that's even a bad smell. Anyway, this thing is heavy enough and durable enough to replace an excercise bike. Let's face it, how many people buy excercise bikes and how many people don't use them after a short time. There is a tensioning knob that when tightened provides a harder pedal, but for now I'm using it more for the motion than the tension, so I think this thing is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great economical pedal exerciser","review":"This is a decent piece of equipment, especially for the money. Although you do need to sit up higher than you normally would at a desk or chair, it's a nice way to keep moving and burn a few calories while you watch tv or surf the Internet, or as a way to keep active at work.

While I enjoy so much of his work, I especially like his live performances and My Old Flame [comprised of two live sides: The Dolphin and Spring Is Here] is no exception. My preference between these two sides is Spring Is Here. The version of \\"How About You\\", which begins the CD and is my favorite selection in the entire package, is terrific. Lou Levy's work on piano is wonderful. Sweet Lorraine, Old Devil Moon and I'm Old Fashioned all demonstrate the cohesiveness of Getz, Levy, bassist Monte Budwig and drummer Victor Lewis as a quartet.\\"The Dolphin\\" disc is more subdued than the \\"Spring\\" side of this release with more ballads and fewer up-tempo pieces, but has some noteworthy cuts. Clifford Brown's timeless \\"Joy Spring\\" is given superb treatment as is \\"My Old Flame\\". If you're a fan of Stan Getz, but don't yet have this two CD set, I recommend adding it to your collection. It's yet another top flight live performance by Getz and some his pals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both CDs were mislabeled","review":"Both CDs are great live recording. Stan Getz Quartet played wonderfully.The Green CD was labeled as Disc Two \\"Spring Is Here\\", is wrong.It actually should be labeled as CD #1 (The Dolphin) and has 6 tracks on it.Then, the Red CD was labeled as Disc One \\"The Dolphin\\", is wrong.It should be CD #2 (Spring Is Here) and has 7 tracks on it.This mislabeling incident showed that Sony DADC manufacturedthem without quality control in place, and Concord Jazz -the musiclabel owner- also has no QC. It is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of the Dead is better","review":"This game is a bit short. It has a few alternate routes, where you are allowed you to choose to go left or right at certain checkpoints. But these alternate routes are very short, and do not make a big impact on the fun of the game, or the story of the game. So there is not enough replay value for you to go back to choose one of the alternate routes.House of the Dead is more interesting in that the story moves along differently depending on which rooms you go into.Confidential Mission may appear like a copycat of Virtual Cop, but I own both Virtual Cop games for Saturn and they are a lot more fun than Confidential Mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Horrible]","review":"THIS GAME HAS A COUPLE OF GOOD WEAPONS BUT ONLY THREE LEVELS!!

I'm not suprised the scissors don't work, they are so small and made of such poor materials, I should think cutting anything other than a strand of cotton would be putting them under stress. The saw blade is very thin compared to the original and the sheath is a joke, I can't even close this one. These things aint cheap, especially when you throw in a few accessories.

The ability to open the knife blade one handed without opening the entire tool is worth the price of admission. I have to carry a second small pocket knife for quick cutting jobs. My friend carries only the Wave.

The ruler is on the inside and I have to open the tool to get to it. It's not a big deal because I don't use it that often, but I wish it were on the exterior like on the Blast.2. While the outside opening blades are fantastic, they are a little edgy and leave an indentation in my pocket. (I use the clip to keep the Wave stationed in my back pocket.)3. This sucker is heavy.

As previously noted by another reviewer, your hand can start hurting a bit when you hold the tool very strongly due to the fact that you are holding a piece of metal in your hand that is not round, but more of a squared shape.I guess that wearing gloves for these kind of moments when you need to deal with large stuff would be appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product-wrong sheath tho!","review":"Naturally, can't fault Leatherman on their products.

On the leatherman you can open the knife with the tool in the \\"folded\\" position, which is handy if you use the knife regularly (which I do).It is much heavier than the knockoff all-in-one tools, so it takes a bit of getting used to on your belt, but well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Gritty Tool Construction","review":"I have purchased many leatherman tools over the years; this will be my last.The rough finish on the assembled parts makes this exceptionally hard to open and close.

I've owned my Leatherman multitool for nearly 20 years and it is still a good tool. Really like this new WAVE multtool, Wish Mizzuz Clawz would have left one under OUR tree! Really like the layout of the locking blades. You can open them without opening the whole tool, unlike my old one. And my old one does not have the locking feature and requires care and attention that it doesn't fold on on you and give you a nasty cut. No such fear with this new WAVE model. Quality built, well thought out (should be, they've been making Leatherman tools for many years) and one of the most useful tools you could ever carry right on your belt. Made in USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as well-built as the old wave","review":"Based on my experience, this is a step backwards from the old Wave. My old wave was sturdily built, and I used it for years without problem, until it got confiscated at airport security. Doh! I recently replaced it with the New Wave. I used the small flat screwdriver head right out of the box, and the tip snapped off with only medium torque. Amazon replaced it, but on that one the every time I used the scissors the spring bar kept popping out to the side, making them unusable (I found someone else who had the same problem, and they posted a picture here: [...]. Amazon is replacing again and I hope third time's a charm. It's of course too small a sample size to draw definitive conclusions from, but it seems Leatherman's quality control is going downhill. The other tools seem to be fine.

One of the best features of his books is that he includes numerous maps and simple drawings to better show the battles, troops, weapons, etc.Limited, like all histories of the Punic Wars, in the available source material, in this book Dodge relies heavily on Polybius and Livy (not that he has a choice). However, he also relies heavily on his own military experience and visits to the actual battlefields to present his summary and analysis of the battles, and in this case, of Hannibal's route across the Alps.My one criticism has been noted by other reviewers--Dodge just LOVES Hannibal. Hannibal is the yardstick by which Dodge measures all other commanders. While this may be justifiable, it seems a bit overdone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dodge's Classic is Never Dull","review":"For a book of almost 700 pages, Dodge's Hannibal is never dull.Dodge recreates the Hannibal's battles with amazing detail, considering the events occured over 2,100 years prior to his account. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in ancient battle tactics, or the Roman legions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instructive for Present Day Carthaginian/Republicans","review":"According to Dodge, Carthage was a wealthy trading city-state that refused to tax itself. Sound familiar? Dodge shows how Hannibal proved that he was the best general in recorded history, and his assessment was made even after writing detailed texts on Alexander, Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus, and Napolean as well as the American Civil War generals he served under.Although the United States presently has the greatest military force and leadership the world has ever known, we are not entirely immune from the stinginess of Carthage. Carthage refused to help Hannibal in an ancient version of tax revolt, but Hannibal still gave Rome decisive defeat after defeat after defeat. He taught them, Dodge shows, what real generalship and strategies were, and helped them progress from mere bravura into the refined tactics and strategies that used their strength to advantage. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copyright on this book expired","review":"I noticed that the original book's copyright has expired.

This is one of those times. Dodge does an outstanding job weaving the story of one of the greatest generals of history. He makes a credible case for Hannibal being THE BEST miltary genious of recorded history. I learned more about the Romans and Carthaginians in this book than all the previous books I've read combined. The book was first published in the 1890's and you can tell by the beautiful and intelligent writing. Dodge doesn't feel the need to \\"dumb down\\" to the reader like contemporary historians tend to do. My only complaint is that, due to this publish date, the maps and pictures are hand drawn and rudimentary. I will be ordering more books from T.Dodge in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful - well written - knew his stuff","review":"I don't want to repeat the comments below - I'll just say its one of the better history books I've read in the last few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read any other book of the 2nd Punic War, just not this one","review":"This is the most subjective book there is on Hannibal, or the Second Punic War. Dodge ignores historical evidence, and injects his own beliefs and feelings. I used it as a reference for tactical analysis on the Battle of Zama, but was forced to dismiss and omit much of Dodge's material in favor of more reliable sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, Rare and Exceptional Perspective!","review":"This is an excellent book. I can't imagine there being a more comprehensive, interesting and accurate book on Hannibal. What I found most interesting was the perspective of the writer, a Civil War veteran. The tactics used in the Civil War, were for the most part the same as the tactics used by Hannibal; so states Ayrault-Dodge, the author. He visited all the major battle sites, something none of the of the other Hannibal authors attempted to do. Based on Ayrault-Dodge, most of them mostly got it wrong and the place and time of battle was a most significant variable that Hannibal skillfully controlled. If you like adventure reading and you want the facts and the perspective of an ancient warrior-scholar about Hannibal Barca, this is the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great book from Adizes","review":"I just read \\"Managing Change\\" and enjoyed it 100%... so I bought \\"How to Solve Mismanagement crisis\\".

Because of its low level of mathematics, it can be used at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The exposition is clear and concise but not formal. The book covers a lot of ground and is written by an expert in the field. Almost each section has plenty of good real world examples. It can be used as an introductory reference to advanced topics such as interest rate option modelling and the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela Approach.However, the book needs a new edition to include the latest topics in the modelling of interest rates. A visual basic computer disc for practice could improve the book considerably.At less than $50 the price of the book makes it a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional","review":"Never seen Jet Li in a performance like this, I barely recognized him, he was amazing in this film. I love the feel of the film, the directing, and acting. Very subtle but very emotional performances. What I love most about this film was the sense of love, community, and support shown by everyone around the father and son.

Here, the situation is what is difficult but we see humanity shine. I wanted to give everyone a hug.

Not a typical Li thriller, action, martial arts movie nevertheless I would say his finest performance. As most readers know by now it's a story of a dying father and his sacrificial love for his autistic son.Well acted by all parties, directed, scored and certainly well written ( close to 14 years) the story conveys the universality of human compassion and sacrifice.

The lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing. It's completely fake: nothing inside moves when you move it, and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve. It's just something you can play with while you're waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you. I did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire.

I can't think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this. It is a toy, pretending to be an air pump. The nonfunctional lever on the top (mentioned by other reviewers) indicates that it was designed as a toy. I'm just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway, not out on a trail.

We're not talking high-brow hilarity but a definite and pleasant amusement. Let's be honest though, that's not why you want to watch this film.

A likeable hitman? That seems a bit much.But he is the one character you really do like. The action is great, the acting is great, the jokes are just two steps to far.

I'm not sure I love it as much as I liked my 10-yr old Leatherman Wave. The primary difference is where the knife blades are located. On the Wave, the knife blades are on the outside of the tool when it's closed. That makes it easier to use the knives, especially when you only have one hand free to get the tool out and open the knife. I think that would be virtually impossible to do with the Leatherman Blast.

The quality is very good and I am very pleased so far with the purchase. If it holds up working near the beach then all the better.

He has a Leatherman Squirt that he's been using for 6 or 7 years so I figured he'd like a larger version. And he did. The Blast has the quality you'd expect from Leatherman and it had the combination of tools and blades I was looking for. A good product for a good price. I gave it 4 stars because I'm not sure about the plastic liner in the handles. My son hasn't had any problems with it but he's only had it since Dec 2011. Bottom line...

I don't believe in using a multi-tool for big jobs when I have a toolbox full of \\"real\\" tools in the garage waiting for me. I found the blast & it seemed to be the best fit for me from their current lineup. It is a great knife, I could do without a couple of the tools, but that's me. I am a less is more kind of guy.

The item descriptions are helpful and concise with production dates, manufacturers, dimensions and price ranges.Beyond being a pricing guide, this book also contains a tribute to Charles M. Schulz, an overview of how the evaluations of price were determined, collecting tips every Peanuts Collector should know, a collector's corner with photos of Peanuts Collectors' collections, Peanuts Collector's Clubs and activities, and more.I highly recommend this book for every Peanuts Collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dixie Chicks sing William Billings","review":"Ever wanted to hear an album called \\"The Dixie Chicks sing William Billings\\"? Well, this is it! A4 must have felt that the harmonies sound very like the DCs' (they do) or that the songs are southern stuff (they're not). For whatever reason they decided to do them with Country Western vocal mannerisms thrown in. I was crushed. I think they're affected, irritating, not what I expected from this group, and not the way anything on this album should be sung. You may feel differently. That's fine. The point is only that you be advised (warned) that very few cuts on this CD are sung \\"straight\\". The few that are are breathtaking. The rest, well.... And the diction! In the sweet bye and bye, for example, these ladies will meet on a byoo-dee-full shore. You may not, I repeat, mind, or even notice, but you should know that this is what to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This album is just what we've come to expect from Anonymous 4 - beautiful harmonies and pleasing music. It is especially nice to hear some of the traditional Christian music that reminds us of our wonderful heritage, and how so many of our contemporary artists have missed the point of good composition. No one today writes lyrics like these, nor do they remember that good music is easy for congregations to sing. With Christian music, it is all about the congregation's ability to worship, not about the artist's desire to be \\"cute\\" or \\"unique\\" with his work. This album is a great combination of depth of words and thoughts and simplicity of melodies, presented with beautiful voices of Anonymous 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like more Anonymous 4","review":"I love the texts and melodies on this disc. The production is flawless and the flow of songs makes perfect sense to me. As with other Anonymous 4 releases, individual voices are very distinguishable, and perhaps that's the point. If the record is meant to be an historical recreation, then for me it kind of falls flat- I feels to me like I've invited Hildegard back into my room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels among us","review":"I thought this recording was excellent! As usual, Anonymus 4 brings us lovely vocal quality and intelligent interpretations. I loved hearing these great shape-note hymns with the elaborate harmonies. One reviewer commented that the melodies get lost. While this is true, each song is pure harmony and each lady carries her part. The recording is so much fun to listen to because I pick out something new each time. I have known and loved these songs all my life and I am glad to see them brought to life on this recording. My favorites are Holy Manna, Amazing Grace, and Angel Band.Although the performance is not historically accurate, I find it thoroughly enjoyable and creative. One of my favorite CD's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie in its genre","review":"This is a good action film, it shows a plot about global terrorism, espionage, counter-intelligence and all these stuff. It's really interesting for the lovers of aircrafts that they used real Sukhoi fighters for this movie. European productions never use this kind of elements and they don't often invest in high budget action movies. The weak point was the acting, they did it good considering they were most beginners, but not a big deal. I highly recommend this movie for action/airplanes lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"Good quality aside from the highlighting in the book but as expected with textbooks but the price was too good to pass up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...the jackpot in my search for a good book on vocation","review":"I spent several weeks doing research on the topic of vocation and reading books and articles from a variety of sources.

Strip away the fact your playing as Wolverine, and you've just got yourself an average run of the mill side scroller with nothing special attached to it. The game's 13 levels are relatively short and not at all too challenging, and the gameplay gets very repetitive after a while as well. The graphics are nicely animated, but the characters move around a bit jerky, plus it would have been nice to have some added super villians other than Cyber, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike. All in all, if your an X-Men fan and own a GBC, give this game a try, but all others should leave this on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR dissapointment.

Then came Lights and Sounds and I was pretty disappointed. I'm not sure if others agree with me on that one but I just didn't feel the \\"punch\\" when I heard that album. It had a few good songs but nothing like the Ocean Avenue songs. Then I heard about a month ago that Paper Walls was coming out. I was a little hesitant to buy the cd. The reason was because thought this cd would have turned out to be like Lights and Sounds. But, I went ahead and bought it anyways. I got into my car, open the cd and popped it into the cd player. WOW! The first song had all the \\"punch\\" you needed. The song, \\"The Takedown\\", started off with a riff and just got better as the song progressed. I fell in love with the rest of the album too because it brought back that Ocean Avenue feel. I definitely recommend this album!My current faves on the cd:-The Takedown-Fighting-Keeper-Light up the sky-Date Line(i am gone)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Although product is rated for 5 and over, I wouldn't recommend it for ages under 10. The bindings are difficult to release and the way they attach to the board allows them to stick out the bottom and act as snow brakes. If the rider had larger boots this may be less of a problem? Although other reviews made mention of the binding issues, they didn't seem to indicate they were that big of an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound quality suffers on this live effort","review":"This album was remastered for a better sound quality and released as Tremulous Antenna from HUX records in 2002. Live in the Air Age has the best sound quality of Be Bop's live work. This album displays cuts from Modern Music and Drastic Plastic that show this band could translate work from the studio to the stage. The live version of the Modern Music medley should put to rest those who would state that Bill Nelson could only shine when doing studio overdubs.

The movie is quite beautiful and moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Why can't everyone leave me alone?\\"","review":"\\"Asylum\\" is well-written but somewhat unmemorable. Oxford in 1278 is intelligently depicted, but the plot has only enough substance for a traditional four-part \\"Doctor Who\\" story or a Telos Novella. There's not enough plot and characterization here to sustain a full-length \\"Who\\" novel; instead, we get scenes that repeat what we already know.Nyssa, one of the most likeable \\"Doctor Who\\" companions, is especially poorly served by this book. She spends the whole story within the grounds of Oxford Castle, hiding from the outside world, making no contribution to the plot and sinking ever deeper into a depression that seems born of a desire on the author's part to present his own personal problems to the world rather than tell an interesting or entertaining \\"Doctor Who\\" story.Even the Fourth Doctor is weakly characterized in this book. Unless you want to read every \\"Doctor Who\\" book ever published, I suggest you skip \\"Asylum\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Quick review: boring and tedious. 4Doc is barely adequate, but pairing him up with Nyssa before he meets her in the TV series is completely wrong. As a plot point it adds very little to the story, and worse off she comes off completely different from what I'd imagine her to be that many years later. Darvill-Evans would probably have been better off using a completely new character rather than bringing back an old. As for the murder mystery central to tbe plot, lets just say I saw through it almost as soon as it was introduced. The real purpose of the book, it seems, is for the author to display how much he knows about medieval society and thought. But mere knowledge do not a plot make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring , Dull and pathetic! Felt like a history story","review":"This adventure pairs the 4th Doctor with Nyssa before she meets on Traken. There is no aliens running around to take over the world etc. This book was very boring and dull! I felt like I was reading one of the many period pieces the BBC did with the 1st Doctor in 1960's. It was so boring I gave up after reading the first half. If you want aliens etc, try one of the many other books the BBC has with the 4th Doctor! Even P-science Fiction was better than this!Avoid this book unless you can check it out at your public library!

It's that bad.The album started promising, with the moody \\"Glomd\\"; I really liked the song's subtle harp touches and what felt like a house beat just waiting to come out and take over. Thankfully, that didn't happen, and the song remains understated and beautiful. The album pretty much took a nose dive after that, into unoriginal pseudo-Bjork territory (the next song, \\"Psalm,\\" featuring someone named K. was pretty much a blatant rip-off of Post-era Bjork).The album production is mildly enjoyable -- almost sufficient (I particularly liked the accordion samples throughout) -- but ultimately it's a good thing this album is out of print. On this record, Koop has not yet become the fully-formed group that produced the great \\"Waltz for Koop,\\" which is good from beginning to end. \\"Sons of Koop\\" is the sad, depressed teenage offspring of \\"Waltz for Koop.\\" And even the band is likely to be eager to forget their formative years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I ordered this 12 volt regulator 3 days ago and it arrived today.

Then the light ceases to function at all. Amazon was great in sending a replacement TWO times, yet the same problem persisted.

I ordered two sets of the \\"Autumn in Hanover\\" pattern and they are wonderful. They do not look or feel like Corelle. They are the perfect weight and with two children, I don't have to worry about broken dishes anymore! They also stack up much nicer in my dishwasher then my old stoneware dishes, and they are easier to clean because the surface is smoother.

They seem a little awkward and with the exception of the pliers there is nothing on this tool that a good old fashion Swiss Army Knife can't do and do it better. I'm going to stick with Genuine Swiss Army knifes still. They are smaller, lighter, easier to open, easier to work with, and usually less expensive. Don't see why anyone prefers a Leatherman over a Swiss Army Knife unless you must have a pliers. A pliers is handy but I would not give up the small size and ease of use of a Swiss Army Knife. This tool is built solid though. It does have a locking mechanism for the blade which Swiss Army knifes don't have which is a small plus. Overall, not a bad tool. I'll probably leave it in my glove box. I'm sure a need will arise for it at some point.

I ordered two Fuses, one for him and one for me, on the reccommendation of a previous review by a US Army sargeant.I can understand why these tools are so beloved. I've only had this little device for a few days but I REALLY like it. It folds to a compact size, is reasonably durable, and has a huge number of tools contained within its frame. Its essentially a tool box on my belt. It has a place with my wallet, eye glasses, and keys.#1 upside: I have large hands and the handle is just right for me. The grips are perfect as well, non slip without being sticky. Definitely engineered in America for Americans.#1 downside: Sometimes you need to manuever around the wire cutters in the jaws of the pliers to grip a bolt. To me, it was a bit tricky at first, but that should be the worst thing about this fantastic little device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good GPS","review":"This is a very neat unit. The color display makes all the difference compared to an earlier version I have used - the Magellan MAP 330. Although it has fewer screen displays than the 330, all the necessary information is available including vertical profile (with the Mapsend Topo software) and it is much more readable. The GoTo pointer is constantly updated on the move as you approach a destination (although I would like to see a thicker line for this function).

After 2 months I got it back and it didn't work at all right out of the box, then I noticed it wasn't even my unit, they had exchange it for a different one that didn't work! Of course I had to send it in (again at my cost) and after another 6 weeks wait they send me back the second unit in working condition - well it worked for about a month, which, for me included using it about three times.

Astoundingly it is almost exclusively the work of one man (all but 21 articles). David Aune, who is a professor at the University of Notre Dame, covers literary and rhetorical topics pertinent to NT and Early Christian interpretation, amply treating both primary sources and secondary sources. You will find numerous articles related to composition, literary materials, and ancient rhetoric. For example, there are articles titled: allusions, chreia, dictation, enthymeme, form criticism, midrash, preface, rewritten bible, and many more.

Some of the text is a bit too much for such a young child, but the photos lend themselves to telling a story that children of any age can understand. He liked to see the pictures of tiny babies, and also liked to hear how the older children felt about the babies. I think this book really helped him to know what to expect.

This one, by far, was her favorite and I think I can recite it cover to cover with my eyes closed, as we have read it at least 100 times...I think because it is filled with pictures of real children and babies, as opposed to illustrations, it really captured her attention. The language was on her level. We read this book for MONTHS after the new baby came home and it really helped us to identify how my daughter was feeling...she would nod her head adamantly at certain points in agreement and mimic some of the situations in the illustrations. It really helped us (her parents) to communicate with a barely talking (or understandable) toddler.She is now 3 1/2, and we STILL are reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok book not great for a younger child","review":"I had a hard time finding a book to read to my daugher about her sibling on the way and finally decided to give this book a try. It is kinda outdated and has alot of words. It would be better for an older child but most of it went over the head of my 2 1/2 yr old. She likes looking at the pictures but there is not really a story to follow.

It contains a lot of information, although not all of it is useful. This is a great book for someone just getting into four wheeling.My personal thoughts are that this book should have been Jeep or LandRover specific (Those are the authors obvious favorites) instead of trying to be all encompassing of 4x4's. Basically, there was not enought specific information on any type of area or vehicle, and not enough gereral information. The author seemed stuck somewhere inbetween, making this book not really good for either use.I did read the book cover to cover, so I guess it couldnt have been that bad either.

As your skills and experience increase, you can go back to this book and glean more than you did the last time you read it. Even if your 4-wheel-drive is a push-button-do-everything-for-you variety, you will at least be able to understand WHAT your vehicle is doing FOR you.The author's style is professional, yet personal; thorough, without putting you to sleep; respectful of trails, vehicles and other wheelers, without being preachy.

This one, while not my favorite, is still quite good and has aged pretty well. I don't know why this is listed here as Vol 2 as the Billy Nasty mix was the first JDJ cd (released in 1993). Billy (pre-techno DJ) mixes up a nice selection of house tunes, some now classics, such as Fargetta's Music is Movin', Tonto's Drum by Eagle's Prey, Song For Life by Leftfield, Gypsy's I'll Trance You, and Yerba Del Diablo by Datura. The first half seems housier, while the second half (my favorite part) moves more into early progressive house territory. The mixing is relatively smooth, a few bumps here and there but nothing too pear-shaped. All up, a good mixed party cd for those who like early house music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat and non-stop.","review":"Billy Nasty Mix put it all together on this album.

It was easy to attach both hooks to tow points on a Honda Accord, and loop the strap itself around a truck's trailer hitch. The strap gives/flexes JUST enough that it's not a sharp jolt after the slack is taken up, but not so much that it feels squishy or unreliable in use.It doesn't weigh much, and is easy to store and retrieve (I prefer to keep it in a plastic bag so it doesn't unwind). Not heavy, awkward, and noisy like a chain.

Furs. I don't see it. The songs drone on ... and on. Interpol is much better as a comparison to the above mentioned '80's bands. I don't want to relive the past but this group is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic KX-TGA101S","review":"Poor sound quality. I have 4 phones and except for the phone on the main base the others work sometimes, but most of the time say the phone is too far from base even when it is only 15 feet away. By listening to Consumer Reports Magazine I bought this phone, but now which I hadn't. Volume issues are also a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"I like the features that this phone has to offer. It's really cool how you can check your messages directly from the phone. It's pretty easy and comfortable to use, as well. However, literally 8 days after I received it one of the speakers stopped working. This resulted in me not getting a dial tone or being able to use it unless I use it on speakerphone. The speakerphone feature does not even work that well. Whenever I use it, I have to practically hold it up to my face or people complain that they cannot hear me. I think that a product should definitely last more than a week without problems. We checked the owner's manual and sure enough, this is a common problem. We called up Panasonic and they said that they would fix it, but we would have to pay the shipping back. How out of line is that? I would not recommend this phone to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Additional Handset","review":"I had upgraded my existing phones to the Panasonic 6.0. I needed an additional handset to complete my system. The additional handset was easy to install and sync with the current system.

There is a major problem with battery usage and power indicator. 2 of the 4 units are affected. They will always show 1 bar for remaining battery power. They will always cut out after just a minute or so of usage. Using fresh batteries has no affect. Swapping batteries with the good phones has no affect. If I take out the batteries in the bad phones they show to be fully charged in other devices.Bottom line: Some of the phones consume excessive power and show low power availability on their displays, making them unusable. Would not advice purchasing these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"This is certainly one of the easiest phones to operate and install. Clearly defined instructions walk you easily through the set up process. Furthermore, the phone allows for a crisp conversation without any background noises. The cordless phone allows you the freedom to roam throughout the house without dropping your call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to rate just an expansion handset","review":"Had a set of those (base phone with answering machine + 1 extension handset) for about two years and it's worked flawlessly, so when our older cordless died we decided to get another extension handset. Adding it to be recognized by base was a breeze. Nice thing that you can operate the base from any extension phone. You can also set every extension to have different ring, but why would somebody want to have this cacophony of phone rings every time somebody calls you id beyond me...The size of it is just right, but cradling it between your ear and your shoulder is quite an exercise, but there is a connector to hook up external earpiece if you want. Sound volume is good, and setting or changing options is very simple. We are really glad we've got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic 6.0","review":"The phone works well anywhere in the house.

Clarity is very good and distance is good as far as I can tell and it is easy to use. Have not lost any calls while moving around on my property of 1 acre.

We bought this set and two extra handsets for a total of 6, we have 4 kids, and they have worked perfectly. Our old set had interference problems with the microwave and all the computer equipment. This newer style, DECT 6.0, has none of those problems. The sound is clear, the handsets are easy to use and the range is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Phone","review":"I bought this cordless handset to complement my original Panasonic 6.0 Answering System. I can't say enough about this product. Just put in the batteries, plug it in to an electrical outlet and you're good to go. I use this phone in the bedroom. Its very compact, stylish and fits nicely on the nightstand. Very easy to program. When a call is picked up by the answering system, the speaker on the handset turns on automatically and you can listen to the message as its being recorded (pretty neat stuff). I had an ATT System for years, but after using the Panasonic 6.0, I am completely sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phones don't hold a charge","review":"My phones do not hold a charge. They beep and go dead after a few seconds even after being charged for 24 hours. Sometimes they ring for one long tone.

No change :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much difference from 5.8 ghz","review":"Got this because it was advertised as \\"markedly reduced interference\\"...it is not.

All work well, having that many extensions works with my internet phone connection well. It's easy to transfer information from phone to phone, and easy to use the intercom feature to find those missing phones. I like this phone system.

This set I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this phone system","review":"We needed an extra handset for our Panasonic cordless phone system. We are very pleased, especially as these handsets do not need a telephone jack, but only need to be plugged in, so can be used just about anywhere in the house. Sound quality is excellent. We highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold a charge costs nearly what new 2 set costs","review":"I have this now as the remote to the base station. It's started to not hold a charge. I figured the rechargeable batteries were weak. Replaced them for $6 but the problem persists. But since the replacement cost of JUST this remote station is nearly the cost of a new 2 set I'll spend a few dollars more and get a brand new 2 set with new base and answering machine etc. In fact all I think I need is the base w/o the handset so this price is completely out of whack"},{"rating":"2","title":"this phone is great","review":"This phone offers us the ability to not have to run for the phone anymore. We are still depending on our land line and this one added to the two others we already had. It works great and gives us the freedom to not worry we won't hear the phone in the other room during the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speakers didn't work after a few hours","review":"Boy was I excited to get the new wireless speakers. Sounded great, solved the problem of using the computer to be the\\"radio\\". ...for about 4 hours then a little speaker rattle. No problem...just lower the volume... for about 1 hour..then nothing. Argh!I have to say in the defense of the speakers that while they worked the sound was fine for my ears.Maybe this was a fluke, or maybe the issue is systemic. I dunno, I'm waiting for replacements to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Volume-no help","review":"Purchased these phones based on reviews. When installed, there is no volume on the handsets. I purchased the Panasonic hands free headset, again based on reviews and you can barely hear the caller. Speakerphone allows you to hear better if you are about 1 foot away. Try another phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"join a conversation???","review":"Other reviewers must not receive outside calls intended for the whole family. DECT phones require an awkward procedure to allow a second person to join an incoming call. And more than one additional joiner is impossible even if you have several extension phones! I'm used to being able to just \\"pick up the extension\\", and that's a requirement these phones can't meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phones only recharge from one base","review":"I have had this phone for a couple of months. I assumed that each handset would recharge from a base, but they only recharge on the control or main base. I have to remember to switch out phones from one base to the next daily or they run out of battery.I also find that the controls from erasing messages, etc aren't user friendly. I would never purchase this phone again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic wireless phone","review":"The item was misleading on the web site.I thought it was a complete unit, but when received found out it was an auxiliary until and I required a mother base.I sent the unit back sent bought the right unit locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain no good","review":"i like nothing about it. would never buy anything panasonic makes., they would have to give it to me and then i would be hesitant."},{"rating":"2","title":"additional phones","review":"bought two additionalo handsets to go with the three existing ones. easy to set up and charge. makes the telephone use more flexible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greg's review","review":"Great phone, The two units I purchased merged with the 4 I already had with no problem.

Great sound and far reaching signal. Battery life is very good. Small \\"footprint\\" doesn't take up much desk space, but sturdy enough not to fall over. System itself has answering machine included, but not necessarily outfitted for voice mail...didn't occur to me there would be no light to signify a message like my previous Panasonic phone did.

It was EXTREMELY east to pair with the base station, I was impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement vs. Repair","review":"These two cordless phones are replacement units for two of five exisiting phones that failed after several years service. I e-mailed Panasonic about returning them for repair and discovered the cost (including shipping) would exceed buying new units. I contemplated purchasing a whole new system of five phones with answering machine, but that would have been even more expensive. Hopefully none of the other original units fail relatively soon or I will have thrown good money after bad. On one of the failed units the screen went blank and, because of that, I couldn't even \\"de-register\\" the phone from the system. Thankfully, the system accepts a total of six phones, therefore that didn't become a problem. In general, the phones are of good quality including sound, distance, battery life and function. If it wern't for the two failed phones, I would have given them (system) a five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completey Unreliable!","review":"I bought this phone about 6 months ago.

I liked the phones, but was having trouble with one charger not charging despite indicating that it was. I purchased phone batteries, thinking that might be the problem, but it made no difference. One charger was \\"burned out\\" despite cleaning the contacts, plugging, unplugging, etc. I bought 2 more handset/charger sets, and within 3 months one of those chargers died, along with another of my original chargers. I now have 5 phones with only 2 functioning charger bases.I just spoke to customer service who told me that only the phones are warranted, not the \\"accessories\\", which the chargers and cords are. He told me to go buy them on the website, that Panasonic would not stand behind the charger/cord product.I rarely write reviews, but this infuriates me and I want to warn buyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone with excellent features and range","review":"I recently purchased a Panasonic Dect Series Cordless Phone to add one additional handset to my system.I have found the Panasonic cordless phone to be far superior in range and battery life than the GE phone system it replaced.The only minor negative is the finish on the handset has worn off over a long period of time. This does not affect the performance of the handset.I have been very pleased with the Panasonic cordless system"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install/great sound quality","review":"Purchased this additional handset to add to the 3-phone Panaonic system we purchased a few months ago. This handset was very easy to connect to the existing system: just plug it in and press the locator button on the base phone--done! We upgraded to this system when our old phone began interfering with our wireless router, causing us to get bumped offline a lot. This phone doesn't interfere with our wireless router or other appliances and has very clear sound quality. I love the big buttons and intuitive menus. Like that you can use it as an intercom, too. My only complaints would be that the display is hard to read with my less-than-perfect vision and the buttons are not lit, so finding the right one in the dark can be tricky."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],C={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-948a4ca5"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/29.md","filePath":"sponsor/29.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/29.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
