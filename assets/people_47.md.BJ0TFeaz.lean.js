At first I was terribly confused and bored with the book, but enjoying a challenge I stuck it through and completed the novel. After finishing it I realized I didn't fully understand the purpose of the struggles contained within the pages. I did understand the personal lives of Gordimers' characters but the politics threw me a loop. I now am beginning to realize the tremendous writing ability this author really has.

This really is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me","review":"I could not get into this book at all. The method of writing was very hard to follow. I couldn't tell who was talking most of the time. If there were more than two people in a conversation, forget it. I often had to go back to the begin of the conversation and try to figure it out. There also seemed to be more detail about the \\"politics\\" of South Africa than I cared to know or be able to understand. Granted there may be some that would enjoy this, but it lost me.

I did not know this at the time, and later learned of her visual defects (nostagmus nerve blockage syndrome and weak eye muscles).

I wish I would have found this sooner. She will just stare up at it and oogle and oggle and giggle and coo. It's a full on party in her crib for a good 10 minutes or so until she's maybe a little overstimulated.

Now it's hanging above her changing table, and she still loves looking at it (she's one now).I would recommend though substituting one of the links with a piece of string. Then you can spin it, and that really grabs baby's attention.Of all the things we got for our new born, this one was definitely the most popular with her.Some reviewers noted that it isn't well made. Well, it is on the flimsy side, but it is not meant to be played with. It is meant only to be looked at, and for that it works absolutely fine.Do not hide away pictures as you change them, put them on the changing table or on the playing mat.

My daughter was very interested while I assembled this, but after I took my hands off of it, she gave me a look I didn't expect to see for another 13 years.After thinking about the brain development books and gender preferences, I dug all of the face-like images out. My daughter was again interested as I assembled everything. This time, she gave all the images a glance before rolling over and checking out the patternless crib bumper instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple. Perfect for infants.","review":"I received this item as a gift. At first, I had doubts whether this stim-mobile would be effective. Unlike other mobile devices that has stuffed animals and music, this mobile was made with plastic cards. It looks very flimsy when you open the packaging.

The cross-bars were very very thin and all the plastic cards were cracked/broken. I ended up making my own: purchased a mobile arm from Amazon (search for mobile holder), printed my own high contrast photos, laminated them, and put them together with fishing wire. My husband cut a dowel to make cross-bars, which I also painted black and white. It was worth the work and I can change out the cards more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can be used with a co-sleeper...if you also buy...","review":"This mobile holds my infant's attention like nothing else. She is almost 4 months old, and we've been using it for two months. I have the hanging part attached to her co-sleeper using this clamp: [JL Childress Crib Mobile Attachment Clamp]The clamp has a loop and the mobile has a hook, so putting the two together was easy and simple.Also, seeing how much of a hit this was, we bought the car seat pictures and have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted this to be better","review":"I chose this mobile for the simple, high-contrast images. On that, it delivered. I took for granted that I would be getting a mobile that spun in a full circle. This does not: the links you use to attach the mobile to the arm only allow for it to twist 270 degrees, severely limiting how much and how long this can spin.The cards are a complete pain to change. To snap them on to the mobile requires the brute hand strength of a veritable strong man. Inserting one card into another to make the t-shaped pair requires great dexterity so you don't tear the plastic or snap one in half.I was really hoping for this to be better quality, in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad implementation","review":"I like the idea of this mobile and would have definitely liked it if it was made a little better. But the whole thing seems kind of cheap and plastic-y. The way two cards are put together causes one of them to split a little in the middle and the cards don't really hang down straight. I ended up returning the mobile because it just didn't fulfill its purpose due to its poor quality. If it was cheaper it'd probably be ok. I don't know why something so innovative that being recommended on so many websites wouldn't be of higher quality!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke trying to assemble","review":"It's a stimulating piece of junk. Baby's interested for sure, but how disappointing when it breaks upon assembling! One of the arches snapped in two trying to get it inserted. Plus, those flimsy plastic graphic cards don't fit into each other nicely, nor can you put them onto the arches easily. My fingers are still raw typing this a few minutes later. Anyway and finally, the clamp did not fit on our changing table.

We already had a standard \\"stuffed animal\\" mobile with a wind-up music box. What I did was hook up this mobile to the music box. At 14 weeks, my son is HOOKED as well, but wants the music and rotation to go with the cards. He loves when we switch them around too.But, like the other reviews said, the stim-mobile itself does not come with a rotating motor or music, and the cards do fall off extremely easily (just now, in fact, my husband went to wind it and said, \\"Those things always fall off when I crank it up.\\")Combine the next version with a rotating motor that plays classical music -- that you don't have to wind up -- with cards that can be swapped out in any configuration, and you'll have a total winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizes my baby","review":"my son can be crying, and when i put him in his bassinet with this mobile and he opens his eyes, it's like he sees an angel. he can watch it for literally 30 minutes at a time, talking to it...and the mobile hardly moves or does anything.i have an older son for whom we got an electric mobile in his infancy, and he hated it. i thought i'd try this one under the premise that it's best not to overstimulate a newborn who was used to being in a womb...and i think it's right on. it boggles my mind how much he loves this but he absolutely does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, flimsy, limited fastening options","review":"I agree with other reviews that said this product should cost much less, given the quality of the materials. The images and are good and my baby does like looking at them, but we don't even use the hanger arm because it's flimsy and has limited options for what you can affix it to. We bought this to hang on our changing table or bassinet, but that's impossible given the fastener. It is built for a crib with slats and nothing else. But it doesn't say that on the box, nor does the image show what kind of fastener it has. The cards are hard to put together and take apart without breaking, as others have said, and the overall look is cheap and flimsy. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fit on Anything","review":"I was hugely disappointed when this mobile didn't fit on my crib. I'm certain I have one of the most popular cribs in the US, I got it at Costco after all, and the mobile simply will not fit anywhere on the crib. So then I tried it on the bassinet, didn't work there either. So then I thought, maybe somewhere on the dresser above the changing table? Nope. I'm going to have to figure out a way to hang it from the ceiling, probably using fishing line and screw hook. Also, it's made with a very cheap looking white plastic, which will bother people looking for a stylish mobile to compliment their professionally decorated nursery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good, but not usable for most infants!","review":"I presume most people plan to purchase this for the first couple months of their infant' life like we did...however, this mobile can only be attached to a crib (the attachment point requires a t-shape anchor with fairly wide slats). It can't be used on a pack and play, it can't be used on a standard bassinet. How irritating. What on earth were they thinking? Materials are quite flimsy and one even included an ad on the side of the card visible to the baby...very thoughtless. If this were more functional and could attach to a wider variety of objects, I would give it a higher rating, but how very inflexible of the company to make it only crib appropriate, particularly when it is intended for a child most people wouldn't put in a crib!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"My baby loves this mobile at ten weeks old.

It's just unnecessarily hard to clamp and unclamp the pieces from each other and from the mobile.

Every time I put her down, her eyes intently study the images. I have a much fancier motorized mobile with moving stuffed animals, but baby much prefers the stim-mobile! She has been mesmerized by the mobile from birth! It also grows with her. The height is adjustable and you can move it away as baby's eyesight improves and you can change out the images to continue to allure baby's attention. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves it!","review":"Our little one (9 weeks old) loves this mobile! She stares at it and smiles and coo's when she sees it. Since there are extra pieces so that you can switch them out I hung some of the extras with string from the ceiling above her changing table. Every time I change her she smiles when she sees the cards- they're like friends to her! If I need a few minutes to get ready I can put her in her crib and she'll just stare at the mobile. I would definitely recommend this. The only thing I wish it did was spin. But she seems to like it anyways. So glad I bought this mobile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This mobile is classically beautiful without the use of overstimulating, ugly toys spinning around making obnoxious music!

It is just a simple picture but he thinks they are his best friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Newborn granddaughter LOVES it!","review":"I purchased this for my 6 week old granddaughter. She would lay in her crib and look at it and smile. When she was fussy I'd hold it over her head on the changing table and she'd quiet down and watch it. Now she's 3 months old and still loves it. Sometimes I'll hold it closer to her so she can \\"touch\\" it and she'll shriek with laughter. Great toy for a new baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"I have twin baby girls and both girls were enraptured with the mobile images the moment they set eyes on them. One of the twins has visual developmental delays and this mobile has helped immensely with her visual stimulation and tracking.

I plan on buying this for friends - it is a strong product that has worked wonders with my babies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"After only a few minutes into assembling the mobile per the instructions I managed to break one of the over hanging arches that holds the cards. While trying to insert the lower hanging arch into the hole specified in the top arch it broke in half. Also, it was impossible to attach the cards to the little nodules on the arches without tearing them because the nodules were too big for the holes in the cards or visa-versa. Overall the attach points / integration points that hold this mobile together were not correctly sized. Seems like the manufacturer made the pieces but never tested to see if the pieces actually fit together."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, flimsy quality","review":"The mobile was great at catching my daughter's attention. She loves to stare at it. And, from what I hear, this high contrast stimulation is good for her development. I am just diappointed with the quality, as the whole mobile seems flimsy and cheap.The picture cards are interchangable, but as far as I can tell, they can only be placed in one direction. --There is one card that lies horizontally, and one that attaches to the mobile vertically, but you can not attach the horizonal one to the mobile, nor can you lay the vertical one horizontally to be viewed by baby. So I feel that the choices of view are limited. However, the horizontal cards are two sided, so that does increase the options. (I know this may not make sense until you actually see the mobile in person!)All in all, it's good for capturing baby's attention, but I would have been more satisfied if the price was lower considering the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My oldest daughter enjoyed this mobile's pictures when she was a baby. However, the plastic is very flimsy and it broke, so I bought a second one for my second daughter. The plastic broke as I was assembling this mobile. I would recommend looking for another similar product rather than wasting your money on something that breaks so easily. Wish I had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the mobile but don't like the assembly.","review":"I really like this mobile. The baby hasn't come yet; however, I think it's a smart toy. I am disappointed at how difficult it is to put the image pieces together and how prone the plastic is to wearing out before it's put together/taken apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son loves this","review":"This has been terrific. Our son absolutely loves it and can spend an hour looking at it. We couldn't be happier with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply stimulating","review":"From the time our baby was a newborn she was fascinated by these simple, non-moving, non-musical, colorful discs. She could stare at them for a long time and loved to be wherever we placed the mobile (sometimes above her changing table). She is now a 6-month old and we allow her to stand (supported by us) and reach for the discs, which she still finds fascinating. Just goes to show, you don't have to have the bling to make the babe happy. This is the best mobile we've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I didnt have any issues with the cards wripping, and thought it was a great product. My little newbie LOVES looking at it and I would tell every mom to get one of these. My only complaint, I have to \\"Jimmy Rig\\" it to stay on the side of his pack and play or bassinet... It would be nice if it wasnt built just to go in between slats on the crib."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"This mobile is great, very stimulating for baby. I like the fact thatvit loves with baby and that you can change the cards so that baby does not get bored with it. However, it regret that not all the cards are perforated so that they can be hanged face down (as it is only about 10 are) ; and that the mobile does not rotate on its own. Other than that it's a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So baby not all that interested","review":"With no movement or sound this mobile is just so-so...thought with all the good reviews it would be a little more stimulating for baby! Cute but rather flimsey and doesn't really hold on crib rail that well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not use","review":"I don't know if this is a good mobile or not. The plastic bracket is not adjustable and there was nowhere on our crib or bassinet where it would fit so we were unable to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im-mobile","review":"Before buying this product I did not realize that it does not have any mechanism for movement other than swaying in a breeze or by being moved by a parent's hand. I would have expected motion from a mobile. We call it the im-mobile in our home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor quality, doesn't fit with all cribs","review":"As an optometrist, the idea of this product is great. That's about it. The quality is quite poor. It doesn't fit on the arched side of our crib (nor the straight front/back end) which deems it almost useless. We ended up holding the cards up like flash cards. When no longer needed, it all went in storage. I recently took it out for my newborn #2 and the thin plastic parts that connect the cards to the main base were broken. Poor quality and doesn't fit with all cribs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"This product was a BIG disappointment. I would have given it 0 stars if it was an option. I thought it was a great idea -- just poorly executed. Save your money. It's difficult to switch the visuals and never held my child's interest. After a few weeks, I've already taken it down and replaced it. If you can, I'd wait for the Lamaze Freddie The Firefly coming out in August. Since that one is not available yet, I purchased the Tiny Love Classical Mobile. It seems to be holding my child's interest well enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed. This mobile didn't fit on our crib or changing table.","review":"With all the great reviews, I had high expectations for this product. Upon assembly, my husband pointed out that the slits made to take the cards apart are actually just slightly too small and will cause ripping. Poor design.Secondly, and more importantly, the mobile wouldn't fit on our crib or changing table as it is apparently designed for a crib with a short bar at the top. We have a Babyletto brand crib and changing table, so nothing weird or unusual. So sad. Now we have to return it.Before buying, make sure your crib or changing table has only a thin bar at the top in order to accomodate this mobile! I'm sure if this weren't the case I would have otherwise been quite happy with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP!!!","review":"Don't expect a lot from this mobile! I wanted a stimulating mobile, but I ended up with just frustration. The plastic cards that hang are SO hard to take apart. We cracked a few in the process. The end result was a cheap looking mobile that looks like it could have been made by a kindergartener. I do NOT recommend this mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke while putting it together!","review":"Straight out of the box I wasn't impressed by how completely cheap this product is. What a shame too, it definitely looks like a neat thing for a baby to look at. Upon constructing it (and trying very hard to be gentle while getting badly cut pieces to fit together), it snapped with little effort. The plastic used on this is so thin that it really worries me what would happen if the baby just happened to grab this thing. It would quickly become a chocking hazard.The cards are also very cheaply made. I considered just keeping the cards for the baby to look at in some way (haven't figured out how yet), but I don't think I'd just hand them to the baby to play with. Again, they'd probably break just as easily.I'll be looking for a similar style mobile and hopefully I can find one that is much better quality. This thing isn't worth the money, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves it in the morning","review":"When my baby was 5 weeks I printed off some stimulation images from the internet and taped them to the bottom of the shelf over his changing area.He LOVED (and still does at 3mos) looking at them.Once he started smiling and cooing at them, I decided I needed something similar for his co-sleeper.This mobile by Manhattan fits the bill perfectly.I don't miss having a music box or motorized movement. Baby's excited kicks shake it gently, which is great from a developmental perspective.Cons:~Very tricky to attach to a co-sleeper...a clap base would be handier.I SUPPOSE you could cut and paste your own images to pieces of hard plastic and fashion a mobile yourself, but for $20 it's worth saving your time and simply purchasing this mobile.Baby loves staring at it in the morning while I get ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"Like another reviewer I broke one of the arms while assembling it. Other than that part, the rest of the assmebly was intuitive. The build quality is fairly cheap, but it is probably \\"good enough for $20\\" except for the arm.So I'll be ordering some super glue to fix the broken part:("},{"rating":"1","title":"snapped","review":"I broke the arm while putting it together!!! I was so excited about this item because it is based on educational principles and I was equally bummed when it snapped in half!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I must admit that my daughter enjoyed looking at this mobile for the first couple months of her life. My complaint is that the product is flimsy for the price. The holes punched in the cards were so small that when hooked onto the arms of the mobile they cracked (many arrived already cracked). The arms and cards tend to fall off if accidentally touched even slightly. And the cards are somewhat translucent so you can see the image on the reverse as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for newborns!","review":"We received this mobile as a gift when our daughter was only a few weeks old. She was fascinated by it from the beginning and continues to be interested in it even at 6 months. (Once she started getting grabby, we had to remove the extra plastic links so that the images were out of reach.) Our baby clearly preferred this mobile to the musical one that we bought her (at twice the price, I see now). The changeable images keep it interesting and stimulating, from very simple black/white/ red geometics for the youngest babies, to more colorful images and faces as baby gets older. This mobile is designed for infants up to 5 months, but our 6 and 1/2 month old is still interested in it--I haven't had the heart to move it from its position on the changing table. One of the best gifts ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea--POOR quality","review":"As an ophthalmologist, I can attest to the functional utility of this product. Newborns truly are drawn to high contrast patterns--but this product is so poorly made I would not recommend it. The plastic cards are badly made--3 of them were broken straight out of the box such that I had to use tape to put them back together. In addition, the holes in the card to attach to the main apparatus are inconsistent so that some fit too loosely and are easily knocked off while others are so tight I can't get them attached. If motivated, you could probably make your own sturdier mobile--the patterns are available online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much cooler on a fishing line and hook in the ceiling!","review":"My daughter (now 10 months old) has loved this from the day we got it, when she was only 2 weeks old! The trick is to ditch the plastic rod it comes with and put a small eye hook into the ceiling and then hang the mobile with clear fishing line. This allows it to spin freely and really keep the baby's attention. My dad also used an Exacto knife to cut slits in all of the discs so that we can use all of them in any position. Annoying tweaks? Yes. But totally worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor materials","review":"We really hoped to get a good stimulating mobile for our child, and this looked perfect. Upon un-packaging though, it became very clear that it was not a very well made toy. The cards are a flimsy plastic that has the tabs easily tear off. Two of the preset card pairs tore just straightening them into the T-shape. I am not willing to take a risk that the tabs may break off and become a choking hazard. IMHO it should cost about $10. We are disappointed and will be returning the mobile and looking for something that is better built."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"I was looking forward to this product. The actual pieces are hard to switch out. I could tell that my baby was looking for it to move like her other mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I only had 100 pages left to go in this book and gave up.

Pillivuyt quality is very high -- you can tell at a glance that these are not cheaply made.Note that there are two 4-inch diameter Pillivuyt pleated souffles, but at present the Amazon descriptions do not accurately distinguish them. The \\"deep classic\\" souffle is 2.5 inches high and holds 1.5 cups (12 oz), whereas the \\"classic\\" souffle is 2 inches deep and holds 1.25 cups (10 oz).Here is a tip that you may find useful: the dark blue plastic lids from 12 oz (and 12.5 oz) canisters of Planters peanuts fit both of these 4-inch diameter) souffles perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite what I wanted, but no worries","review":"The product itself is fine, but not quite what I wanted.

I haven't had time to repack and return the broken shards to Amazon, so haven't received a refund.

BEST OF privileges ballads like \\"Straight to You\\" and pop misfires like \\"Deanna\\" over scorching essays in domestic depravity and spiritual despair like \\"Jack the Ripper\\" and \\"City of Refuge\\" (from HENRY'S DREAM and TENDER PREY, respectively). The radio-ready schmaltz of \\"The Ship Song\\" (1990) and \\"Into my Arms\\" (1997) marks the descent of the former Birthday Party screamer from an agent of chaos to a sort of Harry Chapin for aging Goths. A proper retrospective of Cave's most raw-boned demon blues could stun a mule at twenty paces, but this major-label package ain't it. 1993's LIVE SEEDS captures Cave closer to his prime. --Michael Draine (first appeared in Vendetta #11)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Seeds","review":"THis music takes a very specific flavor.

I was really excited to learn more about the history of Iran, for it has become such a controversial nation last few years, but now, I am very much disgusted by my stupidest decision. Also the author mumbles everywhere and does not focus. He needs to find a big goddamn idea and weave everything together.

The LaCie response, \\"We don't repair drives. Buy a new one.\\" I am left with a $180 dollar doorstop and a resolve to never purchase another LaCie product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Solid for 2 Years","review":"I've never experienced the former reviewers unfortunate issues with this LaCie Drive.

I'm done with LaCie. Two failed after a year and the two remaining are failing now, clicking and clacking and regularly unmounting themselves. They look great! ... designed by a famous guy, but what's inside should last longer than a year!LaCie knows it, and didn't want to look at my failed drives at all. After all, they outlasted the warantee, and that was all that was needed for them.I ended up with some from Mercury (Elite Firewire 800 Pro).

I hoped to get a pair of headphones to cancel out distractions while I studies. I definitely got what I paid for as these headphones are lightweight, comfortable, and awful at noise cancellation. When the noise canceling feature is turned on, the volume of the primary signal dramatically decreases. Also, when there is any bass being played the headphones send out an annoying low pulsing that hurts my ears.Overall if you are looking for headphones these are okay, but if you're looking for noise cancellation, pay for a really good pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Jazz","review":"Great music from 3 of the greastest erotic films of the 60s. The high part of this album is the lengthy booklet including many pictures from the films. I am a little unhappy that some of the songs have the dialogue included. There is another edition of the Vixen soundtrack that is more complete but is no longer in circulation. Very impressed with Lorna and Faster Pussycat. A great buy for any Russ Meyer fan or filmatic jazz fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rest in peace Russ Meyer","review":"This CD features the soundtracks to three of Russ Meyer's films. Unfortunately, the recording quality isn't very good. The music seems to be taken directly from the films, because most of the tracks have film dialogue over the music. Plus, the music isn't all that great to begin with. Igo Kantor is no Bernard Hermann. Anyway, people don't watch Russ Meyer movies to hear the music. They watch them to see busty women. Fortunately, the booklet that comes with the CD shows many pictures of Russ Meyer's women, with and without clothes. This CD is for Russ Meyer's biggest fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not frosted--hooray!","review":"So glad they're not frosted as they're already very sweet.

Not too sweet but just right. Initially only me and my 3 yr old ate them but now everybody in the household enjoys these, not to sweet, snacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"hugely disappointing","review":"What happened? This album amounts to a mid-life crisis. One of the things I've always worshipped about Liz Phair was her capacity for innovative lyrics and sound.. these songs don't even sound smart. I guess the pix in the CD say it all... and it's just sad that someone so creative and groundbreaking felt that at this stage she needed to espouse what is now so commonplace in female \\"rock.\\" My only hope is that she returns to what she does best-- because in that arena she's still tops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be ...?","review":"This is a dreadful album. Phair has squandered every ounce of her indie credibility, and produced an album that doesn't even work on its own obviously very hit oriented terms. There are benefits to selling out, but I can't imagine that she is going to reap any of them with this slick, processed junk. This is the first disc that I have bought in a long time where I actually feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phair fan...run and hide!","review":"A complete train wreck. Whip-Smart and Exile in Guyville to this? Don't beleive any of the good reviews on this album...rarely does a sell out make it so apparent to the world. Liz, I never thought you would be the one to take the dive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Self Titled, but No Liz","review":"I never knew who Liz Phair was before \\"Why Can't I?\\", but I was hooked to her since. I did get the self titled, but along with her debut album Exile In Guyville. I loved the self-titled, but the debut album just blew for me. But after a while I started to like Exile more and more, soon I got her other albums and got the rarities on the internet, but I soon realized something. Liz wrote excellent songs in the beginning, but her ability was slowly declining with each record.The self titled strays so far from any of the other albums that is should not even be considered part of the same family. The album would be good if Liz had not decided to suck up the lyrics babbling on about sex and etc. She did talk about these things in earlier albums but she was much smarter about it. Her clever lyrics run dry in this album. The only reason you should have this album is if you need to complete your Liz collection, or if you are obsessed with \\"Why Can't I?\\" and \\"Extraordinary.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the critics - Liz still writes great songs","review":"Let's give this whole sell-out notion a rest - this is Ms. Phair continuing to write provocative and honest songs with great rock sensibilities. If you loved Guyville, Whip Smart and/or WhiteChocolateSpaceEgg, you will enjoy Extraordinary, Rock Me, WHC and others.Yes, more of the songs (particularly the Matrix produced) are commercially accessible, but that doesn't automatically make them bad. Sure, Why Can't I sounds like Avril, but an Avril that is 15 years older, divorced and raising a young son on her own. The lyrics remain engaging and poignant.The more I listen to this record, the more I prefer it to her past efforts. I respect Ms. Phair for moving onward and upward - and I particularly for providing us a damn good record. Now if we could only get her to do a record with Paul Westerberg, I could die a happy man..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling out never sounded so bad","review":"Unlike most of Liz Phair's fans I couldn't care less if she wants to be a big star. She's been in the business for a long time and if she wants to cash in I say more power to her. All I care about is the music being good. On this album the music is not good. In fact, it just plain sucks. Hey Liz- if your going to throw away years of integrity and being true to yourself and your fans itleast try to sound good doing it. Honestly, if the songs didn't suck, all would be forgiven. So long Liz, it was fun while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same stuff","review":"Exile in Guyville.... what an incredible album. If you want to listen to it again, please put it back on the turntable, and quit whining that her new albun isn't the same. It shouldn't be! Are you doing the same things now that you were doing in 1993? Are your opinions and words the same? If not, why do you expect hers to stay the same? If you're looking for a nostalgia kick, don't get this album, it won't satisfy you. But if you forget the past and listen with open ears, this is actually a pretty good album. There are some dogs, and the first single (Why Can't I) is super poppy and sounds nothing at all like old liz. But listen to Extraordinary, Rock me, or Friend of Mine, and you'll hear something worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I can't i think whenever i hear this junk","review":"Oh goody! liz phair, my favorite forever! time to get her new album...When I first heard this I thought...oops the factory mixed this up with avril!

Terrible music, laughable lyrics, and over-the-top bubblegum production. It was nice knowing you Liz..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Liz Phair or Britney Spears?","review":"Rarely do I buy a CD that's so bad I refuse to listen to it for a second time and give it a chance. This is one of those rarities. If you're an existing fan of Liz Phair - DON'T BUY THIS CD! It appears Liz wants to join the ranks of over-produced, talentless pop princesses. Why? She must need the money. It's just so sad. I have more respect for Michelle Branch. Buy her album instead; it's much better than this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril, Pink, with a side of Madonna and a dash of Britney","review":"Just thinking about the existence of this album propels me to listen to \\"Exile in Guyville\\" very, very loud in celebration of the brash, assertive, intimate voice that single-handedly personified female heterosexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED ARTIST","review":"WHY ANYONE STILL CARES ABOUT LIZ PHAIR IS BEYOND ME.. SHE MADE SOME MINOR HEADWAVES WITH HER FIRST RECORD.. IT SHOCKED SOME WITH HER EXPLICIT LYRICS.. SHE IS AN OK ROCKER - WHIP SMART WAS A PRETTY GOOD RECORD - BUT HER VOICE HAS ALWAYS SUCKED..

When Exile came out I was 24 (or so). About the same age as her. My taste in music went very close to what she was playing then. Now? I am 34 and my taste in music has changed. This is what sounds like happened to her. Kids, marriage, divorce, age progression...these things change a person. This isn't EIC, but I think if she put that out again, it would sound more forced than what is on this album. Take it for what it is, a good pop album by a great artist.PS SEE HER LIVE...SHE ROCKS. And she looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garishly overpainted","review":"As a long time Liz fan, I've been looking forward to this album since 'Whitechocolatespaceegg'. And while it took me a little while to warm up to that album, I don't anticipate warming up to this one at all. It is entirely overproduced. The clever, insightful lyrics typical of Liz have been drowned out by a heavy dose of Pop-formula studio tricks. The most frustrating aspect of the album is that you get a key for an online EP called 'Come and Get It' that does not suffer from expensive studio time. Instead you get the lyrics, voice & guitar work of Liz raw, like we're used to. But you can only listen to the songs on an internet-connected computer. Release the songs as-is & I'll pay for them. Though I'd rather trade in the 14 song 'Liz Phair' release straight up for the 4 song EP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liz or Avril?","review":"All the critics have said it, and for once they're right: This album sounds like Avril Lavigne. Really. Almost no difference. A couple of songs start out sounding like Liz, but they quickly fall back into pop-formula predictablilty.If you like Avril Lavigne, you'll love this album. It sounds like Avril grown up and more edge to the lyrics. If you like Liz Phair, go dig out the first three albums and enjoy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment of 03...","review":"First thing, I love Liz Phair. However, this album is radio pap, and just as bad as everyone has warned you. I'm guessing she needed to cash in for her own reasons, but I'm going to pretend I never listened to it and hold out hope for a future record. I may have been slightly moved by \\"Little Digger\\", but I'm a mom and it's easy to pull those heartstrings.\\"Exile\\" is obviously her best, but I really liked \\"Spaceegg\\" so noone would mistake me for an indie purist.Maybe if we all deny we ever heard this record, it will just go away...."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star...One Awful Album","review":"This will probably go down as one of the greatest sell outs in rock history. An album this gross makes you wonder if the whole Liz Phair thing was a sham to begin with. I know I'm taking this cd and the two old Liz Phair records I own and sell them so they can be where they belong -- the USED cd bin. PLEASE don't waste your money on this god awful record -- buy Kelly Clarkston or Avil Lavine instead -- at least they did their cheesy albums with integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for hardcore Liz Phair fans!","review":"She sold out. Period, the end.At the risk of sounding like a music snob of some sort, chances are, if you're a Liz Phair fan dating back to her Guyville (or for some, Girlysound) days, you probably won't take to this specific album. In fact, this album just may depress you. With the exception of a *few* good songs (courtesy of the lyrical content), this is a pathetic attempt for marketable pop exposure. But, that's pretty damn obvious to those of us who know that Liz Phair existed BEFORE the song \\"Why Can't I?\\" tainted the airwaves.I still think Phair's magnificent, so for the hardcore Liz fans, just ignore this album and focus on her indie gems, or really, any material made PRIOR to this album.For those of you who identify yourself as Phair fans because you couldn't get enough of the annoyingly played out, \\"Why Can't I?\\", check out her latest album, Somebody's Miracle. (It's actually pretty good.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Explicit Explicit","review":"There is little saving grace in this collection of explicit lyrics and images. I'm not a prude. I know where all the explicit lyrics are on Jefferson Airplane albums. I've got copies of The Fugs and the Mothers of Invention in my collection. And even Judy Collins has been sensational, in her day.But this is like listening to a high school sophomore trying to be sexy. The music is, at best, jelly bean. Her voice is a little sultry. But the images here, the lyrics here are just plain crude.I've read Henry Miller, and be it Capricorn or Cancer, those tropics leave nothing to anyone's imagination. Liz is at best a fair pornographer. She wants to be a bad girl. She doesn't have a prayer. She hasn't had enough Wild Turkey in her life to know what it really is like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Yes, sexy cover, but this is one of the most bland albums I have heard in a long time. I guess trying to go mainstream requires that. Too bad.One song after another; musicially uninteresting, shallow bland lyrics ('Rock Me' is a perfect example).Not worth a second listen.Too bad.I guess this is what it takes to get a hit record these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Liz...seriously? Part I","review":"She can't sing. At least when she was an indie chick she had the word \\"alternative\\" to excuse her from needing to sound any good. The commercial experiment, which consists of \\"Liz Phair\\" and \\"Somebody's Miracle,\\" was a huge failure artistically and commercially. Sad but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liz Phair gone terribly wrong","review":"This is the worst Liz Phair album to date. Liz decided to trade in her unqiue lyrics for cliches instead. Now we get 'baby, baby, baby, if it's alright/I want you to rock me all night' or 'why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?/why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?' I have no problem when an artist wants to go mainstream. Hey I can't blame Liz for wanting to get a little media attention. Almost a decade in hiding with three wonderful albums that the America public doesn't know about. Sure she deserved more recognition. But why is it in our society that an artist has to wipe away any of the artistic integrity they had to begin with and replace it with a new style to conform? This is one of the worst albums of 2003 (along with Jewel's) and you should not get it. For better music check out older Liz Phair, PJ Harvey, Veruca Salt, and Hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"sell out, with liz ,oh yeah","review":"remember when liz phair wrote interesteing, creative, personal songs and stories? Remember when her musical and singing styles were interesting and original? Well, Liz finally gave in and decided musical integrity wasn't important, so she watered everything down for the money. Don't buy this album, it's terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Can't Sing","review":"Liz Phair can't sing. If you've ever heard her perform live, always off key. It's painful to listen to. Obviously her cd was highly tweaked so she sound somewhat better on her studio efforts. Plus, she comes off as being very full of her self, typical of most ex high school cheerleading brats. What she's doing in the music industry is a complete mystery....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"The only other cd I have of Liz Phair is \\"Whitechoclatespaceegg\\" and \\"Liz Phair\\" is exceptionally better. The tunes that the Matrix produced are the best tracks but there are other decent tracks surrounding these songs. Some of my favorite tracks are Extraordinary, Why Can't I, Rock Me, and Little Digger. The cd does lose a little steam towards the end but it is enough to keep you interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Exile in Guyville instead","review":"If you think Liz Phair just hit the scene w/ this piece of garbage, go instead buy Exile in Guyville, which is truly amazing. Liz, you're not a 20 year old anymore, so stop trying to act like one, and \\"make it\\". Its not going to happen for you anyways"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTRAORDINARY!","review":"What a relief! This album ROCKS! It is very meaty, and full of excellent substance. Liz has grown up, but it hasn't changed her music ability! She's gotten more daring! \\"extraordinary\\" is an excellent way to start the cd-WITH A BANG. \\"Little Digger\\" is very heartbreaking, but a great song. And then there is H.W.C-you just want to get up dance. For all you old time liz fans give this cd a chance, she's still the same old liz! All the songs just get better and better! the album is definately \\"EXTRAODINARY\\"!!! 5 beautiful stars!!! Way to go LIZ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Liz Phair rock album!","review":"Honestly, this album rocks out pretty good in a couple spots,and really lends itself to being blasted out of a car stereo at relativelyhigh volume. If you've heard the single/saw the video/caught heron Leno, by all means, dive right in and pick up a copy of \\"Liz Phair\\".You'll like it. She's a clever musician.\\"Liz Phair\\" is not Exile In Guyville pt. II, but I don't think anyone was really expecting that. This is a very accessible album, and should go a long way towards raising awareness of this super-intelligent singer/songwriter amongst the public. Long-time fans may lament the fact that some of that distinctive Liz Phair sound has been lost: tenuous, pitchy vocals have been traded for studio-perfect leads. Unusual chord voicings that are the result of teaching yourself how to play guitar, have been swapped out for super heavy power chords that would make Spinal Tap proud. :-)End of the day, it's a good-sounding album from a very talented musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disappointing.","review":"No one can blame Liz Phair for wanting sh**loads of money and trying to make a successful pop album. But the Matrix-produced tracks on this CD are just insipid and irritating. Even many of the non-Matrix tracks, with the exception of \\"Little Digger,\\" disappoint. I hope this album does well, so that she won't wait another five years before releasing her next CD. Because for long-time fans, the best that can be done now is to keep listening to Exile, Whip-Smart, Juvenilia, and WCSE, and hope Liz' next album will be better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I've been a fan since I heard Guyville and I had high expectations when I heard a new disc was coming out. I'm sorry but this one leaves me limp. I can understand an artist needing to grow,but Liz has changed into a banal, talentless mess. Lacking wit and sophistication that have been her trademarks, she has made a disc lacking in any emotion or flair."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"maybe it's just me, but it seems like Liz Phair could use some help with her singing. I got this record from my cousin, and Liz looks pretty good on the front cover, so I was interested - but then I was real disappointed with the music. maybe she oughta put on some clothes & learn to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly disappointing...","review":"I like Liz Phair. Only, I'm talking about \\"Exile in Guyville\\" Liz Phair. I love that CD. I adore it. Songs like \\"F*ck and Run\\" and \\"The Divorce Song\\" and \\"Help Me Mary\\" were so honest and so truthful, I couldn't help but love them. But this CD...it was your typical, sugary pop music. And I think if you take this album, and listen to it without ever knowing about Liz Phair's past records, it's OK. \\"Why Can't I?\\" is infectious and easily gets stuck in your head. \\"Friend of Mine\\" seems kind of earnest and honest, and I found the lyrics very easy to relate to. \\"Rock Me\\" is funny. But if you put this next to \\"Exile in Guyville,\\" it's a shame, a really unfortunate shame. It doesn't even hold a candle to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"life lessons ...","review":"Liz Phair has entered a new phase in her life with this release. Earlier on, she was the sexually-liberated young woman, showing every girl that what's good for the gander is good for the goose, and more so. The optimistic among her audience hoped that as she grew older, she'd grow wiser and satisfied, abandoning the impulse to sow oats just as wild as her male counterparts.Unfortunately, she is now giving lie to the myth of female sexual liberation. Certainly, this is unintentional on her part - she'll realize it far too late. But for those of us on the outside, we now see very clearly what comes of all this - not a confident, strong, independent woman, but a grovelling, used-up (...). Much luck to Little Digger, the unfortunate first in a long line of children to wonder who is using their mother - he'll need it. One might be inclined to offer luck to Phair as well, but she wouldn't know what to do with it if she got it; she's still championing the life on the back, spread eagle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liz...Liz...Liz.....","review":"Liz's latest album is practicably intolerable. Such a fine artist has chosen now to wade in the end of shallowness. A huge admirer of her previous work, this album is pathetic. Only a handful of well written tracks that resemble the talented Liz that we know of are present out of the 14 on this record. The rest sound like the worst 1980's metal band you could ever imagine. Very sad indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIZ PHAIR IS FROM MY HOMETOWN!!!!! READ ON","review":"Liz Phair is a great artist. She has some great hits and has a powerful voice. Yet, the real reason I am here telling you about this album because Liz came from my hometown Winnetka, IL. I bet you're thinking, so what, tons of people came from Philly, Chicago, New York. But to think that a star went to my school that I am in now, I just can hardley believe it. You see, Winnetka is a very very small town. It's very very wealthy too. But, I just wanted to show the world that the little town of Winnetka is very grateful of Liz's work. Oh, and you should def. buy this album! SHARE THE LOVE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing mess","review":"When I bought the CD I failed to see the parental warning label. It is kind of dark on a dark background. I bought the cd, and started to play it in my car with the volume low because my family was visiting and we were talking. When I dropped them off at the hotel, I turned up the volume and nearly blushed. I am not a prude, but I also don't need to listen to vulgar language for entertainment. I Can only imagine what would have occured if my family heard the lyrics, I would be mortified. If I were you, stick to Annie Lennox's Bare or the new Lucinda Williams.

Heard her on NPR and she seems to be getting a bit desperate as her career progresses. Album has 2 good classic Phair tunes other than that she sounds like a whiner.

After waiting so many years since whitechocolatespacegg, which was my first Liz Phair CD and one of my favorites in my whole collection, this is a massive disappointment. There are a four or five tracks in the second half of the album that actually sound like Liz had something to do with them, but even then, they come across as weak, filler-ish attempts compared to what we're used to from her. Maybe this selling-out technique will work, (if it does, I guess we can't blame her - after all, who doesn't like money?) and the people who enjoy Avril will like this, but I have to say that I'm hoping for a flop if that's what it takes to get her to release a good album again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"When I first heard this album, I almost fell off my chair. The song content was the same old, same old, but it was presented in a whiny, adolescent, user-friendly format that seemed to come from Liz Phair's younger, worse-songwriter sister than from Phair herself.The mirth from \\"Exile\\" is gone, and what's left is a rehash of the old material, like the revamping of \\"Flower\\" (sold as \\"H.W.C.\\"), and some profanity to deviate from totally sounding like Avril Lavigne.This isn't Liz Phair, because I know that Liz Phair would never do anything as embarrassing as this album. At the end of the CD, the question presented itself: whatever happened to the real Liz Phair?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Life isn't phair.","review":"My Top 5 fun musical jokes over the last few years:1.

Before this review is dismissed as lacking in depth, it should be noted that whatever depth may not be present in said review, is simply rooted in the depth that isn't present in Phair's latest album.Not to be a killjoy, I tried every track and listened in full. Not a single song got me sonically-affected."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it away to my friend...","review":"This album was my introduction to Liz Phair (I was in kindergarden when 'Exile In Guyville' was released, okay?) and at the time I bought it, I thought it was pretty good. I guess it's because I didn't have any of her other albums to compare it by. It interested me enough to make me go out and buy 'whitechocolatespaceegg' with which I was only mildly impressed with. When I got my hands on 'Whip-Smart' however, I was blown away. I loved 'Whip-Smart' and thought that this CD was pretty weak in comparison. I admit, it's catchy at times but here's the thing: I like her older stuff better because it's different. It stands out. Her song arrangements and her way with lyrics were so much different from the mainstream. It was really refreshing. Now she sounds like everybody else. It's kind of a shame, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Poppy","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Phair's. While this latest cd is sure to aggravate some, it's very spritely and fun.

Regrettably, this was the first cd I've ever purchased there (on my first visit to the big-blue dynamo in over two years no less). My version is lacking \\"HWC.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"my dear liz phair...","review":"The thing I (used to) love about Liz Phair's music is that at first you don't really like it and then you listen and listen and it grows and grows on you. Every song on this album was easy listening - bad sign. I can't get the songs out of my head and I want to!If she'd only not had such lame backing music and vocal synthesis I think the album would be OK - it's as though she wrote these interesting tunes with her guitar and handed them over to her producers saying \\"butcher me, baby!\\".It's really disapointing - at best, a wider audience will be attracted to her music now and she might get some more worthy recognition for her brilliant first three albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to your roots Liz!","review":"Liz should maybe have listened to Exile in Guyville before making this album. A disappointing effort from someone who has so much talent. Trying to go Avril Lavigne-ish doesn't work for her, unfortunately. It is still nice to see that she does try hard to be the 'old' Liz Phair, but, I think it is purely an act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whip-Smarm","review":"It is great for an artist to evolve and to branch out. It is a welcome thing to see them attempt new styles and embrace new influences. However, it is not ok when they lose all their dignity, sense of humor, integrity and common sense.Sorry, Liz. It is indeed better by far to get paid, but to churn out dull, contrived, manufactured, bandwagon pop is a slap-in-the-face to the fans and to oneself as an artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not get much worse than this","review":"I have been a devoted Liz Phair fan since she began. While Whip-Smart and Whitechocolatespaceegg never matched her brilliant Exile in Guyville all three are great alblums and will always have constant play on my stereo. Whoever advisesd her to put out a pop alblum has made the biggest mistake since New Coke. What is next? Joe Jackson doing gangsta rap? Portishead putting out a polka alblum? There is not one redeeming quailty to this pop hororr. I suppose her song H.W.C. is her nod to her bad girl past, but it does not work when set to a tune that Tiffany would be comfertable singing. I will always love Liz, she is stunning and talented. I just hope that as Coke quickly recognized the erorr of their ways when they changed their formula, Liz will also come to her senses and issue another alblum to help rinse the horrid taste of this one from my ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"I find myself playing this CD alot.","review":"Oh the pains of a major pop music star. If they make something new that sounds like something old they are hated just as much as if they make something new that sounds new. The throngs of bad reviews this CD received set me in the mindset to not seriously consider this effort from Liz until I found myself doing a funny thing. I surprisingly found myself playing it alot. Its power cord pop. Its naughty girly lyrics. Its songs about thinking about sex, wanting sex, having sex. And its got a beat you can hardly not shake your butt to or at least bang out some air guitar .The anti pop sounds of early Liz (and the likes of Cobain,Pearl Jam and RH Chili Peppers) is todays pop sounds so it seems a bit cheezy to complain that an artist isn't as hip today as they were when they first were discovered.Bottem line: A critically disclaimed CD that is surprisingly good. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible CD","review":"I can't believe I wasted my money on this lousy wannabe album. Liz is in her late 30s and she thinks she can suddenly be teeny popstar Avril Laguine...yuck! Her lyrics make me cringe, her singing is pathetically overdone and the songs are like nursery rhymes. I can't think of any other artist that has completely erased her credibilty this quickly. You better put out a great record real soon, Liz, or your fifteen minutes are up. Sorry, but that's what you get for humiliating yourself for the almighty $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril?

That's the gist of the negative reviews piled onto this album. Anyone who found this album to be out of sorts with Liz's previous work really needs to have their ears checked/cleaned/scraped... Whitechocolatespaceegg was most certainly a pop album, not as shiny as Liz Phair, but still pop through and through. The self-titled album is a clear extension of of Liz's pop momentum. It's a brilliant album with every song deserving a listen. Easily one of the best albums to come out that year! Just because you don't need a decoder ring to decipher the lyrics doesn't make this a bad album, it just makes you pretentious for expecting it!Best Songs: Extraordinary and HWC!!-stoney72"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop music for grown-ups","review":"I'm a big Liz Phair fan who was pretty cautious of her newer, more refined (i.e. pop) sound but I love this album. She retains the edge that made her famous but rocks out in a very fun way. This is pop music for people who think they're too cool for pop music. I think the thing I love most is the upfront and confident sexuality she displays. Young pop princesses who flaunt their sexuality are a dime a dozen. But on this album, Liz shows them how a real woman does it. I have worn grooves into this CD from listening to it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go For the Explicit Version","review":"Though this is a rock solid pop album with excellent songs, it is hard to have the entire experience of a Liz Phair record that has been edited. While there are some awesome tracks- namely \\"Extraordinary\\" and \\"Rock Me\\" which need not be edited, overall the explicit record is a more complete experience and the way this record was intended to be listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is what happens when the music biz takes charge","review":"So sad to hear this album after the wonderful Whitechocolatespaceegg. I can only surmise that her a&r rep said, \\"look honey, we're going to do things our way this time.\\" This CD is like if Wilco had listened to their record comany on YHF and reworked the songs until the record company liked them. Thank God Wilco didn't, but it sounds like Liz Phair did! So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look out Britney Spears!","review":"I am a big fan of old Liz Phair.Unfortunately, with this album, Ms. Phair's lyrics have been reduced to predictable cliches and her sound is over-produced and has lost any splendor and unpredictability it once had.The result is an album that owes more to Britney Spears and other teeny-pop than any of Liz Phair's previous work. You'll find my copy with many others on the used rack at Amoeba Records in Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only thing extraordinary is the body","review":"Just a news flash, theres nothing extraordinary about you.

Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just doesn't sound like her!","review":"I've been a fan now for three years and when her new album came out I was so excited. After putting it on I felt it wasn't what I expected. It just doesn't sound like her. Don't get me wrong it's a good album but just not Liz phair's! I'm also a fan of Michelle Branch and it sounds more like her music. The song writing used to make you think and every time I listened to a song I would find something I hadn't noticed. She was witty and creative with her lyrics. Now they are good but they give you less to think about. I'm still a fan and I do recommend this album to anyone who isn't an indie Pop fan but if you are than go with whip-smart or exile in guyville before you get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY CLEAN VERSION...","review":"Do not buy this. Liz Phair censored is like a car with no gas. First off the whole song of H.W.C. is gone, which was a great song. I can't even imagine the rest of the songs and how they got butchered. Just buy the Explicit version..so what she says F*ck once or twice. Please.

While I think \\"Why Can't I\\" and \\"Red Light Fever\\" are ok, the rest seems almost like filler giving this release a short life in the rotation. My biggest issue is the repetitive choruses, I hate to advocate buying songs from others but maybe Liz should consider this. If you must buy this CD, get it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Liz a Break! This is a quality CD!","review":"Liz has been getting a lot of flack for this CD. I have to admit, I have only been with her since whitechocolatespaceegg. However, the rather mean-spirited criticism Liz has been getting is greatly undue. It's a great CD. Just be prepared for something different.I, personally, don't even think it's THAT different than whitechocolatespaceegg, but everyone else seems to think so. It's a bit bigger, faster, and frankly it's more focused. Standouts include the soaring \\"Extraordinary\\", the Complicated-esque \\"Why Can't I?\\" (you definately can see the Matrix stamp here), the sly \\"Firewalker\\", and the sleek and muscular \\"My Bionic Eyes\\". They're rock songs, and you wouldn't play them in a coffeeshop, but that doesn't mean they're dishonest and stupid.I think this album proves Ms. Phair's versatility as an artist, and I think that should be celebrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"lollipop","review":"This CD is not the Liz Phair i know and love!

Had she writren all of the songs, this could have been a five star album (well, rock me [stinks], IMHO), posibly as good as Exile. Also, Windows users can burn the Internet EP to a CD used Media Player 9, but the protected asf file cant be converted to a wav, so it can't be played on a regular home stereo. You're paying for those 5 songs by the way, but you can't use them. If Capitol Records, or whomever, would do like Wilco and The Dead have done and make the Internet EP available as MP3 or shn files, then this would be less of a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible shame.","review":"Oh dear. She appears to have lost the plot completely. Cashing in on your body is the last resort of the washed-up and dried-out. The album sounds identical to everything else being played on MTV at the moment. I predict she will be on the next cover of Rolling Stone, the indespensible guide to worthlessness in modern music.If you like Liz Phair, don't buy this. If you are a fan of Avril Lavigne, but she's not growed-up enough for you, then by all means, purchase away. It's as bad as Tatu, but with swearing (ooer!).I, for one, am quite disappointed. To draw a spurious comparison, it's as though Picasso, realising that nobody looks at painted art any more, decided to start tightrope walking, whistling dixie.And as for you, Liz: you should be unutterably ashamed, a girl of your age."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to liz phair?","review":"if you're looking for liz phair, you're not going to find her on this cd. she has completely lost her edge on this album. lyrics are plain, soft, and they all seem to have a popish melody. however, if you're into the teenage radio pop music, you might enjoy this album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"Liz Phair..sexy pop star? Is this a Saturday Night Live skit? What?!? It's serious. NO way Jose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album and the Internet EP is Great Too","review":"A great album with a good range of music and some very personal lyrics. My favourite is \\"Little Digger\\". Well, I have to admit that this album is more towards pop than rock but it sure sounds better than the current pop/rock albums out there. And don't forget the check out the bonuses in the Internet too. The \\"Comeandgetit\\" Internet EP has 5 songs and they are to me like an extension of the album - not just some B-side rejects. Old Liz Phair fans may find the materials in the Comeandgetit Internet EP more agreeable because it is less-produced. Some of the stuffs in \\"Comeandgetit\\" are even better than the ones inside the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care what the critics say. This cd is great!","review":"I was really worried that this cd was going to [be bad]. Most reviews I read prior to purchasing said that this was one of the worst cd's of the year. I'm not sure what cd the critics are listening to but I think this cd is incredible. Yes, many of the songs are catchy and somewhat pop. But I think it is a logical progression for Liz to take. I would hate it if she just continued to release the same cd over and over.Some of my favorites are Rock Me, Little Digger & HWC. This is worth buying no matter what the \\"critics\\" say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"Ater waiting years for this album I was aghast to learn that the Matrix poppers were given control over the destiny of this album.

After listening to the whole CD, the only question I have is \\"Why Can't I\\" get a refund?? I found this CD incredibly disappointing and think that only a couple of tracks have merit besides her hit single. And certainly \\"Favorite\\" and \\"HWC\\" rate as 2 of the worst songs I have ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"as bad as you've heard","review":"If this is the \\"real Liz Phair\\" as another reviewer has suggested, she's had an alteration. Apart from pure money grubbing cynicism, that's the only possible explanation for the brilliantly insightful ironist of previous albums coming up with stuff like \\"Rock Me\\" or that asinine underwear song. The sad thing is that, rather than sounding like Avril Lavigne, as she's apparently trying to do, Liz sounds like Avril trying to sound like Liz Phair (instead of her cute, spunky teenaged self) and failing miserably. Basically, this is the worst thing I've bought since washed up 60's bands tried to make themselves relevant with tinkly synthesizers and drum machines in the 80's. I can only hope that commercial failure will lead Liz back to what she's good at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, Just Not What She Was","review":"Okay, if this were Liz Phair's first album, everyone would be all over it with compliments. But because she's changed a bit in the last ten years, everyone's complaining. Stop.

Aren't you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Departure from her previous works does not mean \\"dreadful\\".","review":"There have been thousands of reviews written about this album by rock critics way more qualified than I, so I'll just make this simple:* If you're looking for an album that sounds like Phair's first record, \\"Exile in Guyville\\", you will be disappointed.* If you're an avid Phair fan, you'll be a little confused by her new direction, but this album is worth hearing. (One could argue that it's the next point in the trajectory started by \\"Whitechocolatespaceegg\\".)* If you love top 40 pop music and have heard 'Why Can't I?' on the radio, you'll probably love this album, or at least most of it.Good news for longtime Phair fans who are a little iffy on this record: buying this disc will unlock the magic electronic key to allow you to download another EP online, which is quite different from this album and well worth hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was bound to happen...just take it for what it is.","review":"i've been a diehard liz fan since \\"exile in guyville\\", so i'm probably biased & will most likely love anything she does, including this. yes, it's pop. & yes, you have heard \\"why can't i\\" & \\"extraordinary\\" in almost every cheesy romantic comedy that has come out in the past few years. i think the help liz got from all the superstar producers sort of swallowed up her real individuality. she is still somewhat honest in songs with lyrics that she actually wrote by herself (little digger, firewalker) but she by no means needs help writing! listen to any of her 3 indie records or the girlysound demos & you'll see that she is clever, witty, creative, intelligent, & honest.but as i said before, i do like this album. but don't judge liz based on this, i recommend you start from \\"exile in guyville\\" & go on from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"as bad as you've heard","review":"...

Part of Liz's charm was hearing her out-of-pitch voice, singing witty lyrics. Now her voice hits all the notes, but it's more studio machine than woman. The only song I sort of like is \\"Friend of Mine\\"...but only cuz it kind of reminds me of whitechocolatespaceegg.I don't know what she was trying to prove.Liz, turn off the pitch control and sing into the mike all by yourself!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's all the fuss about?!","review":"I don't understand why \\"hardcore\\" Liz fans are so upset after the release of this pop record. Liz Phair has always had a great pop sensibility, and she just intensified it with her most recent release. White Chocolate Space Egg was also pretty pop, so I don't understand what the uproar is about. She's still a great songwriter, and got some support from other musicians--big deal! So she wants to target a broader audience, we can't lynch her for that! She's talented enough to deserve her success. I've enjoyed every single one of her records, and they each have a style of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"just listen a few more times.","review":"Before I bought the new album, I read what all the critics had to say: \\"sellout, too old, avril-wannabe, blah blah blah\\".

The first time I listened, I only got hooked by one or two songs, but now that I have played it through about 3 or 4 times, it's definitely taken hold. If you found yourself ashamed to be singing along to \\"Complicated\\" last summer and are afraid of a repeat, don't worry - if you hear \\"Extraordinary\\" on the radio this year, sing all you want, cause it's Liz, and she actually has something to say.Oh, and to all those complaining about Liz's so-called \\"new\\" sex-kitten look, trying to appeal to the Britney/Avril audiences, get over it: she's hot, she's always been hot, and she probably always will be. i only hope i look like that when i am 36, and I imagine you hope you/your wives/girlfriends do too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it's Liz Phair..","review":"I've been listening to Liz Phair since I was about 14, so, give or take 10 years.

Her older music is funny, intelligent, witty, insightful and comforting to girls and women who aren't like everybody else. This is just like everything else you hear from the pop music scene. Her other albums are unique, unforgetable, and I have some that are scratched up from years of use that I still listen to. This is just embarassing, and I guess she was hoping that people would like it, or that she would gain a wider audience, but I think she just succeeded in losing her old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunner","review":"I usually write well thought out reviews of the lastest cd release. But after listening to this cd, my mind has melted and I am asking someone to type this review because I can't. This is a horrible, horrible cd, I still love Liz Phair's early stuff, this release is [bad]. What a waste of my money, I have already given away the cd to a eight year old neighbor who seems to like it when she is not listening to the latest Jewel cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, just doesn't cut it.","review":"I'm not a suck up what most people seem to do. I'm glad Liz is getting more publicity and all, but let's be honest, the music in her new album is just lousy. The lyrics she's known for doesn't quite fit in to the Top 40 pop genre. ...She's basically dumping her fans that knew her from the beginning and making herself a clone of Avril Lagine. Shame really she's selling herself out with these songwriters named \\"The Matrix\\" (original name, isn't it?) and attempting to go make a quick buck. I'm not gonna sit here and B.S. saying \\"Her new pop sound is amazing and slick as ever.\\" It just doesn't work out that way. I've been a big fan since Exile In Guyville and this self-titled album is one big slap in the face. ... You just ruined the career of a very talented singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Flat","review":"Like everything else with the words \\"The Matrix\\" attached to it in 2003, Liz Phairs attempt to transform herself into Avril Lavigne is disappointing for several reasons. The songs aren't that good or even that catchy--which is, after all, why you have The Matrix write your songs in the first place. They sound trite, something Phair should be ashamed of after her auspicious debut. Worst of all, she's trying so hard to sell out--and failing. Attempted humor and poignance fall equally flat. If you're a fan of Liz Phair circa 1992 you'll find very little here."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad, sad, sad","review":"Please, save your money. I'm open to change. I'm even open to pop on occasion. But this CD is just bad. Unlike some others, I loved Whitechocolatespaceegg, which some have said is too \\"pop.\\" I don't even mind Avril, who Liz is now being accused of imitating. But this CD just [is bad]. I'd didn't believe the reviewers who panned this CD and I bought it anyway. What a waste of money! The next time that many people take time out of their day to write something negative, I'll listen. If you are new to Liz, buy her last album instead. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, this makes me cry.","review":"I have given this album a good 6 months or so, having owned it digitally since before it was released. And I am disappointed, to say the least. Admittedly I have a ridiculous emotional attachment to Ms. Phair's earlier work, but this is ridiculous. I fully support an artist's wish to do different work and sell more records, but if I wanted to listen to Sheryl Crow I would buy her albums. This is nothing new. We have seen all this before. I can't appreciate the hints at intelligent songwriting due to the nauseating production, i.e. \\"Little Digger.\\" \\"HWC\\" is equivalent to \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" at best, no sexual revolution here. The harmonica just makes it worse. And laughable.I can only hope this is a marketing ploy and the next Liz Phair album will showcase the lyrics and rock'n'roll spirit that many of us are used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is disappointing.","review":"I'm aware that this album is her bid to become a pop star, but that's no excuse for the horrible lyrics. I don't mind the poppy sound of the album. What I do mind are the sentimental, mind numbing, garbage lyrics. The few times she tries to be \\"edgy\\" it sounds so forced that it makes it even worse. This album sounds more like a Lizzy Maguire soundtrack than a Liz Phair album."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no 'there' there","review":"Truth be told, a week ago I wouldn't have known a Liz Phair song if it hit me in the head. I've heard of her but that's about it. But when I heard the 'Extraordinary' tune in a soundtrack I thought it would be a cool artist for my 8 year old daughter to listen to. ooops. I'm no prude but obviously this is not something for a child to listen to.Now that I've heard it and researched her as an artist, I'm compelled to agree with most of the negative reviews if not just a few of the positives. If you don't care any more about what you're listening to than the beat and the guitar riffs you will probably like this album. If you resent pandering and commercialism for product's sake, you might hate this album. it's formulaic, unauthentic, and overt in an Abercrombie&finch; sort of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Effort For Someone I've Never Heard Of","review":"1) I have never heard of Liz Phair before this album. I mostly listen to mainstream stuff like Jewel, Alanis Morisette and Sheryl Crow.2) So I downloaded this album after hearing the catchy hook of \\"Why Can't I?\\". All the tracks are catchy and pop-rock like.3) The best songs are:ExtraordinaryWhy Can't ILittle DiggerRed Light Fever (The best track, I promise, it's soooo good)Good Love Never DiesFriend Of Mine (Second best)4) Worst trackLove/Hate (Oh my gosh, I had the worst headache afterwards)5) Overall it's worth downloading / buying if you love Alanis, Sheryl and Jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lyrics, Great CD","review":"...i do see Extraordinary as the next single. it should be the next single, it's a great song.This whole album is good and i can't stop listening to it. She can write good songs, rock just as much as the boys and still look beautiful, more power to her. I don't care if people say it's over produced, SO WHAT!. a LOT of albums are over produced now a days just look at Jewel's new album. This is still a good album and worth adding to your cd library. I feel like i can relate to the lyrics on this album with my friends like on Red Light Fever. I own her previous albums as well as this one and i like them all. I hope she makes some serious cash on this cd she deserves it. Pick this one up and listen to it a few times and you'll probably get hooked too. Matter of fact if there's a son on this album i don't like ? it'd be Fire Walker other than that the album is flawless. She's got a lot of Wit and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liz rocks!","review":"This is my first encounter with her music and I think it's simply an excellent album. I love all the songs. This is a well polished and produced album.I guess to the purist (or those who's followed her career from the start) may think she's becoming more \\"popularized\\" rather than sticking to her roots. I have since listened to some of her older songs, and I think, IMHO, that this has to be her best album yet.But that's my outside view of it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mature Album","review":"Old hard-liners Liz's fans will bash this album, but don't listen to them. Like everything in life (well, almost everything) every person is in constant evolution and so is Liz. How could we expect her to be the same person as in \\"Exile...\\"? Of course her lyrics reflect the change in her life and the maturing of her ideas and views. On the musical side, no complains either. Liz finally has the production she always deserved.I loved this album. Rock on, Liz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Edge?","review":"A long time fan of Liz Phair, I was ecstatic to see a new album. whitechocolatespaceegg was not my favorite, so I was hoping this would restore my undying love for Liz's music. But it's not our Liz Phair of old! She could join ranks with Britney on this one. I am disappointed in the over-produced feel of the album, the pop-overtones and the seeming disregard for those fans who like her music because it's generally so much different than mainstream. I would suggest listening to some tracks before purchasing this CD - make sure it's Avril you want, not Liz Phair."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Fragments","review":"This book, Harrington's autobiography, is a must for anyone who wants to know about the Greenwich Village scene of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as the development of Harrington's thought. It is particularly notable for its short discussion of \\"The Recognitions\\" by William Gaddis, one of the first notices of Gaddis in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy at his Best!","review":"There is an illegal drug being sold on the Net that makes you Superman. The FDA calls on Net Force and the NSA to stop the seller.I liked the action and the descriptions Clancy uses to describe what's going on. Every thing is described with great detail.I would recommend this book to adults that like violence, action and details about guns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual standard expected of Tom Clancy","review":"Be warned if you do not like bad language you will have a problem with this book. I put up with it until page 299 and decided no more. I found the plot interesting but contrived and certainly no comparison with his previous books. I then took another look at the book cover and realized I had been conned. Tom Clancy didn't even write it. There it was in large letters Tom Clancy, to catch my eye in the bookshop. At the bottom in very small letters, created by Tom Clancy and Steve Pieczenih WRITTEN BY Steve Perry. Need I say more except how very disappointed I feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the edge...","review":"I normally don't read Clancy, I admit, because of his ability to detail a book to death. I'm reading books for fun and enjoyment, and this hit the mark. What a great book, seriously. It grabbed me from the begining and held me til the end. I liked it so much that I read while I walked to work everyday. I've already ordered 4 net force books and can't wait til they come. -bernzy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much day to day stuff","review":"This book was my least favorite book in the net force series (yes i have read all of them up to springboard)because it has too much useless day to day stuff that is boring. Toni keeps complaining about how shes fat and is on and off with the scrimshaw stuff.Most net force books take me 2 weeks to read...but this one took me a month!Also, what does net force have to do with controlling drugs?The other novels that came after this were pretty much a chore to read, especially state of war. They always just start out with a death (or many),and go through the introduction. Then they just go for days or even weeks without any leads at all. Then a personal event happens, and they get a lead. This is where most of the books start to pick up their pace. This is when its hard to put the book down. But thats changing with every new novel. However when springboard came out in January, it renewed my interest in Net Force."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good entertaining book.","review":"This was the first work of Tom Clancy that I actually read. I've seen some of the movies (Hunt for Red October, and the a few of the Jack Ryan movies). I personally found the book enjoyable. It kept my interest through most of the book. I thought the end of the book asked me to suspend my disbelief a little too much, but overall an entertaining read. I thought the book explained a lot of the technical stuff well without boring someone who may not be interested. The action was pretty good, and kept the book moving, and the twists kept things interesting. This may have been my first Clancy novel, but it certainly will not be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest band on earth?","review":"In a year where Korn and Limp Bizkit stole the metal spotlight,(yes, it's still metal to me), The Deftones' Around the Fur went almost unnoticed. This album is THE definitive metal album of the nineties. It's SO heavy, not only musically, but lyrically as well. Chino Moreno's softer side comes through in MASCARA, a haunting little number, but he can still scream too, as in HEADUP. And as a drummer, you can't ask for anything with more feel or agressiveness than this. If you thought ADRENALINE was un-toppable, check AROUND THE FUR out. The Deftones have the heaviest, most original sound out of any of their peers, and I pray they keep making music for a long time. Five stars and then some!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is great","review":"this cd is in my opinion by far their best work. alot of the songs are upbeat and full of energy and are very catchy. this cd isnt at all repetitive in anyway at all. its a short cd so you cant get bored at all through this cd. all the tracks are mostly straight-forward.

I personally think that it was unwise of them to put the best song first, seeing that there is no motivation to listen further after its done. I FORCED myself to listen to the whole cd through, because i love deftones and i wanted to give it a fair chance, but nothing caught me really - i personally think that this album drags compared to the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I still havent listened to this whole cd... because it all sounds the same and the songs arent that great.. My Own Summer is the best song on the cd, and probably the best song they've ever made.. other than that I think the Cd is alright... not worth getting excited over it"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Be Quiet And Drive\\" is my top 5 favourite song","review":"I'm going to make this short!! I bought this album because of \\"Be Quiet And Drive\\". When I heard this album the other songs didn't quite cut it, THIS song was very well musically composed; It has a whimisically sensual sound that enbarks the odd promiscuous mystery of how music can be organic. I believe a classical orchestra inspiration would've really gave the band more staying power. this is where this band stands in my top 5.#5 Goo Goo Dolls (Only One) #4 Stone Temple Pilots (Plush) #3 DEFTONES (BE QUIET AND DRIVE) #2 Sianspheric (Nothing Stands) #1 Blur (Battle)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good CD, but get the first","review":"Chino has an awesome voice, but this CD is lacking something that the first one had. \\"My Own Summer\\" is the best song, and is on the MATRIX soundtrack, which is a whole lot better than this CD. Like I said, this CD is good, but if you want te real deftones buy the first one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, but way too familar!","review":"\\"Shove it\\" and \\"Rickets\\" are good songs, but the rest are nothing special. The one thing that pisses me of, is that this band is such a blatant KoRn ripoff. I swear, the Deftones should just change their name to \\"KoRn Lite\\", because that's what they are. I had this CD, but traded it for Pantera's \\"Great Southern Trendkill\\" album. It was a very good exchange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring, uninspiring noise","review":"After purchasing this album, I was very disappointed that my first Deftones CD turned out to be some of the most un-inspiring rock I have heard in a long time. Most of the songs on this album are the same old tired screeching and screaming that could be found elsewhere by such bands as Korn, who I must say do alot better job in tapping into the dark recesses of human angst. Nearly all the songs on this album are really really awful, unintelligeble noise that grows tiring after awhile. I give it 2 stars because the Radiohead-esque track \\"Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)\\" is actually a pretty great song, but unfortunately the only good one on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try not to buy this one.","review":"Most inexperienced listeners will say they like deftones, simply because they've heard the tracks from \\"The Crow\\" and \\"The Matrix\\" sound tracks. That's where I used to be: among the many. Now I'm part of the universe that has actually spent money on a real deftones cd. The shove it and fly away songs rock, but the rest just EATS IT. I could seriously make music that's just as good, although I'd have to work on my voice for about 2 seconds. Ha! For those of you who have already bought this cd, do what I did: Ask a friend who hasn't heard very much deftones to \\"temporarily\\" trade this cd for one of his/hers. Then never give the good cd of their's back! Mwahaha! Just have patience, and your time will come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Rock Cd","review":"I bought the limted edtion version of White Pony when it came out and, it was my first Deftones purchase. I was blown away by it(wait! don't scroll down just yet I'm getting top the review). White pony was not an improvement over \\"Around The Fur\\", It was/is merely a record of the same level. Around the fur is an extremely great album. From the instant \\"Shove It\\" starts(it's a good song and, if you read the lyrics you'll realize that Chino's not telling someone to 'shove it') you'll be blown away. Chino's whispering can lull you into a false sense of sercurity and it will but then he'll start to scream and you'll be reminded of tool and static-x. This is a must have if you have White Pony and you are just getting into the Deftones. You'll love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones a bomb about to expolde","review":"They rock, joining the underground leigion of Hardcore bands (KoRn, Coal Chamber, and Limp Bizkit) this is a band with riffs that rock, and a frontman that is read to kill, check em out, DEFTONES ARE READY BLOW UP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I heard chino is getting singing lessons, godspeed!","review":"Along with Tool i think this band is really overated. The distortion is so thick on this album you can barely tell any of the instruments apart. It's like a big wall of fuzz with the occasional snap of a snare drum. Chino Moreno is such an awful vocalist, he can't sing and his screaming is so forced and weak. I'll give it 2 stars since i only give 1 star to truly worthless albums that deserve it, and i guess \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\" is an enjoyable emo-ish song. I recommed you listen to the bands who influenced the deftones such as Helmet, Bad Brains, Faith no more and Sick of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth must be told","review":"Please stop calling this the best CD ever. You have got to be kidding yourself. I admit a few songs had potential, like Around the Fur and Be Quiet And Drive, but they just wasted them. My Own Summer steals the riff from Metallica's The Outlaw Torn and most of the other songs sound like they used the first riff that popped in their head and used it for the whole song. That's too bad, since everyone in the band is talented, as shown in the fury and hooks of Adrenaline (Before Chino ruined his voice by shouting so much) and the beautiful music of White Pony. Try those out if you like, but be quiet and drive (far away from this CD)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you hear me now?","review":"Hard rockers are back with a new album full of the same undistinguishable songs. The album's big single \\"Shove It\\" is a great heavy metal song in it's own right, but the rest of the album crumbles under the pressure of that one hit. Not much potential any way you look at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW COULD ANYBODY LIKE THIS???","review":"Okay, I am a kid and this music is my life, I have every CD from Soundgarden to Rage to Sevendust to Godsmack and since everybody likes Deftones I figured I might as well buy their popular album. After buying it I had to be stopped from burning it. This excruciatingly long cd full of garbage is nothing but Chino Moreno whispering behind heavy guitar riffs and then screeching his lyrics in a horrible high-pitched tone. Every song goes on and on like this and if you don't hate it because of the sound in one of the songs, how do you not get BORED through an entire CD of the same sounding songs. If CDNOW would let me give this 0 Stars I would. If you have any taste in music STAY AWAY FROM THIS GROUP!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Quiet And Drive (Far, Far Away)","review":"I do not like this band. They are not metal, they are a punk band, and of the hardcore scene, there are a lot better bands than this bunch of Mexican chihuahuas. Helmet helped them get where they are today. Far is probably the most underrated band in history. Hell, even Sick Of It All kicks Chino Moreno's bony behind. Do me a favour, buy Far's \\"Tin Cans With Strings To You,\\" and stay the hell away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 12 year olds that try to think they have problems","review":"bitching, complaning, whining, all there is. just makes you depressed. people just say they like this crap. nobody really enjoys it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"def\\"tones","review":"if you take the tones out and hear this cd you will go DEF! this band is really terrible. all the songs on this cd are dumb. don't get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.....","review":"I still remember when I first heard these guys, back in the 8th grade. I liked korn back than(I've since moved on), and mtv was doing a special on korn's favorite videos, so I watched it. I remember when they showed the video for \\"Shove it(My Own Summer\\". I was blown away, and they are one of the few bands I liked from back than that I still like.This is my favorite Deftones album. It's awesome. My favorite songs are \\"My Own Summer(Shove It)\\", \\"Lhabia\\", \\"Mascara\\", and \\"Headup\\", but all the songs are good. In my opinion, this is more polished than their first album, but that is only my opinion. To sum it up, buy this CD, you are getting more than your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one...","review":"This is the Deftones best album in my opinion. That's probably because I like the hard fast driving songs a bit more than mid tempo rockers, but I digress. Chino has a great combo of singing and screaming in this album, both done well. His vocal range is pretty impressive. These guys show a lot of ability in changing song speeds and dynamics. Mascara slowly draws you in, while Rickets lauches out of the gates and never lets up. Most all of the choruses hook you in well, and they can just plain tear it up any time they want.Great CD by a great band.Favorites: My own Summer, Around the Fur, Be quiet and drive, and Headup."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotionally envoking, mind blowing stuff, this here album","review":"Chino's primordial crooning (and livid howls) mixed with pumping guitar riffs, a pounding bass and complementary drums makes this truly a great buy. Disillusioned are the few that mistake this work of genius as 'noise'."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing band","review":"When it comes to this band, Deftones have a diffrent sound in nu metal. Chino has a great voice, and he shows it in this album. Be quiet and drive is one of the best deftones songs ever. Another good song is Head Up with Max Cavalera. Deftones is a band that dosn't care about the mainstream. All they care about is playing music. When you hear My own Summer man that makes you want to get up and just rock out. I don't care too much for nu metal but this band stands out. They made me a fan and when you hear this it'll make a fan out of you. I hear other metal bands to see if they have a cool sound like Deftones. Tool is one of those bands that I like now. Anyway great band and I am proud to have this in my cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal, No. Punk, No. Stale ol' Crap, No.","review":"If you want metal, don't get this. If you want punk, don't get this. If you want stale old crap that has had little creativity from their influences, don't get this. This music is for someone who want's to hear something thoughtful, progressive, and new. Call it nu-metal or what ever, it's just straight up good, inventive hard rock. These guys are legit. The guitars may not be eddie van halen but it's different and they have a unique sound that I haven't really heard before. Progress. That's what music is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extremely Kick-Butt Album","review":"Deftones are one of the few bands in the newer-metal/rock scene that actually have creativity among various other talents that add to their music. They are one of the better bands out there, for they stay true to their music and write about meaningful topics, unlike the other rock bands out there that are just looking for fame and ho's. I say that this album and adrenaline are their best works. Other bands to check out that are great like the Deftones are : System of a Down, Primus, Coal Chamber, Smashing Pumpkins, Silverchair, Led Zeppelin, and Cradle of Filth. If you like Deftones, you will not be disappointed with these other bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good !","review":"Deftones have done it again! My Own Summer, Dai the Flu, Be Quiet and Drive, Headup are excellent songs. This CD is not as good as Adrenaline, which is my favorite, but it's good! Buy it, it's worth it! Can't wait for their upcoming album that's in the works!............In my own summer the shade is a tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album But....","review":"I think this is definitely one of the best Deftones album , and indeed one of the most original rock albums of the last decade. The combination of Chino's vocals and heavily distorted guitar at times seem to reach sublime levels. That said, I had recently purchased this album (for the second time, I lost the first that I had bought on cassette) and found myself tiring of it after listening to it about 2-3 times. What does this mean? Not really anything necessarily,just that the Deftones and specifically Around the Fur , needs to be taken in doses."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd rocks","review":"deftones are awesome but korn is still better. i bought this cd because people said it was a good deftones cd. the best song off of it is shove it!!! deftones yeah"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones Rock by Sacramento fan","review":"All I can say is that this is one of my favorite CDs and one of the best CDs I've ever listened to. And, Deftones rock live too. They are the most talented band from Sacramento in my opinion. All the songs on the CD are great, and you have to appreciate the sheer emotion Chino and the guys bring to their thrash/metal style, which is invividual from other bands. Bottom line: if you are considerening getting this CD, buy it or else you'll miss out on some awesome music. Headup with Max Cavalera and Around the Fur are my favorites, but all the songs rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet cd","review":"The deftones again lay a track of fury with this record. MX is cool because Abe's wife sings with Chino. I also thought this was good record because Chino was tring his hand at actual singing and I think he nailed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Around the Fur\\" is the future of heavy music.","review":"The Deftones latest release \\"Around the Fur\\", has proved to be the future of heavy music. The music is crushingly heavy in some songs, but emotional and melodic in others. The vocals of Chino Moreno are amazing. He combines the gloominess of Robert Smith(the Cure) with the ferociousness of Max Cavalera(sepultura). He is emotionally gripping at times, and just straight p****d off at others. The songs range from the heavily melodic \\"My Own Summer\\" to the heart brokeness of \\"Mascara\\". The Deftones sound comes from the roots of metal, but goes far beyond it's traditional boundaries. They have a sound similar to Korn and Limp Bizkit, but deliver emotional power that is purely their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I carry around this c.d. like an i.d.","review":"This is my favorite c.d. of all time! Chino really pours his heart out with eerie vocals and absurdly sad lyrics. It is genius. You don't have to a hard-core fan to appreciate and respect them. One of my favorite songs is m.x where he sings about the shallow things even a deep musician is drawn to: girls, money and new clothes! But in Dai the Flu he thanks his wife for loving him while screaming, it fills me with motivation, and I want to scream and mosh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet sweet screaming in my ears","review":"This has gotta be the hardest, sweatiest CD I have had the pleasue of listening to. While their debut CD, Adrenaline, was a showcase for the metal talent Chino and the boys had, thisCD shows that they can more than hold their own in terms of musicality as well. And while the first one was a never-ending purge of anger, this one broadens its scope in terms of lyrical content, even attempting the occasional love song (Mascara, Be Quiet and Drive). The results are quite surprising. Look for the same thing to happen on White Pony, their follow up (somebody tell me when this is supposed to come out! ). Many songs are still very abrasive and furious, such as Lotion and the title track, but these pale in comparison to their real songs, Be Quiet and Drive, Dai the Flu, and MX most notably. Don't forget to listen to the hidden track, Damone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFTONES ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!","review":"DEFTONES ARE THE BEST BAND RIGHT ABOVE KORN AND LIMP BIZKIT.

I have loved the Deftones for years. I have seen them at Ozzfest back in the day and on their own headlining tours. This album is a monster!! My Own Summer, Be Quiet and Drive and the title track are brilliant. Deftones changed my view on music as a whole. This album also serves as a transition for this.band because their next album, White Pony goes in a completely different direction. Anyway this album is a must have if you are a fan of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"my heart beats fast as the tears roll down my face......","review":"All I have to say is BE QUIET AND DRIVE (FAR AWAY). This has to be the best song ever written by the deftones. In fact, this new album, (not as good as adrenaline) is pretty good considering the songs from the first were songs from when the Deftones were kids growing up and Around the Fur, a complete 180. I only like a few songs, but they match up to the entire adrenaline CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deftones are the absolute best!","review":"Once I heard Adrenaline I was hooked, and the Defontes became my favorite band. I didn't think they could get much better, but they did. Around the Fur shares the same in-your face fury of the first album and mixes it with haunting melody and moody lyrics. This is a great album if you're a fan of \\"new-metal\\" or \\"alt-metal\\" or if you're just looking for original music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFTONES KICK ASS","review":"Deftones are the baddest band ever I love all their stuff! I've been following them for about 3 years or so now, since i first heard adrenaline. this cd isn't quite as heavy or angry as their first, but its just as good if not better (but my favorite song, root, is on adrenaline)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did they go wrong?","review":"This album is nothing compared to their debut Adrenaline. The only song I thought was o.k. was my very own summer, but you start to get tired of that song. Everything sounds pretty much the same on this cd. I think the Deftones rule but they blew it with this album. Their old songs like Bored are great!!! If you want a good Deftones album check out Adrenaline."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of the songs were even playing","review":"Really bad quality. I got it a little late and once I did, I played it - NONE of the songs worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Deftones, once local to Sacramento,Ca, rock the world.","review":"Around the Fur is an awesome release from the Deftones. With songs like \\"My own Summer\\" and \\"Be Quiet And Drive(Far Away)\\" how can anyone not like this. And who could forget the opening to \\"Around the Fur\\"! The Deftones started in Sacramento, but are not rocking the world with their awesome music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminisent of Korn?","review":"Many would say that the Deftones sound like Korn. But not I. While they do come from the same genre of music, whatever that might be, they are my no means the same. The Deftones are unique in a way that cannot be explained. Their driving guitar riffs are superub, and Chino's vocals are emotional and strait from the heart, all the while Abe Cunningham's drumming and Chi Cheng's bass lines keep all of it going, the end result is something like organized choas."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD EVER","review":"IT IS THE BEST CD EVER. HEAVEY GUITAR ACCOMPANIED BY YELLING...........WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR. SO FOR ALL THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE THE DEFTONES I GOT 7 WORDS FOR YOU........GO AWAY CAUSE NO ONE LIKES YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFTONES ARE aWESOME!!","review":"When I first heard it I was surprised at how hard it could get and then instantly get soft and quiet. Chino is a great singer. If you like hard rock, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the hook...","review":"Well, I was very proud to call myself a resident of Sacramento after hearing this CD. By far their best, \\"Around the Fur\\" is the clean yet aggressive CD that fits between the garage-hardcore \\"Adrenaline\\" and experimental \\"White Pony\\", and was the album that put the Deftones into Bucky's Official Top Ten Bands of All Time.Every song on this CD rocks. I sometimes tend to skip track 3 (which slows the CD down a bit) and it does get kind of annoying to have to skip ahead to 32 minutes on the final track to hear the hidden song \\"Damone\\", but I don't know of any other CD that consistently keeps my head moving like this one. \\"My Own Summer\\" has one of my favorite guitar riffs of all time, and I have to play \\"Dai the Flu\\" at least twice every time I listen to the CD. Strange how the Deftones could remain on the back burner of the rap-metal craze when they have such fantastic albums as this and crap like Limp Bizket was so much more popular. Oh well, let the masses be fed their nonsense...."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love this?","review":"In my opinion this is the worst Deftones release so far, but don't get me wrong. I love it. I just like Adrenaline and White Pony a little better. A lot of people think this is Deftones' best album. Very heavy and agressive for the most part, but songs like Mascara are soft and excellent too. \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\" is one of the most beautiful excellent songs ever written in the history of the world. I love that song to death. The Acoustic version of it (Not on the CD) is pretty good too, I suggest downloading it. (Anyways, each song on here is 5/5 stars. Definitely one of the best albums I own. Don't miss out. You'll regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hoh","review":"this is a terrible album! the riffs are bad and the lyrics are bad! there's better albums! try somethin' like led zeppelin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Deftones CD ever","review":"Deftones, of the best bands out there right now. this album is the best of the best when it comes to nu-metal. Deftones actually do not have class for themselves. they have so much versatility, from the melodic \\"mascara\\" to the heavy and raw \\"headup\\" to the ear shout screams of chino in \\"my own summer'. the track realy sticks out in this album has to be \\"Be Quiet and Drive (far away)\\". the song is not as havy as the rest of the album but its very rythmic and it is a great track. its th pinnacle of the record.All in all, this is an AMAZING record. i highyl recomned it if u wanna know what REAL nu-metal is...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome from beginning to end","review":"All you have to do is put it in your CD player and hit play. From track one to the last, there is honestly not one bad track. My favorite album from the deftones!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"all deftones cds are must -haves","review":"deftones once again shows how much they can rock. every song on here makes you impatient till their next album comes out. You just can't get tired of their music. Deftones is a great way to let out stress. They have awesome tunes and the screaming is just perfect, not too much, but not too little. One of my favorites is be quiet and drive, it just makes you want to listen to it over and over again. i have had this cd for quite some time and i can still listen to it as though it were my first. if you are patient enough or scroll your forward button on the last track, eventually there'll be a hidden track that just makes you happy the cd wasn't over yet. a cd you have to have, no doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"For the price of this Naxos disc, it's an excellent deal.This is a great recording of 2 of Schubert's most beautiful and melodic symphonies. Maybe the previous reviewer is correct about the sound of the musicians in the hall, but on a good stereo system you can't really tell. I recommend this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection for day hikes in the Smokies","review":"We are frequent day hikers in the Smokies. This book has a good description of day hikes. The description has everything needed to find the hikes, to determine the points of interest, and to determine the level and kind of difficulty. I found the descriptions accurate for those hikes I have made. I particularly liked the listing of trails by interest and ease and the division by location. I have a number of hiking guides for the Smokies an find this the most useful for day hikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hiking Guide!","review":"I found this to be a great hiking guide to a place I knew nothing about before arriving. It is very imformative on difficulty of the hikes and what the scenery will be like so you can plan your visit accordingly. I would recommend this book to any level of hikers wanting to leave their car and really see the Great Smokey Mountains from the trail. The guide is so thorough it made it hard to narrow my choices down for the five days of hiking I would be exploring. The only complaint (if you can call it that) would be to include a area map that showed the park in its entirety at the beginning of the book so you can begin to aclimate yourself to where trailheads are located, etc...The book does recommend picking up a map at the visitors center upon arrival, I am just a planner and want to know everything in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painter Passing Through--Beautiful artwork","review":"Gordon Lightfoot added another chapter to his long recording career with the release of \\"A Painter Passing Through\\" this May. With a baritone voice that is perfectly suited for the album's rustic imagery, and his longtime band playing on all the basic tracks, this work represents one of Lightfoot's best efforts. The new release includes 10 songs which show off the artist's versatility. From the bluesy Boathouse, to the country flavor of \\"I Used to be a Country Singer\\" and \\"Red Velvet\\" to the classic, acoustic Lightfoot sound from the title track, this delightful album offers something for everybody.Lightfoot purists should love the autobiographical nature of \\"Drifters\\" and \\"Much to My Surprise.\\" The title track, outstanding in lyric and sound, is a poignant reminiscence of his life as he recalls his \\"walk of fame\\" during his heyday of the 1970s. Whether you are a casual listener or a longtime loyal fan, \\"A Painter Passing Through\\" is likely to please you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than no album at all!","review":"This new album is better than no album at all. Gordon has entertained us for decades. He has the right to just kick back and do nothing at all. At least he is giving his fans something new. Several new songs such as \\"A Painter Passing Through\\" and \\"Drifters\\" are as good as any classic Lightfoot song. Many other songs are weak, but that has often been the case on many of his albums. I am tired of some of these reviewers coming down on Gordon for having done nothing good since the 1960s and early 70s. Though the many of the songs from the 60s are great the production values really stink. To these people I say that Gordon reached his peak in the quality of songs and production with the 1980s albums \\"Shadows\\" & \\"Salute.\\" Hopefully we will have Gordon around for many more years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great singer, a not-so-great album","review":"I was dismayed by the harsh nasality of Gordon Lightfoot's once-resonant voice on his latest CD, A Painter Passing Through. I took this to mean that age had finally caught up with him, and, with much trepidation, went to see him in concert. Something is wrong! He is NOT so nasal, nor aged, and, most definitely, NOT at ALL like this album.Although A Painter Passing Through DOES highlight Gordon's delightful songwriting skills, its production leaves MUCH to be desired. Gone are the melodic undertones of Don Quixote and Sundown...they are replaced by an almost frightening nasality, a straining, grating noise that is especially apparent on \\"Ringneck Loon\\", one of the most lyrically wonderful tracks on the CD. For the true-of-heart, buy this album, if only for the lyrics, but be certain that you see him live, if only to hear the songs as they are MEANT to sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Well...","review":"I hate Gordon Lightfoot, I love my husband. I am buying this CD for him! he is Gordon Lightfoot's #1 fan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightfoot's Golden Voice-gone...","review":"What a sad thing... my beloved Lightfoot music reduced to a shadow of it's former self... Still, \\"Ringneck Loon\\" and \\"Much to My Surprise\\" have the a hint though, of the old Lightfoot... 25 years ago his voice was INCOMPARABLE... very sad, but I still listen to all my earlier Lightfoot albums in my car's 12 CD player... 9 of them are Gord's!! Lightfoot has been my favorite since I was 16 (28 years ago) Well wishes to all Lightfoot fans..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two out of 10","review":"That's how many good tracks are on this cd. Most of the songs GL has written are too high for his voice. When he sings Ian Tyson or Steve McEown, he sings in his good old baritone and with a vitality that isn't in the other cuts. These two cuts (Red Velvet and I Used to Be a Country Singer) are awfully good, though.He seems to have some itch to write a song about the loon, he's tried it before, but it doesn't quite make it. The age of Froggy Went A-courtin' is long gone. And Uncle Toad won't revive it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gord's Not \\"Gold,\\" He's Just Old","review":"Even hard-core Lightfoot fans will have a difficult time finding anything wonderful about this newest CD. There is none of the rich nuances of earlier Lightfoot recordings such as the \\"Sundown\\" or \\"Summertime Dream\\" albums. While some artists's voices mellow and grow richer with age, Lightfoot has only a nasal whine that grows wearisome after a few songs. As a long-time Lightfoot fan, I can only recommend that others stay with the early stuff and end their Lightfoot collection with \\"East of Midnight.\\" There's nothing new after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new; no longer inventive and thought provoking.","review":"I love the early Lightfoot that everyone like PP&M rushed to record. The new stuff seems to have very little substance to it. One album seems to sound like the next. The music as well as the lyrics are predictable. There is one, maybe two thought provoking, emotions provoking songs in this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocal style is all wrong","review":"I don't know if it is age or perhaps maybe Gordon has asthma, I don't know. But the nasal sound that has replaced one of the greatest voices is very disturbing. I bought this CD when it came out and I no longer have it. I also did not have internet access at that time or I would have listened to some samples.I guess I expect Gordo to sound like he did 20-25 years ago. Everyone changes for different reasons and I will always love his 70's & 80's music but this one is not for me. Do yourself a favor and listen to the samples before buying and judge for yourself. I will be looking forward to the next CD from Gordo but I'll test drive before I buy.The intrumentation is fine by the way, it's just the voice that gets me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was shocked;what is his record company thinking???","review":"When I first played this, I thought there was something wrong with the CD. His voice is totally shot. The lyrics of the songs are beautiful, but he should find someone else to sing them. I'm in mourning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it again, Sam; it grows on you.","review":"A friend of mine put this CD on and asked me to identify the singer. I couldn't. And of the three concerts I've attended in my life, two of them were Gordon Lightfoot. She later gave me this album and bought another for herself. I play it often and my appreciation for it continues to grow. Much to my surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old to rock and roll & too old to sing!!!!","review":"I'm a huge Gordo fan and this album was a major disappointment. Whoever said his voice was shot was really being generous. The years of booze and cigarettes haven't been kind. Even the digital masters couldn't fix this album. The upside is good guitar work and the background band is typically fine. Please Gordon, let us remember you as you were. No mas!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gordon Lightfoot meets Donald Duck","review":"As a big fan of Gordon Lightfoot over the years, it is a shame to see how much he is repeating himself. If you have any one of his original post-1980 releases, you pretty much have them all. The most disturbing aspect of \\"A Painter Passing Through\\" is how nasal his voice has become--almost as if he took a drag of helium before stepping to the microphone each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a Story Teller","review":"I've been Gord's fan for his career on records and in concert for 28 years, and I truly hate to see this kind of decline in his work. Some performers go through a kind of transformation, voice mellowing, getting stronger. Lightfoot seems somehow weaker and unmoved. Instead of being transported by the music (last remembered example, This Here Tattoo) he seems to play heartlessly, merely wanting to get it over with. Gord does retain his ability to tell a good story though (q.v. Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, Ballad of the Yarmouth Castle),in I Used to be a Country Singer, a song about a sad motel maid who used to \\"sing a mean Patsy Cline.\\" This cut and My Little Love are about the only keepers. Sadly, this album is a little too much like its immediate predecessor, Waiting for You, which was a total dud. Sorry Gord, if you keep up at this rate \\"a painter passing through\\" will merely be asked to just keep on going."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Gordon Lightfoot has crafted many wonderful songs over his long career. His albums were known for their consummate musicianship, lovely poem/songs, haunting arrangements, and great harmony. This album is nearly without any redeeming qualities. The lyrics are banal at best...\\"He's a loon and he don't care.\\" His voice is fine and earthy and rich, though showing its age with the loss of his upper range and increased nasality. The arrangements are unimaginative. Once in a while an intro leads you to think that another brilliant heart breaker is on the way. Not so. Don't buy this album unless you want to give it away or unless you are such a hardcore fan that you want it just to say you have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Disappointing","review":"One has to be very careful -- very -- when one gets a new Lightfoot album. With each one we say, first, \\"there you go, he lost it.\\" Then ten listenings later you're hooked. So I listened several times before rendering the verdict: Gordon, the voice is gone and the lyrics really are second-rate. Another reviewer had a great idea: Have someone else sing your new songs. And I'd add, \\"And don't write junk.\\" (Sorry, but \\"He's a loon and he don't care less\\" is simply a tired, lazy Lightfoot on autopilot.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"I am a hard-core fan of Gord. But this cd is terrible! It was the only time I've ever written to a music company asking for my money back (of course it was ignored). Then I tried giving it away to my father-in-law, who is also a big fan. Last I saw, it was being used to balance out an uneven chair leg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Principles from the Kings of the Old Testament","review":"My son and I are almost done with our Bible study in conjunction with this book. I have read through the Bible many times, but this guide was practical in that it applied what we learn about the kings of the OT to our modern lives. I appreciate that this study includes a lot of reading from the Word of God and is not just man-made thoughts.

I get the whole we-fight-to-feed-our-family story, but it was not interesting. No big fights or battles between squads or platoon. No dropships. No armor. No military esprit-de-corps.

This is the second best in the series. The third one is the best and the second one is my least favorite because it was way to gross. Good features in this disk, all in all, this is a great buy.

I will admit, there were some moderately shocking parts (like the breast implant scene and the semen scene), which were sometimes funny, and the brief parody of The Usual Suspects was well-done, but these were few and far between. None of the characters grabbed me in any way, particularly \\"Doofy\\" - who seems to have walked right off of the bar napkin of some drunken writer. I might give this 3 stars if I was 11.

There was nothing wrong with it, I had no complaints but fans of the slasher flicks 'Scream\\" and \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" will appreciate this film for the potential it holds. However I am not a fan of those movies so this doesn't hold as many thrills for me. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a good laugh. Regina Hall and Anna Faris definetly have a big future in the world of comedy as this movie will show. Plus the Wayans brothers add so much to this movie.

I will give the film that, it is different, but comedies like these lack substance and are ultimately pointless. Scary Movie was sick, and not entirely funny. The script, the idea, and the concept were not worth putting on film. It may have raked in some cash, but if the movie industry is not going to care about film quality and greatness, and only about money and box office revenue, the film industry may has well stop making movies all together.

This movie is a piece of trash and is very immature. A five-year old could write a better script. It is just a typical gross-out comedy that finds any excuse to put a ... on the screen in order to get a shock out of the viewer. I am sure that many people who watched it then probably feel the same way about it now. It isn't even very good at spoofing other movies.

And I can appreciate some vulgar humor in the SOUTH PARK vein. But unlike SOUTH PARK, SCARY MOVIE doesn't come off with the same success. SOUTH PARK tries continually to outdo itself, but it pulls it off with a certain level of \\"class\\".SCARY MOVIE ultimately fails because it tries to hard. Hence resorting to flashing the male anatomy several times for a chuckle. Please! If you want to do toilet humor, fine, but at least make it funny... something more like Mike Myers drinking \\"poo\\" in AUSTIN POWERS, as he says \\"It's nutty!\\" and grins.Shawn Wayans fans will enjoy his performance.

It must be a male humor joke but the males in the audience didn't seem to find it funny either, probably in there for shock value.

Instead, it is one helluva roller-coaster parody of the recent box-office hits like Matrix and the likes of Scream that promises to bring you a ceaseless 1 and 1/2 hour of nauseous, dizzying, raucous laughter.Scary Movie not only spoofs hits like Sixth Sense and I Know What You Did Last Summer, it also pokes fun at racism and bimbo-hood, albeit done in the light of humor.To really enjoy Scary Movie, you'd have to dispose yourself of all reason and rationale and laugh it all down, with some popcorn and coke of course(just make sure not to choke on it while guffawing away). The plot may be thin, but it sure is the one of the funniest movie I have ever seen.

Making fun of some of our best movies is one thing, but inspiring laughter at such things as disabled people is appalling. These movies are disgusting, lewd, and just plain bad.

It's just that most of it wasn't all that funny. Granted, there were some big laughs for me, but they were throw-away gags, not big comedy set pieces. But, you've gotta admire any film which portrays David Arquette as the bonehead he is. I just wish it were funnier, though it WAS watchable and good-natured (all the actors are game and lively, which helped a lot).

This generally stale movie did have it's moments, but they were all able to be fit nice and snug into the trailer, perhaps one of the funniest of all time. If I was writing this review for the trailer I'd give it two snaps up in a blink. The Wayans brothers, however, manage to take that brilliant trailer, interspersing crude and unfunny jokes with the occasional impaling penis, and turn it into a less than sterling comedy.

Only way out is to eject the DVD unseen. Stupid. I've tried 4 copies from Blockbuster and Hollywood Video with same results. I even tried it on my computer DVD and it hangs up.Somethings wrong here.I going to return the DVD and get the VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky poor parody","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. There were only two funny parts and both appeared on the TV teasers for the movie (facial expression of the scream monster). This is a very poor parody of scream, with a little blair witch and exorcist thrown in. My simplest analogy would be an extremely tacky Mel Brooks type of film, but without the humor or the characters. Don't get me wrong, I like tacky, I like tasteless, and I think Mel Brooks and the Airplane/Naked Gun series are all great - but a movie has to have some humor about it. This one didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting your money's worth?","review":"Scary Movie is a great movie (that's the only reason I give it 2 stars) I bet you all know the storyline so I won't bore you any further. Now, the big letdown with this disc is that you don't get the whole movie.. I know about at least one scene which has been edited. The \\"Helpless cheerleader\\"-scene has a vital thing missing.. You don't get to see her guts beeing ripped out. I have seen the scene in all of it's g(l)ory and believe me, you DO wanna see this. Now, give me an uneditet Scary Movie and I'll pay as much as they want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Raunchiness to a New Level","review":"You have to decide whether its to new hights, or new lows. There isn't really a plot to this movie, it basically threads together the plots from such recent teen horror movies as SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, but plot doesn't really matter in a spoof movie anyway. The only thing that matters is getting laughs, and it probably will as long as you aren't offended easily. This movie has an incredible range of things to offend even the most unoffended people. Violence, Drug use, Bad language, Retarded police officers, and even the old death by penis. This movie is much funnier too if you have seen Scream recently, because there are lots of references to it and they will be funnier if you know what they mean. This movie will almost definately make you laugh if you are a teenager, but if you don't find violence or nudity funny, then stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Movie may be only 2 stars, but's its funny as hell!","review":"I enjoyed watching this laugh-your-but-off comedy that parodies Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.

It's better than I expected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slashing the slasher genre!","review":"Yeah, the Scream Trilogy and I Know What You Did Last Summer have had their spots in the box office hall of fame. Their creators and Dimension films have made their millions. This could only mean one thing: Time to mock it to no end!Let's get down to business: This movie was hillarious! Lousy casting (except for Wayans who plays a terrific pothead) but bad actors are the key to a good parody. The plot... well, who cares about plot, that's the reason this movie was created: Because slasher films have no plot! There's only one thing left to judge: The humor value.Well, it's rude, vulgar, obscene, and keeps you guessing how \\"far\\" the movie can really take the R rating without hitting NC-17. One way or another, I was just about on the floor for the entire movie. Naked Gun, Hot Shots Part Deux, and now Scary Movie. As reluctant as I am, I have to rank this as one of the funniest movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wayans make the best spoofs!","review":"The best spoof since Don't be a menace... which also stared Marlon and Shawn Wayans. The plot is primarly the plot of scream 1 but there are jokes about a few others including The Sixth Sense and The Matrix.Scary Movies really is a joke a minute sort of flick some outrageously funny! There are some very funny characters although some of the jokes are quite sick. If you havnt Scream yet then rent that first or you won't appreciate the jokes as much. Definatly worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude and Lame","review":"I deplored this waste of a perfectly good idea on such a trashy film. Not only was it completely not funny, aside from a handful of good moments that you have already seen on the commercials and trailers, this film has nothing to offer the person coming in for the cheap laugh, or especially for the person coming for a serious gag. Between the good parts, the rest is basically just homophobic filler and will make you want to vomit if you have half an ounce of good taste. The only thing of lower quality than the movie is the DVD. What junk is this? I rented it and couldn't play it on my player on my TV, I had to go to a buddie's house to watch it, and it sucked.

I was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it reached video and when I did it was a real let down. How this movie made so much money? Well, I do know, there are more idiots in the world than there have ever been. I did laugh a couple of times, but there was too much emphasis on sex, and was pretty gross at times. None of the class and clever thoughts of the Airplane series or the first Naked Gun. The Wayans tried too hard. Nothing was suttle in this movie. They had to push it down your throat to make you think it was funny. Even my girlfriends brother, who laughs at anything, barely laughed more than 2-3 times. Don't touch this one! Leave it on the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"Why did this movie get so much hype this summer???? It sucked!!! People said this was the best comedy of the summer, what the hell??!! Road Trip was definetly the best comedy. Scary Movie was nasty and stupid. There was only a few funny parts but not many.

So I borrowed it from my friend and watched it right now. It was funny all the way through. Not necessarily JUST a \\"comedy\\" movie. It was one of the them \\"stupid-funny\\" movies haha. I liked it though, really funny actors in this movie. Some of my favorite parts are when one of the wayan brothers acts gay, hahahaha, that sh** cracks me up and when they are smokin weed lol. But yea, a low budget film, but definately worth the watch if you want to see something funny. I recommend that its definately worth the watch! Its really funny at the end when they find out who the killer really was, LMAO. Check out this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy & Horror Will Never Mix............","review":"Scary Movie is basically a lame parody of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Like the manufactuer's description, if youv'e seen Scream and I Know What You Did, then you know the whole movie. There are a few funny jokes, especailly at the beggining with Carmen Electra, but the movie gets weirder as it continues.Basically the only reason someone would ever buy this crap would be either they really hated the two originals or just really, really like them.The killer, who some call Smiley due to his smiling scream mask at Halloween, however, is alright at playing Mr. Ghostface. So in otherwords, this movie is low in the Spaceballs level. Please, watch the originals if you want a good slaher flick. Or go get a comedy like Mr. Deeds or Anger Management. Comedy and Horror just don't mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than i expected","review":"I DID NOT want to see this movie! But, after much goading by my husband I gave in . . .and I was glad I did. Yes, this movie was brash, crude and in your face, but I did not find it at all offensive or over the top. I laughed the entire time! The market has been so saturated with these \\"teen horror-did I really pay money to watch this?\\" kind of flicks that it was great to see someone finally take a hit at them.

What was funny was how this noncreative, unimaginative, piece of trash even made it to the screen. You would have had to smoke as much dope as they did in this movie to even find it worth snickering at. They took every nasty, foul, perverted subject, mixed it with the plots of movies that were worth watching, and spewed forth this disgusting concoction. It is no wonder that the Wayans Brother's show was cancelled. And I must shame the people in charge of giving this movie an R rating when it easily could have and should have gotten an X, but I guess money speaks louder than basic rating guidelines.

Parts of it were so bad that I used the fast forward key numerous times. I do not mind R rated movies and I own several that I consider excellent shows. This is not an R rated movie, it should be rated X, but alas they don't have that rating anymore. To anyone who might consider buying this movie, I can give you exact directions to the local landfill where my copy will reside."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should've been called Stupid Movie.","review":"This is one of the worst comedy movies of all time. It seemed like the writers were trying so hard to make it funny, their efforts were way too obvious. It was like the writers were taking a multiple choice test on sophmoric humor. The jokes were not even all that raunchy. I could see that it was funny if you were a) drunk or stoned, b)13 years old, or c)a mental defective. It's better when comedy seems effortless in execution.The Farley Brothers RULE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, sad excuse for a movie","review":"I am usually very open to spoofs and parodies but Scary Movie disgraces the genre. It could have been done really well, since it is an interesting idea for a movie but the use of nudity, sexual inuendoes, and crude bathroom jokes makes the movie unbearable to watch.

So whats the use of parodying a parody? This movie was such a waste, All that gross stuff was unecessary. And how about a CLUE to Hollywood, enough with the gross stuff, its NOT FUNNY! Whatever happened to pure comedy? Stuff that was funny cause it was brilliantly written, and was witty. Go rewatch Liar Liar, or Analyize this. Two movies that didn't lower themselves to the level of trash to be funny.

The reviews and trailer were completely misleading and did not let any clue leak out that this movie was purely porn.The number of scenes in which people somehow don't bother with clothing is disgusting and immoral.

If you liked those movies, you'll probably like \\"Scary Movie\\". It was just waaaay too much for me.The humor was really juvenile and the sad part is, kids really shouldn't see this movie. There's too much nudity and I can't believe this movie got a R rating. It should've been an NC-17.I couldn't believe how many families were at the theatre I was viewing it in.

Some of the scenes may be EXTREMELY crude, but it isn't going overboard too much, so it was insanely funny to watch. So, if you love to watch parodies, I would definatly recommend this movie! But if you want something more along the lines of a Parody about horror characters like Freddy, Jason, Michael, pinhead, and others, watch the movie Stan Hellsing.

As a 19 year old female I found it to be quite demeaning towards women, but what should I have really expected? As for the people who happily comsume this inane drivel, keep it.

But it's still a classic I'm unwilling to give 5 stars.Along with the Wayans' brand of comedy, comes an unshakeable annoyance at some of their jokes because of their juvenility. Unlike White Chicks, the Wayans show no restraint with their toilet and sexual humor in Scary Movie. Why does every joke have to revolve around sex? Are the Wayans Brothers that sexually obsessed? All in all, it's a funny picture if you can abandon your decent sensibilities for a little while and just have fun. That's what I did, and I'll not hesitate to watch it again and again.

Instead of the subtle, intelligent kind of humor we see in movies like \\"Annie Hall\\" and \\"Tootsie\\", we find a battering-ram-at-the-castle-gates kind of humor, wherein they beat you over the head with the comedy without generating even one honest, genuine chuckle. Gone are the days of wittier spoofs like \\"Airplane!\\" and \\"The Naked Gun.\\" Instead, we have this load of gross-outs and fart jokes that actually succeeds at being less funny than the Carrot Top movie. And you know what the worst part is? It's still a better movie than anything Adam Sandler ever made. Groan."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end is near","review":"That anyone at all found this movie funny is sad. That America rushed to the theaters in drooling droves is enough to make you want to call it quits. Sure, it's raunchy. Sure, it's over the top. But the jokes are also unfunny, completely unfunny. They run the full gamut from totally uninspired gags to rip-offs of preexisting totally uninspired gags. That's the true sign of a comedy utterly devoid of worth: it can't even pick good jokes to steal. This wretched, tired, hideous waste of celluloid could only be worth renting as a sociological study, or as proof that it's about time for God to end this misguided experiment we call humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda been called \\"Stupid Movie\\"","review":"Trust me folks, do not waste your money on this one.

Although the trailers make this movie out to be a hilarious spoof, they are lying. This movie has about 5 minutes of actual spoof comedy, the rest is sex joke. And they aren't even funny. They consist of pubic hair, sveral comments(and visual aids) about how \\"big\\" a guy is, the \\"first time\\", and several homosexual jokes. There are very few funny scenes, the rest are just gross. So any one under 13, and over sixteen should not see this movie.

But that still doesn'tmake up for the two hours of complete stupidity and crude humor that filled this movie. There were maybe about two minutes of good jokes about every thirty minutes, and that doesn't nearly make up for even ten minutes of that completely awful movie. It's the basic plot to the Scream trilogy and I Know What You Did Last Summer, filled with toilet humor. I walked out of the move half-way through ... If someone happens to tape it for you off of the TV in about eight months, I don't even suggest watching it then.

What I like most about this movie is, though, the fact that this movie follows the main story line of Wes Craven's Scream. For those who don't know, Kevin Williams, the screenplay writer of the original Scream, originally chose its title as Scary Movie. Later they decided to change the title to Scream. so, Scary Movie is like a twin sister of Scream. If Scream was intense, scary, and screamy, Scary Movie shows how the same story line can be made as a hilarious comedy. It just as entertaining and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellis keeps it up","review":"This held up to the earlier Planetary episodes but was sometimes frustrating in it's \\"mysteriousness\\".

Usually, my response is to lend them a copy of something by Warren Ellis.In my opinion, this book and the one that precedes it are great examples of the very best that western adventure comics have to offer. Ellis skilfully constructs a hidden history and slowly draws the reader along, often leaving us gasping for more. He satisfies the comic lover with his exploration of some of the genre stereotypes, while, At the same time, giving us a great thriller/mystery that the not-so-comic-versed can also enjoy.All this and great art too.

The zoom and activation responce times are fast, ease of use is great. Digital 10x zoom is crisp and comes out as good as 3x Optical when on print. Upload times are fast, software which comes with it is easy to use. 4AA Batteries last about 200+ shots on the 1200 x 1600 high res mode (4x6 print mode), including playback view time and all the zooming in/out time.

But that does not happen always. The camera looks sleek and stylish. The user interface is easy to understand without reading the manual. Btaerry life is very very good. I was able to take aroun 200 pictures with LCD turned on always. It uses Compact Flash -Type I cards which are cheap as dirt.

Because it arrived at the Factory Service Center just after 1yr, the repair was not covered by warranty. The charge is ~$115 for repair but the repair work only has a 3month warranty. This is obviously a design flaw which has been carried over to the A75 and several other models. Search the internet and you'll find out how common it is.

On other digital cameras that I've borrowed from friends, they would have great outdoor pics but terrible indoor or night pics, or visa versa depending on the camera. The A75 has (from what I've been able to tell) the best overall picture quality for a camera under $300.Also, shutter lag is pretty good with this camera, although some of the newer cameras in this price range are better.Overall, I couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful - zoom lens mechanism is VERY breakable - E18 error","review":"Read reviews of the A70. The E18 error is alive and well still in the A75!What this means is that the gears that move the zoom lens are exposed to the elements by means of the gap between the lens and the body. All it takes is a piece of dust or sand to blow in there and the lens will freeze up and you will get an E18 error. Then you have to mail your camera to Illinois and wait several weeks. If it happens after a year has passed and the warranty is void, your camera is a paperweight. If you have scuffs on your camera, Canon might even choose to void the warrenty due to neglect.This happens to alot of people, google \\"Canon\\" and \\"E18\\".I had my A75 for only 4 days before the E18 error happened.If you get this camera, keep it in an airtight dust free case at all times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"One of the reason I give this five stars is because this camera is cheap for all of its features. I just bought this recently and the you can be as creative as you like! If you are beginning then just switch it to auto and snap away, but if you want to be creative, go ahead and mess around with it! The photo stitch mode is awsome and makes cool pics! The battery life is another great thing about this camera, it last the whole day, literally! But when you buy your memory card make sure to by at least a 128mb so you don't have to worry about erasing cute pics. But the 32mb card it comes with is a special bonus! I took 27 pics and a 30 second movie all on that one little card. One more thing is the movies. They're nearly as good as my $800 mini video camera. Anyway I really recommend this camera for anybody!

I can't think of another book that had such an impact on me as a child. Why on earth is it out of print? The various houses and inventions that John Henry made inspired me to go out to the lumber pile in our own back yard and build my own forts and useless inventions (like the Eagle's cage?), complete with crooked rusty nails hammered into splintered boards with an appropriate-sized rock. In retrospect, it's a good thing I never got Lockjaw. Or fell out of a tree with a double armload of lumber. Maybe you should keep this book from your kids after all... ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kid's book ever!","review":"Andrew Henry's Meadow is a wonder for kids through 5th grade. Who wouldn't want to live in a tree house? Or a river boat house? Or a rabbit house? Andrew Henry's Meadow is the best book for dreamers/doers and daydreamers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Favorite","review":"This was my favorite book as a child. It enthralled me with the illustrations and now I am looking for it for my children. Glad to finally rediscover it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good; could be better","review":"Of all the books that I had as a child, this is the one that I always remembered. My parents reminded me of how much I enjoyed it growing up. I bought it for my son who is only two... thinking that we'll get around to reading it later on. No. He's already started to pick it out from other books to read!My only disappointment was in the illustrations. It would be nice to see an updated version of this book. Not so much in the text, but in the drawings. The entire book is in black and white. In today's world of computer generated graphics, this book may struggle to keep up. Even just adding some colorization to the existing drawings would be a major improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"This book has been a favorite for both my brother and I when we were children. In fact, I still have the original book. The author was a friend of my grandparents. I continue to cherish the book.Since I have the only family copy, I went to Amazon to see whether I could order my brother a copy. It turns out that Andrew Henry's Meadow has been re-released. Yeah!I am going to send this book to my friend's son and to my brother. I will keep my copy for the baby my husband and I are expecting in Nov./Dec."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew Henry's Meadow","review":"This book was my all time favorite, however I know longer have a copy I have dreamed of finding another, the problem was that I couldn't remember the title. I searched for \\"meadow\\" here at Amazon.com just remembering that it had something to do with it and narrowing it down and viola there it was. Just finding the title and reading the reviews made me realize my memories were true. My daughter is just beginning to read and would love for her to have the book for her very own. We went to the local library and checked it out yesterday it was like Christmas to me. It was so nice to know some others loved it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Fantasy About a Secret Hideout","review":"Andrew Henry excels at building inventions, but his creations annoy his family and outgrow for his house, so one day he goes away to find a meadow where he can build a house of his own. One by one his friends from town find him, and he builds a custom home for each friend. After some time, the children's parents come in search of them. Everyone goes home, and Andrew's parents give him a place in the basement for his inventions.This lighthearted fantasy appeals to the childhood delight of a secret hideout. Andrew Henry's generosity, creativity and skill are portrayed as qualities to be admired, and the parents' search for the missing children evokes a warm sense of community. The illustrations are wonderfully detailed, especially Andrew Henry's inventions. The story will appeal to most children, but especially those budding engineers who enjoy building (or disassembling) complex structures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew Henry's Meadow","review":"This book was constantly checked out from my elementary school library. We would always fight over who would check it out next. For some kids, it was the only book they ever checked out.

Was beginning to think I had made it up! (loaned my copy to a student) Thank you for bringing it all back by sharing your thoughts about a book that is my all time favorite.The illustrations are highly detailed and the very BEST! You never tire of them, even though they aren't in color, and find something new each time you read the story. I agree it is a shame that the book is out of print as it has so very much to offer everyone who reads it. As an Art Teacher I have refered to the book many times and used the \\"theme\\" to inspire projects.Would dearly love to find a copy to use in my classroom and have to read to my grandchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book stays with you","review":"Andrew Henry's Meadow is one of those childhood books you never forget. My copy, although falling apart, is something I won't let go-what a shame it's gone out of print! I spent long moments studying the pictures (they're in black and white) and wondering about all the characters. It's a timeless story of growing up, if you are lucky enough to have a copy, hang on to it and share it with the children around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desperate to find another copy","review":"An endearing and wonderful story that is also well-told. This was my brother's all-time favorite book and my sister and I enjoyed it to. My brother has a son now and I have been looking for four years to find. I keep hoping that I'll hear back from the out-of-print folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book!","review":"I bought this on a whim and gave it to one of my grandchildren. It turned out to be one of her dad's favorite books from his childhood. He actually has built structures similar to Henry's meadow structures as a result! I highly recommend this book to encourage creativity in children and adults too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew Henry's Meadow","review":"Our daughter is in first grade and has inherited my love of reading....So, I thought I would go through my old weekly reader collection at my parents home and try to find my favorite book \\"Andrew Henry's Meadow\\" so I could share it with my daughter. Because this book really captured my imagination and brought me so much joy at a young age. To my surprise, my Mother had cleaned out my brother and my childhood books and toys, etc. and had a garage sale a few years earlier and my precious book had been sold. It was such a JOY to find out it has been reprinted and I could buy another copy!!! You cannot go wrong with this little book....it really is a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed to inspire","review":"It looks like I am the first to cheer Mike McCloskey and San Juan Publishing for reviving this fantastic book. As has been repeatedly noted here this story, and Mrs. Burns' illustrations, are pure magic for the imagination. It was my favorite book growing up and is my favorite book now. Andrew Henry's steadfast resolve, creativity, and humility are constant inspirations to me. Reading the comments of other people who feel the same way has made my eyes mist over.I've been spending the last two years building up a small collection of 1965 editions to give as gifts, and now I can safely tuck those away and present brand new copies to eager children everywhere. Thank you Mrs. Burn, and thank you Mr. McCloskey!

JEFFREY ROBINSON"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, fair amount of action","review":"I just finished reading this book on my Kindle. I enjoyed it very much. I used to read Tom Clancy books (when he still wrote books), and am a fan of military action/fiction. One of the things that makes this book so entertaining is that it isn't fiction. Some of the things these guys did in a submarine during WWII are almost unbelievable, and the fact that any of them survived to tell the tale is remarkable.I would have given it 5 stars except for the authors habit of interjecting other captains/crews action into the general flow of the story. It is interesting to see the parallels between boats and historically it adds to the persepective, but it does get a little tedious trying to keep straight who was CO/XO when, and where and what boat did what. It's a minor flaw and certainly not worth avoiding the book over, and I wholeheartdly recommend it to anyone who is a military/history/action fan.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Book About a Great Submarine Commander","review":"This is a fine read about Dick O'Kane, the ace of aces among WWII submarine commanders. Tuohy has a fine grasp of the dramatic wartime events and of O'Kane's tremendously brave and competent character. He, also, brings in some general discussion of the submarine war in the Pacific including the terrible problem of faulty torpedoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough for a Movie","review":"This is the second book that I have read about Richard O'Kane and his experiences in the Wahoo and Tang and waiting on two more books to arrive.

I saw this book on Amazon.com, & knew I had to have it. This book is Great! There are things in this book that are not covered in the others. Not only was the exploits of O'Kane in submarines great, his leadership when he was a prisoner of the Japanese shows what kind of man he really was. I could not put this book down. The only reason it took 3 days to read was because I had to go to work during those days! The author does give you some timelines along with what O'Kane wss doing with his boats. You can follow along during the war for the whole book. This is a must read book if you read about submarines PERIOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the real thing.......","review":"This story is basically a rehash of Tang and O'Kanes exploits, with a few other boat's highlights thrown in to make it seem less so. I consider Dick O'Kanes own \\"Clear the Bridge\\" one of THE best stories ever put to paper on the submarine war in the Pacific. I have read that book three times and it still held my interest. \\"The Bravest Man\\" did not do so through three chapters. The author just scratches the surface of the real story of Tang, and I bought the book hoping to learn more. It did not deliver. The fact that I read the real thing three times says it all...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Could Smell the Diesel and Hear the Engines Pound","review":"I was a USN submariner in the cold war 60's. I served aboard the USS Blenny SS 324, and the USS Sculpin SSN 590. The Blenny was a WWII diesel boat very similar basically to the USS Tang except it had been upgraded to a modern \\"snorkel\\" configuration. While in submarine school, the first training cruise we had was on the USS Cavalla, another WWII decorated veteran. Tuohy is a great author with his ability to tell this story of the brave CO's & sailors of these fabulous and feared machines. While many submariners paid the ultimate price, our enemies paid the ultimate price in numbers and loss of warships as well as in commercial transport shipping that was hugely greater. This narrative ranks right up there with the likes of \\"Blind Man's Bluff\\", Sherry Sontag's story of the \\"cold war\\" submariners."},{"rating":"2","title":"sub fan must have","review":"This book is an excellent source of WWII American submarine's greatest hero and many behind the scenes look at how the submarine force waged it's battles. Author divulges some little known facts on how poorly the admirals ran the silent service initially, until a few captains changed their minds. A little frustraing to read in that O'Kanes exploits are interspersed with other anecdotes regarding the navy and it's issues. Hard to follow the book's hero's journey, when author continually jumps around. All round a good source for sub fans though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bravest Man","review":"This is how to write the history of a warrior.

One reviewer complained about the simplicity of the arrangements -- but that's what the album was for. Our LP had several tear-out lyric sheets, and the chorus dutifully sings all the verses in the same key throughout the song, so you could have a roomful of people sing along without having to go through key changes or such.This is THE album that my parents played while I was growing up. (In fact, for many years these were the only Christmas songs I knew!) My biggest disappointment with the CD is that two hymns -- \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" and \\"The Coventry Carol\\" -- were omitted. Why, why, why?

The king of these stylized stylers was Royal Crown Revue. This album carefully walks the line between comedy and music and does it very very well.

While the Cherry Popping Daddys, Squirrel Nut Zippers and Bryan Setzer Orchestra put Swing on the charts, Mugzy's Move perfectly captures the gritty essence of the time frame better than any other CD. As a personal testament to the flavor of this album my Dad, a true zoot-suit hepcat in WWII era, loves when I play this CD because it takes him back to his heyday.The visually impressive lyrics of Eddie Nichols, rich horn section and tight drum work of Daniel Glass pound out a hot collection of tunes with a swagger that proves Swing is more than a fashion, it's a way of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Neo-Swing Music Groups!","review":"The founder of the neo-swings, RcR is one of the best musicians ever!

While the volume could have used a more determined copy editor, it shines, nonetheless, for what it accomplishes.

Playing out under the soft glow of television static while rotting cabling ensnares them, drawing them closer together into the undercurrent of forbidden subcultures. Wildly descriptive, the harsh environments mold the characters, creating new patterns of survival, and explorations of self destruction. Wielding a dark edge that most genre work strives for, these stories provide that glimpse down the dark alley-ways that many authors quickly push the reader past.Highly suggested for anybody that wants to explore the ghettos of the brightly lit cyberpunk fiction that is all too common"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of descriptive prose, little real narrative...","review":"This is less a collection of stories than it is a collection of dark descriptions of a rusting, claustrophobic borg future that gets repetitive after three stories or so. Most are written from first-person perspective, with paragraph after paragraph of scene-setting descriptive prose, 90% of which contains some kind of metal, rust, fluid, or combination thereof. It wears thin quickly.Story-wise, there's very little \\"meat\\" under the surface, and practically zero in the way of any character interaction or dialogue.

I finally asked the herbalist/L.Ac. to recommend something which explained the workings of Oriental Medicine, and he recommended this book. Although I'm now familiar with concepts such as qi, yin and yang, I find that, even armed with this book, I'm still mystified, and find I still must uncomfortably rely on simple belief that my L.Ac. knows what he's doing, since the logic of these treatment protocols still eludes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good general info on TCM but for those who really study it not that accurate","review":"For a lay person this is a good book, for those who study TCM not so much.

The rest of the program makes it interesting if you want to expand your knowledge of Sibelius's non-symphonic work. Although it features a no-name band (the CSR Symphony Orchestra) Kenneth Schermerhorn's conducting is excellent: There's always a chance that the Intermezzo will run away with you, but here you'll find a careful orchestral crescendo that tingles with anticipation until you get the full \\"tutti\\" before it fades away. A very nice addition to your classical library."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good popcorn movie","review":"I first saw LXG in the theater with some friends, popcorn, and Goobers. It was a great time and I fell in love with the fantasy world presented in the film and it's characters. I've loved books since I was a child and have always had a facination for these characters and for films dealing with the fantastic. I love the idea of 19th century super heroes and the cast of LXG is excellent and couldn't have been better. League isn't a highly realistic film. It's a fantasy and I adore it.Try it with friends, popcorn, and Goobers. LOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"League of enjoyable characters","review":"this was an enjoyable movie the only drawback was that they deviated from the graphic novel by including a character not in the graphic novel of Tom Sawyer and that was a shame, as his character was the weakest in the whole film.It is fun, to watch, and makes you want more and hope for sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great","review":"It is great.

The graphics aren't the best but given it was made in 2003 its understandable.

I would venture to say that it is the worst made movie that I have seen is quite some time (barring 'Ishtar' fame). Here you have some great actors playing characters that just were not developed for this movie. I can only assume that Connery is desperate for the money and did not bother to read this script prior to signing on to the project. Do not waste your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of things blow up and that's about it","review":"This movie is as random as it gets. The characters dislike each other for no reason I can understand, they travel to different places but I don't know why, and a LOT of stuff explodes. The filmmakers added Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray to the original League, but why? The villain isn't interesting, either --- that's a real problem in a superhero action movie.In addition to melodramatic acting, a slurring Sean Connery, and a senseless \\"plot,\\" the special effects are horrible. Although I did like Mr. Hyde, everything else was flat and lifeless. They made Hyde look smelly and sweaty, but everything else looks like a cartoon. Fortunately, I rented this one for two bucks. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as they come","review":"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was a total disaster. I haven't seen a movie this bad in some time, and I have seen my share of bad movies. This is a case where story, characters, and the actions all failing to work independently or otherwise. The story feels like a long exposition, forever explaining things instead of showing them to us. And forget about any character development, they haven't the time when there is a muddled plot to present. This two hour long exposition is only punctuated by the most banal action sequences ever devised, lifted directly from other equally banal movies. What happened to Stephen Norrington, who showed some directing flair in Blade? Or Dan Laustsen, who shot the excellent Brotherhood of the Wolf? Well, guess when a movie sucks this bad, you can only blame the guy who wrote the whole damn thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story and good actors","review":"Being a fan of comic books and comic book movies I just had to see The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and I was impressed.

The plot is great and full of interesting twists. I'm not telling what happens but if your looking for a good time this is the movie. A must see of the big screen movie.

If you are a fan of the excellent graphic novels by Moore and Kevin O'Neil you will be bitterly disappointed in this film.Taken on its own, the film isn't all that bad. It's pure B Movie fun and Sean Connery and the cast (Stuart Townsend as well) have a terrific time with their characters. I was disappointed by Hyde - how does a ghastly creature who murders people in the Rue Morgue and is the embodiment of pure evil suddenly decide to be helpful and a team player? He also looks amazingly fake.The plot is silly and exists only for fight scenes and the Fantom is a terrible movie villian (how does he get around in all that armor?) but I always like lots of kung fu and flips so it was fun to watch.I agree with another reviewer - the ending is lame.

When i started watching it I was not impressed. Sean Connery is the only good actor in this movie. I thought oh another great Sean Connery movie. I was wrong. This is a piece of garbage. The plot is way to predictable. The special effects are just mediocre. It reminded me of Indiana Jones except way too fictional and not nearly as good of acting or special effects. Whoever wrote the story for this movie just took ideas from Dracula, Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, and whole bunch of other stories and tried to put them togeather and made the worst movie of all time. A good piece of advice to whoever wrote this, you should really write something original since you can't tell stories right.

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a very fresh twist on fantasy with a superb cast and well done action sequences. The special effects are good enough, though not the film's strong point.

Yes, the effects are a little cheesy and the Nautilus is too big for the Venetian canals. Beyond that, suspend your disbelief and have a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible film.","review":"I tried to bring myself to like it, but I can't. With Sean Connery in the cast, I expected a lot out of this film, but it's got a bad script and the direction seemed more tailormade for special effects rather than the acting. The humor in it sucks (example: Tom Sawyer is \\"checking out\\" the vampiress, and Allan says \\"She's out of your league.\\" League! As in League of Extroadinary Gentlemen!\\" HA. Not funny.). In fact, at the theater, PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AT THESE DUMB JOKES. As I said, the direction is horrid, which is even worse since it's the director of \\"Blade\\" (Stephen Norrington), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bland acting, average special effects, horrible script, heavyhanded direction, and ludicrous plot devices (how is a domino effect stopped by the destruction of ONE building??) all add up to one stupid film.

Although the historical inaccuracies, overblown special effects, ridiculous plot and stilted dialogue are painful, these failings never quite demonstrate the total disregard for the audience evidenced by the horrendous acting. One is speechless from the first frame and continues to watch only on the theory that the film could not get worse. One will be sorely mistaken as every passing minute brings greater agony. Clearly, this movie was never designed to be publicly viewed and was perhaps intended to be used in an introductory film course as a \\"what not to do\\" demonstration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it all the way....","review":"This movie was so bad we only lasted about 30 minutes before turning it off.

Special effects are GREAT but the effects are the only good things in this dumb and uninteresting tale. Mr. Hyde should not be portrayeed as the Hulk; Moriarity and Nemo were men of genius, not marshal arts fighters; there was no story worth telling so it was just a beautiful big budget film of no consequence.

He is almost, but not quite, able to save the film simply by showing up and being That Damn Cool. Now, I've enjoyed other films with Connery before, but here we have the wierd spectacle of seeing him at his most fun to watch this side of \\"Goldfinger,\\" only to have everything around him be a complete train wreck and waste of time. Still, fat old bald men simply should NOT be able to kick that much ass.But sadly, I have to remind you that this movie really *is* a big stinker: bad story, obvious plot \\"twists,\\" really bad CGI, dismal acting, pretty much you name it. And for those few who read the comic book version of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, prepare yourself to see about 100 IQ points chopped off the top of the story, and all the good characters butchered or replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst special effects EVER","review":"Just because this is a \\"popcorn movie\\", it doesn't mean it has to be retarded.

Don't you just hate it while watching a movie and this single thought keeps going through your head, \\"They could have made it so much better.\\" This film is so unbelivable that it borders on the absurd. The plot, what little there is, is nonsense, the characters are pointless, and the special affects are nothing special. The only thing that keeps me from rating this film one star is the acting.

I felt absolutely nothing while watching it because the characters were so flat that there was no way to get emotionally involved with what little bit of story was there. Captain Nemo had some cool stuff, but frankly, all of it looked so fake, there was just no getting into it. In terms of filming, MANY of the scenes were way too dark - I kept begging for one of the characters to turn on the lights so we could see what was happening - and the fight scenes were so harshly edited that half the time you can't figure out what is going on until it is all over. The ending was abrupt and frankly, didn't make much sense - battle scene in the artic, anti-climactic fate of Allen Quartermaine, and cut to Africa? I'm glad I caught this one at the matinee and didn't pay full price. What a waste of two hours.

Let's take as many late Victorian science fiction and fantasy characters as we can and put them together into an action movie. This seems like it would be really cool. The writers throw in a few half-clever references to the original works here and there, but characters mostly get to their supernatural powers. Character development is minimal since we've got to fit 6 or 7 characters into a regular-length movie plus lots of fighting and explosions.The comic may be good, but don't waste your time on the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Just awful.","review":"First off, I adore the comic. The characters are each well thought out and you really do learn to care in a certain way about each one. The movie, however, was awful. It was obviously made for a quick buck, focusing on the action part of the movie, they made the villain absolutely ridiculous, and because the Great 'I'm so awesome and need to play the male role' Sean Connery funded the movie, he was made into the leader of the team, and in a disgrace to Mina, she was thrust into the stereotypical female of the group that every other male needs to be attracted to. The effects were awful, and nevermind breaking every rule of common logic of the Venice scene(I won't spoil). Don't waste your time on this movie, it's just not worth losing time that could be done doing something more productive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye candy only.","review":"Not a bad picture; however it's not a great one either. Nothing but eye candy and some decent action sequences. Unfortuately, the plot has some blaring holes and the action is shot way to close to see what's going on. Naseeruddin Shah is great as Nemo, Peta Wilson is hot as Mina Harker and Jason Flemyng is touching as Dr. Jekyll. This movie is for visual lovers only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic","review":"One of, if not the, worst movies I have ever seen. Thank god I didn't pay good money to see this in the theater.

Moronic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not that bad","review":"Other reviewers are correct, this movie is not a masterpiece. It probably will never have a sequel.So, why did I give it four stars?Simple, I had fun. I was not expecting a masterpiece. I wasn't even expecting to like it much, but I was pleasantly surprized. Almost from the beginning I enjoyed Sean Connery's character. It helped that I like him and that I saw KING SOLOMON'S MINES several years ago. Then I started playing at identifying as many lines from various books as I could find. Then I just sort of got into it. If I compared it to professional sports I'd have to say that it certainly wasn't the Super Bowl, perhaps more like all star wrestling. Then again, out of all the sporting events I've been to, one night ring side at an all star wrestling event stands out as my all time most fun.RECOMMENDATION: Don't expect THE LORD OF THE RINGS or STAR WARS. Losen up and have fun with it and you will find an enjoyable movie. Pop some popcorn and laugh as you watch it with a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique and weird- I liked it very much","review":"Watch this one for yourself and see what you think.

It's got a unique vibe to it. I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired Crap","review":"Alan Moore is a genius, but this film doesn't capture that - instead it captures all the childish flaws of the comics story-process and magnifies them until they're unforgiveable.First, the enchanting feminine allure of Peta Wilson is thown away when she rips into a guy's neck and gets splashed with his severed artery. So there's no sexual tension at all - she's just a monster in the shape of a woman.There's something about using the buildings of Venice as dominoes.. Something unbelievable.. Or is it just ridiculous?Then there's Connery, who is not a deep enough thinker to make gold out of this wooden, paint-by-numbers script. He was phoning it in. I don't blame him - what else could he do?This was to be a summer-weekend blockbuster but it sank without a trace last August - and deservedly so. The plot is a pile of rickety Rube-Roldberg tricks and there's just nothing here to sustain interest - it's dead on arrival. Stay Away."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS NOT THAT BAD REALLY!","review":"Not another comic book film? Continuing the current trend of turning graphic novels to film, LXG sees a collection of classic misfits such as The Invisible Man & Dr. Jekyll form a late 19th Century X-Men-styled unit.A league of extraordinary gentlemen you might say? Yup!So what happens? Like most groups formed by such men, crime & evil doesn't tend to stand a chance & while the plot is predictable Director Stephen Norrington (Blade) beefs up the action with style and a punch or two to the gut. Supported by an able cast, it is Sean Connery as the legendary Quartermain however who steals the show with an onscreen awe that captures the other character's hearts as much any audience's.The Verdict: Let down by special effects that are surpassed by the polish of today's car adverts there is still an undeniable charm to this yarn that sets the bar for Saturday Morning films to come"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, But A Bit Too Long","review":"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie, its pretty good itself. Where else could you ever hope to see the likes of Captain Nemo, Dorin Gray, Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain & Tom Sawyer all in the same movie? About the only character the production is lacking is Sherlock Holmes.The action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors. The only real drawback is the length. About 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes.All in all, a good popcorn flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does this movie get such a bad wrap?","review":"Sure, the movie has it's flaws, but it is still a good action movie. Some of the things that happened in the movie were not the same as the novels. (ie Dorian only had to look upon his portrait to break the spell rather than destroy it.)It is exciting and has good action sequences. It is really more worth watching if you have read at least one of the novels the characters are based on. You will get more out of it if you don't view it as a mindless action movie, like the worthless Bad Boys II, and look at its intellectual merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAD A LOT OF FUN","review":"For entertainment purposes, I found LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN to be a great roller coaster ride, filled with some awesome CGI effects, derring do and villainous confrontations. Peta Wilson as Mina Harker was my favorite; Shane West as Tom Sawyer was fun; Jason Flemyng's Jekyll/Hyde goofily exciting; and of course, Sean Connery leading the way as he always so gallantly does. Trevor Jones' score was brilliant, too. It's mindless, confusing at times, but as far as \\"comic book\\" adventures go, it's a great way to spend a couple hours. Don't take it so seriously and I think you'll find it enjoyable too. Richard Roxburgh as M is excellent too!

The characters are hollow and a bit over-acted. Certain scenes are shot well but lack substance. The supposed intrigue just isn't there.

The main character, Allan Quatermain, played by Sean Connery, would become the model for Indiana Jones. The movie takes some liberties with the characters. For instance Mr. Hyde has been transformed into \\"The Hulk.\\" There is a list of fine actors which in itself makes the movie a worth while view. Even the minor characters are names from old novels.The fighting and action lack much of that special CG effect of bullet dodging and gravity defying martial art moves.The movie is fairly plain and straight forward with a twist, but not complex . Certainly a worth while view if you either like Marvel/DC comic heroes or are just a fan of 19th century literature.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Lots of killing, minimum blood/gore. Some sexual innuendos in the dialouge. MAKES FOR AN EXCELLENT FAMILY RENTAL if you don't mind a little violence/killing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Connery and Company","review":"I know nothing of the source for the film which, from a few reviewers I just glanced at, seems to have been a book of some sort. Better or worse. I can't say. Different. Inevitably.What will you get when watching. Lots of action from an assortment of 19th century fictional characters, working here for good or for evil. Nothing of any depth in plot or performance save for Sean Connery who is allowed some space, not much, to provide a measure of weight to his character. It makes a difference: from a purely fun and games comic strip animation, it is given some element of humanity. It is still special effects with humanoid characters; but Connery provides someone who might actually have been a human person.Recommended for children of all ages (as they say), and adults who may want a bit of mindlessness with a touch of the aged, but still vital, as always virile, Connery."},{"rating":"2","title":"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen","review":"I really liked this movie, I am especially partial to Sean Connery because I have all his James Bond movies. He is a wonderful actor and is good in anything that he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies I have seen","review":"Okay, I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have seen... how do movies like this get made??I had trouble sitting through the whole thing.... and I really liked the actors.The script was really choppy and boring.. I lost interest after we were lessthan halfway through... I just wanted it to end... like a slow torture.The characters although well acted seemed very flat... like they were missingsomething.I don't like to give bad reviews but this movie is just horrible. To top it off thecomputer animations were just so fake looking... I've seen better animation inmovies that are a decade old. If you can't make it look slightly real.... maybe youshouldn't use it. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie was so bad I want my money back. Bad script, bad acting, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad.

That was the reason I was so disapointed in LXG. The movie starts off with a good enough premise, save the world. However half way through the movie the film changes gears, rather abruptly, and leaves the audience confused. Couple this with piss poor photography (the camera keeps jumping from character to character during the fight scenes), makes this a very poor film.Rent it or buy it for no more than $5.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun if your standards are low enough","review":"It's a pity that yet again the movie industry decided to not risk confusing us. They took a very intriguing premise and turned it into a glitzy piece of fluff. But it is very pretty fluff, not brilliant but pretty.As long as you don't try to think about the movie and just go with the ride, it is enjoyable. Any thought, and the movie just falls apart. (For instance, consider the time this movie is taking place - early 1900's, I think - and the fact that Tom Sawyer was a teenager before the Civil War of the 1860's based on the book by Mark Twain, and that Mina and Jonathan Harker were young adults when Dracula came to London in 1894 or 1895 based on the original novel of Dracula by Bram Stoker.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay God","review":"This was a mildly entertaining film. The characters were portrayed quite well. It was enough action to keep me motivated to allow my eyes not to wonder from the screen. Sean Connery of acceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great, should have been great, but it wasn't","review":"The idea of for the LXG movie was a great one. The wittiness and cleverness of having a team of classic literary characters seems very fun, and this movie could have started a great franchise. With some of the worst directing and a terribly written screenplay, however, this film fails to astonish, in fact it fails to even slightly entertain after the first 20 minutes.One of the problems, is that their is always something action-packed happeneing at every moment. This causes for boredom, for if your adrenaline is going every second, eventually it is ineffective. Their is no down time in the movie for the viewer to process the information. This cause the viewing of LXG seem like it is work. Most of the acting is pretty well-done, but the director, who should never be let near a video-camera again, had no idea what he was doing.Trust me, this movie is not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"The League of Extrordinary Gentlemen","review":"Wait till it's shown on your local TV station on a night when you have other plans for the evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame on sean connery","review":"A class B movie at best. the only reason i bought this dvd was sean was starring and the concept seemed exciting. what a dissapointment!! save your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster.","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this, but I was highly disappointed when I finally had the chance to do so. This movie has a messy plot that I wasn't even into. I was thinking that maybe as the movie went on, I would be more interested, but I wasn't. Stuart Townsend couldn't even save this movie. His part wasn't big enough. (he's too good to be in this movie) Boring production, drab colors, nothing to hold one's mind at all. This is going in the back of my collection and probably never coming out. Avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point was?","review":"After just seeing \\"The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" I can understand why it got such bad reviews. The only good thing that I could say about the movie was Sean Connery was in it and he was the only good actor. The rest of the movie was just plan bad. The one thing that I couldn't understand was Mina Harker was a vampire and everyone know that vampires do not survive in sunlight. This is one movie that watcher should just pass on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst movie I've seen, yet","review":"This movie makes absolutly no sense. It is 110 minutes of dis-jointed scenes punctuated by random explosions and CGI effects. The only good thing I can say is the fact that the video transfer and the sound is excellent, unfortunatley you could watch the whole film without any sound and you wouldn't miss anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Res--Worth the Blu-Ray version","review":"Wow! This is the kind of BRD that makes you appreciate my 52\\" HD LCD. Snow scene with Sean Connery faces the old tiger is incredibly lifelike, as is the scene of him and young Sawyer skeet shooting off of the Nautilus.Also loved scene of Hyde changing back to jekyll in the Nautilus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good for kids...","review":"This movie is about a group of literary characters who form a group and fight together against evil. I had a lot of problems paying attention to this movie. It just didn't grab my attention and my mind kept wondering. I felt like the characters were just running around and didn't really know what they were doing. That being said, I think that children (not too young due to violence) may enjoy watching this film due to the costumes, special effects, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Guys...","review":"This movie was a BIG letdown. I begged my parents to let me see it. I thought it was going to be one of those awesome can-I-please-watch-it-again movies. Nuh uh. I dunno, it just was cheesey in some places and just flat out dumb. Not to mention unrealistic. I know its a fantasy story but come on! There's no way Tom Sawyer, having never seen a car in his life, could just get in and cruise Venice, saving the world like he's a pro! It just didn't seem right. The Fantom was not a good villain, he looked and sounded fake and made you want to laugh. It was waaaayy too long (and that's saying something, since I'm a Lord of the Rings fan) and the dialog stunk. I feel sorry for Sean Connery. He's an awesome actor, but I don't know what he was thinking, agreeing to this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LXG is a gem!","review":"Don't take LXG too seriously. It's a fantasy that takes place on an alternate world where our larger than life literary heroes and bad guys exist. It's so nice to have a movie like this to watch when one needs a good escape from reality. Give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed and cheered and had fun watching it","review":"LXG is a cool and crazy special effects extravaganza with classic good guys, bad guys, misfits and monsters. It's a \\"who's who\\" of bad asses from great old books and stories. I watched it with some friends and we had a great time. Buy it - watch it -love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get rid of that stupid American...","review":"Could no one responsible for this project see that this Shane West person has no business being anywhere near this film? I was fully prepared to while away a few hours with this piece of fluff, not expecting anyway particularly extraordinary, but at least have some fun watching Sean Connery do his thing. Then, 15 minutes into the film, we get this Shane West - he opens his mouth - and the movie is history for me. Bone-headed producers who feel that we Americans are so stupid that we can't enjoy a movie unless it has some moronic 15-year old cowboy in it. Did no one at the studio watch this and not figure it out? I have to admit I never did finish the film. If they had to have an American, did they have to get someone who registers like a block of unvarnished wood?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I really liked the premise, and the previews were spectacular. Unfortunately, that's all this movie is. It's as if it was done to show someone who has never seen a movie what could be done with computer effects. Rent at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"The league of extraordinarily quick and muddled productions.","review":"I rented this flick with the expectations that all the negative press and word of mouth was a little exagerated due to the engaging premise. Come to find out the negative press and word of mouth was dead on, this flick is a letdown. It seems this movie was rushed due to the gaping plot holes, average fx, and blindingly quick action scenes (so much is happening all at once you can barely tell WHAT is going on). Given maybe better direction and a lengthier script and production, this could've been a really neat franchise. Another in the long list of 'no brainer' adaptations (comic book or otherwise) that if the filmmakers had stuck closer to the source material, should've had a fun and entertaining blockbuster. When will Hollywood producers realize that if they meld great fx with an exciting, smart script and make a good movie they will make a lot more coin than they will with the likes of THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN? puzzling."},{"rating":"1","title":"No funny aftertaste","review":"No aftertaste at all. I am sure I'll have forgotten this movie completely before I can even... Wait, what was I talking about again? Oh, yes. LXG. Sean Connery has become the dottering old guy they portray him as on SNL. The characters are given short shift to some of the saddest SFX I've ever seen. The Nautilus changes sizes from as vast as Manhattan to small enough to fit into a canal in Venice. The only semi-interesting characters are either dead by the end of the movie or defying their own story-lines for a \\"funeral\\" for another \\"dead\\" character. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The League of Extraordinary Morons","review":"I just watched this movie, and I have to say I am in an extraordinary stupor. I feel like I have experienced something so extraordinarily bad, I don't know how to express it (ok, no more extraordinary references). This movie is bad. It is convoluted, has no focus, and the special effects were very disappointing except for Skinner and his whole white plaster thing going on. Sean Connery's line \\"I'm waiting to be impressed\\" sums up the whole experience. You sit there waiting for anything to happen that could possibly redeem the movie, and there is nothing. Avoid this movie if you can, but if you can't I hope you go with an extraordinarily special person so at least you can say you got something out of it...a date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic","review":"Let's start from the beginning. The man's name is Allan QUATERmain. It is NOT QUARTERmain. And Sean Connery? He shtill talksh like he haszh a mouth full of oatmeal, and even HE mispronounces his own name!! And Quatermain (in Haggard's fiction) describes himself as small, a \\"flea of a man\\" whose hair \\"stands up like a bristle brush\\". He certainly isn't Sean Connery. Quatermain was born in 1817. This movie is set in 1911. You do the math. The cover photo is extremely reminiscent ofMystery Men, and even thought that flick has a villian named Casanova Frankenstein, it's STILL better than this mangled, ill-conceived adaptation. Why is Nemo's Nautilus the size of an aircraft carrier? And if it's that huge, how does it cruise around the canals of Venice? Tom Sawyer? Really?! No wonder Alan Moore is disgusted with films of his books.The rest lives up to this insulting premise. Strictly for dimbulbs that think they're \\"smart\\" because they've heard of some of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of celluloid","review":"A complete waste of celluloid, even my 11 year old hated it.

If you're going do that write your own damn story! Don't tell everyone we are doing LXG and then NOT DO IT. You should always be true to your source as much as possible when making an adaptation, or why bother at all?Wheather or not you have read the comic shouldn't be an issue people CAN and many HAVE done faithful and well done adaptations of comic books so to say you can't is junk IMHO. A comic book isn't a novel and is easy to make into a film if the folks who made LXG had ANY respect for the original they would have tried harder...not every movie has to be an action film to be successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"When I first viewed this movie I said to myself \\"what the heck was that?\\" I then decided to give it another shot. I'm so glad I did. I guess I wasn't concentrating the first time!What a premise. \\"Superhero's\\" of 1899. It was a great movie.What imagination and special effects. It did take me a bit to figure out that Special agent Sawyer was Tom Sawyer but that was part of its charm.I loved the character developement and the togetherness that goes on through the film. It was quite different from any other picture I've seen.I know it was short lived at the box office but so was \\"Eddie and the Cruisers\\" and we all know how that ended up.This is a great action movie for all to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One very poorly polished turd...","review":"Everyone I know who's seen this film, myself included, hated it!! It's an interesting concept, but none of the actors really shine here and the look of certain things, such as the ship, are totally overdone and stupid looking. You'd think a movie with a vampire chick in it would be good, but she doesn't do any vampire-like things. I appoligize if anyone \\"doesn't find this review helpful,\\" but seriously, I TRIED trading this DVD in to a local DVD store and they turned me away. This is no lie, they had 17 used and unsold copies already. Please don't waste your time on this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Terrible movie when compared to the actually quite good comic. The idea is a fun one, and could have been done well, but unfortunately ends up dull and irritating.The Venice scenes alone are enough to ruin the movie- stick to the comics or better comic movies like Spiderman, Hellboy, X-Men, and so forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The League of Extraordinarny Gentlemen","review":"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is one of my favorite fantasy/action/adventure movies ever. I liked Captain Nemo's awsome submarine, the Nautilus. Dr.Jeykell and Mr Hyde were pretty good, Dorian Gray's character was errie and spooky looking as portrayed in the book: Picture of Dorian Gray, Agent Sawyer a.k.a. Tom Sawyer was good in his character and Allan Quartermain from King Solomon's Mines was cool too. The League members must fight and bring down a evil genius known as the Fantom, who's real identity is a surprise worth waiting for. ...The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a great movie to watch. Give LXG a try. It liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LXG on Blu-ray: Excellent picture and an OK movie!","review":"I'm revewing the Blu-ray version of the movie. This is the first blu-ray DVD that impressed me with the quality of video transfer!Picture Quality: Excellent without any reservation! 5 stars compared to other BD's.Audio: 4 stars. 5.1 is presented in DTS and PCM. While Audio quality is really good, the action scenes seem very loud and conversations seem a little too low in comparison which would force you to watch it at a little louder volume if you have an A/V Dolby 5.1/DTS receiver.Movie: 3 stars.

I've read the lousy reviews here and the sadistic opinions from movie critics and had no interest at all in seeing this film. Much to my surprise, it was very, very entertaining! A bit short on story, but BIG on FUN, BIG on ACTION and, if you have a home entertainment sysyem with Dolby 5.1, ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS on SOUND. To make a long story short, I would actually watch this movie again, and coming from an \\"indy film\\" fan like myself, I think that's pretty amazing (and so does my wife.) It's definately worth AT LEAST a rent, for the FUN of it. Also, I think it's a really good flick for kids even though it was givin a PG-13 rating.

It felt like they were ripping off Indiana Jones, X-Men and The Mummy all in the same movie. Let me say that both Indiana Jones and X-Men are both great series but the Mummy sucked.

I saw this movie the same day I saw Pirates of the Carribean, and I tell you, I was very disappointed. The movie didn't have much of a plot except that in the movie they were supposed to stop some bombs from detinating. That didn't work, so basically the rest of the movie was just to kill the guy who started the fight. I think the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide was something they should not have put in the movie at all.

But I still found it a thoroughly entertaining action-adventure story. If you've read anything about this, you know the premise: a number of characters from Victorian fantastic fiction team up to fight a villian trying to start the first World War. Sean Connery is excellent as always, the rest of the cast is definitely competent. But the real star of this movie (and any movie like it) is the action, which is pretty much non-stop from the very beginning.I also found the behind-the-scenes documentary to be rather interesting. In an age when most SFX are CGI, it was nice to see the crew making things \\"real.\\"I can't say this movie had any sort of profound effect on my life.

As I viewed it for the first time, I did my best in trying to imagine that it really was great. However, the disappointment resulting from being excited by the storyline only to find out the film was actually not-so-hot made it, in the final accounting, a real stinker. I should have spent my twenty bucks elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring and too unrealistic, even for an action flick","review":"I was bored during the first 45 minutes of this film until it started to improve - slightly. The actors were all superb and outstanding, especially Peta Wilson - the sexy vampiress! She brought a significant amount of life to an otherwise very dull movie. All of the actors were believable and great in their roles. Unfortunately that was not enough to make the movie interesting. The plot is too unrealistic, even for an action movie and seems to plod along endlessly until you can't wait for it to end. This movie was quite a snorefest and I doubt I will be purchasing the DVD when it becomes available. The best part of the movie next to Peta Wilson's performance was the ending. And I don't mean because the ending was good, I mean because it was OVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Being a HUGE fan of Sean Connery, I have been looking forward to this movie for months. I could not have been more disappointed. I thought the acting was great but the movie and the plot [bad]. For example the bad guy was trying to get the world to go to war but it never explained why. What was his reason? There was also a lot of jumping from scene to scene and not explaining where they were or why they were there. Mr. Hyde was another HUGE disappointment. It was just as bad as the hulk. There was very little character development; I never grew attached to any of the characters. They also left some things open ended. The movie was over and you go \\"wait a minute. What happened to that guy?\\" Or \\"What was going on here?\\" Very poorly done and it is a shame to waste any money to go see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So wanted this movie to work","review":"This movie was \\"watchable,\\" and I use that term loosely bc it was hard to see what was going on half the time, but when it was all said and done... I was very disappointed. I really was looking forward to enjoying a fun adventurous summer movie, but it just seemed like they just slapped this thing together. Not much of a screenplay to speak of. I did like the backdrop though and the concept of the movie also was intriguing. Sean Connery did a great job, man he can still kick some booty, and so did the guy that played the invisible man. All of the casts together, just didnt have any chemistry.

The writers showed quite a bit of restraint, allowing the characters to unfold with little more explanation than needed. There's a few places where you get a dumbed down summary of who each player is, but this is rare and understandable when it happens. A few characters don't get explained at all. You wouldn't know that Agent Sawyer is in fact Tom Sawyer from the movie alone, for example.The dialog is snappy. The action sequences are as crisp as Norrington's previous hit, Blade. If you go in looking for a fun action flik told out with re-interpretations of classical victorian characters, you will be amused.I, for one, recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This \\"Blu-ray\\" edition is the best ever.

I would not recommend this tape to anyone! The narrarators are soooo dramatic - for instance in the first story ( I can't even remember the title, it was so bad) the person reading the story emphasises every last word of the sentence, whispers and has to take a breath every few words. It is very annoying. I couldn't listen to any more than 20 minutes of the story - that's how bad she got on my nerves. The second story was not much better - she should have skipped the accent and I was disapointed in the storyline - Susan Wiggs is usually much better.Maybe reading the book instead of listening would make a difference.

The clich��s, the bad acting, the terrible direction of all its moving parts, and the ill-contrived rushed plot. I stopped this movie a little after the 1-hour mark after it almost made me physical/emotionally ill. Anyone who likes this movie cannot be trusted to even take my trash to the curb. Some movies are bad, but they are made to be corny (i.e \\"Transmorphers: Fall of Man\\" or any Ed Wood flick) but this has no excuse becuase its supposed to be a serious suspense-drama. The producers and creators of this should seek work doing something else...maybe removing roadkill from the streets.Im not one to suggest ticket sales as a barometer of a good or even quality movie but this one at THE U.S. Box Office took in ticket sales of only $17,164 (stat at IMDB)...they generally find that much in between theater seats for Disney-pixar movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"B Movie.

This movie is extremely predictable and poorly acted. Michael Douglas is stiff as he reads his lines. A reporter believes the DA is planting evidence (not in Philadelphia either!). He is also dating the assistant DA (one sex scene, no nudity). Rather than call in the FBI, he plans to catch the DA by making himself look like the criminal in a murder case with the aid of another reporter. The DA suspects he is being set up and the assistant reporter is killed along with the tape that would exonerate the first reporter. Now it is up to his lover to uncover the truth. It is a good story, just overdone. If you are going to do a remake, get Leonardo DiCaprio to play the lead.

Disorder in the Court -- the stooges are called as witnesses in the court, to testify regarding the murder of a man in a club in which they were performing as musicians. Not one of their best.2. Brideless Groom -- Shemp appears in this one. He has to marry a girl within 4 hours in order to inherit half a million dollars. Tries madly to find one, and then a big goofy fight ensues. A little better than the first episode.3. Malice in the Palace -- The best of the bunch. A classic episode, featuring diamond thieves, cooking mishaps, and such. As goofy as the rest, but a little more clever--classic Stooges.The recording quality is good. Digiview seems to make decent DVDs for cheap. Sometimes they take out the original music, however.

The sparse tale is about a young woman glimpsed by two men from a train. Both desire her and pursue her in their own ways, with somewhat drastic results stemming from extreme coincidence. It's the kind of moody, frustrated tale that might work better as an atmospheric noir film, but in any event it's certainly not enhanced by the flat style and drab colors employed throughout.

I cannot imagine that a traumatic event would so de-stabilize her! Thus, the book was ruined for me by the character not staying in character. I'm glad Shreve ending everything so happily, as I invested some time in this book, her worst, as far as I'm concerned.

The plot dragged on to the point it seemed the book would never end, and the characters were weak, boring and passive. As I read the outline of the book, it left me with the feeling the book would be somewhat of a thriller but, alas, this was not to be. The book could have been summed up in 50 pages or less. We found out little about Eden until well into the book, and her friend, Andrew, seemed to be front and centre. Shreve has many fine books on the market, particularly the Pilot's Wife, Strange Fits of Passion, etc. \\"Eden Close\\" lacked emotion and purpose. This was Shreve's first novel, written in 1989; thankfully her writing skills have improved enormously since then. Skip this novel, read her more recent books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read after reading the Pilot's Wife.","review":"The book was sluggish, lacking substance.

I readthis book because it supposedly is to be made into a film by Touchstone Studios. I see what appeals to the filmmakers: a potentially histrionic plot complete with bloody, violent murder and sexual abuse of a blind girl. The characters of Eden and Eden's controlling mother easily offer challenges to actresses. But the book as a whole and the rest of these characters (especially the male protagonist) are uninteresting and border on cliches.

There is no more room for imagination! Everything is already offered to the reader.The plot is typical (a lot of writers do this plot). The title is inappropriate because it is not in the perspective of Eden (except small parts in the ending of each chapter which, by the way, are out of place and do not help in the development of the story). It is more on the perspective of Andrew. This loses the mystery of the persona of Eden.The ending is so disappointing.

Full of twists and turns, what really makes this novel incredible, as well as all of Anita's other works, is her character development and her unique style of writing.

The recorded sound is not brilliant, but perfectly acceptable, and young Austrian pianist Stefan Vladar provides some fine playing with occasional real highlights: the 'Anhang Variation 5', for example, is full of poignancy, the 'Finale: Allegro brillante' is just that, and the 'Arabesque' Op. 18 seems to me to have just the right 'feminine' touch. On the other hand, there were moments when I thought Vladar could have put more nuances into the music or brought out even further the 'typical Schumann' naivet�� of this music.

I realize that they are trying to present him as the antagonist and as a flat character that will never change, but honestly! Furthermore, I found Cindy to be infuriating in this novel...the only way she got to be a jockey was having a family in the business and willing to help; yet she can't give Wolf a chance? And didn't she get to ride Glory when she was barely learning? She is taking her frustration at not being able to ride out on Wolf.

The author will mention substantiating evidence, but then never provide it. For example, she refers to archaeology work done at Little Bighorn but never says what it is. The book focuses way too much on Custer's wife...for a biography of him. There are 100 pages dealing with her widowhood. After reading the book, I don't know any more about Custer than I did before reading it. I had expected some sort of biography since the title reads \\"the life & death\\" & then meaning of the myth from that, but the book didn't deliver. I didn't get anything from the book to change my preconceptions of him from history class. The writer puts forth a victim defense...nothing was his fault, the army failed him, etc. Bottom line is 270+ men died at Little Bighorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"More miss than hit","review":"If you ever wondered why Billy Wilder's last movie, Buddy Buddy was so weak despite a great cast and a great premise, checking out the Francis Veber-scripted/Eduardo Molinaro-directed French original L'Emmerdeur/A Pain in the A** gives some pretty solid pointers - it's not very good either, seemingly too satisfied at the cleverness of the conceit to really mine it for all its worth. Lino Ventura is the mob hitman whose attempts to set up for a hit for his unforgiving bosses are constantly interrupted by suicidal Jacques Brel in the next hotel room. Unfortunately the first 40 minutes are pretty flat scene setting, with the film taking forever to get into gear and then only cruising fairly gently with the occasional light smiles rather than belly laughs along the way. Veber at least would go onto do much better work.TFI's French DVD does boast a good widescreen transfer with English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"L'emmerdeur\\" starring Lino Ventura and Jacques Brel","review":"The \\"combo\\" of Brel and Ventura is so perfect for the somber character vs the \\"mess-up\\". Their characters play perfectly off each other. Also \\"vintage\\" vehicles and France in the '70's brings back a lot of memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good text","review":"This book is not worth purchasing if you have any knowledge whatsoever of the hotel industry. It attempts to cover too many topics in too little space and fails to penetrate the surface of any given issue. I think that it is probably too much to ask that an in depth analysis of an industry as diverse and complex as the hotel industry be compiled into a single volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your ipod first","review":"Have a second Generation ipod?

When I received it I was very excited because it came in three nicely bound hard cover volumes. But, when I looked inside, all I saw was massive amounts of mathematical equations. I felt like I was reading a mathematics book and it was completely unreadable, overwhelming, & intimidating. I guess, being a novice, I expected something much more readable. So, I blame myself but for anyone like me who thinks the title of the book will give them an enjoyable \\"read\\" on computer programming...forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Academic Book","review":"Knuth's set of books on the Art of programming are excellent academic books. However, I should like to warn everyone that they are not practical programming books. For one thing, they examine each subject in extreme detail. Someone looking for a quick review of sorting, for example, will find page after page of mathmatical formulae and definitions, detailing not only sorting in general but total orderings, keys, data structures, etc. Also, don't expect to steal any code from this book. All the algorithms are written in MIX, a hypotheical assembler language for an abstract machine. In fact MIX is so out of date, and the abstract machine so primitive, Knuth is promising to update both - but not very soon.In short - these are great books. But they're not light reading and they are geared more for academic study rather than practical use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fundamental book for the randomness.","review":"Knuth talks about the applications into informatics of the theory number.This book , written several years ago, is today the best about those facts.

As far as the information goes inside, it is helpful. The only thing that bothers me about this book is that some of the problems at the end of the chapters make NO sense what so ever, and there is no help in sight of figuring out HOW to do the ridiculous problem they present. I have heard, though, that this is true of any physics book and that you can still make a good grade without ever getting the book's answer for homework problems. Another unfortunate thing is that unless you are a professor you really have no say in whether you get this book or not. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i needed for class","review":"Much cheaper than going through the bookstore.

The book basically consists of equations to be memorized and examples of how to plug numbers into those equations. There is minimal explanation, and it leaves any student unprepared for any kind of higher year physics course, without any idea of how these equations actually came about. Also, it was embarassing to walk around campus with such a cheesy attempt at cover art that is trying to make physics look \\"hip\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is utter crap.","review":"Okay.No student solutions manual. So good luck reasoning you way through the problems at the back of the book. No calculus, which actually makes things much simpler. The examples are not representative of the problems in the back of the chapters. Cumbersome algrebraic formulas that are not necessary if just a tad bit of calculus was employed. A waste of paper. Too bad universites use this, as the authors are obviously rip-off artists not at all concerned with the quality of their text, which is in shambles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Physics book ever seen","review":"This is the worst Physics books I have ever been FORCED to use!

But later I realized tha the too many figures are close to be junk stuff...but later on I discovered a very band thing: Calculus is completely absent, i.e., the powerful instrument devised by Netwon and Leibniz is completely avoided and I think deliberately.

You can give them jewelry, flowers, chocolates, and perfume and if they are a good person they will appreciate it, even if they take it back for something that suits them better.

They claim it can't be returned because they consider it a hazardous material. That argument is lacking any logic since they ship it to you under the same conditions.

The dry-down is nice. Some other summer time perfumes I use are DKNY Be Delicious which is a bit more fruity and stronger and Davidoff Cool Water is more \\"spicy and sporty\\", Oxygene by Lanvin has a slight chemical note to it and Shi by Alfred Sung is more floral and \\"soapy\\". Light Blue is nicely balanced between fruity and floral and musky. The musk anchors the perfume or it would be too light to be noticeable. This perfume perks me up during the day but it is a little too light for me for night time use. For night time in the summer I use Michael by Michael Kors, Chanel Allure and J'Adore.The 3.4 oz version was available for a slightly lower price at a discount club during Christmas. I think this price is still a bit on the higher side for just 1.7 oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I purchased this item in good faith. I've been using this fragrance for years.

It carried a much much lighter bouquet and it evaporated like pure alcohol into the skin.

I still had some left from the bottle I had bought from a known department store so I was able to compare the scent. It was noticably faint.

My review concerns the perfume only. I had such high hopes concerning this scent. I had read many rave reviews. When I received a sample scent in the mail, I was shocked at how much I disliked the fragrance. To me, it smells very similar to Anais Anais (which can be bought at a much less expensive price), and I have never cared for Anais Anais. Both perfumes are overbearingly spicy to me. I really like soft, fresh and sweet scents. Light Blue had nothing that I liked about it. I suggest buying a \\"sample size\\" first of any perfume and make sure that you like the scent. What smells great for one person does not smell great to another person. Reading the reviews, I thought I'd love this scent. But to be honest, I hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feminine","review":"Just love this fragrance! Convenient to have a purse size with me although not necessary as the fragrance lasts all day.

It is a work of fiction. Clearly it describes both the external manipulation of children by adults and their vulnerability to exploitation by those adults and children of their own age. My question is this: Did the author need to make this point by using such a destructive context? Or was the context self-serving for the author...to produce such sensationalized work that it would be noted for its content rather than its merit as a novel.

The songs featured on this CD, for example, show a heavy Hendrix influence from the electroharmonics down to the vocals.

One important note for those of you considering a digital SLR: you can only use viewfinder (not the display) when taking photos. Display can only be used to review the photo after it has been shot.

Canon has borrowed from its professional lens line to put an L quality label on the lens system to indicate that this is a new lens and it has been designed to fulfill the high resolution requirements of an eight megapixel CCD. In use the Canon felt slightly slower than I was expecting, certainly not much faster than the G5 and I didn't see any marked improvement in speed overall from that camera.Overall image quality was good, that L lens proving it can deliver the resolution and that Canon's reliable DiGiC image processor can turn out a quality image with good tonal and color balance and no noticeable artifacts.Http://www.powershotpro1.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Most Expensive Disposable Camera","review":"I have owned the camera for just 6 months, and took good care of it.

However, I was never informed of the camera's firmware upgrade and had to find it myself on their website.I would not recommend any Canon camera.

The automatic flash washes out all photos regardless of settings. The autofocus is so slow you'll miss all good shots if taking photos of children. The macro focus capability is useless and can't focus at all on macro settings. All in all, don't waste your money on this Canon camera, try Canon's other brands which are far superior, ie SD550 or better still upgrade to a digital SLR like the 20D.

The only good news is that I didn't pay for this Canon. Not having image stabilization really hurts this camera when used in low light situations - all shots are blurry. Fiddling with aperture and other settings helps only slightly. I've studied the manual cover to cover, fiddled with more settings, and no go. Of course no one believes me - that a camera that costs this much could take such terrible pictures, (it must be Operator Error!), so I let others snap some shots - then they see the light. Don't buy this camera!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the time","review":"This is the fifth digital camera I have owned...I've had 12 35mm cameras before this.

All the criticisms of it are from people who seem to think you should use the automatic settings for all the extreme types of photos. This is not the case.

After talking with Canon, they will not admit that this is their problem because I must have dropped the camera...that never happened!

On the plus side, it takes nice, sharp pictures (although a bit noisy in dark areas), and is built like a tank. But that's where it ends because it is absolute torture waiting for this thing to focus! Honestly, my four-year-old Sony Cybershot focuses faster which I simply cannot understand. Also, the LCD viewfinder freezes for at least one second for every single shot while it composes the picture. This is fine if you're shooting a bowl of fruit, but if your subject is moving at all, you're going to want to pull your hair out! I really wish this camera were all it was supposed to be, but you have now been warned. I guess I'll keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value, a looker...plays like butter","review":"I first saw this guitar in a guitar magazine advert and thought it looked very cool. As it was an \\"Artist Signature\\" model I assumed it would be expensive and forgot about it. Some months later I happened across it on the Amazon site for $159, free shippng and thought it might be a diamond in the rough and ordered it immediately. Was very happy with it out of the box, very well made and a cool looker too! I confess I like this guitar so much I took it to my luthier and had him dress and polish the frets, set up intonation and put high end strings on it adding $60 to my cost. This is now my favorite guitar among several higher end instruments, very easy to play and sounds great through several different amps.

The story from the sales person was: Paul loved it and they told him it would retail for $400. He said no go. He wanted it the same price as the model he bought and uses on stage. He won and so did consumers. It's not a USA Fender or Gibson but it is a guitar which is great for a beginer or a pro.

I thought at first it was me, so I read and re-read the manual, tried all manner of settings, and still each picture needs brightness and color balance, is out of focus and needs red eye reduction half the time. Also very annoying that it only warns you of low battery just before it runs out. It was a complete waste of money - only gave it 1 star because there didn't seem to be an option for zero.

I'd had my camera for 6 months and been thrilled with it, and then out of nowhere the E18 message popped up. I simply have no faith in Canon digital cameras anymore (although I just bought an i960 printer and it's fantastic), and would caution anyone considering purchasing one to consider how important your investment is to you.

The S500 produces excellent images, is easy to use, and is compact enough to carry in a pocket. 3X optical zoom is standard on these cameras. Besides shooting still photos, you can record low-res video clips as well as audio clips, but don't expect high quality on either.For a hundred bux less, you can get the 4MP S410 model which is otherwise identical to the S500. Should you go for this or the S410? I think for most consumers 4MP is plenty enough, with room for cropping and enlargements. 5MP is only necessary if you really crop a lot *and* plan to blow up the cropped images. The S410 strikes a great balance between pixel count and price -- it's a better value."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this ultracompact cameraA wonderful small camera","review":"Canon have done it again and produced this year another great ultracompact camera.

At 5 megapixel resolutions you can take very good quality pictures. The camera itself is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. It comes with 32 MB compact flash, so you may well want to upgrade this capacity. Also, a case is not supplied in the box. Still these are small minuses. Like a lot of the newer ultracompact digital cameras the S500 has a movie mode, and can capture 2-3 minutes.

The lock and key are flimsy and didn't insert or turn easily. One of the wooden braces came unglued in the shipping perhaps. The interior black felt was filled with wood and packing dust. I didn't hesitate to return this for a refund. This wasn't worth the half price of $80. It's really something you might find at a Cheap Jacks near Macy's on 34th Street for $40, Maybe.

So I had to manually place them in thier respective spots and hold them on until I got the top or cover on. The razor still worked ok despite this new inconvenience. Then in April I tried to open the retractible blade (for sideburns) and the whole side blade and other pieces fell off. The razor is now un-useable.

There is nothing about the album I don't like. As to this CD, I usually stop playing it before I get to the bonus tracks. The bonus tracks are actually very good, but having bonus tracks at the end of a concept album is like having a blooper reel added to the end of Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\"...it ruins the effect of the movie.

This book and another (Notorious) both contained passages that were written by Nora Roberts and that Ms. Dailey simply put into her own novels.I have been told that this version of the book was re-written without the passages.

Jando's spirited playing of op 2 #3 (the most substantial piece here) is worth the price of admission by itself.Jando is definitely in the \\"virtuoso\\" mold and the only mild criticism I might make is that he tends to play a little too loudly, especially in the slow movements.

The movie opens with an excellent robbery scene that soon devolves into a clash of greed, personalities, and intrigue. The depth of characterization portrayed is far beyond the typical Hollywood production, and Carlyle is aided considerably by great performances from Ray Winstone, Leana Headley, and Steve Waddington. Britain is not a gun culture like the U.S., and toughness is more a case of mana, or 'face.' The interplay of unemployment, row homes, subsistence-level criminality, and the occasional big score play out to the film's closing moments that include a knuckle-biting burglary attempt inside a police station. 'Face' is one of the best Brit offerings in a decade. Also look out for a strong performance by Damon Albarn, lead singer of Blur and the Gorillaz, the world's greatest 2D band."},{"rating":"2","title":"great british film!","review":"i saw this movie last night and thought it was fantastic. carlisle and winstone are great, and live up to their usual standards. the movie is kind of like 'reservoir dogs' as it deals with a hiest gone wrong, and the paranoia which follows. it also reminded me of a 'fawlty towers' episode in that every thing that could go wrong did go wrong, except there was no real humour in it. the pace of the movie worked really well, and i would say, in hindsight of my comparing it to 'reservoir dogs', that the characters were much deeper and thus the viewer is more emphatic towards their fate. a nicely suprising flick. watch it. and look out for the character julian, played by blur's damon albarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Clay Casserole","review":"I love this clay casserole, it is not only beautiful but great to cook with.

If you've been curious about the art of French cuisine, this is the most thorough instruction you could receive, especially at this price. He seems to have thought of everything you might need to know, all the way from selecting and sharpening knives to how to use food as a decoration. As for the food, he starts with how to select your food items, then shows you several different ways to prepare each, including presentation. Some of the techniques that really stood out to me are the Buche de Noel (Yule Log cake), making a caramel sauce, preparing fish, making merinque mushrooms, decorating a pate, the French omelet vs. the American version, variety of uses for pastry dough, etc. Once you see how fun and easy these can be, you'll want to try it yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read the reviews first","review":"I usually read reviews before buying an item, but did not in this case.My wife and I enjoyed this original series on PBS and I thought that is what was included. With 408 minutes and two discs, I assumed there would be close to twelve 30-minute episodes. What is actually on the cd's are \\"snippets\\" of the episodes, sometimes jarringly edited, presented by topic. That is fine if you enjoy navigating with your remote to find and watch a 30 second segment, but I would have much preferred the original show in it's original format. Why the producers felt it needed to be re-worked is beyond me.Five stars for Mr Pepin, but two stars for this poorly re-worked package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content, horrible navigation","review":"The poultry prep videos alone warrant the purchase price. The layout and navigation of the DVD are, however, about as poorly conceived as anyone could possibly imagine. Many of the segments are very short - some under a minute - and you have to play each individually. It appears some of the \\"Main Menu\\" links on subsections are completely non-functional.Regardless, the content is what matters, and it is fantastic. Jacques' knife skills are to be held in awe. Watching him debone a chicken makes you realize how badly you need to have your knives sharpened by a professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for viewers of the televised series","review":"Instead of containing each of the 30-minute episodes of the televised series in their entirety, in this DVD set, the episodes are cut up into short segments arranged by food category. And even though these segments are grouped together, you can only play each segment one by one. The original series itself is wonderful and very educational, so the content is still valuable, but in this format, it's almost unwatchable.

He inspires one to study the culinary arts and is the most charming fellow with a sharp knife you'd ever want to meet.I have only a few regrets: Aside from the navigational problems encountered in getting around in this dvd, I wish the instructional portions had been longer and more involved.

It hasn't worked since. I paid $400 for this camera and Canon would like $110 (plus taxes) to fix the problem - ridiculous. Especially since this seems to be a VERY common problem with their cameras. I've enjoyed the camera's picture quality and ease of use, but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years!

In December, they first experienced problems with the LCD viewer which displayed only partial images. The screen completely failed in January. The camera was evaluated by a local Canon repair store which had seen other similar failures. When the camera was sent for repair, Canon accused my parents of dropping the camera and charged $150 to fix it! This camera was NOT mishandled! Of course they offered to sell them a refurbished model from the rest of their dud supply.

The picture quality was brilliant, it was easy to use. The device was ment to be envied. It took marvelous pictures until within 3 months, July 2005- the LCD screen cracked. The camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage. I was never suspiscious of it until I took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems. Something bad will happen to this camera. Either the sceen will break or the memory card thing. A friend of mine also owned the s410, and her screen broke before mine did.The camera still takes photos, but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options. It is not worth the price of repair. Tomorrow I am going to buy a new camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a lemon!","review":"I bought this camera after being a loyal Canon customer for years. After spending roughly $100.00 in shipping on 3 separate occasions to send the camera back to Canon's service center, it still is not working properly. In the 8 months I have owned the camera it has only worked properly for a total of 3 days. Everyone at Canon is sympathetic that my camera is not working properly, but no one seems empowered to just ship me one that works. Instead, I have to endure a never ending sequence of shipping and receiving the camera only to find out that they can't seem fix the root cause of why the LCD is not working properly.

Yes you'd save money, but there have been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for too long. And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions. These batteries are made in sweatshops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody to sue.

This cd of course falls into the Blues . It was recorded in various states of inebriation which added to the live aspect or the profanity aspect, take your pick.

You only short yourself by picking this one.Everything said about how wonderful and rare tracks to be heard here are true. The author of that post is right on the money by praising this recording. The only problem is that \\"In Concert\\" gives you every last bit of this and a little bit more.I love to see concerts but have to admit they tend to fall short of the studio voice. I'm fine with that. Only reason I mention that is because after hearing this album or the other... I feel the studio versions of their music falls short.

I first heard this about 15 years ago and have since bought first the double album set, then the CD. It is classic Doors, and typical Morrison. From the music, and also his reaction to what's going on in the crowd, you get the impression Morrison nevers really cares what the audience thinks about his art. This doesn't take away from his passion for the music though, as testified by the songs included. Each and every piece is a story all on it's own. Highlights include a great version of \\"Break on Thru\\", and the epic poetry of \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\". The low point of this concert was \\"Build Me a Women\\" which is just plain dumb. However it's then followed by a interesting version of \\"When the Music's over\\" which has Morrison screaming at the crowd to shut-up. Overall a great concert, and an absolute must for Doors fans everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone loves it!","review":"Everyone that has listened to my cd wants a copy of it for themselves.

You don't necessarily have to have an interest in Burma, or canoes, to appreciate it. This is a classic travel account of the Major's canoe trip down the Irrawaddy River in those carefree days before WWII. Raven-Hart has a definite sense of adventure but doesn't take himself too seriously. In fact, the comic bits in here are very entertaining, some of the book's highlights. Plus, he has an observant eye for detail, offering the reader an accurate picture of the Burmese countryside and the people themselves. My copy of this book also includes some interesting Black & White photos that the author took. If you enjoy this one, look for the other canoe trip books that he wrote, which include trips on the Nile, the Mississippi, on rivers Europe, and in the South Pacific.

What I found was a grossly amateurish, intellectually pretentious, and stunningly manipulative piece of drivel. I absolutely hated this book, particularly because of obvious attempts at using emotionally loaded language to appeal to those with Emma Bovary Syndrome - an insistence on believing that somehow infatuation and projection are the \\"real\\" basis of love between two adult human beings.

But the book itself was awful. I, personally, do not understand how it became a best seller. The biggest problem was that Robert James Waller has no talent for dialogue. The Bridges of Madison County is full of long monologues by various characters. They are stiff, formal, and unrealistic, not at all the way people hold conversations. The writing style, too, could be improved--it was very simple, very predictable, very unsophisticated. In short, I do not think this book is worth reading.

I had seen the movie but the book is more detailed & I loved it!! Made me feel as if I was there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"I took this book for just what it is...a work of fiction. It's not real, so I didn't feel the need to pass judgement on the characters. It's a story that some will find entertaining, others won't. This book brings to mind an old song that goes something like: it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along. That sums it up in a nutshell. The writing is average, but I couldn't stop reading because I felt sympathy for a couple who fell deeply in love with each other but were doomed from the start. The simple fact is, you can't help who you love. This book explores an emotional (and heartwrenching) journey of what it's like to love someone you can't be with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, trite and unbelievable.","review":"Characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. Dialog is ridiculous.Writing is clouded by digressions on pseudo-philosophicalmumbo-jumbo."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many tears","review":"This book was recommend to me by a friend who said she cried while reading it. After I read it I too cried, because I could never be friends with someone who would recommend this book let alone cry over it unless it was because they wasted valuable time.On the upside it made Ditches of Edison County look brilliant, I think I laughed so hard I cried."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK book, GREAT story","review":"If Waller had came up with this story on his own, I would have given this book 5 stars. However, this is a true life story. He merely made it into novel form, which, in agreement with the many other criticisms here, he didn't do too well. The characters are flat and there are too many cliches.However, although the telling of it is inferior, the story itself is remarkably compelling and moving. I've never had the motivation to go and write a review before, and here I am right after finishing this book. To know that two people can share such intense, sincere love, and to find out and experience how they did - that is the reason why you should read this book.I am (and I think we all should be) very glad that Michael and Carolyn have put this story out there for the world to read and feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was pure crap!","review":"The publisher didn't have much sense since he published this crap!

Please don't read this book, you'll go into a deep depression, that is if you're awake enough to read it!!! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable love story","review":"I picked this book up because of the familiar title and after reading it I fell in love with Robert James Waller and his ideas. The Bridges of Madison County was a wonderful love story - the kind that every girl wishes could happn to them. I found myself admiring both Francesca and Robert for their decisions and their maturity in handling the circumstances. I feel that the sort of love that Robert James Waller wrote abut in The Bridges of Madison County is rare in today's society and this book was a nice reminder that it can still exist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarely do I say this but....","review":"Watch The Movie instead.

Now I am diabetic! Just too much syrup for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grafikimagnation has no imagnation...","review":"Perhaps the reason why those of us who weren't taken in by Waller's literary con job (and I use the word \\"literary\\" only under advisement and a ton of salt) is because prolonged exposure to this verbal quagmire produces a rather contagious abbreviation of the intellect characteristically suffered by readers of Harlequin romances (such as yourself, for instance).This kind of alleged story would only appeal to those losers who waited too long while love passed them by but unfortunately didn't show such prolonged restraint when this piece of shit was published by Warner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe.","review":"I have been in love. I have experienced powerful, gut-wrenching emotion. I have looked at something and thought, \\"it will never, ever be better than this\\". But certainly not while I was reading this book.The language was shabby. The storyline was flat and predictable, yet somehow managed to confuse the reader with unprecedented jumps from the present into the past, into the past of the past, into the future. As I turned page after nauseating page I watched Waller trample over everything good in fiction. The emotional moments were clumsily laden with outrageous cliches. There was no subtlety; none of the clever nuances that even the worst drug-store novel manages to include.I have never been more unimpressed with a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad you can't rate it a big, fat zero!","review":"This is the worst use of typed words in existence.

What tripe!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Joke","review":"Are these posters giving this book a 10 for real? This book (and I hesitate to call it that), is UNBEARABLE...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Waller had any talent...","review":"...he still couldn't do this pathetic story any justice. It's loaded with ridiculous metaphors, \\"I am the arrow and you are my quiver.\\" Boy, that's a turn on. If you have an hour free, go ahead and read it. It's surely worth a laugh. Waller may be the most overrated--I hesitate to call him a 'novelist'--person who's been published in history. God is this a terrible book. Hmmm, what else could it be called, 'Doing the Farmer's wife while the farmer's away?\\" This doesn't paint a picture of life in Iowa, in fact, many Iowans resent the fact that it took place here. It's truly an embarassment, as is Robert James Waller. What a joke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two-Dimensional Characters","review":"This book seemed so \\"engineered\\" -- my word for the author proceeding with a plan, then inserting cardboard characters to move through the plot. Neither character seemed more than a cutout: perfect, intelligent, witty, accomplished, talented, blah blah blah. At no point in this book could I lose myself in the plot or the characters. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Movie...Skip Book!","review":"The Clint Eastwood movie was 500% better than the book. I so respect Mr. Eastwood as a filmmaker because he had the brilliant idea to cast Meryl Streep and to make the movie about Francesca. Lovely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth wasting time over.","review":"I sincerely hope that teenagers who have read this book have not been caught in a fantasy of undying romantic love. It's a nice enough story, but written in a trite overly-poetic manner. Gosh! Who speaks crap like \\"I am like a Peregrine...etc.\\" And funny how Francesa gets over her guilt very fast. She is supposed to be a deep and sensitive person isn't she? Very few persons in their sane minds woud leave a legacy for their children detailing their extra-marital affairs. Robert Kincaid the macho man gets a chain bearing the name \\"Francesa\\" and pines for her till his death????? How much more unrealistic can you get? The only plus point is the description of the country that is vivid, you can picture locales very easily in your mind's-eye. This book is strictly for the \\"Use and throw\\" kind - like killing time on a short plane trip and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Hype Ends in Disappointment","review":"I decided to read this book after seeeing it on the bookshelf at my dads house. I've heard a lot of great things about this book. After I started reading it, I realized it was only a big erotic love story, not a well written drama as it was portrayed to be. I was very disappointed in the way the book turned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAD TO LAUGH...","review":"when I read the review from Dave in the Great Midwest because IAGREE THOROUGHLY! I, too, read this book in an afternoon on the advice of a friend and I, too, was apalled. The characters ARE both quite pathetic. And since when did adultry get to be so romantic? The premise is stupid and the dialogue is atrocious. The male character could well be an escapee from a mental hospital, he says such bombastically, nonsensical things! I think the popularity of this book and the subsequent movie just go to show that if you TELL people something is good, most will believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"dumbing down\\" of literature continues","review":"Try not to laugh when Kincaid says \\"I am the highway and aperegrine and all the sails that ever went to sea.\\"This book was highly recommended to me by a co-worker. I read it in an afternoon (Thank God that I didn't waste any more time than that on it.) and was just appalled. The dialogue was absurd, the characters pathetic. It almost read like a National Lampoon parody. I had always considered my co-worker to be reasonably intelligent (she has a doctorate for God's sake) but after I read this I never looked at her quite the same.This book should appeal to those who consider \\"The Young and the Restless\\" art."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WAS HOOKED","review":"Unabashedly sentimental and easily moved, I am one of the many many people swept up in the simple love story in this book. Robert James Waller definitely hit a soapy nerve; people are still gobbling up this simplistic kids-book-for-adults. And, easy read though it is, with little real wit or style, the essential story, which some claim is predictable, still resonated deeply for me at the conclusion. Unrequited love is a mighty powerful conceit, regardless of how many times it is replayed. And the characters, though underdeveloped, are well-imagined, and have appealing qualities, particularly Francesca, who exudes a soft melancholy throughout. Mish, mash, mush, whatever, if you like love stories that take you away, albeit manipulate you, with transporting sentimentality, you'll curl up with this book more than once, and enjoy it every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrayal in Madison County","review":"Reading so many other disparaging reviews about Bridges has renewed my faith in humanity. This is the worst book I have ever read - far worse than any Harlequin romance, because they are never hailed as a profound or beuatiful works of literature. I have to worry about anyone who sympathises with Francesca and their propensity for cheating on a faithful, kind, spouse. If you are bored, don't have a cheap and nasty affair with a womanising loser - find ways of bringing life back into your marriage. And as far as the writing style is concerned - well it certainly spiced up my marriage - my husband and I had many moments of closeness laughing hysterically at this romantic drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 love story of the year","review":"The boook \\"The bridges of madison county\\" was the best love story i have ever read. It is a book that makes you feel like the charachter. You go through almost the same emotions as the charachter,its a good book that i would definatly rcomend it for those people out there who like love stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've ever really been in love you'll \\"GET\\" this book","review":"If you're a miserable cynic, you'll hate it. I am not a fiction reader. I am purely a lover of non-fiction. But a friend pleaded with me to read this book. When I finally broke down and picked up the book, I could not put it down. I finished it in about 5 hours.People can say whatever they want about it being contrived romance, but this book puts you inside of what it feels like to be in a very intense romance that some (real) people really experience. I've been there, I know the anguish and intensity of the love this book describes. There really are people who love, speak and act this way.People who don't get this book are bitter and angry that they can not concieve of such intense loving and living. If you love to love, and love an incredible quick read, this book is for you.I wept for a good half hour when I finished this book despite myself. Enjoy!-- A non-fiction loving, non-sap from New Jersey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect read for the sentimentalist","review":"A woman I know, along with an Amazon.com reviewer or two, couldn't comprehend how Francesca's boredom could lead her to betray her husband. Francesca was not bored, perhaps unsustained by her husband's lack of passion, but not bored. Bridges of Madison County hit the bestsellers list for years because just about everyone has parted ways with someone they loved, whether it lasted four days or ten years. True passion lives forever in the memory and can sustain for a lifetime. This story is beautiful, one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage in, garbage out...","review":"That this is a great commercial success is a good example of how low the average novel readers level of expectation is!

Thanks Mister Waller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, fer cryin' out loud...","review":"I don't mean to sound insensitive, but if this book were a horse, I'd have to shoot it. No, really; it's that bad. I don't know a single English professor who ever read it. It was smarmy and pretentious. When I read the line about a \\"star creature on a comet's tail\\", I was groaning out loud. And when I read \\"I am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea\\", I found myself hoping that those sails would be capsized by a hurricane. And the part where Francesca's children read about her lovemaking really creeped me out.\\"Yes, kids, nothing says healthy like reading about your mother's adulterous sexual escapades.\\"Overall, despite its hype, this is nothing we haven't seen before. You read one romance novel, you've read 'em all. Kind of like Stephen King novels. If you're truly curious, pick it up at the library. You'l laugh until you realize that it's not a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fact that escapes many of you...","review":"...is that Waller's day job is a professor of marketing. Doesn't that just say it all? Upon finishing this book, I thought, \\"Who wrote this? A committee in conjunction with a focus group?\\" Then I read Waller's bio on the back cover. Yup, I was right. This book is nothing but a horny professor's wet dream. I mean, come on, what's with the line about being a peregrine? If some guy showed up in my front yard and said that, I'd direct him to the local police department. If you want romance, try marrying someone you REALLY love. Passion and tenderness do exist within legitimate relationships. Now THAT'S a storyline!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"Sorry to say it, but this book wouldn't even get a passing grade in a creative writing class. Trite, overused prose, a predictable plot -- why did people rave about this book? And call me old-fashioned, but what is so romantic about a sleazy few days of sex while the husband and kids are out of town? What is saddest about this book (aside from the poor writing) is that Francesca then spends the rest of her life pining after this loser. After reading this, I was so depressed, I had to read a decent romance, and so pulled out Jane Eyre again. Now, THAT'S a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery","review":"This book is so bad, so horrible, so nauseating and phoney that it's amazing. Sure, I could go on about how it lacks originality, lacks descriptive power, how the thoughts are all trite and childish, and even how a nice story can be ruined for all time. But I won't. Instead, let's play a game where we all pick out the absolutely worst sentence. Mine: \\"And out of the pickup came Rober Kincaid, looking like some vision from a never-written book called An Illustrated History of Shamans.\\" Is there a more nonsensical way to describe the first appearance of someone to someone else in a novel? I've never seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious!","review":"If you want to have a good laugh, please read this book. It was so incredibly bad that it is a parody of itself. The author/main character is so conceited and narcissistic (One scene that cracked me up was when a gorgeous model sniffs that basically she can't get close to him because he is too deep, brooding - HELLO! Can this be anymore silly? Talk about a male fantasy!) I believe a parody of this was written called \\"The Ditches of Edison County\\" but there really isn't any need to read that because you'll laugh just as much reading this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a parody of itself","review":"There are a couple of other hilarious ones, including the Butches of Madison County and the Fridges of Madison county.

I think Waller really did make an effort to reflect how these two people feel and what they meant to each other, even years later, but failed miserably to do so. Maybe it was the challenge of trying to put it all in words versus watching the romance being play out on screen. I have not read his other books, but I certainly am looking for them now (that's why I was on amazon.com today). I'm not giving up on him, but I would recommend the movie over the book any time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get real, this book is awful.....","review":"I have to say honestly, I saw the movie before I read the book, and I liked the movie a lot! I love Meryl Streep, but Clint Eastwood gives me the heebie jeebies....so needless to say, as I'm reading the book (after I saw the movie) and the author is writing about how Robert Kincaid is supposed to be this sexy older man, I'm trying to keep my lunch down! Yuck. I'm sorry but the image of Clint Eastwood ruined it for me...it was horrible enough watching him kiss and make love to Francesca in the movie...they totally should have has someone like...I don't know...Robert Redford play the part of Robert Kincaid....Clint Eastwood needs to stick to the Dirty Harry movies....not love stories....this book might have had potential, but I just can't get that old man out of my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeccchhhh!","review":"I must thank Robert James Waller as I now have a new litmus test for dating women.

This book was so bad that I resented the hour or so it took me to fly through it -- I could have cleaned the bathroom or something. At least the movie had an excuse (it is much more enjoyable than the book with its cheesy Hollywood plot), but this kind of horrible writing is embarrassing. See the movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tearful but trivial","review":"Reactions to this book are likely to be strongly polarized; some people will love it and others hate it. It is a simple story of tragic love, with no profound insights or surprising twists. The story itself is genuinely moving, and I am not ashamed to admit to shedding a tear or two. But Waller's writing style is very poor, full of cliches, and with embarrassingly clumsy attempts at lyricism. If you want to know what a real writer can do with such a theme, read Edith Wharton's 'Ethan Frome'.'Bridges' is a short story padded out to make a novella, using interminable details about loading a truck and taking a photograph. 'Set lens to f/8' we are told. Fascinating stuff, which must have made for a great movie. It is incredible to think that Waller actually squeezed a sequel out of it. I will not be reading that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soppy","review":"I love romance novels. I love reading Mills and Boon as well as Avon romances. This wasn't a romance novel. It was pointless. Let me save you from having to read it:-* The first 20 or so pages detail the main hero's life. I will sum it up for you: he is a photographer. He travels. He has no one in his life.* Next 100 or so pages detail four days he spends with a middle aged married woman. They cook dinner. They dance. They have sex. Then the story goes on about how they never see eachother again, yet pine for each other alot. They die.* Last 30 pages detail her children discovering about her affair, and about a musician who met him.Thank goodness the book is only short!I would recomend this to middle aged women who feel like they are in a rut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the hype","review":"This book was a huge fad when it first was published. It was not worth the hype. I agree with the reader below that the plot was contrived. I didn't find the characters all that sympathetic, but then I don't much like stories that romanticize adultery. However, I disagree in that I didn't think this book was all that well-written. The prose was too flowery and included some ridiculously cliched metaphors. Go ahead and read it if you really want to, but I'd suggest the paperback (it won't cost much) or better yet, just check it out of your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This is such a classic.

Anyonewho didn't like it clearly has no sense of romance or passion. The love that Robert and Francesca shared in the beautiful Madison County, Iowa is an example of the strongest love there is-the kind that changes you forever. Francesca just happened to find it with someone other than her husband. Waller's lyrical prose transcends common writing, and transports the reader to the mystical bridges. I have never cried so much as I did when Francesca has to make the crucial choice that will change her life and Robert's forever.

I am a romantic. And I couldn't stand it. This book is so banal and badly written one wonders how it got published at all.

The prose is wooden, the characters are comatose and the story is so ridiculous and hypocritical you want to throw up. The only reason I read it at all is I got stuck for three days in a camp with no other book around. A hint for amazon.com: please introduce a no-star category. A hint for Mr. Waller: please do not write any more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, mindless PAP","review":"I couldn't stand this book - pretentious, sickening, badly written. Of course all my female friends love it and think there's something wrong with me (e.g., I don't have a heart because I don't like it.) Well, I do have a heart but I sure don't have the heart to read this again - or to recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and annoying!","review":"A friend recommended this book, trembling as she handed it to me. She thought it was the best thing she'd read in years, and she told me with tears in her eyes.Of course there are male authors that can describe what a woman feels and be pretty close. But I felt this book was too obviously a man's speculation and probably hope of how a woman would feel in reading the story. In short I was annoyed because I felt manipulated and patronized."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God","review":"This is probably the most hysterically funny book I've ever read. I didn't actually finish it (I mean, come ON . . .) but for an entire summer my friends and I would make each other laugh until we cried by reading some of Waller's truly miserable prose. I thank Mr. Waller for providing for so much unintentional hilarity and I very much pity anyone who actually forced themselves to finish what is truly an awful, insultingly bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"This book made me feel icky all over. There are certain fantasies that it's just smarter to keep private. This is one of them. I'm not sure what made me more uncomfortable, the lovers (argh, what a cliche) or the creeping sensation that it was all a big marketing ploy. Definitely not for anyone who is looking for something more than a stereotypical romance novel dressed as literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching n' eerie","review":"i am surprised at the readers' dislike for the book. i think it was great, it moved me. but i do call it eerie coz of robert's love for francesca. it was amazing how he holds on to her even though he knows they aren't going to be together. that's the power of love, i'll say. i did it give it to my boyfriend as a present too and the reason was that i knew he and i weren't going to be able to be together either, so i thought i'd let him him know thru this book how he'll always be with me. of course, my duffer boyfriend didn't get it though, till today (i think). men! (sigh)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"FRIDGES\\" Parody was an assault, and as woman who","review":"has experienced the pain of love lost, I find the comparison offensive. Women are far truer to themsleves when it comes to loyalty. Francesca kept her promise to her marriage and to her children all the while knowing the frustration of love lost. This is romantic writing at its best with an ability to touch at the core of the pain. I would recommend that all those who missed the point re-read it.

She wasn't abused, neglected, ignored or any of the other reasons a person might be expected to experience before looking for an affair. She was just plain ole bored. Nothing worth wasting sympathy on. Can't believe these two people who only saw each other for a brief period could carry the torch the rest of their lives. The children reading the story and thinking that it was just wonderful without feeling even a little sorry for their father doesn't ring true. Sorry..can't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"In his dreams!","review":"Thank God I'm selective when it comes to my own cash. This book was lent to me by a 35+ y.o. single friend that said she cried and cried. I was really reluctant to read it but did after some prodding. Oh, gag me.

No substance to the story just another air-head woman forgetting about what's important in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book defines \\"overrated\\"","review":"After hearing all the hype, I picked it up. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This has to be one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The dialogue is forced, unreal and just plain boring. The storyline is less than romantic, simply another re-hash of the old farmer's wife and the milkman story. I'm astounded that people are actually reading this drivel, never mind that so many actually find it remotely interesting"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Crime Against Literature\\"","review":"I quote the great Meryl Streep by calling this book a crime against literature. I wish there were negative stars that I can give this awful concoction of pointless romanticism and inept story structure. The plot was minimal, the characterizations were nonexistent. For the life of me, I can't understand why this book was so popular. You have to give Mr. Waller credit for marketing. He knew what would sell, and apparently he spent all of an afternoon producing it. Now please, stop the madness and don't produce any more books like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridges to Nowhere","review":"Frankly, I can't understand all the hoopla concerning this book. It seems to me a very ordinary sort of romance plot and the book is not particularly well written either. It is a psychologically thin novel -- the author does not delve into why a happily married woman should throw herself so cheerfully into adultery, and why one cheap, trashy fling should be considered so life changing. There is no competent analysis as to what love really is and the pathos of lifelong separation between the lovers are neither believable nor sensible. The book stands for false emotions.I draw a parallel between this book and Erich Segal's \\"Love Story\\" which was just as enormously popular, but which I find just as simplistic. Why do they succeed while scores of others like them fall by the wayside, and so many better novels have to be pulped? One can only wonder at the mysterious element called \\"luck.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It touched the deepest part of my heart","review":"Well, obviously not many people like that book. Sure ! It's not that easy to devote your life to a person, to a feeling, to a moment that lasts forever... actualy, it's very hard.And even harder is to realise that such kind of love exists.But it's the first step...

It is not just the telling of two people meeting in the summer in Iowa, but it is the summation of two unfilled dreams. They were not to be, but they were good dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but overrated love story","review":"This brief book (took me about three hours to finish) has its high points but at other times wallows in unrealistic dialogue and unlikely characterizations.Robert Kincaid is a well-rounded character, but Francesca -- an Italian immigrant turned English literature teacher (!) -- misses the mark after a decent start. Particularly disappointing were the dialogue between Robert and herself, discussing their future, which reads like the author talking with himself; as well as the letter to her children at the end of the book, which sounds as if it were written to two strangers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter sweet love","review":"I'm a romantic at heart and this book makes me weep. It is just so heartwrenching when two people love each other the way they do and can't be together. Francisca will forever be haunted by her guilt if she leaves her children and husband. She did the right thing, but it was so painful to see her choose between the man she loves and her duty as a wife and mother.I just wish they can be together. What is even more sad is, they never met again. Yet that love remains. On the other hand, upon reflection, would that love still remain if she did choose to be with her lover ? The answer to that we will never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie, skip the book.","review":"The movie captures the magic of falling in love with its quiet moments, yearning music and, above all, Meryl Streep's fabulous performance as Francesca. The book, which I read after seeing the film, was a great disappointment. I agree with most of the negative comments on this page. The fact the story itself has attracted such vehemently opposing views, however, does show that Waller's story has touched a nerve with the public. It shows perhaps that love and hate are two sides of the same coin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather silly","review":"Waller is a good essayist but a poor novelist. He has taken the old traveling salesman-farmer's daughter routine and tried to con us into thinking it is a real romance. Why did the woman keep a secret for 25 years and then feel compelled to blab the whole thing to, of all people, her own children? What is glamorous about a four-day roll in the hay with a man she knows she will never see again? If he is such a hotshot photographer, why does he toss his highpriced equipment into the back of a pickup where it will get dusty and unusable, and worse yet stolen? Give me a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"divine romance","review":"Dont listen to anyone who mentions the book is bad. They probably did not get the essence of what the author was trying to convey.The rattrap is only of use until the rat is caught, after that it is useless. Similarly words and language are only of use until the meaning or emotions are grasped. After that they too are useless. But unfortunately if one gets stuck at the words, then it is shallow.Definitely, one of the best books i have read and reread. A slow romance which goes beyond words but touches the depths of the heart. One of the few romantic novels which have made attempts to touch the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate waste of potential (and paper....and your time)","review":"This book is essentially worthless drivel. \\"He moves like a gazelle..\\" ?!? Is the author serious? To say the book is cliche ridden is an understatement. The writing is sophomoric and the characters are developed not in action, but in ridiculous cliched descriptions like the gazelle simile. The saddest thing is that this could have been a great story. The plot has potential. A long lost forbidden and passionate love affair, discovered after the two main players are deceased. The woman's children having to figure out what happened years ago based on their dead mother's diary. This book could have been brilliant and instead its like a bad passage from the Song of Soloman. Don't waste your time reading this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, I did cry...","review":"Forgive me, it's been a few years since I've read the book. Remember that part near the end about the swan swimming in the lake, trying to find it's mate that had been shot? Man, was that heart-wrenching!But that was the only emotion that surfaced in me while reading this horrible book. I read it because it was highly recommended to me by a friend who studies journalism at Northwestern. I respected her literary opinions until I read this. In fact, I was skimming through it at the end!I can't find words to describe this trash. Harlequin novels are better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure drivel.","review":"Forced myself to get through it, only because I hate to leave a book unfinished.

May I suggest instead that you rent Brief Encounter (based on Noel Coward's Still Life) or A Summer Story (based on Galsworthy's The Apple Tree)? Both of those are about fast romances, missed chances, and obligation to duty. And they are both way more powerful than this treacle.

It gave me pain to read it but I did just to be fair. I read a parody (The Ditches of Edison County) first and thought it patently unfair--the original couldn't possibly be that bad. Unfortunately, it was much, much worse. I don't like to deride an author's work, but this book is so obviously a money making machine to be marketed to a notoriously poorly read mass market that I don't think it qualifies as real writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I guess we could all spend a little time wondering \\"what if\\", but as far as this book goes - get real!

Although blatantly designed to appeal to the emotions of unhappy women, this book is puffed up with such male egotism and strutting nonsense that I can't believe women managed to swallow it.

Go figure!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated - I'm sorry I spent the time and the money on it.","review":"This book was hardly the compelling story it was cracked up to be. In fact, one wonders whether it would have done so well without Oprah's endorsement of it. Because of her endorsement, I view with skepticism any other books she has endorsed, and her endorsement is never a reason I would read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego stroking and maudlin","review":"When this book showed up on everyone's must read list I stepped out of character and read it. In the opening section of the book Waller compares himself to the hero, who he has been following/researching in order to complete the tale. He believes that he and the hero are now practically the same person. He then portrays a person with no faults, complete self-reliance, who is strong and sensitive. He lovingly strokes this character all throughout the book. There wasn't much more to it besides some very sad people who made some difficult decisions and didn't want to live with them anymore. Poor babies. I couldn't get over the fact that he was essentially writing this story about what an amazing person he himself is. By the time I was through with it, about a half an hour later, I resigned myself to never read a book off the best seller list again. Waller is not a literary author, he is a trashy romance novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read","review":"...and I have read some pretty bad ones in my lifetime! The only way I was able to get through is was on a Thanksgiving day drive to my cousin's. Everyone in the car took turns reading it aloud. It's a maudlin, unrealistic, hideous piece of garbage.

I fear for the fans of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't let him write a sequel","review":"Why is this book in the \\"Literature and Fiction\\" section? It should be considered a Romance - and a very poorly written one at that. The plot is mawkish but vaguely plausible. With compelling characters, it might have been interesting. However, the characters are unbelievably flat - they never do anything unexpected, they have no faults, and as a result, the reader has no interest in what happens to them. Waller's florid text does not improve matters. I have not read such a poorly-written book in years. The \\"2\\" rating is generous.If you're looking for something romantic, don't read this book - it will turn you into a cynic.

Not a great one - these people are not ready for, say, Anna Karenina - just a good one, with at least one of the following virtues \\"Bridges\\" conspicuously lacks: 1) Sentences.2) Human speech.3) A moral centeror, lacking those,4) Pictures"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember Waller's Book Signings?","review":"Saw stories about the audiences at his book signings around the country when the book came out. By and large the audiences were made up of women in the 40-55 years old age range--precisely the Harlequin Romancers of the world who were probably in deadend marriages and yearned for the escapist fantasy Waller provided. But as a novel? Full disclosure: I never got past page 16. Couldn't do it. The writing was that bad. Just horrible cliches, awkward phrasing. And I must say how hilarious to read others defending their uplifting experience with bad literature with \\"If you didn't like it, you must never have been in love!\\"Oh honey, yes we have. And are.

We kept passing it to one another with the intro, \\"you have to read this. It's TERRIBLE.\\" Because we really wanted someone else in the house with whom we could discuss who TERRIBLE it was.

Children find out that their mother had an extra-marital affair on their father while they were at a country fair, having left her behind to pick up a wandering photojournalist and they find the romance worthy of celebrating? Yeah! That is reality for you. I am sure there are loads of adult children hoping they found out that their mother was living a lie their entire lives!Sorry, but I still regret wasting the time on this book.

Vicki sings so beautifully and there is such a spiritual connection when you listen to her songs. I have been blessed to have found this lady's glorious music. I recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for peace and love in the Lord and this CD will bring you just a little bit closer to God. It is truly AMAZING !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading, but...","review":"As with most of the recent Star Trek comics, Enemy Unseen collects three stories that either have a good story but awful art or the other way around.Perchance to Dream is a fantastic story by novelist Keith DeCandido (his Diplomatic Implausibilty is the best Trek novel of the last year), but with awful, stiff, clunky art by Peter Pachoumis.Embrace the Wolf is a cleverly written TNG sequel to the TOS episode \\"Wolf in the Fold\\" by Buffy novelists Christopher Golden and Tom Sniegoski, done in by AWFUL art by Dave Hoover.The best art is by Andrew Currie, who does a great job with The Killing Shadows, but it's illustrating a really boring story by Scott Ciencin. A pity Currie couldn't have drawn one of the other two.Still, it's worth it for the two good stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling historical account","review":"Compelling and unforgettable historical account of ancient Hawai\`i from pre-Captain Cook up to the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, by prominent historian and Native Hawaiian Lilikala Kame\`eleihiwa. Moving and detailed description of the devastating impact American imperialism exacts upon the minds, culture, and lives of the Native Hawaiian people. A must for those interested in a true history of Hawai\`i."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice - even for its price!","review":"This is the worst Bolero I've ever heard. I could hardly believe this is performed by a professional orchestra! From the very first note (well, beat in fact), the drum is lifeless and boring. Drums are supposed to make this song go forward, no dragging behind. But that was exactly how I felt.Also, most of the solo are just plainly BAD. They basically sound like some high school students doing it for the first time. I also think they got some jazz saxophone player doing the solo, for they totally ruined the smoothness of this classical composition.As for other songs in this CD. They are not really much better, the whole orchestra is very dull. But I address heavily on Bolero because I hate to see when someone ruin a classic piece!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A old friends thoughts","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. My first thought when I saw the title was about See no Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak no Evil the tale of 3 Monkeys. But I really enjoyed your interesting way of expressing your views of this very important subject. And it instantly brought to mind my own thoughts and ways I've expressed them to my Family and Friends over the years.

All the other works on the subject have beenheavy handed and far too institutional to actually finish. The book is out of print, but easy to find.

I couldn't put the book down, I was happily amazed that I am not the only one in the world going through a divorce and feeling crazy.

We are Crazy when we hear her voice and don't take her advice, because all she/he/it wants for us is to be happy and fulfill our true destiny. This was an amazing book and I am proud to say my best friend, Robin was not only part of the editing process but also sent me the book to read, Thank you, Robin and Thank you, Ms. Gabriel for writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"goddess club member","review":"Having had the experience of a divorce in my 40's after a long marriage, this journey with Catherine Gabriel was not only familiar but rewarding. I would have longed to have had Joan as my personal trainer in adjusting to a new life. This author shows how honesty, intellect and a sense of humor can even out the bumps in lifes road. She's not crazy, just a joy to read. This is an easy read, without the heavyness of the subject. Be prepared for self reflection, uplifting your mood, and to forever be changed in your outlook of a goddess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speaker wire","review":"Thick insulation, works perfectly. this was used to install speakers in a restaurant drop ceiling.i would recommend this to anyone running new wire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was sent two 250ft spools","review":"I was sent two 250ft spools, i wanted one 500ft spool, I also wanted same as picture it is not a metal spool it is plastic and not made by coleman a good quality brand of wire, if you purchase this item don't purchase from deerso inc. \\"boo on them\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY","review":"BEING AN OLD LEE MOORE FAN WHO LISTENED TO HIM ON THE RADIO MANY YEARS AGO, I WAS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE TECHNICAL QUALITY OF THIS RECORDING.

This is one of the finest books for helping Christians who are struggling in their spiritual development and are having trouble moving beyond the guilt stage of failure to live up to others' expectations and are searching for the liberating life which comes from a surrender to God's love and grace. Dr. Bobo combines his years as a university professor with a deep compassion for \\"everyday\\" Christians who are caught in the web of \\"spiritual-growth-by-works\\" trap - and the Christian life has become a drudgery.

It was a chilling time and the author tells it like it was. We HAVE come a long way, baby!!

BORN TOO LATE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed character development hurts well composed novel","review":"Merlis brilliantly composes American Studies, but unfortunately, his character development comes to a screeching halt somewhere in the middle of the novel. Merlis goes from a fine story to some sort of a soap opera-esqe ending that leaves this reader cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Gum","review":"I purchased both the gum cigars and chocolate cigars for my daughters announcement. The chocolate cigars were classier and of better comparative quality. This is not to suggest that the chocolate is anywhere near gourmet quality but it was far superior to your other tobaccoless alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book but...","review":"It was tedious. I was hoping that the story would get interesting at some point, there might be some sort of passion or driving force but the characters just got swept along. There was nothing to make me care about any of the characters; they were all generic, taken from \\"central casting\\". The book was violent and ugly without a strong moral center. It was truly a struggle to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved Gap Creek but this is a poor follow on effort","review":"I greatly enjoyed Gap Creek, Morgan's novel about the difficult life of a 17 year old girl who lived 100 years ago but Brave Enemies, the story of a 16 year old girl (who pretends to be be a boy to protect herself) who lived 225 years ago falls flat for me. Josie/Joseph is just too saintly to believe while the preacher who takes in Joseph (only to discover a woman under the rags) seems to have real psychological problems. Their relationship doesn't seem real.The book has too many examples of unrealistic coincidences and miraculous escapes. I did enjoy Morgan's portrayal of day to day life in the Carolinas but I can't recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great readed","review":"I just picked this book out as one of the books I was going to read on vaction. The problem is that it never made withme on my trip to the Gulf. I finished the book in two days. Because I could not put it down. I am not one who would read a love story. I got the book because of the Battle of Cowpens. I found the love story between Josie and John was my favoir part of the book. I do not what to give anything away. This book gives us many gifts. Robert Morgan gives us poetly, history, and gripping story of love. As well as a taste of the South during the Revolution. I hope Mr. Morgan will write his next book with Joise and John picking up where we last see them. Agreat book that you well be glad you read. It will warm your heart to the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and repetitive","review":"While the author is obviously a competent writer and excels at description, he is overly reptitious. The pacing was slow and tedious, which did litle to create tension or anticipation. The only thing I anticipated was the end of the book. The characters seemed one dimensional. I never felt like I knew them or particularly cared about them. Whereas we are subjected to lengthy observations of the settings, we are seldom exposed to the emotions and feelings of the characters. We are told that John falls in love with Josie, but nothing other than proximity even hints at the reason why. I didn't like Cold Mountain either but will admit that it was technically well written, as is this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for thriller fans.","review":"A riveting thriller about a serial killer who dies, but leaves behind a baffling list of new murders which are still happening. The mystery takes newspaper reporter Joe Dougherty down a tangled trail filled with breathtaking plot twists, memorable characters and a truly shocking ending. The first few pages of PLAYING DEAD might be the most compelling opening to a suspense novel that I've ever read. And it never stops - the chapter are short, the writing crisp and the pace of the plot breakneck. If you're a fan of Michael Connelly or Lawrence Block, you should definitely try PLAYING DEAD. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks suspense and credibility.","review":"Mostly an excuse for the author to play out his fantasy of gorgeous women falling in love with him for no good reason. The narrative wanders into his background of compulsive gambling, also for no good reason except that his past interrupts whatever small narrative flow there is (and there isn't much). The victims are relentlessly uninteresting (who cares if they live or die...not this reader). He has created possibly a most boring and unconvincing set of serial murderers with a paticularly petty excuse for their deeds. Give this one a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Suspense and Thriller Fans!","review":"R.G. Belsky weaves a tale of suspense that is anything but dull. Playing Dead is full of plot twists, thrills and chills that make you not want to put it down. Totally enjoyable! I would definitely read other works by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"On the Shelf,\\" UCLAlumni Magazine, May 2002","review":"Allyn Ryan '59, M.F.A.'64 creates an intriguing alternate history in her new science-fiction thriller Salt Mines.

Very boring at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book was a good read, a reminder of how society was, & still is, in many ways. A very disturbing, but accurate story of a man just trying to LIVE in a very racially charged time in our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indignities and rage of a black shipyard worker during WWII","review":"Chester Himes's first novel is a vivid portrait of black rage in Los Angeles during World War II, when blacks were able to get shipyard jobs, but had to work with (or for) southern whites who expected deference from those they considered their inferiors (indeed, regarded as subhuman). Himes crammed a lot into 203 pages. I find Bob Jones's dreams and his dialogue with Alice not just didactic, but forced, and the sexual politics is at some points difficult to believe. In contrast, the fury and terror of indignities at work, with the LAPD, with duplicitous white coworkers, union and company officials burn true. In the four days after snapping back at a Texan woman who spits out the n-word, Bob loses his position (and therefore his draft deferment), his middle-class girlfriend, his car, the money in his wallet, his shoes, and his freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author !! 10 Stars","review":"This emotionally charged novel, written by Chester Himes, tells the true locked up feelings of an african american character, that we to this day somewhat, feel the same. Take a journey with Himes thru this novel going thru the likings/dislikes of everyday life. Himes in so many words said things alot of us still feel to this day. He writes from his soul leaving the reader emotionally drained. I love Chester Himes novels, he thinks and writes what most is scared to say or write. I could now see in his time the world was not ready for Chester Himes, but still true today these feelings and thoughts still exist. Chester Himes May U Rest In Peace !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively, witty and enjoyably purple prose","review":"Against a backdrop of greed and corruption, this book tells both the story of Los Angeles and of the Los Angeles Times. The Chandler family -- reaching out like an occult hand -- transformed L.A. from a dusty pueblo into a lusty metropolis. Author Dennis Edward McDougal turns his gimlet eye on the fascinating Chandler dynasty and provides insight into the bittersweet life of its scion, Otis Chandler. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adonis with issues","review":"The first few pages are written in a glitzy, sophomoric style that is grating. Fortunately the book straightens out into a well-researched and well-written history of LA, the LAT and the Chandler/Otis families. Otis Chandler is the most interesting person in the book, a driven, hollow man. The book misses some opportunities to delve deeper into Otis. For example, in the sections on deer hunting it comes as close as anywhere to approaching the mind of Otis, the way it was tormented by killing, and yet driven to kill. Couldn't the author have worked with this more throughout the biography?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Protocol propaganda","review":"Only by careful omission of Rome's empire does the author claim the Jews were expelled due to their own activities and not for the simple crime of not being Catholic. It wasn't only Jews who were persecuted under the Inquisition.Paul Warburg and the other international bankers--many who are not Jewish--are found on the Pilgrim Society member's list, a Freemason roundtable at the time.The top leaders of the Russian Revolution, and their financial backers, were all Freemason, most who were not Jewish (see Wikipedia: Jewish Bolshevism).These Freemasons are Rome's Templar Knights who have ran world revolution since 1776 after the Inquisition and Jesuits themselves were abolished/banned in 1773.The persecutions have not been about RACE i.e. Jewish & Gentile, rather RELIGION.These are just some errors with books based on the Protocols--produced by the Freemasons themselves to blame their world revolution on the Jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee - this book seems to suggest the Jews are profideous and intolerant & hateful of the dominant culture .. can this be true ??","review":"\\"We Jews, we are the destroyers and will remain the destroyers.Nothing you can do will meet our demands and needs.

Not for any usual sound problems, but because it surprisingly captured the sniffling, coughing, breathy noises of the performer. I tried to overlook it, but constantly hearing labored breathing and sniffling behind the music is incredibly distracting. I'm guessing he had a cold when he recorded this and the sound guy had no idea what he was doing. Such a pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"a life-altering experience","review":"This magazine transcends the industry to which it caters and affects its readers on a spiritual level. After reading a single issue, I was so moved that I sold all of my worldly possessions, gave the money to charity, and now devote my life to the betterment of mankind. This publication simply cannot be praised enough. Rating this magazine is like rating the Bible -- you can't put a score on what can only be described as proof of a higher power."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is The Specials???","review":"This is The Specials? It's nothing in comparison to the 2-Tone band we know and love. I am going to review this album as another band, say The Sputniks. The Sputniks have a very good blend between horns and vocals. The tunes on this album have a the great traditional sound of the 2-tone era with a kick ass edge. Of course the album doesn't do justice to seeing The Sputniks. The energy put into the album is great, but seeing them live just doesn't compare. The Specials have officially sold out; hearing \\"It's You\\" played in Applebee's, just ruined it for me. So now, they are going to be referred to as the band formally known as The Specials"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ska Comeback","review":"This is a very good album that rivals the intensity and beat of the early Specials and Selecter. The original band is almost all here and ready to rocksteady. The best tracks include \\"My Tears Come Falling Down Like Rain,\\" \\"It's You\\" and \\"Keep On Learning.\\" Great live tracks of \\"Rat Race\\" and \\"Gangsters\\" although not the best version of \\"Concrete Jungle\\" I've heard. Produced by Stoker and guest spots by the boys from Rancid. If you love ska (and who doesn't, despite what Rolling Stone said), this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...","review":"This is really a great album. Yeah, it's different than the old stuff, but it's still solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still impressed","review":"Enough said about the old vs. the new. I'm happy to own this CD and anyone who knows anything about the band should be able to realize that The Specials are able to illustrate their particular point of view and their current frame of reference better than most any band recording today. They aren't 20 anymore (though judging by Roddy's exploits in Buffalo this summer you might think they were) and their music reflects that. It's still us against them, working class upfront take what you will, and still pretty danm good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scalet Woman","review":"This is the first book I read by Gwynne Foster.

I forced myself to finish. It had all the makings of truly good read. The plot was great and the characters were interesting. Or so I thought. The Blake character waffled too much, sometimes he loved her, sometimes he didn't. A very irritating trait in any man. Melinda was somewhat interesting but her accepting attitude towards Blake's indecision reminded me of a floor mat. I really enjoyed Ms. Forster's earlier books and this one will not stop me from reading any future ones, however, I'd skip this one and go read \\"Against the Wind\\" were I you. It's one of her best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"The ambivalence drove me crazy. There were paragraphs were Ms Forster wrote how much Blake loved the woman at the beginning, then at the end he couldn't stand her or didn't want to be with her or thought the worst of her or some such nonsense.The Heroine was just as bad and believe it or not they'd both had feelings for each other for 5 years. Ok so she was married so they didn't act on those feelings etc and he thought she was a gold digger, so I understood where Ms Forester wanted to go but she didn't get there.The plot had some substance but I ran out of patience with the characters.This is the second book of hers that I've found disappointing. Not sure I'm going to waste my time with another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I am sorry, but this was the worst I have ever read. The characters were difficult to follow. In 1 sentence they were all over each other and then in the next sentence they were upset and outraged with each other. They were too wishy washy. I didnt understand why Melinda was so outraged about Blake trying to protect his client in regards to the foundation. I think she was over the top with her reaction. I think the writing style and the dialogue were too old fashioned. It was almost like the characters were stuck in a time warp. The plot was pretty good but the deliverance was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"I am a big fan of Gwynne Forster's work, I have read all of her books and truly enjoy her writing. So I am sure you can imagine my shock upon reading Scarlet Woman! The book is below, way below Ms. Forster's writing standards. This book lacked everything, romance, suspense, drama, believability. It was simply sex and silliness. Truly a dissapointment.

The author has truly mastered his craft, giving his readers a clear sense of being guided through the story while never failing to surprise us. A delight to read, a literal page-turner. In short, wonderful.But I cannot leave it at that, for the book also challenges its readers, opening: \\"You are a witness.\\" It is participatory, an active read. We have been witnesses to our own celebrity culture and even to our own \\"love stories\\" just as we are said to have witnessed the appearance that is the game. Can we, however, come to witness what is of true value? Mr. Vedeler's book affords us the opportunity to witness his characters' return to reality.

I needed a volume that helps me build business cases based on value propositions for management who knows little about software but a lot about business. Well this isn't the book. It is interesting. But, when you try to communicate value in terms that the business community doesn't understand, you fall flat on your face. For example, concepts like incremental funding methodology and minimum marketable features have lots of appeal to technies. But, they don't make sense when to a chief financial officer who doesn't have a deep software or the XP background. Perhaps, the book would work if I worked in a software house that built software using XP and the state-of-the-art. That would be nice. I guess I will search for another volume that is more traditional in its approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boiler Room","review":"I bought this thinking It would be an interesting drama, as I heard good things about it.However, it is much more than a drama.I now realize this is an excellent tool to learn how salesmen ply their trade.If you ever plan on buying anything (esp. stock), or selling anything, you will be able to learn something from this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"REIGNITE","review":"Boiler Room is a classic.

The sound is remarkably good for the 1940's. I grew up with Bruno Walter's Bruckher 4th and 9th and Te Deum. Since the 8th occupies a special place in my heart, not to mention my pantheon, I always wondered how Bruno Walter might have approached it. Occasionally, dreams come true. For me, the measure of an interpretation is not whether it somehow surpasses all others, but whether I can emotionally learn from it, whether my emotional life is deeper and richer because of it. Bruno Walter's 8th is such a performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wildness\\" can have many definitions!","review":"In her own home setting, the protagonist is indeed the wildest woman around, and the reader cheers and chuckles at her bicycle riding and cigar smoking.

She's managed to support her family writing \\"minor\\" romantic novels. When her housekeeper's little grandaughter disappears while under the care of the father at work in a logging camp deep deep in the forests, she sets off to help find the child. The written language is glorious..I remember my great grandmother using some of the same phrases. Her descriptions of pioneer life, life in the logging camps, the forests, and her obvious love and respect for animals and the environment is nothing short of thrilling. Charlotte becomes separated from her group and lost in the forest, eventually following a family of wild animals in an effort to survive.

For example, The Crown just about financed its construction the way DARPA financed the early Net."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Thin\\" Cable","review":"Interesting subject, but not a well-told. Given the book's short length, about 220 pages, he devotes a surprising amount of the book to backgrounding. In a book of this length, you really have to cut to the chase. For instance, we get 20 pages, or a little less than 10% of the book, describing the history of the Great Eastern, the massive ship that finally laid the cable. And a number of pages devoted to the family of Cyrus Field, the man who came up with the whole idea. Why? Not every fact, newpaper article, and speech that a researcher finds is relevant. Needs focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breezing across the Atlantic...","review":"It's not often that you'll read historical non-fiction that grabs you and pulls you along, but this is one of those rare such books that would make great beach reading.

His prose is very celebratory although that appears to be his intention: witness the title. The notes in the back suggest he relied exclusively on just a few sources and too much at that.

Also, she does not seem to understand that heightism and discrimination toward shorter men is much greater than toward shorter women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left too much to be desired","review":"I think this movie was on the right track, and it was well made for a documentary. The problem is it seriously lacked content. It did little but scratch the surface of what it wanted to say about the military-industrial complex. It should have delved much deeper into things like how much Boeing/NG and other companies were being paid by the goverment for projects.It would tease you with tidbits like 'every state is responsible for making part of the B2' (inferring it's a strategy to continue the political/economic demand to produce them. . . but then leave out SO MUCH potential information.Overall, I was pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you know","review":"I learned so much from this film.

For example, the bald assertion that Cheney steered defense contracts to Halliburton flies in the face of audits that found to the contrary. The acquisition officers themselves complained to the press that the Halliburton contracts were handled via the normal government process and that it slandered them to say otherwise. I am even less impressed with the assertion that follows this slander that this polemic reveals nothing new because everyone knows it's true. That's a pretty tired rhetorical trick: Strongly assert your case has already been proven and move on. The people who actually handled these contracts know otherwise. I doubt they will be featured in this propaganda piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This my friends is what we call \\"propaganda\\".

What a bunch of crap. Any history book will tell you this isn't true. The worst battles of the war were fought against Japan the last year of the war. Many civilians committed suicide rather then surrender when the US won a battle. That's a funny way for a country to try to surrender.

The real title should be: \\"How the military industrial complex makes us fight because we're too stupid to think for ourselves and it's a lie that millions of people living under brutal dictatorships lack freedom.\\"Right off the bat, the film shows a former CIA agent talking about blowback, with the inference that 9-11 was our fault for trying to liberate millions in the Muslim world.If you approve of Michael Moore's theory that health care in Cuba is better than the U.S., this is the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous propaganda, but slickly produced","review":"This is a big disappointment. There are plenty of good arguments they could have marshaled to make their case, but instead they merely had various \\"talking heads\\" stating personal opinions, presenting them as incontrovertible facts. And endlessly repeating of minor variations on the theme.If you like the genre, the use of visuals and music in the transitions is quite good. However, the attempted manipulation is painfully obvious: The argumentation is so deficient that the slick production values highlight that weakness.Other reviewers' citing of Michael Moore's work as comparable are misplaced.

On the other hand, it's influence over our elected leaders may be threatening the sovereignty of our country by influencing our leaders to unnecessarily go to war to increase the volume of the arms market.

The book begins with what is known of Anderson's early life and continues until her death, spanning several decades, two continents and many court battles.However, I felt that the book leaned too heavily on the evidence that supported Anderson's claim. From the mystery's beginning until its conclusive end, there was always much evidence against the possibility on Anderson being Anastasia. Some is included in the book, but not dwelt upon as much as some of the other evidence.The updated section on the DNA testing is fascinating and very well written and should prove once and for all the claimant's identity, although some doubters still remain.Even though the mystery does conclude at the end of the book this is still a fascinating read, especially for anyone interested in Russian or royal history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly...","review":"A very silly fable spun by a man almost clinically obsessed with the fraud Franciszka Szanckowska (note that Kurth cannot even spell her name right, making it into some bizarre \\"Schanskowska\\"), alias Anna Anderson, the person who claimed to have been Princess Anastasia and who was exposed decades ago by Grand Duke Ernest and the team of detectives he hired... Nowadays this book about a has-been fraud is interesting only from a psychological point of view - as a fine example of obsession and denial of one man, and its influences on his psyche (Kurth cannot even force himself to accept the results of DNA tests, proving that \\"Anderson\\" was Szanckowska, and he denies them)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one for the nutjobs","review":"The credibility of this book should have been destroyed by the DNA testing which disclosed Anna Anderson's true identity, but of course there are stil circles of people out there who will bend over backwards to invent any and every theory that works with their fantasy.

But Kurth is obiviously on a follower of Anna because instead of writing a true non-fiction (instead of stating facts) he has to find situations that prove Anna Andersen is Anastasia; expecially in the first trial chapter where he stresses that the judge was being unfair; which made him sound like a child whining (but, but. . .) Even with these small annoyances, the book was very enjoyable altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but a little too personal","review":"I read this book years ago, it is a fascinating detailed book, and after reading its emotional testimony, I too was convinced it was she, However, I was wrong, and so was the author, some people would like to dismiss DNA but that is just burying our heads in the sand. Anna Anderson could not even speak Russian, although it was explained away in the book, it was obvious she did not know it. The authors style is very personal and he insists that a german factory worker could not pass herself off as a Princess, but that is too simplistic, the Romanov family knew she was not Anastasia, some people may not recognise their family members, but I would. Anastasia died in Ykateringberg, they found her body. it is her older sister, Maria, who's remains are missing.

Ok, so those of us who were convinced by this book would definitely have triumphantly seized upon a positive DNA match between Anna Anderson & the Romanov bones as the last scientific word, but all the same... Those DNA tests not only contradicted all the other evidence pointing to Anna's authenticity, they contradicted each other. Three DNA tests were done - two very strongly resulting in a DNA match between Anna and a great nephew of Franzizka Shanzkowzka, but the third matching neither with the Romanov's NOR the Shanzozkowzka's. Whilst not proving Anna was Grand Duchess Anastasia, it certainly proves these results simply are not reliable, and, yup folks, this mystery is far from over."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the mystery?","review":"What's the mystery?

Although DNA evidence has now proven beyond reasonable doubt Anna Anderson was a fraud his book is none-the-less of value, it brings to life a fascinating era and womans futile fantacy life. Historians and romantics will probably debate the the merits, or lack there of, the Anna Anderson saga for years to come.

But it does not have much examples of how to use the character. Definitions next to characters are very confusing and not clear. One of my biggest concerns is that definitions, pronunciation, and kun(meaning of the character written in Japanese) are all written in English instead of Kana. I would suggest that you choose another book. If you still want to buy this book, then consider once more and read other customers' reviews carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For the Japanese Language Student","review":"The kanji is fairly easy to find, there is an informational preface. The most commonly used kanji is in the front. A very, very small list of Kanji by English words. I recommend this for a student learning kanji. Numbers, days, etc. are not in order, but easy to spot if there is previous knowledge of kanji. Not recommended for students who've not had previous knowledge of kanji."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"There is no reason to buy this book. It is not a kanji dictionary, so it will be of limited use for that purpose. It also has very limited use as a self-instruction text, because the order the kanji are presented in is illogical for foreign learners (so many times you end up learning a complicated kanji, only to find that simple parts of that kanji turn up as their own kanji *later in the book*), and there are no mnemonics of any kind. Many compound words are presented, but there is no information on how to actually use them, so you cannot use it to learn new vocabulary unless you already know the words. The stroke order diagrams are mildly helpful, but you can find animated ones online for free (WWWJDIC will have a diagram for probably every single kanji in the book). Basically, the book amounts to one big kanji list. Henshall's Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters, Heisig's Remembering the Kanji, etc. are much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I bought this book 4 years ago and have barely used it at all. I like the fact that it gives stroke order, but it does not have all the readings for each character, it does not provide any mnemonics or historical origins, and the individual kanji are not numbered, making it a pain to find them easily.A much better book is Spahn and Hadamitzky's \\"Guide to Kanji and Kana\\", or Kenneth Henshall's \\"Guide to Remembering the Japanese Characters.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful book; I couldn't be happier with it. I've got the \\"Yookoso! A Guide to Contemporary Japanese\\"'s workbook (it's for my Japanese class), but I prefer this book much more. It not only enables you to learn the Kanji, but it even has a section at the front giving you instructions on how to test yourself; how to cut an index card so you can test yourself on either writing the character itself, it's on/kun readings, it's meanings, etc. The characters are written in awesome calligraphy in both brush and pen; all this said, I love it ^_^."},{"rating":"1","title":"not useful at all","review":"This book is essentially a listing of 2000 Kanji with two examples of howthey are used in compounds. There is no kanji lookup system, no discussionof radicals, and no order to the list. So if you find a kanji that you do not know, there is no way to look it up in this book. My Kanji Learner's Dictionary is much more useful. I'm confused as to why someone would publish a book like this - it is really not useful at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Kanji book you'll need! A must for any Japanese student!","review":"First off, this is not a dictionary. As titled, it is 2,000 of the most commonly used kanji you'll need to understand Japanese. I used this book during college (my major was Japanese and World Business, Univ. of TN) and I somehow lost it and did miserably in my classes without it. The book has two ways to reference the kanji; the first is the onyomi or hiragana spelling, the second is by stroke count. Like I said, get this book if you're taking Japanese classes, it will make your life much easier as the course gets more advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST learning method for SERIOUS kanji learners","review":"If you are a serious kanji learner, meaning you want to know all the 2000 standard kanji and not just +- 200 for travelling purposes, you need this book.Admitted, learning Kanji is a lot of work, but this book sure does help a lot. All the other reviewers summarised the good points of the book, but the one thing I'd like to point out is the fact that in the examples it uses only the kanji the learner already encounterd. This makes it a better book than Kodansha's. True, Kodansha gives a lot more examples for every kanji, but you don't remember a single one of them if they consist of 3 kanji you didn't learn yet. I'd say, teach yourself all 2000 kanji with this book, then go buy Kodansha for the extensive amount of examples they offer.Danil, The Netherlands"},{"rating":"1","title":"In need dire need for update","review":"My bad, I noticed too late that this is a 1987 publication... let's do the math..yeap that's 25 years Outdated.I'm a month into studying japanese for personal trip, I,m studying on my own and I already learned my kana (both hiragana and katakana)Why romaji... it would have been far more helpful to have kana.

This CD showcases many of his staple songs, leading to long vocal virtuoso singing almost with jazz scatting leanings. You can really hear the playfulness he displayed live.The only thing I miss in this is his earlier simpler presentation. I remember the best shows as just being himself on guitar, Mr. Carter on the Congas and other percussion, and this fabulous vibraphonist. Nope, I dont remember his name. I have yet to hear this vibraphonist on any recording, but I really thought that he was an important element in making the ethereal and almost other-worldly sounds that Tim Buckley spun.

After the first five songs listening to it on the way home, I realized that these guys were just playing up their religion to become popular. The songs seem to have no real meaning behind them, just repeating the words \\"Lord, Savior, and Jesus\\" many times in a horribly nasal voice. To those with a discriminating ear, listening to basically the same songs over and over with the key barely changing is abominable.

Wolfgang Ruebsam plays four brief organ pieces (a total of seven and a half minutes); a ��German Boys�� Choir�� (could it be that they didn��t want their true identity to be known?) sings three lovely German carols (a total of eight minutes); and the CSSR State Philharmonic directed by Alfred Walter plays 21 German and Anglo-Saxon carols in the most hideously sentimental orchestration (with added keyboard bass, yuk!!) imaginable. The organ pieces and the boys choir are both very good, respectably recorded.

I was looking for a middle-of-the-road camera: solid professional features: more than a point-and-shoot but less than an 8 or 9 megapix device. This Canon is perfect. Sturdy. Feature packed. A solid feel and size without being too heavy. All the reviews are right: you'll spend another $100 min on accesories, batteries, etc. But I would do it over again if I had to. On AUTO mode, anyone can snap a pic in a instant - yet the camera is full of other modes and features that would suit all but the professional photographer. And at 3+ megapixels, the pictures are simply supurb. I like the fold out screen and the SLR type viewfinder combo. The 10x zoom is wonderful and very fast.

If you are taking pictures with good lighting then this camera is great. I have used most of the features and like them all. I would reccommend this to just about anyone.

This is annoying, but not impossible to live with. However, since then I have found that the batteries, whether I am using the camera or not, are completely drained in only a few days.Canon charges a huge amount to even send the camera in for diagnosis, making the whole situation cost-prohibitive.Since this model is no longer in production, this posting may be moot.

I took pictures with both cameras using the same image and same angle, one after another. I transferred to the PC and the A95 seemed a bit better. I think the issue is the focus technology on the S1. The A95 took the shot much faster and always looked better. I haven't decided if I want to take the S1 back yet. I love the 10x zoom and it works fine at full zoom if you know how to use the manual focus feature. I love all the added features, and the hardware is much better built than the A95.

Unlike some huge books, I did not get lost in the complexities. Any technology like this is complex enough as it is. I like to start with an overview, and this book is exactly that: a great introduction and overview. Even so, it's practical enough to put the knowledge to work right away.

The title of the book is a misnomer and that may offset some people's expectations. This book isn't about JBoss in-depth. It is about J2EE, good developmental practices and a guided course into building a j2ee app from gound-up.I particularly enjoyed the clear and detailed instructions and explanantions about application packaging and development. The example used throughout the book is an excellent choice and iterative developmental model used is fantastic. I did not use the suggested ant scripts (I use MyEclipseIDE it's XDoclet extensions) but still found the scripts highly useful reference points.Overall a well written book and a good buy.

To me it was basically a horror story about an extremely sadistic and cruel mother who literally got away with murder for a long, long time.I saw Terry and, I think, the author and the arresting officer on a talk show about a year ago and found that show to be much more interesting and informative than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Book, Different Author........","review":"Although I didn't finish this book, the book, \\"Whatever Mother Says...\\", is this EXACT story written by Wensley Clarkson!

Instead of keeping up with his assignments he stays busy playing with his toys and watching tv. So when it's time to go back to school brother is clueless about his studies and fails a quiz.What's great about this book is that brother tries to skip school and avoid his parents but when he does come clean his parents aren't irate like he thought they would but instead they help him to catch back up.

The viola soloist is lovely, the violin soloists are also fine. So are the horns and the recorders. Why don't I love this recording? I think it has to do with a pedestrian approach.The viola concerto is the best thing on this disc. It is engaging Telemann, and is well-performed for the most part. The orchestra accompaniment is pretty vanilla, however. A lack of clarity in the orchestra also hinders some of the joy of the Concerto for 3 violins.I guess if I had to sum up my apathy about this disc, I would say that the blame falls on the shoulders of Edlinger and the orchestra. We have come a long way in Baroque playing, but this seems hopelessly average and old-fashioned (not that older styles of Baroque performances don't have their rewards).

ODDS AND SODS is mostly a collection of rare songs and B-sides that would have been perfect candidates for a single. The original collection must have been large already, but the wonder of compact disc has expanded ODDS AND SODS to 23 songs worth of hidden treasures that might otherwise be overlooked. The few songs on here from the aborted LIFEHOUSE project are proof that Pete Townshend was on to something back in 1971, he just didn't know how to present it to the public. 30 years later, with LIFEHOUSE about to come to fruition in a different form, these songs are excellent preparations for what could be the greatest rock show the world has ever seen!

That said, there are several things to consider. First, there is material here that has already been issued in the Who's reissue series, and other cuts, like John Entwhistle penned b-sides, Circles (a BIG omission), etc., that are not here. Second, some of the remix/remaster choices are suspect. What happen to Under My Thumb? And what about the distortion on the high end in Summertime Blues? Also, if you want to hear how good Pure and Easy and Long Live Rock can sound, you'll have to buy the box set, because the overall sound is much smoother and more natural there.I'm happy to have the material, but of all the Who's expanded reissue series, this is the one I would most question as to it being as good as it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just rocks","review":"Not one of the concept albums...but great the cuts are powerful.So many songs added to the original list which was rockin on its own.I just had to replace this one in my catalog when going digital."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite Sleeper Material","review":"When you think of great Who recordings, usually Who's Next, Tommy, or a compilation comes to mind first.

But what really makes this expanded edition so good is that all the sides of this wonderful band are explored from the off beat Cousin Kevin's Model Child to the sixties organ flavored Mary Anne With The Shakey Hands to the explosive Pete Townsend sung version of Love Aint For Keeping. It seems as if a different version of Little Billy was placed on this collection from the original. A mild disssapointment as this track lacks the speed from the original. The original studio version of Summer Time Blues is here as well as Young Mans Blues in the same realm. Maybe not on the level of the prime time Who's Next but certainly a very special collection in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar collection of rare Who gems!","review":"Any Who fan will delight in this rich mix of songwriting and odd tid bits and not so odd music, A must for a Who fan's library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That's what I call oldies but goldies","review":"\\"Odds and Sods\\", the remaster, is far better than the original one because it brings more obscure material, offering a different view of the band. Songs like \\"Young Man Blues\\", \\"Summertime Blues\\" and \\"Water\\", stage favorites in the beggining of the 70's, are showed in studio versions, along with \\"Pure and Easy\\", \\"Naked Eye\\" and \\"Too much of Anything\\" (from the \\"Lifehouse\\" project - which turned out to be \\"Who's Next\\"), \\"Cousin Kevin Model Child\\" (a John's contribution not included in \\"Tommy\\"), \\"Leaving Here\\", \\"I'm the Face\\" and \\"Baby don't you do it\\" (recorded as the High Numbers, in 1964), and \\"Mary-Anne with her Shaky Hands\\" (from the underestimated \\"Sell Out\\") are fine examples of how far the band went in 10 years. A real master piece, addressed for music fans, from the huge Who ones to the youngest."},{"rating":"2","title":"raw and reckless, early who","review":"much of the material on this 23 song disc is simply going to be too crude and raw for the average listener to get into, but for rock and roll history buffs, and fanatic fans of the who, this is a fantastic gathering of rarities, outtakes, and B-sides from the earliest years of the band. the music here is sometimes powerful, sometimes sloppy, sometimes quite good. two tracks are absolutely great: the studio version of \\"young man blues,\\" and \\"long live rock.\\" lots of heavy pete townshend power chords and riffs on the guitar, effective at this point more from the sheer aggessive attitude of the player than for proficiency, and plenty of mania from keith moon as he assaults his drum kit in what is often more a percussive storm than an act of musical beat-keeping. highly recommended for lovers of early to mid-sixties garage rock, and for anyone who wants to catch an earful of what this band sounded like back in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carr Super hoop","review":"Great value compared to a running board.

I found it quite enjoyable. The young lead actor is quite good, as are the actors who played the slimy congressman and his complicated nephew. The movie portrays innocence lost. A young man who is a high achiever and who has faith in the nation's political system learns that many inside the system are absolutely corrupt and that they shield each other from exposure. The young boy's journey was realistic in many ways -- aside from his oblivious parents.A WORD OF CAUTION: Please ignore the reviewer who says this movie is perverse and that it is about sexual slavery. That person is wildly mistaken and not that intelligent. In fact, he or she isn't intelligent at all. The movie is obviously too deep for that person to understand or appreciate. Please do not allow that terrible review to keep you from watching this captivating independent and low-budget film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie","review":"I hated this movie.

Who better than someone born in Massachusetts to write a story about the illustrious Boston Red Sox? He begins with THE SIXTH GAME. For those uniniated, the Sixth Game is possibly the greatest game ever played in a World Series. All the way from Carlton Fisk's triumphant home run to the damning Free-Agency created on Major League Baseball. I know it sounds cliche, but Gammons truly hits a home run with this book. Along the way, from 1975-1985, you meet the Red Sox and learn who they are. Jim Rice, Bill \\"Spaceman\\" Lee, and Luis Tiant. Bucky \\"Bleeping\\" Dent, Mike Torrez, and Joe Rudi. Everybody important, and some that are not important, are covered in the book. If you are a Sox fan, or simply a baseball fan, and you have not read this book, you are truly missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Red Sox","review":"BEYOND THE SIXTH GAME is Peter Gammons look at Red Sox baseball from 1975-1983. The main characters are Fisk, Tiant, Lee, Yaz, Lynn,Scott, Rice and Zimmer. Gammons, much like Sox fans themselves, laments the wasted potential of the bunch. They were so close so often and yet ended with multiple heartbreaks and no championships. The hidden gem of the book is the chapter that examines the Reds and their unmatched egos. Gammons seems to imply that the Reds had the mental toughness that the Sox always lacked during this period to overcome both poor management and the Yankees and O's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose Wisely","review":"This would be a great toy if i could get one that worked properly this is the 3rd one we have purchased and none of them will work correctly.

I really feel like I have gotten a complete workout and was even a little sore after the first workout. I work out 5 times a week and try to do something different every day and this is a great change. Kelsey is a refreshing and motivating instructor and it is good to see a different face instead of some of the nausating instructors that the FIRM has. I would highly recommend it. It is not a beginner workout. I would say it is more inter/advanced. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to be a calorie burner, but THE MUSIC...AAAGH!","review":"Ms. Daniels seems to have some great, creative moves but the lack of cuing while jumping right to a move that should probably be explained coupled with her utter lack of synchronicity to the music makes it unbearable for me.I just got Dangerous Curves Ahead and I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible cueing, 200 calorie workout","review":"I have been a user of the Firm DVDs for years. I own the Transfirmer series and love it - it really is a great work out. This DVD didn't get my heart rate up at all. According to my heart rate monitor, I burned about 200 calories. This is probably due to not being able to follow the instructor's cueing. I've done a lot of fitness DVDs and typically catch on pretty quickly. I think the \\"pink\\" firm DVDs are a waste of money. This will be the last Firm DVD I purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible cueing","review":"I have a number of the firms dvds and have been using them for two years with great results. Bought this thinking I would step it up a notch but, the cueing is so bad you end up stopping to say WHAT!! The most disconcerting thing is that the steps are off the beat of the music and that drove me crazy. It's a tough workout if you can get in your own groove but I find myself using this the least of all the Firms workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Cue-ing, please bring back with a new instructor","review":"I had purchased another DVD featuring Kelsey and I was disappointed by her awful, and lack of, cueing. I am a Firm user since I was teenager and I continue to use their original 5 a few of the newer ones about 6 times a week. I am not a beginner by any means her cueing starts half way into the moves. Additionally, her voice is so irritating and hard to understand, I found myself putting on the mute button.The weight workout is pretty solid and has some unique moves but I hated the dancey marching segments that was endless and boring.Here are the pro's and cons:Pro's:- Weighted work out was challenging and added some new moves that really worked my glutes and legs- Weighted workout segment really got the heart pumping - great cardioCon's:- Instructor's cueing was delayed and her speech hard to understand and a huge turn off- The dancey part in between the weighted work out is BORING and too long"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! But probably not a great intro to The Firm for beginners","review":"I'm a huge fan of The Firm, and I really enjoy this video. It's extremely demanding, and the moves do require a fairly high amount of coordination, but that makes it more entertaining for me. The Firm puts out a lot of videos, so I appreciate it when they throw in new combinations. Having said that, I would not recommend this for an introduction to The Firm. It helps to be familiar with their other videos, because most of the difficult moves are just variations on things that have shown up before in other workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Hype","review":"I couldn't pass their look--so masculine, no waist or hips! They all had squad, highly muscular bodies. I like to maintain my curves, so will stick to the older \\"Firm\\" videos and DVD's, where real women guide you through real exercise. I rather stand the 80's music than this!

I use it frequently. However, as a fitness instructor, I have concerns with this workout for beginners. While Kelsie is upbeat and fun to work out with, her cueing is poor and the music is often off-beat. This is not a problem if you are patient the first time through, and if you're not new to exercising.Once you get past that, (and know that you need to have good form on lunges and plies, which she doesn't mention a whole lot), it's a great workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructor not on the beat of the music, annoying","review":"I used to teach aerobics a long time ago, and am just getting back into it.

Don't waste your time with this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of valuable workout time","review":"I have several Firm dvds that I enjoy doing weekly, mostly with instructor Allison Davis. I bought the 500 Calorie workout because I liked the idea of a hard, calorie-burning hour of cardio. My advice, save your money and the hour of your time you will spend trying to follow this erratic instructor. As others have reported, the cuing is horrendous and the disconnect of the workout to the music is a huge distraction. Kelsie is hands-down the poorest instructor I've ever seen on a workout dvd in terms of direction and preparing you for the next move. Even the background gals look as if they are stuggling to follow her. After three different occasions of giving the workout a shot and then turning it off and hitting the treadmill instead, I decided that there are many less frustrating and more enjoyable ways to burn 500 calories. This dvd is going straight to the trash so no one else has to struggle through it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to follow","review":"While I do think this video could give you a great workout, there is no way to burn 500 calories or even get through it when you have to stop and figure out what is going on. She is impossible to follow and does not give cues that you can understand until she has already moved on. It is ridiculous!I have tried it a few times and repeatedly have to stop and watch to figure out what she is actually doing, then restart, by then I am behind. And....I am not a beginner.I really wanted this to be a great video, but it just isnt worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok but be careful on some of the transitioning","review":"I got this workout to see if I'd like them before buying their new slim in 30 series. I have done kettle wox, Zumba, P90X, and Brazilian Butt Lift series. I found that it had some good moves but some segments were done so quick it was hard to catch onto what she was doing. I also found that some of the transitioning between weights and non weights was too quick. I actually strained my left back muscles doing this workout and that has never happened with any of the harder programs. I like changing things up and will do this occasionally but not as often as some of my other programs. Just wasn't impressed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've come to the conclusion...I don't like \\"The Firm\\"!","review":"I work at a public library, so have access to hundreds of exercise DVDs.

But all \\"Firm\\" DVDs suffer from the same flaws....too chaotic, the moves are too complicated with not enough repetition/cuing. I find I'm flailing all over the place trying to keep up with the choreography. Personally, I don't want to have to mentally concentrate that hard when I'm exercising. For those of you who want a really efficient work-out that burns calories/carbs & gives you results....try Jillian Michaels, Jari Love, or \\"Results Fitness in 10 days\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I work out every day usually twice a day and with other home videos such as tae bo amped I can burn over 400 calories in 50 minutes so I thought I would give this one a try.

I am an intermediate exerciser and have been using dvd's to stay in shape for over 12 years. When you are using compound movements with weights the cuing should be accurate, timely, and in sync with the music and the pace of the exercise none of this is true. I would not recommend this dvd for anyone looking for a safe/effective cardio/weight workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"the steps are hard to follow..","review":"steps of this video are complicated it is hard to follow. I only played it onced for about 15-20 mins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love this workout!!","review":"This workout left me dripping with sweat from head to toe.

She is so spastic and it drove me NUTS! I didn't have time to learn what move she was doing before she moved onto the next one. I might have to just watch it several times to learn it but her whole style is just off and annoying to me. I appreciate the quickness of the dvd but not everyone knows the moves right away so when you do the move twice and move on to the next one, you really don't get a chance to do anything at all and it just seems like a big waste of time. Maybe my rating will change once I get it down. I tried to take it back to Walmart and I couldn't so I'm stuck with it. Hopefully it will get better in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fat burning workout!!","review":"I have tried various video workouts that claimed to make you sweat and burn loads of calories, and this one really does the work!! You really get to sweat a great deal and the best part: with the always different movements and combinations you never get bored! However beginners stay away from it! the steps are not really complicated but the instructor goes pretty fast and since most of them require a heavy muscle use, you better not jeark any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, unsafe","review":"The aerobic parts of this workout go so fast, and the music is badly cued with the instructor's voice. You'll see even the back-up girls have a hard time keeping up.I really question who would let this kind of DVD even hit the market. It is so poorly done, and the reps on a lot of the strength exercises are so fast there is no way anyone could do the exercise effectively or properly. A lot of the moves also seem dangerous, flinging around weights in jerky motions."},{"rating":"1","title":"too fast!! catered to fitness experts rather than normal people just trying to lose weight!!","review":"this workout may burn 500 calories, but i couldnt get through the first minute of it. they claim that this workout is ok for beginners, even those new to exercise, and to watch one of the girls for beginner modifications. hah! the camera doesnt even pan to her or anyone long enough to figure out what's going on. and that's not the worst of it. Kelsie assumes we already know all these moves, she goes way too fast, not telling you to change a move until she's already doing this new move!!! plus she switches moves every beat. these moves/steps are nothing new. They're straight from any Kathy Smith video or Slim in 6, which give you the same intensity of workout while demonstrating the moves at pace that is meant for a person trying to lose weight not an exercise professional or personal trainer. RIDICULOUS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"This CD is not for people who are not familiar with the firm. There seems to be a variation of 100 moves at any given moment. I couldn't keep up...not because the workout was hard but the directions and the moves were to many at one time. I used this dvd once and haven't looked by since. I love the idea of a 500 calorie burn workout in one but I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instruction","review":"I found this workout to be very confusing. I am very coordinated, and have been back into exercising for nearly 5 months now so these factors have nothing to do with my review. I bought it with the intention of moving on to a more challenging workout, but what I got was one that was impossible. Kelsie does not explain what she is doing and moves from movement to movement under the assumption that you know what her terminology means. I HATED this dvd and would not recommend it to anyone. I probably won't purchase any firm product at all, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"must be very coordinated","review":"This is my first Firm video so I assume most videos are like this one. I personally find it very hard to follow all the steps. She goes so fast that by the time I figure out what she's doing, she's on to something else. I prefer something a little slower that focuses on form rather than coordination. She doesn't focus much on making sure you're doing it right. I always though I had decent coordination but perhaps not! I also find the instructor super annoying. I can't stand the way she talks and doesn't speak in complete sentences. I feel like she's trying to prove something. After doing this 4 times I don't find it any easier to follow. That being said, the video defenitly makes me sweat and I still feel I'm getting a good workout despite my frusterations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing & waste of money!","review":"I don't consider myself a beginner, but if you have never watched a video with this trainer before, you WILL be lost! I gave up on it less than 10 minutes in, b/c the directions were horrible. She calls out moves without explaining as if you already know what they are, and does things so fast, you have to keep rewinding the video. By the time you've figured out her pattern, she's already into the next move. And that's not exactly what i call a workout. My idea of a great workout dvd is something that anyone could do, never having to feel out of synch w/ the trainer, and still see results. Luckily, I got my refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're not into Step Class, avoid this DVD!","review":"I don't know anything about the Firm, and when I read reviews of this video before I bought it, I saw nothing to indicate that this video was a step routine that assumes you've been in step class your entire life. Maybe it does burn 500(+) calories, but if you can't get the routine down, you won't be burning that much. I tried a few times, but she changes moves SO fast and if you're like me and not very coordinated (and step routines give you trouble) I would avoid this video. I have been doing a Jillian Michaels video, and I find it challenging- and it doesn't require such ridiculous coordination. Apologies to everyone who loves this video... I wish I could be that coordinated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very skimpy","review":"I have sent this item back because it is so skimpy with barely a 2\\" overhang on each side of the bed. I noticed the dimensions were not noted in the description so perhaps that is why. It is listed as a King sized comforter, but it's pretty ungenerous. Will have to look for an oversized comforter.Having said that, the quality does look good, but if you want a generous comforter, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comforter","review":"We love this comforter! It is even nicer than we had hoped - light, incredibly fluffy and super soft. The creamy white cover and edging are beautifully stitched.

I ordered on a Monday and received the package on Thursday - that's what I call great service! I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions Not as Marked","review":"As another reviewer noted this comforter is not a standard size. I ordered the King size for a California King bed which is narrower than a normal King size, so even if it is a little narrower than a regular King comforter it should fit. The tag on the comforter says the finished size is 104\\" X 89\\". Apparently I received one that isn't finished because I measured it as 93\\" X 83\\". It is very soft and fluffy but that doesn't help when it barely covers the bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Review from long time HOMM Fan","review":"I've been playing the Heroes series from I to III. I didn't bother with IV because it had poor reviews and looks terrible.This game is all graphics. It plays painfully slow, and requires you to move the camera around to see anything. The units are cool, but they all have abilities that will take forever to remember what they do. The game comes only with a handful (literally) of maps that only one or two allow you to play the faction of your choice.The combat is the same as Heroes III mostly, though heroes can fight too. It's actually one of the good things of the game.If you want to play a map on HOMM V, expect to spend a few hours as it seems to take forever to play. Oh, you better have a good graphics card and lots o'RAM, cause this game is a resource hog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game, enjoyed alot, but copy protection is an F-","review":"Quite a bit like HoMM3 with graphical and skill improvements. The feel of the game is alright, and while not quite as enjoyable as No. 3 its still very entertaining. Unlike most people I enjoyed No. 4, but this is still a good version of HoMM that you will probably enjoy if you liked the previous titled.The reason I give it 1 star overall is the copy protection. I own the box version of this game. 3/4 of the time I stick it in the drive it asks me to insert the regular disk and not the back up. I absolutely HATE this crap - like that stardock garbage from a few years ago. UBISOFT - if your idiot programmers can't come up with some better version of copy protection then you should stop making games."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GOOD OLD TASTE, in 3D","review":"The game is very similar to Heroes III, with better graphics, good sound and the excellent way of play of the old Heroes, no the confusing Heroes 4.Very few bugs, that will be corrected very soon, the game is very stable.The campaigns are excellent, I am in the middle of the second one, and waiting for expansions...I am a fan from Heros, since the first version (except version 4), this game is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a fan of the older Heroes this probably isn't for you.","review":"As a HUGE fan of Heroes I, II, III and even IV, Heroes V came as a big disapointment to me. For one there is no autosave which was great with the others. The game had great graphics with the factions but I wasn't too thrilled about the creature graphics. I have a big problem about creatures that aren't proportionate. It's ridiculous to have arms and legs that are twice as large as you torso or hands that are bigger than your body. I know this is fantasy but come on. There were also very few maps; hardly enough maps to put out on a game. Overall, I hate the game. If the other Heroes had played like this I would have never have liked them and I've been playing them for 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Most of the negative reviews I've seen note compatibility problems. I have had none. About the only issues I've had is that I tried to install the US 1.1 Patch, not realizing I had bought a Euro version. However, all I had to do was locate the Euro patch and it installed fine. BTW, my computer was high-end about 3 years ago, but I run everything at the highest level and have NO slow-down.Now for my review:(1) At first the 3-D switch bothered me, but it's grown on me. Overall I think it's an improvement over previous incarnations. However, I think this will vary by taste.(2) I don't like how it's hard to see the beautiful details of your units during battle. You have to move the camera back so far to see everything that you miss those details. This is a minor complaint, but...(3) The game is very much like previous HOMM games, with an overall improvement in graphics and GUI.I am quite happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel","review":"First of all i read almost all of the reviews, and what i have to say is this, come on guys its a great game all it needs is more maps.I've been playing the series since HOMM 3 was out, and luckily most of the factor's in this game are taken from HOMM 3.Lots of buildings, skills and creatures are an addition. It's a great game and has the potential to be your favorite for a long time.The graphics are stunning, the cities look great, the battle system is astonishing and the AI are smarter than they were in the previous game.Finally i repeat it's a great game and all it needs is more maps. A must buy if you're a fan of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"HoM&M V","review":"Good overall game.

I was extreamly disappointed with it. I did not like the new graphics, they seemed too cartoony to me. They did away with caravans which I enjoyed in HMM4.

It was smashed . I'm not going to pay them to fix a game they could not make right in the first place . I sent the game back to them with a letter of my own .

And it runs slow as a turtle on my Dell 8600 notebook.My recommendation is to skip it. The 3D worldview is as useless as it gets and Ubisoft does not get it for some reason. They also made Scrabble 3D and it is so damn slow and crappy that I rather play a free version with nothing more than lines and letters than their version. Stuff like that just boggles the mind.

The reasons behind the 'vicious militance' of Islamist Palestinians is never fleshed out in any fair way. A few references here and there but - and I am only part way though the book and reading it only to see if it EVER becomes more objective - the usual cliches are employed (i.e. Islam encourages killing of all infidels) and the Islamists are seen as cruel and evil, killing even their own people.

Raba, Palistinian-born American living in Israel, so timid and weak that she barely has an opinion of her own but has no trouble resorting to stereotypical Arab behavior when pressed.

Not only do you get an all-out blues jam with \\"You're Mean\\" but you also get one of the greatest blues songs of all time with \\"The Thrill Is Gone.\\" This song is what the blues is all about and it sounds wonderful with strings in the background.

Vagrant Grace is an extraordinarily beautiful book, rich in image, narrative, and music. Over the past twenty years David Bottoms has become one of the South's finest writers and has won a number of awards and fellowships for his work. Vagrant Grace marks a real development in the evolution of Bottoms' poetry. From vivid short scenes, he has turned here to longer and more meditative poems, but without losing the narrative power for which he is well known. The result is a spiritual depth hitherto unmatched in his work. The long centerpiece of the book, \\"Country Store and Moment of Grace,\\" which deals with the desegregation of his grandfather's country store, is certainly one of the finest long poems to come out of the American South. This is first-class poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content with Contents","review":"I enjoy the subjects Mr. Bottoms writes about, including the social customs of the American south, the outdoors, family life, but most of the poems seem slack in their language.

I have listened more than 20 different violinists who performed the same concerto. Of course all of them are uniqe and worth listening. However, no one could convey her emotions like she does. I was in love with her playing, then I searched her. Too bad she is married. But the love will be there whenever I listen to her. Get this CD.

It helps a little at the beginning for simple things which you can find on many web sites and the Linux manual (I was lazy to surf around so I bought a book). But, after just two days and my experience and demands about the system grow, this book became obsolete. I totally agree with the other reviewer: whenever I want to know something, I end up somewhere else but not in this book. Its instruction on kernel update is very incomplete, for example. For beginners, its instruction is of little use. No expanation about the specific contents of the kernel files and the strange kernel names. And it explains little about update procedure. I found the missing information very annoying throughout the whole book. It's a book of two-days' value, not worth keeping as a \\"complete\\" reference at all, even for simple things."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about zero stars?!!","review":"This book is anything but complete, including the CD-ROM.

For example, I could not find how to install programs in a .tar.gz format, which just happens to be the majority that programs come in. I do not like rpms and prefer to compile my own programs. When it came time to set up some ftp and apache, the book was almost laughable. It talked about the world wide web and that you can surf it with a program like Netscape, wow!

Why the author chooses to thank Mr. Limbaugh for his \\"excellence in broadcasting\\", has nothing to do with the book or the subject of computer programming.

Like most of the stock characters in this mystery, he's unbelievable, inconsistent, and surprisingly uninteresting. Supposedly he's embezzling church funds and ending an affair with a fiftyish ex-Sister. An old man brags (yes, brags) to Higgins that his divorced daughter is committing adultery, and then is furious that Higgins denies Communion to the woman. Since Higgins is so venal an unbeliever, it's unlikely he'd bother. But the father and daughter are as unbelieving if they think adultery equals a state of grace! The best character is the hated housekeeper, who is consistently described as extremely old after 40 years' service -- she's about 55, having come from Ireland in 1958 as a schoolgirl planning to continue her education. The heroine, Sister Mary Helen, is 78 but not regarded as old. Such odd prejudices provide the only interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter","review":"What can I say.

I think that a 12 song compilation would be enough, and trust me.. it WAS enough. The sound quality on this album is horrible and the songs sound really dated, Patsy is also quite ugly and can't carry a tune. After you're done burning this album, also burn anything by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Loretta Lynn and old Dolly Parton.Instead listen to REAL female country artists like Shania Twain, Taylor Swift, Carie Underwood, Dixie Chicks, Gretchen Wilson, Reba McEntire and Sugarland."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Still Lives On","review":"This album has sold millions of copies, second only I believe to Shania Twains last two albums.

But in fact, she is one of those important performers who transcends genre. \\"12 Greatest Hits\\" contains some truly great songs. Each of Cline's interpretations is a multi-layered, full-bodied performance; you will hear new nuances on repeated listenings.Cline's voice is amazing--smooth as honey, often as sweet, and illuminated with a passionate inner fire. She can sound both heartbroken and ironic in the same song. She truly uses these songs as vehicles by which to express the universal truths of human love and pain.I first got interested in Patsy Cline after seeing the film \\"Coal Miner's Daughter.\\" Beverly D'Angelo turns in a superb supporting performance as Cline in the film. My recommendation? See the film, and then enjoy this disc of classic Cline."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the century's great singers","review":"I'm not a fan of most country music--I find a lot of it manipulative and corny.

Her voice ranks with Billie Holiday's, and very few others as one of the most distinctive, soulful, and beautiful in all of recorded music. The songs here are wonderful, too--a concise collection of country classics. People like Patsy and Hank Williams should be played for everyone who thinks country music is bad.

I've read all but the latest EG and gave credence to the favorable comparisons to PDJ... the only characteristic I found them to have in common was authorship of mystery novels set in England, with a male Scotland Yard protagonist. After finishing this book I missed the characters; going back to it again I enjoyed spending more time with them. After the two PDJ books, I still have no clue what it's like to be Adam Dalgliesh. Perhaps my love of Jane Austen explains my desire to understand a novel's characters, and have the author show me what their world looks like through their eyes. EG does this for me: often showing how the same event looked different to Lynley & Havers. Illuminating the perils of false perceptions - not just that they happened, but showing us *why* - is what makes a book timeless and, I think, bodes well for history's judgement of Ms. George."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspector Lynley and Havers' first case together","review":"I just read this first of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley mysteries in order to compare it to the BBC television version, which was shown in the US on PBS's \\"Mystery.\\" It is more complex than the movie, even though the movie was allotted 2 90-min. episodes instead of one. Also, it is a more harrowing experience than the movie, which considerably softened the story for tv. George's writing is top-notch. I found the scenarios hard to digest, emotionally, even though I thought I knew what was coming, more or less. Despite the difficult motivation for the crime(s), I am already into the series' next book, without my vision being colored by the companion tv movie. That can wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling mystery!","review":"When I started my mystery genre binge, I decided to do a little research to find out what British mystery series (I did want to start a series) rated highest amongst critics and readers. Inevitably, Elizabeth George's Inspector Lyndley series ranked amongst the highest. So I started with this novel, the first in the series, and was most assuredly not disappointed. Both Inspector Lyndley and his partner, Barbara Havers, are wonderfully complex characters, each with their own baggage and their own brilliance. The story was just gritty enough (but as over-the-top as the Scandinavian thriller writers tend to be!) to keep me interested, but George certainly focuses on her characters, which is a must if you are writing a series. All in all, I can understand what the hype is about....I enjoyed the novel thoroughly and immediately bought the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Deliverance","review":"I am an anglophile. I LOVE British TV, Music, Movies and especially, British books. Maybe it's my heritage or just an affinity for their culture. So, when EW listed an Elizabeth George book on their Summer Must Read List, I was intrigued. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this is a BBC show(YAY!) but also written by a Yank! I am amazed just how British this book sounded for a gal writing from the States. The language was spot on. The scenary was impeccable. I had no trouble imagining fog drifting in over the countryside. There were no false notes. The characters had depth. I especially liked Havers's passion. Excellent job, Ms. George."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Deliverance","review":"In this writing, \\"A Great Deliverance\\", Elizabeth George has given us two unforgetable characters, Inspector Thomas Linsley, and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers. The two together work as a team as they try to solve the mystery of the beheaded farmer and his confessed killer, his daughter Roberta, whom all who know her do not think her capable of the deed.George has developed two totally different characters, one is a debonair, elegant, aristocratic individual who reeks of the cosmopolitan, and the second as a fat, homely, ill-clothed country bumpkin. Each totally different in appearance and action from the other, but reflective of the trademark character George wants to create. The mystery is set in the English farming countryside and is not too complicated, even when one is slightly distracted by \\"asides\\" in the plot which appear unrelated to the solving of this gruesome crime. A good read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great deliverance from lackluster reading!","review":"I have much enjoyed watching these two detectives on PBS' Mystery series. In fact, I believe I have seen this very story. But of course there is nothing that can compare with the written word.....even in ebooks form! This is wonderfully written with lusciously drawn characters and gloriously painted settings. I was laughing tears over the American couple; in fact, I'm sure that we know them! I do appreciate the reviewer who suggested starting with this first book, even though it supposedly isn't really necessary......now I'm ready for another. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"British Delight","review":"This book takes place in England with all British characters, yet it is written by an American. Elizabeth George did a great job creating this world of Scotland Yard with interesting cops, one from the British aristocracy in Inspector Lynley, and one from the working class in Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers. The story is compelling, though not fast paced. The characters have great depth and each one is well drawn and fascinating. George creates a setting, plot, and characters which all come together to form a work of art in her first novel, A Great Deliverance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Deliverance","review":"Very well written with excellent character development. I enjoyed the setting in England. Ii will definitely read another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Too Graphic","review":"I've been upset about this book for a week now and I'd like to warn others regarding its content. Let me skip to the point: this book dramatizes child abuse. I read the first 90% of the book thinking how well the author did especially when it came to conveying emotions and portraying strong situations without using scuzzy descriptions. And then I got to the end and she dedicated 4 or 5 pages to describing violent child abuse of the worst kind. I did not read these pages after I realized what was going on but skipped page after page after page only seeing briefly if it was over yet. I obviously was so angry that I hope you understand when I tell you I threw the book away! I'd never want my step-daughter or my sons or my mom or anyone to come across this book in my house and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One her best","review":"I read the last book first and now I read the first book. It is a page turner and the characters are well drawn and I particularly liked the main detectives and the sketches of jolly old england. The one thing I do not like about George's books is the endings and that probably will prevent me from reading them all. They most always involve incredibly sadistic sexual things done to children and that turns me off reading more of them. Since George is a former school teacher, one wonders about the meaning of her facination with abusing children in an extremely painful and sexual way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start","review":"I am devouring Elizabeth George's series starring Detective Lynley and his cohort Barbara Havers. I started with some of George's more recent books and realized that you really should read them in the order they were written, so I bought \\"A Great Deliverance\\". It is not as good a read as subsequent books in her series but in my opinion it is a necessity to read and read first. It will help you develop the characters in your mind and thus help you understand them later.What if you have already read her more recent books? Should you skip it? Absolutely not, it is well written and entertaining and it will help you understand Lynley and Haver's relationship and how it developed in to the well oiled machine it is in later novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Debut -- And what a debut it is","review":"This is the first book in the Lynley-Havers series and it is truly an amazing debut novel. Lynley, who is known for his female conquests as much as he is for his great detecting skills, is paired up with Havers. Havers is pretty much assigned to him since the heads at Scotland Yard pretty much know that he won't sleep with her given her position in life and her physical state (she's not the greatest looking thing in the world).Havers doesn't take well to Lynley's leadership. In fact, she resents it. The entire thing is complicated by the fact that the leading suspect isn't speaking. Not just to them but to anyone. Havers needs to prove herself to Lynley and Lynley needs to learn how to work with his new compatriot.This is truly a great debut novel that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery read","review":"This first book is interesting and well-written. I am going right on to the next to see how the characters develop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good on a second read","review":"This is my second time reading it and I still was a fabulous read. I suppose people either love or hate Elizabeth George. I love her and find her characters interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that so great","review":"I am a huge fan of mystery novels and this book was my first Elizabeth George novel. I was extremely let down. I thought the pace of the book was extremely slow and the plot was too simplified. Granted, there is a nice twist at the end, but thats it. I also thought one of the main characters, Barbara, was annoying and stereotypical. I know there are a lot of people who love this series, so maybe it gets much better.

This is not an uncommon trait for fans, I have found, regardless of make and model. The plastic parts require trimming to get them to fit. The telescoping bushing is irreversibly jammed. At least it's pretty inexpensive. I would be willing to pay more for higher quality, but as I've said, these problems seem to be universal--of the three fans I have bought over the last several years, every single one has had material defects, and one developed an electrical problem which forced me to throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"running since I put together","review":"Well a fan is a fan, right? Well I put it together for my wife, and she turned it on next to her side of the bed, since she is so hot. Finally found a way to cool her off.The fan has been running for over a month now, non-stop. Makes a nice, soothing, humming sound that is a not intrusive when sleeping.I am not giving it 5 stars only because of the fact that when assemblying this fan, the components seem to be a little \\"dinky\\" or, in other words, cheaply made. But if it lasts like I expect, at the price I paid, then I will consider it to be a 5 star fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damp Rid","review":"Works well at absorbing the moisture out of the air and a way better deal than the other Damp Ride products.

It also has a lot of vibration which also makes it seem unsafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not White","review":"This Lasko #2526 fan is GREY, not White. The box and all pictures show a bright optic white fan, but it's a dull grey; not even a greyish-white...it's a definite dull grey.

Grey is not what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fan for the price","review":"Good solid fan for the price. As others have mentioned, the screen guarding the fan is plastic, but it is solid, heavy plastic, so it should last without problems. The action is smooth, and the fan is relatively quiet. Overall, the quality seems significantly better than the fan that it replaced, even though the older fan had a metal screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"This fan is a little cheap, but I can't help but love it for how much it cost. It blows air- what more can you ask for? I bought it because my bathroom could get hot in the summertime and nobody wants to do their makeup while they're sweating. It did the job. Again, it's not super sturdy or large, but it works just fine. I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purrs","review":"We use a fan for sleeping at night (I am ashamed to admit this wasteful consumption of electricity, but there it is). It has a very nice, even sound to it, is loud enough, but doesn't put out a hurricane's worth of wind. Kind of a back-handed compliment for a fan, I guess. But as a sleeping fan, top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Snap on Front Grill","review":"When assembling this fan, everything kind of puts together, except for the front grill. It is alarming that the neck doesn't actually snap in with the pole, instead it just kind of rests on top. So if anyone picked it up, the whole thing would fall apart. Also the front grill is impossible to snap on because the grill itself is crooked and doesn't correspond with the snap holes. I'm going to see if the manufacturer can send me a new front grill because with this one I only managed to snap a few of the snap points, with the rest of them being unable to (because the provided hole does not correspond with the snap). Next time I'll buy a little more expensive of a fan that is better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"The Lasko fan was delivered very quickly and was easy to assemble. It moves the air very well and is reasonably quiet at high speed. At the lower speeds, sound is virtually undetectable. The price is more than fair.As a previous poster pointed out, the pictures show the fan to be white, but it is, in fact, grey. This does not matter to us, as it is used in a large master bathroom suite where there is no air movement when the house is closed up for air conditioning, but it may make a difference to others and should be noted."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Shame","review":"It's a shame all the Ugag fans are not at a high enough reading level to make it through this book.Plus they would rather spend their money on camoflauge overalls and lawyers to cover up the athletic indiscretions"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible journalistic talent","review":"This guy makes me want to puke.

The case becomes VERY heavy with the chips inside it, and its large square size makes it awkward to carry in any other way other than by the handle.Therefore, to me the handle is a key feature that lamentably cannot be trivialized as suggested by other fellow reviewers.It was the primary reason why I returned the set.A secondary reason is that the price is not exactly a \\"bargain\\". After going to a local sporting store, I found a 500-chip set for less than half the price of this set - and that one included dealer buttons and 2 card sets. So I bought 2 of them. Yes I now have to haul 2 cases, but they're infinitely sturdier and saved good money by buying a set with dealer buttons and cards already included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful in What to Buy","review":"I have tried several Puppy Pads and OUT! is out in my book.

So I went to a local record store to take a look, and \\"Take it home\\" was the only tape available at the time (I didn't have a record player at the time). I ended up purchased the tape but later on was a little bit disappointed that the tape didn't contained a lot of fast guitar solo licks by Mr. King. Anyhow, as I listened to the tape, and after awhile the music growth in me, so I find myself keep coming back to listen to it over and over again. Then in the early 90's I lost the tape in a move, and never found it again. Anyhow, recently I have been collecting vinyl LPs and I have never find this record for the 3 years I have been collecting vinyl's. Then one day this record turned up in my local used record shop and I just about wetting my pant.

The thing loves to take nose dives and it's easy to stall. The small battery on the plane takes a long time to charge and depletes very fast -maybe 5-10 minutes of crashing time before you need to recharge from the EIGHT D-Cell batteries in the clunky charging station! This thing was recalled due to an over-charging/ over heating hazard so it can't be found except on old store shelves now anyway.

The plane looks very good and the ability to practice the controls while the plane is locked onto the charging stand is great. It took a few times to get the plane airborne. Throwing the plane level really makes a difference. Once the plane was in the air it was a blast. My 7-year-old son was soon able to do loops and barrel rolls with ease, as long as there was little to no wind.The main drawback to this toy unfortunately is a major one. The foam material used is not nearly as durable as advertised. I specifically flew this toy on a golf course to ensure if it crashed it would not strike any trees or hard surfaces. After only 4-5 flights pieces of foam broke off the wing tips and the tail section was breaking in half!Lots of fun but not very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"The Easter Bunny brought this plane for our son.

On the negative side, however, it takes forever to be absorbed into my skin, and leaves an oily feeling like that of suntan oil. This lasted for at least 10 minutes until I rubbed and rubbed and rubbed to get it to absorb into my skin. I don't feel that the product helped my dry skin and even made it feel dryer, as opposed to other products I've been using for severe dry skin. I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lotion around","review":"I have had a amputation on my foot and my foot doctor had gave me a sample of this lotion ( an I have very dry skin ) and this is the only one I have found in 2 years that would work and believe me I have tried everything.

I bought this lotion at the store a week ago and after using it for just a few days, my arms look so much better. I'm hoping if I continue to use it, the KP will go away completely. So far, it's the only thing that has helped this condition.

Unfortunately, it makes the inflammation worse. While it (perhaps) may be good for Keratosis Pilaris Alba (the type of KP that doesn't have redness on/around the bumps), it worsens my type of KP since it inflames the skin. Produced a rash on my arms that put me through itchy, painful, burning hell for a week. It hurt my skin so bad.On a positive note: Good moisturizer though. Just worthless treatment for KP.What a waste of much needed money and hope for a cure for this darned skin ailment! :o("},{"rating":"2","title":"Dermatologist recommended, Me approved","review":"My dermatologist recommended I use this lotion for extremely dry skin. (I don't have any other skin conditions, so please keep that in mind if you are considering using this product for a specific issue other than dry skin.)I've been using it twice a day for about 5 days and am totally impressed with the results. My skin was VERY dry and VERY itchy, and this lotion has completely eliminated those symptoms. My skin feels great, and I'm not constantly itching and fidgeting!My only complaint is that the lotion is tacky when applied.

I have a VERY mild form of CIE, mind you, but I still have very dry, flaky skin head to foot. Amlactin had a sour smell to it (from the amino acids), making me wonder if others could smell it, and I was still dry and used Cetaphil *BLESS THE CREATORS OF CETAPHIL* after applying it to make sure my skin wasn't flaking. Also, Amlactin stung REALLY BAD when I applied it. Do NOT apply where you just shaved, you will try to escape from your own skin and fail. AND IT'S EXPENSIVE. Honestly, stick with Cetaphil. I get disappointed every time I stray away from out 15 year relationship for some hot flashy new moisturizing product. Fortunately, Cetaphil always takes me back.

After my first use, the ammonia smell was too much to bear....it cut clear through my clogged nasal passages (I have a really bad cold). Perhaps I should have known this ammonia scent would happen since ammonium lactate is the 2nd listed ingredient...but for some reason, I did not review the ingredients list so it didn't even occur to me. This lotion is so very expensive that I expected something different. Due to the very prominent ammonia smell, I couldn't in good conscience recommend this to anyone. Surely there is a more pleasant way to exfoliate and moisturize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Expected","review":"I had such high hopes for this lotion.

The solutions are not very intuitive, and there are often few if any clues leading to the solution. Without spoiling anything, let me just say that you need to be patient...VERY patient...not just with yourself but with the puzzles themselves (i.e., be prepared to do nothing at times).

Now with path of the shell you can't even get to a puzzle without total frustration.Example; You have to over and over again try to figure out how to jump from a rock to a place where some sort of puzzle is and this is only known from reading the walkthrough. It isn't fun and in contrast to the relaxing sounds and scenery, one simply gives up out of exhaustion and humiliation.

I think it is logical to assume that anybody who knows how to tie his own shoes--let alone a \\"gentleman\\" seeking to improve his appearance--knows this information.In addition, the last six charters of the book should be excluded. They are not related to a gentleman's appearance; they relate to his etiquette and are imported--as page fillers--from Mr. Greenleaf's other frivolous book: \\"A Gentleman's Guide to Etiquette.\\"The only good thing about my experience reading this book is that it didn't waste more than one hour of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!

Repeated washings have not removed the smell. I will have to dispose of the underwear. I am extremely allergic to anything perfumed or scented.

The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching. Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them! I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings. Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent.

I have them on for about 5 or 10 minutes before I notice \\"the smell\\". By then, it is a pain to go and change them. I now put the smelly ones in a separate drawer from the others.

They speculated that maybe the scent was being used in a particular manufacturing location, when it shouldn't have been, but the scent is there, regardless of manufacturing location. I should note that this is a strong scent that CANNOT be washed out easily---but can take over 10 washings; the scent also gets on other items in one's drawer!!

I've taken a few pictures, the batteries that came with the camera are still fine. I did get rechargable though lol. The camera works if you don't have a ton of light, but I still reccomend a pretty well lit area, as any camera you get will need light. As for the user a few reviews down, I have Windows XP and the software works perfect with it, as does the camera.

The video and sound quality is unbelievably high quality. The software is very easy to use. I was amazed how easy it was to remove red eye from previous pictures taken from my fugi film camera. I have not experienced red eye with this camera, but if I do the software will remove it very easily. The body looks cheap but it feels sturdy when you hold it. It has so many features that come in higher priced cameras, the bang for the buck is what counts for me. Cons I don't like the USB under the flemsy plastic flap. This same flap conceals the a/v out and SD card. The less I have to open that flimsy plastic flap the better. Other than that all is good to go. I would definitely recommend this camera to family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This was my first digital camera purchase and I could not have chosen a better buy.

I would suggest buying an SD (Secure Digital) card and extra batteries to get more pictures from your camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"best camera ever!","review":"This was my first digital camera and I could not be any happier!

I must say, for the years that I've owned it, there is absolutely no excuse for the lack of battery life. In the beginning everything was working fine. This camera has sustained about a good month of use throughout the years. It is greatly disappointing to learn that my camera is suffering a slow demise, despite the limited use. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! There have been far too many sporting events that have been ruined just because I couldn't record a homerun at a baseball game, or capture a slam dunk at a basketball game.

He hikes constantly, and is in the local Allegheny Search and Rescue group, as well as Scoutmaster. So he needs a camera with him that can go on his belt and take pictures that can automatically be referred to. I bought him this camera a couple of years ago, and it has proven to be an excellent buy. Not only does it take fairly good pictures, but it is easy to use, and is lightweight enough to carry on his belt. When clambering down mountains looking for idiot Scouts who fell because they went where they were not supposed to go, he needs something lightweight. It also allows those professionals to see original pictures of how people landed, and where they were, so they can accurately treat them. My husband still wants the more expensive Nikon, but that will be for his own nature photography.Good buy...Karen Sadler"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to take fun pictures!","review":"This is the second digital camera i have owned, but so much easier to use.

The cover and the inside may look cool, but the graphics are not near as good as they say they are, the gameplay is the WORST in any game I have ever played.

I would not recommend it. Yes, our system is grounded and we still have had mother board issues. Another negative - the salt water kills grass if you ever have a problem with the pool water and need to eliminate it as we did when the mother board went out again.

This is a man who has devoted his life to science and is not afraid to give his opinions on what is wrong with today's society, and, more importantly, how these problems might be solved.I was personally very impressed with his first chapter. It is something that I would highly recommend to most young and developing scientists.

Kendall has also managed to describe the man and his time, like a tapestry giving the reader a real sense of the era.Very well written and researched. He details the flaws in the centuries long propaganda campaign of the Tudors, without arguing in favour of Richard.Originally released in 1955 with several re-releases up to 2002, this remains the most readable Richard and a must read for anyone trying to understand the times and get a feel of the real man. There have been descoveries and debates since this was written but it remains a very \\"real\\" and readable biography of the man, the most maligned English monarch to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"This brilliant biography was first published in 1955, but it stands the test of time. It is pro Richard which some people may count as a negative, but I don't. It is balanced and impeccably researched with extensive notes and use of primary sources.

As a Tony Robbin's fan, this has to be one of the worst projects he has done. The depth he usually gains in most of his projects is non-existent here. I was very disappointed. He has tried to cram so much information into such a small amount of time that I kinda felt that this should have been free to get people to learn more about his system.

[Why some of these people have waited a year or more before writing a review is something of a mystery. ;) ]So, you might want to ask yourself \\"Did Robbins get where he is by reading books?\\"Not on your life. He went and got NLP training with Richard Bandler, then toddled off and started selling his own version of Bandler's ideas.This book is poorly written, far longer than the amount of useful information can justify, and gives a highly misleading impression of what NLP is all about.So, if you really want to help fill the Robbins coffers, by all means buy this book.If you want to really understand NLP I'd suggest you do fresh searches on NLP and on Richard Bandler.

Halevy was also Israel's ambassador to Jordan and very instrumental in brokering the peace agreement with Jordan.I found the book rather tiresome with a great deal of muted self-glorification and almost no revelations or juicy bits.

The book has a melodramatic flare, perhaps due to the era it was written: Nearly every day of their 3 years is fraught with high seas, gales, pounding surf, murderous locals, malarial mosquitoes or killer ticks entirely covering their bodies -- and always a crafty or miraculous escape (except from malaria). Although there are respites describing friendly, hospitable \\"natives\\" they meet along the way, this was a disappointment after reading their later Quest for the Lost City, a better-written book in which they describe how they walked and camped from San Diego to southern Mexico and then spent month upon month exploring the jungles bordering Mexico and Guatemala."},{"rating":"2","title":"a relevant classic","review":"I found a first edition of this book at a thrift store and have really enjoyed it.

And in his collected stories are some of the classics of the form, stories like \\"A Clean Well- Lighted Place\\" and \\" In Another Country\\" . These stories so clear in their telling, so seemingly simple and powerful in their language and dialogue give a moving picture of the very limited Hemingway hero, in all his grace under pressure, and his love of code- like heroic action that redeems when no words can.The stories are far more rich and varied than my words indicate.

It is like she is writing the same story over and over again, just less effectively with each subsequent book. It has taken me two weeks and I have yet to complete this book.

This book at times made me wonder what characters were speaking and plot twist jumped in so fast that it was sometime confusing. Alexis and Telford gave us what we wanted in the end - their togetherness but getting there was a little bumpy!

The book is fairly predictable but the great writing and the intriguing and likeable heroine make for an exciting time.

This might have made a pretty good one-shot comic book, but the rather thin premise is barely enough to sustain a short six-issue series. It's occasionally pretty funny, and I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it did make me laugh a few times, but otherwise, it seemed to me that there just wasn't much else there. A lot of the gags are very repetitive, and I got tired of the running gag about the rather limited vocabulary of the Rifle Brigade pretty quickly. I can accept that this is a comedy and not anything resembling a serious war comic, but I didn't think it delivered in that department.Fans of Garth Ennis may like this book, but people who mainly know him as the writer of Preacher (which even had a better Nazi villainess!) might be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading item description, only 11 wrenches","review":"I had two problems with my order of this wrench set.First of all, the description is misleading. It says that it is a 12 piece wrench set WITH rack. But the 12th item IS the rack, there are only 11 wrenches included. The description should either read: '11 piece set with rack' or '12 piece set INCLUDING rack'. The rack is really flimsy and practcally useless by the way but I wasn't planning on using it anyway.The second problem was that the packaging arrived broken and only 10 wrenches were in the box. The 5/16\\" was missing. Hopefully this particular problem was an isolated incident but I am waiting to hear back from the seller (Midway) to send me the missing wrench.So, I searched on Amazon for a 12 piece wrench set to fill the 12 pocket wrench roll case in my car and got only 10 wrenches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Christ Superstar","review":"The first time I heard the music was watching the movie when it first came out. I was on a submarine transiting from Faslane, Scotland to Halifax, Nova Scotia for a liberty rest after a Northern Atlantic patrol.We (the crew) almost wore the sprockets off the 16mm version copy.

I found the record one day when looking through my parents collection, I immediatly fell in love with it. When my birthday came around I asked for it, and was given the movie soundtrack. After hearing a few notes come out of Ted Neeley's Jesus, I had to shut it off. I was used to a storng powerful portrayl of Jesus, instead I heard a passive attempt of a role that could be so much more, if you want this musical, buy the original concept recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better. By a lot.","review":"I've listened to this CD and I own the LD of the movie. IMHO, the casting could have been greatly improved. While I found Judas and Caiaphas pretty good, Ted Neeley made a rather wimpy JC, totally ruining one of my favourite songs from the show, Gethsamene. At times he seems to be screaming like a woman! If you want to hear it as it *should* be heard, go buy, beg, borrow or steal a copy of Michael Crawford's (yes, he of Phantom fame) CD \\"Michael Crawford performs Andrew Lloyd Webber.\\" Trust me, it's worth it for track 7 alone, where he does the most incredibly emotive, anguished rendition of Gethsamene. It will bring tears to your eyes, and a new appreciation for the song. I never thought much of the song until I heard Crawford sing it-he really opened my eyes up to it's beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Original Soundtrack Recording","review":"I am not sure which is worse: the atricious sound quality of this version of the soundtrack or Ted Neely. Let me just say that I am a huge fan of JCS. Huge. If you truly enjoy the music, I'd strongly recommend purchasing the 1996 remastered version of the 1970 original album.This version of the soundtrack sounds very flat. I agree with the reviewer who said they got better sound quality off of their old LP.Ted Neely replaces (or tries to replace) a wholly superior Ian Gillan as Jesus. Neely screeches and over-emotes on virtually ever song. Gillan (the lead singer of Deep Purple) is a hard act to follow, and Neely just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! These are not the original versions","review":"Warning, warning Will Robinson! These are not the original recordings of Jesus Christ Superstar that were released on Decca records in 1970. All are, what I would call, cheesy remakes. As others have said, the production and quality is lacking on this version. The lyrics might be the same, but the original powerful music production, arrangements and singing are sadly lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different - Yet Very Familiar","review":"First of all, you should buy the original and listen to the hell out of it. I spent my youth riding around in my dad's car with the 8-track plugged in quite a bit. Then, buy the movie version (this one) and listen to it. At first, you'll hate it. Give it a chance though, because you will learn to love it in a completely different way. It amazes me. I bought this one in the early nineties and then listened to the original again (after a ten year break). They are so different -- especially the movie version's Ted Neely as Jesus. Yvonne Elliman is in both and she is amazing. Carl Anderson (Judas) will make you lay back and wonder why God gave him that voice and not you because it has to be so cool to be able to sing like him. So much emotion - depth - and voice. He is INCREDIBLE! Incredible! You can't go wrong by buying this because it really will be a whole different experience from the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pityfull recording quality","review":"This album sounds very interesting, and as far as I've been able to listen to it, the music itself can be great. BUT the quality of the recording is so awful that I coudn't listen at it as I would have liked to. This really is a pity. If you like clean sounds, don't buy this CD.BTW there are no lyrics included. At this price, it hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched recording - awful mixing of vocals and orchestra","review":"Just purchased this CD and believe it to be a re-mastered recording from the original sound track. I had purchased the original LPs years ago and was very pleased with the recording. The new CD is just awful in poor mixing of vocals, particularly the chorus and instruments for several tracks. The worst include disc 1/track 9 \\"Simon Zealates\\", disc 2/track 1 \\"The Last Supper\\", and disc 2/track 7 \\"Could We Start Again\\". It's just very sloppy and quite awful recording engineering. MCA/Universal should be ashamed to put its name on this. It's a shame because the singers, especially Ted Neely, Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elleman put their hearts into this film production and Andre Previn's conducting of the score was first rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, Horribly Mixed","review":"I am no audiophile but, Jesus Christ Superstar, what were they thinking when they remixed this CD reissue? Those who did this deserve to be crucified! The cassette tapes I bought the soundtrack on in the 80s sound way better. Lucky I kept them."},{"rating":"2","title":"For He gave His only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ","review":"Truly, this man was innocent...This album is one Rock Version to those who want to know Christ, but, don't want to sing in Country or whatever.

Ted Neely, sings the vocal lead as a true Rock Star, fortunately it was for our LORD. Get this one, folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best musical in the world!","review":"Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice are amazing! I have listened to this ten million times in five different recordings and I love them all! This particular recording's strong points are that it has Ted Neely, my favorite for Jesus, and Carl Anderson, my favorite for Judas. It also has \\"Could We Start Again, Please?\\" and \\"Then We Are Decided\\" which are only on the soundtrack recording. Joshua Mostel isn't the best singer as King Herod and the sound gets kind of funny during the 40 lashes though. If I were you, I would buy this soundtrack recording and the original broadway cast recording (I have both). That way you get the good parts from both. I hope you love it as much as I do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best version of Superstar","review":"The roles of Jesus and Judas on this album are played by the Broadway UNDERSTUDIES. Ben Vereen added Motown soul and original interpretation to the role of Judas, while here Carl Anderson provides a second-best performance. Ted Neeley sings in a manner that will either make you love him or hate him. The dramatic pauses in his singing may have worked well with visuals, but do not make for extraordinarily fluid listening.Also, the sound quality of this album is some of the worst I've ever heard. Sadly, the original Broadway cast soundtrack is available only in Japan, so the best available version of Superstar to buy is the 1970 original concept.This was the fourth Jesus Christ Superstar album to be released, following the original concept album (Gillan/Head 1970), the original Broadway cast (Fenholt/Vereen 1971), and the original London cast (Nicholas/? 1972)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Christ Superstar movie soundtrack","review":"As a young teenager I had this double album and had memorized all the songs. I have not heard the music since the mid seventies and wanted to hear it all again. While listening to it, I found new meaning in the lyrics that did not occur to me in the past. I thought the music and lyrics to be refreshing, uplifting, and still good old rock 'n roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more thing!","review":"I had purchased the original London cast recording, and after I heard it I was not too happy. I compare recordings by my favorite song \\"Gethsemane (I Only Wanted to Say)\\". I was so disgusted that I gave it away to my cousin and bought this album! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best there is!","review":"I agree with everyone who had reviewed this recording. It is the only one to have a listen to over and over again! I heard the 1996 London Cast and they're not too bad, but this blows it away! Ted Neeley is remarkable! Being a loyal Lloyd Webber fan you've got to get this! (better than the current cast in NYC). Happy Listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"70s Music Lovers Dream","review":"You have to watch the video of the original musical that this was recorded to get a real connection but there is no doubt that this is beautiful music. I love love love 70s music, listening to my mother's old records, I couldn't get enough of it. This stuff is like chocolate to me, so rich. The guitars and chorus, and melodic repeating rifs are so beautifully placed together. I highly recommend to fellow music lover's and anyalists alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of Jesus Christ Superstar and feel that the movie version is the best of all. This is the soundtrack of the movie and it does not do any justice to the movie at all. The quality of the CD is terrible! There really needs to be a re-recording and reissue because this is inexcusable.If you are a fan of the movie like me, then other than watching the movie, this soundtrack is the only choice, but do not let the five star reviews fool you. You will be disappointed.If this is going to be your first introduction to Jesus Christ Superstar then please do yourself a favor, skip this CD and get the DVD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst remaster ever?","review":"For the DVD version I would give this a 5-star rating. However, as others have pointed out, this 'remaster' actually sounds worse than the original 1974 vinyl version! Everything sounds like it was recorded in a tin can, and there is an annoying silence inserted between every track for no apparent reason other than to ruin the flow of the album. What were they thinking? The way they treated this great music borders on offensive. If you want to hear how this music *should* sound, get the DVD or even VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ted Neely is THEE Superstar","review":"I have listened to every soundtrack album and this one is by far the most superior. Ted Neely is superb as are his supporting cast. If you loved the movie, buy this soundtrack version. The London recordings just don't have the correct lyrical phrasing. Judas is also a strength of the album with such power and vigor. I am addicted to this CD! I love Ted Neely!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This sure beats Broadway...","review":"When this came out on broadway last year I was so excited to see it, but after I saw it on the Tony awards the modernization of it drew me away. This CD is remarkable. Ted Neeley is terrific! I judge my JCS recordings by my favorite song \\"I only wanted to say\\". And Ted Neeley rocks! The entire cast is awesome! This is the only recording to have! I also recommend to have the movie to go with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music from a tin can","review":"This is the poorest recording of this production I have ever heard. I can't believe I spent this much money on it. I would have been musically better off ordering the DVD instead of the MP3. The sound quality is horrible. It sounds muffled and tinny, like it was recorded in a box. It's pretty bad when the sound quality of the original vinyl, scratches and all is preferable to the sound of a digital recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Magdalene????","review":"I have the newest version of the Jesus Christ Superstar performance with Glenn Carter, and I must say that it's exceptionally better. Even though it lacks \\"This Jesus Must Die\\" and a couple of other songs (which by the way I'm very mad about!), Mary Magdalene played by Renee Castle does SUCH a better job than the MM from the 1973 version! Talk about one huge yawn! Also, Ted Neely looks possessed in this film. Sorry, but Glenn is so believable and Ted is just plain scary to me! I think that the newer version is all around improved, and after seeing both films, let's just say that a newer version was quite in need. I admire the originality of this film, but the 2000 version is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"delicious","review":"bought these during travel in Germany, glad to see they are available here, but they are a bit pricey here"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asbach","review":"All I can say is yummie,lecker lecker, make sure to put them in the fridge taste better cold.

What, nothing else comes to mind Brian?The only plus of this book is the sharp colors, and the art isn't bad (it's not notably good either).Avoid this, and read some of the past classic Spidey tales, and not Bendis' efforts at ruining the Spiderman saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book with excellent dialogue","review":"The Ninth Configuration, actually based on an earlier Blatty novel, Twinkle, Twinkle Killer Kane which I never read is a very good book. It is one of the few cases where the movie (written and directed by Mr. Blatty) is actually better. The movie is out of this world. The book is short and is mostly dialogue-which is excellent and funny in nature. But because of that I think it translates better on film. I recommend both the book and the film.

I have a new Nvidia 8800 GTS video card, and the game won't even launch with it, so be advised not to buy this until there's another patch that fixes the issues. And even if you don't have an G 80 series video card, I would really recommend searching the internet and support forums to see if if people with hardware similar to yours are having problems.

The game is exceptionally fun to play, with great graphics and excellent stealth play alongside a well-thought storyline. The BUGS, however, are too much! The game crashes each time a new level loads. At one point it required a complete reinstall, because after one of the crashes it just wouldn't fire up anymore. Save games get overwritten without notice. The \\"Quick OPSAT\\" button is buggy. Once I hit reload on my weapon, and lost all weapon functionality entirely - couldn't shoot, couldn't reload, couldn't put the weapon away. These bugs bring my overall review from 5 stars to 2... which is a complete shame. My friend has it on xbox 360 and it's a stellar experience, showing what kind of quality title it *could* have been.

Known bug, check the net.Character response time is SLOW. Tried training missions, can't see anything as they are artistic all white rooms with really bad wireframe wall definitions.I'm literally thinking of throwing this game in the trash.

Frame lag, broken save game module, periodic crashes, by a company that should be renamed Ubstupid for releasing an untested game like this. If you can work around the mess, it's a fairly enjoyable game but the negs really take away alot of the pleasure in playing it. You never know whether or not the game was going to die altogether. I made it to the end, but not without headaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splintering Action","review":"Great Game, a great addition to the series. Invovled story line in which your choices have a visible effect.

Yeah, it's kind of console-feeling...but there are more moves, more toys and gadgets, and is just a blast to play. The graphics are outstanding and the AI still could use some work, as usual, but the environments are completely immersive and are very well done and the gameplay is just great.

I have patched the game and updated every driver in my system but the game hangs and I have yet to be able to finish it or get past the point on the ocean liner. It is complete and utter waste of money. They have stopped patching the game at this point and are advertising the next Splinter Cell game already, as if I want to play another game that is total garbage, I can't even finish this one! I won't purchase another Tom Clancy licensed game EVER and Ubisoft will be very lucky if I ever purchase another game with thier name on it either.

When I bought it, I had to upgrade my video card so that it would support Shader 3.0 (The game doesnt look that fine trust me, it would have run on 2.0 perfectly, developers are just alienating 2.0 users). Anyway, after upgrading to a really expensive video card, I had great expectations, I mean, a game that has 3.0 shader as a MINIMUM system requirement has to look awesome right? well no, it looks exactly like any other game I ever played on my 2.0 Shader card. On top of that, the game is buggy as hell and really boring when compared with the other Splinter Cell Titles. My final recommendation? get those bills you were going to use to pay for it and burn them, much more fun in that than this stupid game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other Splinter Cells","review":"The problem with this game is that UBIsoft forgot what made Splinter cell so fun. Namely, you had two dissimilar teams (a spy and a mercenary). Each team had strengths and weaknesses. Double Agent took all that away.This game is no better than a shoot em up game. There is no strategy involved anymore. UBIsoft should have just taken their earlier offering \\"Splinter Cell:Chaos Theory\\" and done some minor tweeks, like making a 8 person multiplayer (vs the current 4).I returned Double Agent a week after I bought it. Don't waste your time on Double Agent. If you want a shoot em up game, get Rainbow 6, or Call of Duty. If you want a great stealthy, strategy game, buy Chaos Theory.

In addition to the terrible design, it took me an entire day to get the brakes and wheels adjusted properly. The wheels were way out of true and the brakes would not align properly at all. I finally got it to an acceptable point with the wheels and brakes when we realized the pedals hit the tire.The bike seems to have the mongoose name, while the manual said Pacific.

You get what you pay for I guess, because this thing is junk. Every pre-assembled piece had to be taken apart and re-installed correctly.

After killing a couple hours getting the rear derailleur fixed I moved on to adjusting the front derailleur.. The front derailleur had alot of play in it and when I tried to adjust the screws I realized that the excess play was allowing the screws to slip behind the adjustment bracket making adjustment impossible.

If you want a VERY HARD pillow with a very odd shape, this pillow is for you. But the pillow is so hard that I find it unbelievable that anyone could sleep on it at all. Plus, if you sleep on your side, you are instructed to sleep only on the narrow end, which requires you to balance your head on it, or your head either falls off the pillow, or falls into the depression in the center of the pillow. Since you have to stay awake (not that I was getting any sleep!)to manage this balancing feat, it defeats the purpose of a pillow. And most of the pillow is wasted if you have to sleep on one narrow part. Ugh. Obviously, the pillow is a good fit for someone. (previous review.) Definitely NOT for ME!

The sound quality is shockingly good. This is made apparent by listening to the opening movement of the 4th Symphony. I compared the tempos in this recording to the one on BIS conducted by Neeme Jarvi and I was taken aback by how Leaper takes his time and allows the haunting and disturbingly beautiful sonics of the Scandinavian Arctic regions to creep over us on an even more expansive level than Jarvi's. The opening to the 3rd is exciting as the strings take us on a worshipful journey comparable to Beethoven's introduction to his Pastoral Symphony. I have read many unfairly derisive reviews of Naxos recordings in regards to recording quality. These statements hold true for the other Sibelius symphonies on Naxos (#1, 2, 5, and 6). However, #3 and #4 on this recording are a glorious exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The product description did not mention that there is no CD booklet to speak of.

Going into this I knew that the zeno doesn't work on white heads or black heads but thats fine because it worked (supposedly) on the exact kind of acne I have (key word have not had). After trying it numorous times and multiple times on the same pimple all I got was a nice warm feeling and nothing more. It did not shrink my pimple and it did not make them hurt less.

According to the owners manual the non-replaceable battery should last 3-4 years with normal use. I'm very disappointed. The gadget worked when it was working...but yeah, SOOOO disappointed that my only options now are to do without or buy a whole new device. Frustrating to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like it says is should","review":"I left a review on the 90 count device, which is the same device but more uses in the tip. Zeno works for me, like a charm. The trick I've noticed, and Zeno advocates, is to catch them when they're first starting to arrive - before you can see them, but you feel them. Be proactive and it'll do what it says, I guess for most people. The other reviewer here points out that it says \\"for most people\\" or \\"for most acne\\", as if this is a loop hole. Any device like this, most devices/tools in general don't work for everyone. Some straightening irons damage one persons hair while making another's sleek and shiny. Some hair growth therapies work for some, not for others. So it's a toss up. My guess is if you have random annoying pimples, but not something you'd consider and acne problem, and you catch these pimples BEFORE they really develop and show, this device is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one?","review":"I think I must be the only person that the zeno doesn't work on. I gave it a good shot and used it on upcoming pimples for a week. Nothing happened. I have large under the skin pimples, so maybe it's not for my type of acne. I used it about 20 times and that means that I spent 50 minutes of my life holding it up to my face in the hope of my acne clearing. It didn't make it worse, but it didn't speed up the process as far as I could tell. I'm not pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me.","review":"I generally have a clear complexion but wanted this for the occasional breakout.

When it doesn't, I honestly feel that with continued treatment, the blemishes tend to shrink and don't last as long. In the past, nodes and cysts could last for weeks. Now, some of them are diminishing in a week to 10 days - not perfect, but better.If you have severe acne, see a dermatologist. Over the counter treatments alone aren't enough.

There are somewhat better readings out there but as I've noted with Gunzenhauser's other discs, the woodwinds are simply impeccable. This is a good 9th.The Symphonic Variations are gorgeous. The flighty transitions, embellished motifs and peasant-like character of this opus are glorious. It seems that the strings and the brass took a cue from the woodwinds and joined in on the music-making.The Gunzenhauser/Slovak Philharmonic Dvorak cycle is the only such cycle I've heard.

What I loved best about the book is how Spencer shows how difficult this was for an average American man, and also how very different the thinking was then between the English and Americans. Spencer also brings the War of 1812 into the story, which is unusual for a Regency, and deftly shows how this influenced both societies at that time.

Few, however, have enough substance to put into words, an epic tale of one of mankind's lowest moments. Bernie co-authored this book as a form of therapy - reading it is reliving it in the first person as Bernie only survived the ordeal by living it in the third person.

I read the specs, bought a DVD player for my computer (I'd wanted to do that, anyway, so it's not a total waste), and tried to install Revelations. It won't install, won't give an explanation, and the \\"support\\" at ubisoft is worse than useless. It was a waste of money, and I doubt that I can return the game now that it is open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Myst 4, Consumer Fraud Revealed","review":"I own the entire Myst series, to my mind they are the absolute best video games. In fact, they are pretty much the only ones I play. I bought Myst 4, but I can't play it, because Ubisoft has defrauded consumers by selling a product with copyright protection that not only prevents playing the game, but disables the DVD drive on your PC and requires a system restore (Win PCs). There are a lot of unhappy customers out there.I don't know whether I should be mad, or disappointed. Ubisoft has been outstanding so far. But I could have put the cost of this game to better use, since it will end up in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play on most PCs","review":"I have four PCs with a mix of Windows 2000, Windows XP Home and Windows XP Pro. I have up-to-date OS patches and up-to-date drivers for all my devices. Myst IV won't run on any of them. Standard viedo cards won't work. You need a 32 MB DirectX 9-compliant video card like a an ATI Radeon 7000 to 9800, NVIDIA GeForce 1/2/3/4/FX families, Matrox Parhelia or Intel i865G to i915G.Shame on Amazon for not mentioning this on their product page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Any game that already has two huge patches that need to be downloaded in order to get the glitches out was rushed to market in time for holiday profits. The system requirements are in such tiny print they are nearly impossible to read without a magnifying glass. Laptop users are totally out of luck.Myst IV crashes repeatedly, dramatically, and unexpectedly just when I thought it was finally up and running and I'd been able to do considerable exploring. From what I have been able to see and hear, the music is lovely and the graphics are intriguing, but not nearly equal to the hype. I will now uninstall it and chalk up the money for the game and the guidebook to a bad experience of a game that was released too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't rush to buy","review":"Even after you have updated your video driver and tried every graphic setting to find a combination that decently works, mouse control is unsteady.

At least it's got good graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great game to add to the Myst collection.","review":"The music, graphics, and story live up to that which we've come to expect from Myst games. I'd recomend reading the readme file before you play the game. I had difficulties at first with the game being glitchy and spontaniously terminating. The readme file suggested that disableing my antivirus monitor might help. It worked and I've had no problems since. I especialy appreciated the new feature of this game which lets you take pictures and notes inside the game for reference at any point. The plot itself has a bit of a surprise ending. I won't spoil it here, but you might pick up on it as you progress through the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maravilloso","review":"Fue definitivamente delicioso jugar esta version de Myst, la historia es muy atractiva, la complejidad esta a su medida, los escenarios son espectaculares que se podrian llamar las obras de arte de la computacion, y la variedad de estos es muy diversa que hace el juego nada monotono.Lo unico que me hizo falta pero que no me atrevo a quitarle puntos por eso es que hubiera sido perfecto si los recorridos fueran en 3D real y no renderizados, pero puede que se haya hecho asi para no perder la calidad visual y no inflar los requerimientos tecnicos del PC.Realmente agradezco a Cian y por tanto a todos los responzables de las sagas de Myst por que fueron de los juegos que mejor me hicieron sentir y mayores satisfaciones me dieron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game ever","review":"This game is the best game i have ever played!!!!!!!!!!Everything is great, but are some curser probloms.Overall everything is GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to Install Game","review":"I have a new and powerful computer but the Anti Copy Protection stops me cold when I try to Install.

My 8 month old Compaq Presario X1200 laptop has a Radeon 9200 video card. The fine print on the game packaging (we are talking magnifying glass required) indicates that \\"laptop models of (supported) cards not fully supported.\\" This makes it sound like it will work, but with some shortcomings. In fact, the game will start, but two minutes in you get to a variable-view screen with totally non-functional graphics. ATI implies new drivers may be available at the computer manufacturer, but Compaq has nothing for this model.I repeat Timothy Spellman's phrase, \\"Shame on Amazon for not mentioning this on their product page.\\" By the way, Amazon, you are making me rate how fun this game is to play, but I wouldn't know because I couldn't make it work.

I agree with a previous reviewer that even knowing the solution to a puzzle, actually performing it is needlessly difficult.Too bad, because the graphics still amaze and the story line is intriging, but it isn't fun anymore - it's tedious.Will I get Myst V-End of Ages ? - I'm sure I will...

However, I had one of those computers and drives that would not open the game once installed. As it happened, about that time I was in the market for a new machine, so I held off on any serious upgrades. Upon recieving my new computer one of my first chores was to try and load Myst IV but with the same results.

The very, very hard to reach technical support (I never did get to ask my own question) had FAQ, two of which dealt with this type of crash. The answer was that you have to have NVIDIA GeForce 1,2,3,4 or FX; ATI Radeon 7000-9800 or better. I have neither, and even though my Dell is about a year old, I had no options.

Once you open it (which is the way you find out it won't play since it isn't listed in the product description) you'll only get 50% of the price.

Despite the detailed ability to dress/create your character I felt disconnected from any narrative. Also, you can't handle certain things.

I bought this CD specifically to have a recording of Cardoso's Milonga and Dyens' Tango en Skai. Gerald Garcia has received much praise, but I simply dislike the way he plays on this CD. The performance of the Milonga lacks rhythmic drive, and the sweeping phrases of the Tango en Skai are unclear at best. There are many better recordings of the famous Lauro pieces, and some of Cinco Piezas are given too soft a touch where more gusto is clearly called for (notably Acentuado). Despite my objections to the performer's interpretations, the brilliance of the compositions usually still shine through and alternative recordings are scarce.

I'm not a guitarist and cannot really comment on Garcia's achievement as a musician, but the whole came across to me as a layman as perfectly convincing. Listen especially to Piazolla's Cinco Piezas, and there to \\"Acentuado\\"! But the Lauro, the Brouwer and the rest are definitely not to be despised either. The recording quality (made at Tonstudio van Geest in Heidelberg, Germany, 1989) is excellent, with none of the \\"early Naxos\\" problems sometimes encountered.

Instead it shows the struggles of passing the bar exam. It almost made me feel sorry for future lawyers as they put their heart and soul into passing the exam. Then I thought about the movie \\"Catch Me if you can\\" based on true events where a con man passed the bar and pretended to be a lawyer and this guy didn't go to law school. Then I thought about the tv show Smarter than a 5th grader where they have all these smart people who fail to answer all the questions. So my point is that maybe the bar exam is hard with such a bad passing rate because law schools are not teaching the right things to pass it. That would explain how a con man was able to pass the bar exam with no law school and why so many people can't win at the tv show Smarter than a fifth grader because who uses or remember the info that was taught in fifth grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for Oneida flatware","review":"I got this set for around $21 which is the cheapest I've seen for Oneida flatware.

She even went so far as to say that the transporter (a mainstay of Federation technology) wasn't possible.

Unfortunately, the title and liner notes are deceiving. The majority of this book is not about the biology of ST characters, but about the authors opinions about just about any social issue you could name. The potentially interesting topics which begin to be addressed in the book get bogged down in the authors knee-jerk liberal attitudes re: feminism, capitalism, religion, the military-industrial complex, environmentalism, etc. Very tedious.

Well, so did I. As a trekker as enthusiastic as any other, I bought it from Amazon and read it right away. In the beginning, it's pretty interesting, of course, for Andreadis does explore a variety of issues, from androids to changelings, from trills to betazoids. But, as she goes along, she starts to go far beyond her field of expertise, biology. That's when it gets really annoying, unless you think exactly like her. Andreadis's ill-disguised feminism makes her go on and on and on... about the Prime Directive, the Ferengi, etc. The Vulcan/Klingon dicotomy is particularly irritant, as it reveals a kind of oversimplification one would never expect to find in a scientist.

Judging from his numerous listings for the low-priced CD label, Jeno Jando must be anointed the \\"King of Naxos,\\" not only for his sheer productivity but for the generally high level of his playing. The eight Impromptus on this disc are played with warm tone, clear fingerwork and an elegant sense of proportion. The sound is somewhat pedestrian but clear. Minor drawbacks are that the recorded piano is, surprisingly, not perfectly in tune, and also the total amount of music on this CD amounts to just less than an hour--a bit of \\"filler\\" would have been welcome. Still, this is a good CD of essential piano repertory at Naxos' typical bargain price."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to frighten your child...buy this book.","review":"I bought this book because my 2 year old is in love with helicopters.

The first few pages are fine, and then I found out what the story is about. A little girl is kidnapped and Budgie needs to help rescue her. There is even a picture of two men chasing after a little girl in pigtails. I stopped reading as soon as I realized what the story was about and deposited it straight in the trash.

This book journies through the lives of a family trying to survive in a country where the language is foreign and the culture is out of the box. As I finished the book I realized how badly I want to go to China. I want to experience being in a different culture, and being with different people. More than that, I want to go to China show the love of Jesus to the people who are suffering there.

Miss Crawford is presented as bi-sexual and Mr. Crawford is actually presented in a likable manner when you are supposed to know he is a flirt and a scumbag!

So when I read the reviews stating that this movie was not true to the book, I didn't give it much thought, thinking that the movie would be good in its own right. Well, I've just finished watching it, and I wish I had my money back. It is unlike Jane Austen altogether with weird implications regarding Mr. Bertram's conduct in Antigua. All the other one-star reviews are accurate, but here's a little more in case you're still not convinced: (Spoiler Alert) Mary Crawford actually stands up amidst the entire family and states (out loud) her wishes that Tom die so that Edmund can inherit the estate. Fanny is strong willed throughout the movie (obviously unlike the book) but then she flip-flips on the only important decision she has to make through the entire course of the movie.

The notable exception would have been for O'connor to have copied Sylvestra Le Touzel's shy and humble Fanny. And for Lindsay Duncan to have copied Angela Pleasence's sleepy Lady Bertram instead of the director's choice of making her a drug addict. And of course the last (and perhaps worst problem) is that instead of telling Jane's Mansfield, the writer Roszema turns it in her political soap box with the political correct condemnation of slavery and also finishing out turning Fanny into a Jane wannabe writer...

Sence and Sensabilities took liberties but this was a all out fraud. watch the BBC mini series its production value leaves a lot to be desired but the interpertation was excelent and I enjoyed it a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage!","review":"I have both read the books and purchased the videos of most of Austin's works. I was anxious to see this movie hoping it would be as well done as \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Not far into the film, when young Fanny inquired about the noise from the slave ship, I knew there was a problem. This production had nothing in common with the book and must have Jane Austin spinning in her grave. The subtlety of her characters and ability to make her point by innuendo are just what make her books so good. Patricia's personal agenda has no business being produced under the title \\"Mansfield Park\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Romance!","review":"Okay, if you overlook the \\"kissing cousins\\" part of it........this is a great film! I recently saw it for the first time, and was just bowled over by how sweet (bittersweet) the romance was between Fanny and Edmund. My heart just sighed several times watching the interplay between these two characters. Just wonderful!! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done!","review":"I truly enjoyed this movie. And I dare say I preferred it to the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice. I'm sorry but the lighting, direction, casting, and wardrobe in P & R left much to be desired. P & R was drab, with simple, plan camera shots, costumes, and actors. Mansfield Park was a breath of fresh air. The lighting in the film was illuminating, the director and cinematographer created beautiful creative shots that engrossed me even more into the film, especially at during the ball dance sequence. The costumes were fitting for the time and nicely done. And last, but not least the actors were good, they acted the part and were attractive. It was a very well put together film. This film is what I expected to see of an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel in this modern day and time. Bravo for Mansfield Park. I wish all her novels could be presented in such a way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield Park","review":"First let me say that I'm a great fan of all these old English romance movies. I own one or more copies of all these classics but this one I threw in the trash since I found it offensive. Mansfield Park is a good story and I've read the book twice but this particular attempt at a screen version is a waste of your money. The acting is fair, the director must have been asleep and the scenery is weary. It works at being vulgar and is abusive which corrupts this story making it something it was never intended to be. If anyone knows of a good make of Mansfield Park I would love to purchase it. Sorry Amazon. You're a great place for movie purchases but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield Park","review":"If you love Jane Austen stories, as the British say, \\"Give this one a miss!\\" Our heroine, Fanny, is terribly mis-characterized (as compared with the book, and after all, what else is one to compare it with?); so too, her benefactor, Sir Thomas. Fanny is made out to be somewhat bold-instead of timid- and the Bertram scion is portrayed as positively mean. If these changes to Austen's brilliant story aren't travesty enough, this screenwriter chose to make the story into a campaign against Slavery--a theme never touched upon by Austen-on the flimsy excuse that the Bertrams have financial interests in Antigua. To give you an idea of just how far-fetched and far-afield this is, try to picture the lovely movie, Emma Thompson's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" as being turned into a rant about the Abuses and Excesses of The Church of England, merely because one of the central characters wants to be a vicar! It's a clear case of taking too much 21st century liberty with a 200 year-old story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pissing on Austen","review":"I'm reminded of small minded 19th century composers \\"enhancing\\" Mozart symphonies so they'd be up to date. Or the Bee Gees' version of Sgt Pepper. Vandalism, as is this. PC (so 10 years ago). A moustache on the Mona Lisa (so 80-years-ago). What made these Hollywood victims think their little dogmas and anachronisms were improvements on the incomparable genius of Austen's favourite (and possibly most profound) novel?Missed the point entirely, omitting the highly significant symbolism (eg. Maria's scene at the garden gate). Generally clueless, extraordinarily annoying, frustrating (such a lot of money down the drain, and we still don't have a decent MP adaption), and insulting.Only thing for it: read the book. Repeatedly. You'll be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austin's Story Spoiled","review":"As an enormous fan of Jane Austen, Mansfield Park is one of my favorite books. The emphasis on integrity in the book and it's innocence is completely destroyed by vile additions in this movie. How can anyone be so egotistical to think they could improve on a Jane Austin story by adding \\"politically correct\\" modern elements never even hinted at in the origional story? Jane would roll over in her grave to see the shocking, in your face sexuality gratuitiously added to her beautiful love story. I enjoy Jane Austin so much mainly because I don't have to worry that my senses will be asaulted by the kind of immorality Hollywood loves to depict so graphically. Shame on the makers of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more smarty pants interpretation of Jane Austen","review":"If it were possible, I think Jane Austen should rise from her grave and hunt down Patricia Rozema. Why would anyone think they could improve Jane Austen by \\"adapting\\", read hacking, her work to bits? While I'm not a big fan of the BBC version, it's a lot better than this tacky movie. At least the BBC writer seemed to have read the book, and understood the writer.Buy the book and give a real writer a chance to tell a tale. This movie belongs in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting movie, but not Mansfield Park.","review":"This would have been an interesting movie if the film makers had titled it something other than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" However, since they chose to present it as a rendition of the Jane Austen novel, I think they took far too many liberties with the story.The biggest difference was in the character of Fanny Price. No matter how badly we in the twenty-first century want to believe it, she was *not* a modern, outspoken, independent woman. She was deeply conservative. If the film makers disliked that aspect, why choose this book to film at all?No film can completely capture the spirit of a novel. But when I watch an adaptation I want to feel that it was created with a fundamental level of understanding of the book, and appreciation for it. This film fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh...What the heck?","review":"I had hoped that I would find at least some semblance of Austen's \\"Mansfield Park\\" in this adaptation...and indeed I did. The characters had the same names. Beyond that, it was almost unrecognizible. I realize that film adaptations of books are seldom on the mark exactly...but I have seen other of Austen's works recreated on the 'big screen' and this one pales in comparison. I enjoyed some of the actors/actresses...but this is not a movie I would recommend to anyone who has ever read \\"Mansfield Park\\". If you haven't read the book then you probably won't be too disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield Park","review":"This movie is not unenjoyable and has several scenes that are rather cute or witty. However, it is very far from being a decent film adaptation of the novel. Much of the book is skipped over, which means that character development is often skipped over. Additionally, those characters that are developed are very different in many respects from the characters of the novel. Perhaps, in the case of Fanny, this was done to make the \\"heroine\\" more appealing to modern women, but it does change the story quite a bit. Also, the movie seems to be rather choppy at times. It's worth a watch, but the changes made have really detracted from the complexity and drama of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Movie","review":"This is, by far, my favorite Jane Austen movie of recent years - and I've seen them all. I loved the way it was filmed - with very witty and romantic effects: having the protaganist address the audience, slowing down the frames to build romantic suspense. I thought it was masterful. Also loved Frances O'Conner's performance. When I saw this movie for the first time I swooned! I have watched it many times since. It did not get as much press or exposure as \\"Emma\\" starring the well known Gwyneth Paltrow and I think somehow this affects people's opinions - many more seem to rave about \\"Emma\\" - but I found Mansfield Park superior. Perhaps it's because of the unconventional views of the film, choosing to include a view of the less priveleged. For me it was a combination of all these things - editing & film techniques, approach to the story, a well chosen cast - that brought this together so effectively. I just love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soap opera?","review":"This is not one of my favorite movies represented by Jane Austin's writings. Maybe a remake of this story should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romance, beautifully filmed","review":"This movie is really good.I understand people being unsatisfied if they have read the novel, (which I have not), but it is so well done as a movie on its own, that I would buy it and recommend it any day to a girl with a love for a good romance & appreciation for Jane Austen style movies.Loved the filming... beautiful shots, lovely acting,You'll appreciate the cinematography for sure.Overall, one of the best romances I've seen in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just couldn't care about the characters or the story","review":"O.K. I'll admit it. I've never read any Jane Austen. I did see a video of Sense and Sensibility though and loved it. I expected to love this too. I didn't. I wanted to identify with the young heroine, Fanny Price, a poor relation of a wealthy family living in Mansfield Park, who comes to live with them at the age of 10. Perhaps its because the young girl seems a little too modern for her background or that the production tries too hard to be politically correct, but I just couldn't care about the characters in spite of the twists and turns of the plot. From reading other reviews I understand that the screenwriter strayed far away from the original book. That might have been one of the problems, which I didn't realize at the time. The acting was good and so was the cinematography, but I can only give this video a lukewarm recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous film from equally important novel","review":"You literary purists--get over it! If you watched the credits, you'll have seen that this film is inspired by and based on the novel, as well as Austen's letters and other writings. The director's emphasis is clearly on a broader sociohistorical context--one admittedly driven by a 20th-century feminist perspective--but this makes the film no less successful. The editing is superlative--note in particular the ball sequence at midpoint and the final shots that close the film--as is the acting, the direction, the cinematography, and the soundtrack. Highly rated! Far better than the usual fluff of period films!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposedly Mansfield Park","review":"Are you kidding me? Jane Austen??? I don't think so. This movie was terrible. The only thing that resembled Jane Austen was part of the name of the characters and some of the language and phrasing. The characters were not consistent with the intent of Austen. They made Lady Bertram a drug addict!!! Tried to tie in the slave issue in an unnatural, overt manner which is not even hinted at in this book. There was too much profanity, too much sexuality, and definitely too much brutality to slaves as depicted in supposed drawings by Tom while he visited the West Indies.There was no hint that audiences were about to view explicit sexually violent drawings of the slaves, and my 83 year old mother had never seen anything like it. She and I both were offended.I threw the movie away. I didn't want anyone else exposed to the vile, disgusting lies the movie portrayed.If you love Jane Austen DO NOT BUY this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly Not Like the Book!","review":"I found it so disappointing to find this movie called Mansfield Park and its total disregard of Jane Austen's book. Any resemblance to the novel is by accident. It grossly misrepresents Sir Bertram and presents a Fanny with a personality almost one hundred eighty degrees different that the Fanny of the book. What a disappointment and misrepresentation of Jane Austen's writing!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hardly resembles jane austen","review":"As a Jane Austen reader, I was very disappointed in this movie. It bears little resemblance to the novel, inserting sexual inuendos and perversions where none existed in Austen's writing. The characters are poorly portrayed, and the movie's only redeeming value is a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites..Mansfield Park","review":"This is a great movie. I enjoy watching this movie because of the overall story and premise, but also because I am a Jane Austen fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If it can make me swoon for Mr. Henry Crawford...","review":"Ok, so it's not like the book. I love the book ... and I love this film. They're different. Honestly, I don't know if I could watch an adaptation of Mansfield Park that was completely true to the novel, because Fanny Price is a very quiet, thoughtful, virtuous person who essentially never does anything wrong. She sits, she observes, she pines for Edward, and she thinks. Occasionally she speaks. As a reader, you know her thoughts and emotions through Jane Austen's genius narration. I just don't think that a quiet Fanny would come across in film - so I am fine with the many liberties taken here. My favorite bits of dialogue from this movie are actually lifted from Northanger Abbey, which I found quite amusing. If you are a die-hard Austen purist, you might not like this film. But I love Jane and manage to love this movie as well.Oh, and be prepared to fall for Henry Crawford. It's really hard to dislike him when he is that beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a New Title","review":"It is very dificult to review this film given that the title is \\"Mansfield Park\\". I think that the movie might be just fine and interesting on its own, but I feel like it robbed the plot outline and title from a classic Austen novel and then refused to honor it. For those of you who have never read the novel, go ahead and watch the movie as it is interesting and well acted.If you have or are planning to read the novel, you whould not have anything to do with this film. It's not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield Park...NOT","review":"Next to Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park is my favorite book of Jane Austen. The movie however was an utter disappointed. Fanny and many if not most of the other characters are completely misrepresented. Not to mention that her beloved brother William who is a large part of the novel is not even alluded to once in the movie. Slavery is a running theme, which is quite an inappropriate and disturbing deviation from the novel. Badly Done!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely disappointing","review":"The producers have taken the audience for a ride since this adaptation has not the remotest resemblence to the wonderful creation of Jane Austen. They have just exploited her name for publicity and marketing purposes. Do not waste your time and money watching this version"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent this. Don't buy.","review":"I'm glad I chose to rent this before I bought. I own many Austen romances in movie form, but I won't bother buying this one. I didn't care for the interpretation at all. The cast had decent potential, but no one really stood out. This really wasn't romantically protrayed. I also didn't appreciate the raunchy undertones that were added. Not necessary and not appropriate for a wide audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane is turning over in her grave!","review":"This movie is not worthy of being called a Jane Austen classic! The characters are not true to the book and the story has been monkeyed with as well. The social statements made are ones we may find pivitol for today, but were not primary issues of the 18th century and certainly not issues in this particular book. Buy any of the other recent J.A. movies - they're all worth your time and money - but leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy little movie","review":"One thing Jane Austen continually riled against was moralistic preaching. Unfortunately her genius tends to show up \\"improvers\\" such as Rozema as very small artists in comparison, particularly when so inclined to sort us all out morally...I was so disappointed, as Mansfield Park is for me Austen's most profound work, full of all sorts of symbolism which are completely missed and even destroyed in this shabby, misanthropic and anachronistic \\"adaption\\".The outstanding exception is the wonderful portrayal of Henry Crawford.I love Frances O'Connor (she is wonderful in the underrated \\"Thank God He Met Lizzie\\"), but here she is very poorly directed and has to work with very undisciplined writing.I hope Rozema will leave out trying to tell us what we must think in future projects - she has no talent for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austin fans;RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!","review":"I so wanted to like this movie...But alas, attempts to \\"modernize\\" Miss Austin's novel with nudity, sex scenes and graffic depiction of sexual abuse of slaves leaves me cold. The director seemed to have a general lack of regard for the sensibilities of the period. The overall effect was the fractured feeling that the movie couldn't decide in which century it wanted to reside. My advice is to steer clear of this adaptation and read \\"Mansfield Park\\" for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrecognizable. No true Austen here.","review":"Maybe if you could completely separate yourself from the fact that this movie bears the title of \\"Mansfield Park,\\" it might be enjoyable. (And I am talking a very slim \\"might.\\"). But who besides an established fan of the genre would be taking the time to watch another adaptation of yet another Austen work? I understand that some changes need to be made when transferring literature to the screen, but this was ludicrous. Fanny Price is portrayed so far from the demure, quiet, undiscovered youth that she is hardly recognizable. Just seeing her expression on the cover tells this is a newly created character bearing a very familiar name. Liberties are taken with other characters as well. If you have any interest in true Austen, don't waste your time on this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A night of good entertainment","review":"I purchased it for 24 hours because I've already seen it, and although it isn't the exact story of Mansfield Park, it is done exceptionally well and I enjoy it tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAVE THE MAKERS READ THE BOOK?","review":"THE WORST ADAPTATION OF A JANE AUSTEN NOVEL THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.

GIVE THIS ONE A MISS AND READ THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a travesty!","review":"Well, to say I was disappointed with this is an understatement. I cannot believe how unfaithful it is to the book.

I was so disappointed with this version of Mansfield Park. The film isn't true at all to the book...the only character well cast was Edmund (played by Johnny Lee Miller). Frances O'Connor, while I think she's a great actress, didn't fit the roll of Fanny Price at all. She was too outspoken & witty...Fanny Price in the book wasn't either. The only reason why I gave it two stars was for Alessandro Nivola -- but only because he's a cutie pie. Those wanting a good adaption should see the 1986 BBC production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very possibly the worst movie ever made","review":"This bit of tripe is not even fit to line a birdcage. The only reason I gave it one star is because there wasn't a selection for zero stars. OK, it surely does not stay true to the Jane Austen novel; in and of itself, that is all right, since most novels are not adapted exactly according to the book. This one, however, completely changes the dialog and personality of the main character (and other characters); it adds disturbing scenes of a sexual nature that are completely gratuitous; and the only relationship this movie has to the novel are the names of the characters, and possibly the setting. Alessandro Nivola, I admit, is the definitive Henry Crawford, but even he is not worth watching this movie for.Watch this \\"adaptation\\" at your own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time for a true Jane Austen experience","review":"I was thoroghly disgusted with this movie and the completely untrue portayal of the main character, Fanny Price. The director of this movie only used the original storyline as a beginning point to form a twisted tangential plot filled with characters sharing the same names as the characters in the book, but with completely different morals and purposes. The acting was very good, but the content was offensive. This horrible remake of an originally uplifting and moral story belongs in the very popular class of movies that draw viewers using sex and lurid topics as a hook. It is unfortunate that a writer as talented and intelligent as Jane Austen should have her works twisted and mangled in such a grotesque fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield Park (1999)","review":"This was not my favorite Austen book. Fanny Price is apretty dull, overly moralistic character. The movie jazzes upup this little family scene with issues like the dubiousorigins of the family fortune but takes away from Austen'sstory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane's favorite...with good cause.","review":"Reputed to be Jane Austen's personal favorite from among all her sometimes straightlaced novels, \\"Mansfield Park\\" touches on the darker elements of society, but does not focus primarily on the faults of the men. Mariah shows the greed and lust she inherited from her father, while her oldest brother, Tom, seems to fit the mold of some of Austen's heroines, rebelling at the injustices and ugliness he has witnessed. The Crawfords, a brother and sister team of questionable morals, team up on our hero and heroine, Edmond and Franny. The DVD touches on the evils of slavery, drugs, lust, and the \\"selling\\" off of young women into society. I felt it should have carried a stronger story line into the slave trade and the goings-on in Antiqua, which obviously led to the moral break between Sir Thomas and his son Tom. But, all in all, I enjoyed it. Particularly, Franny's epistles to her younger sister, putting her unique spin on European history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appealing","review":"I have yet to read the book this movie is based on, so without that to compare the movie too, all I can say is that I enjoyed the movie for what it was... an appealing portrayal of the snotty upper class lording their wealth and privileges over the lower class even while opening their home too them. I enjoyed this movie because it did not hide the ugliness of class prejudice and it had the courage to show that love can win in the end. Very charming movie with much talent and beautiful scenery. Worth watching more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"yum..","review":"Mansfield Park... i do believe it was a completely pleasant experience watching this movie, although it strayed a lot away from the book. but to be honest the book stunk, and im glad it was adapted so well onto the screen. if you thought of it as a completely separate work you'd enjoy it immensely.the fannie price in the book was a crying little wussie, but her film counterpart was smart and cool and completely independent and was a joy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming and beautiful","review":"This is a great movie.

Laden down with too many agendas and obvious anachronisms, this film lacks the crackerjack wit of the author, although it is straining very hard to do...well, something. O'Connor is a promising find, but she is unevenly directed here. Alessandro Nivola, however, is the quintessential Henry Crawford: tortured by his first venture into a love of the heart. Nivola flawlessly depicts a man who has never had to practice restraint, or hear the word \\"No\\" in response to anything he has truly desired. Nonetheless, this film misses its mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"One step above truly hideous.","review":"I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book.The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable Garbage","review":"Any one who is inclined to care about Jane Austin's wonderful characters would not care for this Fanny.

O'Connor's Fanny is clever and witty -- a vast improvement over the priggish milquetoast Fanny of the novel! The film is supplemented from Austen's own letters, making Fanny more representative of Austen herself than of the moralizing, nebbishy Fanny of the book.To those who sniff that this filmed version isn't true to the spirit of the novel's Fanny Price, I say hip, hip, hooray!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old-fashioned romantic movie","review":"If you're looking for a good old-fashioned romance (and dare I say comedy?)

This film is so unlike Jane Austen's beautiful novel in all its essentials as to be unrecognizable. Austen's Fanny Price, it has been said, is a heroine who succeeds because of her refusal to DO anything (including budge). Here, she is turned into a feminist fireball. Worse and worse . . . the director actually has her accept the scoundrel's proposal of marriage, something Austen's immobile and faithful Fanny would never do. The director throws in all kinds of peripheral non-necessities, distracts from the story as much as possible, and destroys all possible subtlety in the process. Just goes to show you . . . if you have a story to tell, don't try and pass it off as a great author's just to gain legitimacy. Especially if your story is worth a lot less than the original. Avoid this movie; read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not faithful to the book","review":"I was disappointed with the changes to Fanny's character and the \\"spicing up\\" that was done to the storyline.

They took Jane Austen's simple, exciting plot, marvellous characters of the kind only Jane Austen can create, and ruined it completely. Where was Aunt Norris' gnawing nastiness? Sir Thomas' dignity (the movie makers made him into some kind of lecher who abused slaves in the worst way in Antigua!)? Lady Bertram's humorous lassitude? Fanny Price's father's embarrassing (but to us highly amusing) vulgarity? And am I the only one who noticed the slightly lesbian tones in Mary Crawford's attentions to Fanny, especially when Fanny has to take off her wet clothes? Good grief!Jane Austen must be turning in her grave.The only reason I am giving this movie one star is because of the costumes. They are beautiful. Everything else about the movie is appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents be warned","review":"My teenage daughters and I have a lot of Jane Austen books and movies. Not only did this one seriously deviate from the book, it also included a graphic scene of the maincharacter looking at drawings of a rape (not in the book). It also deals with adultery by showing the man and women naked together. I threw this one in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield Park - The Dark Side","review":"This video was a great disappointment for one who has read and re-read all of Jane Austen's works over several decades and obtained this video after having worn out the 1986 two-volume BBC-CBS FOX video version.This newer video version insinuates evil-with-intent in most of the characters rather than seeing them through the eyes of Jane Austen's modest Fanny. Perhaps this appeals to those who delight in violence, in believing the worst in everyone and every society. For me, however, one viewing was one too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austen Disappears","review":"I am amazed that anyone who claims to have read Ms. Austen's work and enjoyed it would enjoy this movie. I am not such a purist that I cannot enjoy artistic license in a movie but this one completely missed the story. It seems to me that the director and screen writer were more interested in being artistic than in telling the story of Fanny Price. The movie leaves out essential parts of the story that explain how Fanny comes to live at Mansfield Park. It leaves out the relationship between Fanny and her brother who serves in the military. The time the writer spent editing important parts of the story he used to create pieces that never existed. It is really too bad because the cast could have worked. As it is, this movie left me with a bad taste and I had to reach for Pride & Prejudice to get rid of it! If you want to know the story of Mansfield Park read the book. So far nothing on television or the big screen has gotten it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Fanny Price?","review":"That was the question that came to me while watching this movie. This is a great departure from the story in Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park. If you are a big Austen fan I would stay away from this one. Although it was well acted, with beautiful scenery, there were too many elements from the novel which were missing in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Jane Austen!","review":"I was appalled by this rendition of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park. It should have been named something else with different character names, as it has scarcely anything else in common with the Austen novel beyond these."},{"rating":"1","title":"For this film, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is a misnomer","review":"Is there a secret revised version of the novel \\"Mansfield Park\\" to which only Patricia Rozema had access? If it weren't for the title, I wouldn't even know that it was an attempt at an adaptation! I suppose it's a decent film in its own right, and I thought that the use of Jane Austen's letters and earlier works (the \\"History of England\\" Fanny was writing, for example, along with the stories of cannibalistic children eating their mothers!) as minor plotlines and dialogue was clever, but this is NOT the \\"Mansfield Park\\" Austen fans know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"As a lover of Jane Austen novels I saw this movie when it was first released in the theatre. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! I wanted my time and my money back. The only thing this movie had in common with the actual story were the names of the characters. I don't think Jane Austen herself would have recognized her story. I guess that's what \\"based on the novel by Jane Austen\\" means. Very loosely based. This rendition had no soul and the only clever thing about this movie was the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this PG-13????","review":"Other than the movie being completely off base it is also disgusting. I couldn't even finish it I was so infuriated. A far cry from what I or any other Jane Austen fan would deem respectable and worth a penny. I want to know when lust and sex became art? Tell me why directors and actors feel a sick need to ruin anything wholesome? The novel has its dark happenings in the shadows not in the full front of the show! The novel has wonderful morals and ideals throughout it and unfortunately the director decided to cut it all out and turn it into crap. There was no need for the director to ruin a great story with her dark and twisted view of art. I wish there were a way to vomit garbage images from my mind the way I can with food. I am so angry with this pathetic attempt of a Jane Austen story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same Austen style, more satisfying","review":"I watched this movie after reading the novel and must confess, I care much more for the movie. The book was [of course] well written, but left me wanting. I struggled through it, being a lover of happy endings, and was little given satisfaction at the end. The movie is not only well done, but the 'artistic liberties' taken by the director are not at all offensive to the novel, but instead offer an enhancement of values to the different characters. It has all of Mansfield Park, and more. If you're a die-hard Jane Austen fan, give it a chance, you may end appreciating it despite differences. I did. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the book at all.","review":"I have read this book and from that I think the movie was poorly scripted and poorly cast. The main character was not like the one in the book. Also, there were elements, like the slavery issue, that may have been important at the time, but were not in the book explicitly. There were too many elements apart from the book and this DID NOT lead to a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jane Austen's Book","review":"The movie itself is quite entertaining in modern standards, but it is hardly based on Jane Austen's book. Unlike Austen's main character, Fanny is a bold, loud, playful girl, flirting in the hallways of her uncle's home. Her uncle is a mean-spirited and harsh man, almost never like Austen's Sir Thomas. The other characters are no more like the book in character or looks. The dialogues are modified to sound modern. There is undue physical contact between Fanny and Mr. Crawford and, worse yet, between Fanny and Edmund. A key character is eliminated, Fanny's brother William, who is her only joy in life outside of her uncle's home. He is replaced by a sister, who is attached to Fanny too early in the film. The characters, if separated completely from the book, are in themselves charming. The movie would have been a nice American piece of drama had they called it another name. As it stands, it does great injustice to Jane Austen genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely not Austen's work","review":"This movie did absolutely no credit to Jane Austen's work. It was completely different from the book. All the innocence and morality of Austen's \\"Mansfield Park\\" was supplanted by immorality. The director did a horrible job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield Park want to be","review":"Very poorly done. I was very, very disappointed. Not in the spirit of the book. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Austin's MANSFIELD PARK!","review":"The movie takes Jane Austin's plot, mostly. It slaughters the characters, particularly Fanny Price. The young woman portrayed here bears no resemblance to Miss Austin's creation. She may be a spunky and \\"modern\\" person, but she does not have a fraction the depth of the original and is an almost total opposite of her. Edmund is reduced to a shadow figure. Sir Thomas and his lady are both villified, especially the latter. There is no excuse for the liberties taken. The producers could have done a parody set in the present time if they chose, but to destroy the original, to spoil it for people unfamiliar with the book, is unpardonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director brings PC baggage to dull film","review":"The film was not without charm...when it doesn't stray too far from Jane Austins' novel. When it did ...were left with awkward Father/Uncle groping of Fanny and lesbian innuendo....their is also a mini condemnation of slavery and slave raping thrown into this love story.Patricia Rozema obviously couldn't get people to watch anything she's written so she got Miramax to help her \\"Update\\" Jane Austin's \\"Out of touch\\" novel...problem is that Jane's work is alive and well and people want to see it when it's done right.Patricia should at least mess up an man's Novel next time with her over the top PC feminist take of the world. I'm sure here first draft had Fanny falling in love with Mary Crawford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really a Jane Austen?","review":"Why one star? I didn't know how to leave it empty.What a disappointment. I wonder that this even qualified for the use of the title. Yes it has the plot and the characters' names, but that's about it. The character development, especially of Fanny is terrible. We don't even know what qualities in Fanny lend her to so \\"good\\" as we do in the book and the BBC version, nor would this character even qualify for those qualities. The characters are, unfortunately current \\"Hollywood\\" style.And where was the warning...brief upper nudity scene, I hardly think this was in Jane Austen's style. Leave Mansfield in it's time era, don't try to update it to this time...it just doesn't do.I was so disappointed I actually got rid of the DVD. It's naughty and not at all a Jane Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie is horrible, the acting is flat. You never get an in-depth characterization. The movie is too short for that. Why did they have to drag in so much filth (oral sex with slaves)? If you want to see a superb version of Mansfield Park, get the BBC version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're wanting to see Austin, don't bother.","review":"NOT Mansfield Park except for very general plot outlines, done as an 'adult' version that Austin surely never envisioned. For the most part the cast are all 'way too old for the parts as Austin wrote it, & the costuming & hair are also wrong. It could have turned out different - but it didn't. One thumb down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went Looking for Cause and Effect","review":"For Jane Austen lovers, most of whom are the audience of this type of film, Mansfield Park lets us down. Not only does the movie do a particularly bad job of staying true to the story but it goes into territory that Jane Austen knew little to nothing about - slavery. The director obviously went looking for motivations for the action of the movie. The worst example of this being the acceptance and then rejection of Henry Crawford by Fanny Price. Instead of her dicision being vindicated by the revelation of his character he seems almost justified in sleeping with a married woman. The acting is just what it should be for such a film, but the choice of actress for the older Fanny Price was bad - she's too old (as good as she was). The cinematography and locations they chose were spectacular, but that is the only saving grace. Good sets however were not enough to save this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself!","review":"What license was taken in this adaptation of Jane Austin's novel! This movie was [junk]. No doubt the late Miss Austin would have been mortified if she had seen this [distorted] portrayal of her novel. The characters in this film were extremely shallow. Not one of the actors portrayed their character as they ought. I was bitterly disappointed. I wish I would have never seen this film. I despise this movie. Spare yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen Disrespected!","review":"This movie is awful. I was so disappointed to see that the novel was not followed closely. The director actually had the audacity to try to improve on Jane Austen, which just cannot be done. The story line has been twisted, the costumes and hairstyles are mediocre at best (especially Edward's!), and the graphic sexual scene is completely uncalled for and inappropriate. Jane Austens novels have a pervading modesty and the director just ignored that. Also, the business about slavery was totally out of place. Use your money on something else -- like the BBC's joint effort with A&E of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", which is a truly wonderful film adaption of an Austen Novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield horror picture show","review":"This adaptation ... what am I saying?!, this film whose creators had the audacity to call it \\"Mansfield park\\" and say it was based on Jane Austen's novel is GHASTLY!First I was totally appalled, then horrified what they made of Austen's brilliantly plotted and well-characterized novel. It's not simply a charicature, it's grotesque and horrifying. Fanny Price became an inept, sniggering feminist, Lady Bertram an alcoholic and possibly a drug addict, Maria Bertram a fat, ugly trollop, Mary Crawford a lesbian, Mansfield Park a run-down shanty .... and I could go on and on.The whole plot is inconsequent, illogical and loose to say the least. Characters act and speak totally out of place for the time of Regency, there isn't one of them you could grow to like - all of them behave ghastly.People who haven't read Jane Austen yet, please, please, please do not think this is her!!! No way. The crew should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie... when not compared to the book.","review":"I have to agree with most by saying that this movie wasn't a lot like the book. I am a big fan of all of Jane Austen's novels, and so I was really excited when I heard about this movie. (Since the only other movie made of this book wasn't very good...) I read several reviews on it before I went and saw it, but these reviews only made me nervous because they didn't have many good things to say. However, I didn't need to be nervous because the movie was good... if you look at it as just another movie and not a movie based on a book. The characters were all very good for the parts and it was really fun to watch. I especially liked the \\"It could have ended differently...\\" thing at the end. I would recommend this movie to everyone whether they're a fan of Jane Austen or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Jane Austen!","review":"extremely bad production of probably one of Austen's best written, if not most likeable books. The names and a few of the basic plot points are the same, but other than that, there's no similarities. They made Sir Thomas, who was basically a good man, although somewhat reserved and unbending, into a borderline lecher, they tried to mix Fanny Price and Jane Austen, and I don't think there was much of Fanny in Jane Austen. Also, what was with Mary Crawford practically trying to seduce Fanny? Completely unnecessary. The one redeeming point was the portrayal of Fanny and Edmund's relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT JANE AUSTEN!!!","review":"I bought this DVD and was extremely disappointed. The 'writers' really destroyed her characters as she wrote them; they defiled Sir Thomas's character with gratituous sex drawings and introduced the subject of master/slavery sex into the story... this movie is enough to make her spin in her grave.This wasn't a movie to put in the hands of those who did it. Only those that did Pride and Prejudice for A & E have even touched on the real Jane Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking????","review":"This was a horrible adaptation of Jane Austin's novel. I was very disappointed and could not recommend it to any of my friends. The whole slavery issue and the pictures depicting the lewd treatment of them was very shocking and had no business being in this movie. I hope that someone else will make a Mansfield Park movie that is truer to the book!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad, too Bad!","review":"I was shocked when I watched this version of Mansfield Park. The insertion of a subject not addressed in the book or by the author anywhere at all is disgraceful and also pushed the limits in graphic detail. I wouldn't let my grandchildren watch this version and I have told many of my friends not to watch or buy it. Not worthy of even 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, Jane Austen","review":"Can Jane Austen do no wrong? No, she cannot. At first, I thought this movie dragged. But really it's as it should be since her \\"Life seems like a quick succession of busy nothings.\\" But really, it got better as it went on, and there was a point where I really didn't know which man I wanted her to end up with! That is rare for Jane Austen movies, which are usually quite predictable but we love seeing how it all unfolds anyway. Now I can watch this movie over and over and still love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well-done","review":"this is one of my favorites in this genre, lit adaptations. Hannah Taylor-Gordon is superb, the story is a great lesson, and the locations really fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","review":"Unfortunately, this version of Mansfield Park hardly resembles Jane Austen's book, both in tone and in content. The issue of slavery was never addressed in the book and distracts from the storyline of the poor relation (Fanny) living with wealthy and mostly unkind relatives, with the exception of Edmund. Fanny's morality toward slavery is overpowering to the central theme and horribly overdone. Especially the scene where she views the upsetting drawings by the eldest brother depicting the anguish of slaves. Since when was the brother an artist?? Lame, Lame, Lame... Mansfield Park is not one of my favorite of Austen's novels and I was hoping that the screenplay might take a view that I had not divined from the book..It DOES, but one that is wholly an invention of the screenwriter. Sadly, it is not even a rich, costume film, which we have come to expect from these period pieces. Dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unfaithful to the book","review":"This movie is so disappointing to anyone who has read and loved Jane Austen's books. Instead of reading this book, the author probably took a poor synopsis and wrote their own story, it is so far from Jane Austen's creation. The character of Fanny is totally rewritten and anachronistic. Don't watch it if you are at all a lover of Jane Austen's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen is Rolling in her Grave","review":"If you like the type of movie that takes great liberties with a novelist's work, you'll like Mansfield Park. I love most of the works of Jane Austen, and was amazed at how truly awful the writing, acting, and scenery were in this movie. It took a great deal of nerve to call it Mansfield Park. If you're an Austen purist, you may like the earlier version, but bear in mind that it was made decades ago with a smaller budget. I own that particular version, and have watched it and reread the novel several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"My daughter and I read the book at the same time. Having read the book, and knowing how difficult it was, we were both looking forward to treating ourselves to the movie version. How dissapointed we were! This version was nothing like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing! Very poorly produced movie!","review":"I was very eager to watch this movie, being a Jane Austen fan. I read the book, and loved it! So, after watching this movie, I was extremely disappointed. Not only does it change the events of the story, but it makes up scenes as well. Also, there is no development of the characters. You never feel as if you really get to know and understand them.I don't see why with having only two hours to present this marvelous story that the movie producers and screenplay writers feel that they have to make up their own half of the story. It was genious as Jane Austen wrote it! Read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame!","review":"I had just finished reading Mansfield park, and was very excited that a movie had been made. I was so disappointed! The only thing that follows the book are the names of the people and that Maria and Crawford take off together, but even that is portrayed differently than the book. In my opinion, Jane Austen portrayed, and desired, Fanny Price's character to be very gentle and respectful. This movie does it great injustice. I could write many more things that I disliked about the movie, but it is not worth my time. It is not worth the money to rent it, let alone buy it. What a shame they had to mess up such a sweet book! Shame on the people who wrote this pathetic storyline!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the real one","review":"I am a Jane Austen fan and was so utterly disappointed with this movie. It was nothing like the real \\"mansfield park.\\" there were so many distortions of characters and plots to make it shorter. \\"mansfield park\\" is such a good book and for them to have given the wrong perception of the novel by making this movie was an insult. it would have been better off not made at all. if you've ever read a Jane Austen novel, and watch this movie, you'll probably turn it off because it's so inconsistent with her style and characterizations. whatever you do, please do not watch this so-called \\"Mansfield Park,\\" it's a waste of your time and money. Go read the book instead, the book is phenomenal. If it were possible, it'd give this movie a -5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Purist\\" Jane Austin fans may want to skip this one","review":"I am a very big fan of several of the Jane Austin novels, and also enjoyed seeing some of the screen versions. I especially liked \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" with Hugh Grant & Emma Thompson, as well as the A&E versions of \\"Emma\\" and, particularly, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"(which I highly recommend). I was excited when I first saw previews for this move, since I had read and enjoyed the novel. However, this movie did not seem to live up to my expectations, as it strayed much too far from the novel. I was particularly upset by the portrayal of Edmund's father and his horrendous treatment of slaves on the plantation, which not, even in the remotest sense, a part of the novel. If you are looking for a faithful adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Is Too Many","review":"This by far is the worst attempt to bring an Austen novel to the screen that I have ever seen!

If you enjoyed Austen's book, don't waste your time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie - please stop recommending to me !","review":"This movie is a Hollywood version of parts of the book.

It is a wonderful portrait of the novel and enhanced with dramatic yet tasteful cinematography, colors, and music. Austen's sharp wit and controversial social issues of the time are ones that are still alive today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"This movie was such a dissapointment- so many geat aspects of the book were changed or left out. Perhaps this is because they tried to squish such a wonderful and twisting plot into two hours. I think If I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have understood the movie, it jumps to quickly from scence to scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely film though not the best novel adaptation","review":"I, too, am a big Jane Austin fan and read the novel before watching the film. There are inaccuracies (Fanny's older brother, William, is completely left out), but if you are looking for an enjoyable period romance with good acting, you will likely appreciate this adaptation. It certainly is easier to like Fanny in this film than it is in the book. She's much more empowered."},{"rating":"1","title":"gloomy and boring","review":"Not as witty as the book, this film is rahter boring and goes on and on and on...

I thought it was terrible the first time I saw it. However, while this movie is NOT faithful to Austen, I think it does have at least one substantially redeeming feature that is consistent with Jane Austen stories: a satirical and intelligent sense of humor. So I think of it as not being Jane's voice, but perhaps being her laughter..."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Austen style","review":"Taken without the book in consideration, this movie is quite good. Fanny in this version is a loveable character who you can feel for. The wit and undertones in this movie make it a delightful movie that can be watched over and over and still not completely gotten. However, it does stray from the book quite a bit. If you are looking for a strict version of the book, such as the P&P miniseries, this is not it. The movie does not even do what Emma and S&S do, not only does it skip scenes but it invents new plots, changes characters,and so on. Whether the movie is better for it, I cannot say. I do think though that Austen would not have had a problem with the movie. I feel that it is still in true Austen style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely awful!","review":"Rarely do I completely and wholeheartedly loathe an Austen adaptation. The Bollywood version Bride and Prejudice was delightful. The Kiera Knightley P&P; was ghastly, but mainly because the producers thought that a gentleman in 19th century Britain lived with chickens in his manor house. Shudder!But this was so completely horrible that I can't encourage anyone to watch it under any circumstances. It has NOTHING whatever to do with the Austen novel. Someone bought the title and then created an anti-slavery shock-and-rock period piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I thought I was getting the movie, not a walk-through with the director - rather disappointed. This was my first time to buy on-line and evidently I did not read the description like i should have. There is also some glitches in the DVD - I didn't see any scratches, but it pauses, like it was stuck, wavy lines etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Entertaining","review":"The movie was mostly entertaining. They made a big deal out of Sir Thomas owning slaves but never took it anywhere or resolved it. They also had Fanny do something pretty major that was completely out of character.

This was a true enough depiction of the novel, but the characters were grating in a way that wasn't especially endearing. The costuming wasn't even that interesting to look at, and the affected asides just made me roll my eyes.

Most of the book is basically a diary of day to day activites, but if this is interesting to you, you will enjoy it.

Its hard to fathom how he did it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful \\"Alaskana\\" read","review":"Sure the writing style isn't polished and there is little action, but I think that is what helps makes this such an enjoyable book.

There is enough good here for me to add this to my extensive Alaskana library for long term keeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best outdoor novel ever..","review":"I saw the movie that accompanies this book on PBS. After seeing the film that Dick Proennecke made himself, I had to have this book. Dick has lived out the dream of living in the untamed wilderness of Alaska.

I wasnt too sure though if he would be in love with the book or not but I got it anyway for him as a Christmas gift.He started reading it and didnt want to put it down. He would read to me some of the journals he wrote and I felt such a calmness and so peaceful inside from the readings. Very down to earth and real. Every time my husband read his book he would get a little bummed out on how he wants to try and live in the wilderness and knows that is where true happiness comes from.I think it brings us back down to earth from this fake society we live in. Shows us what really brings happiness in life and how we can better ourselves.Very well written book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, leaves you with a yearning to experience something similar","review":"I'm not near tough enough to handle it like Proenneke, but I'd like to get out into the quiet and spend some time there.

Just a really great read about an interesting character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two unknown masterworks, two master performances.....","review":"I believe Dvorak's third symphony was pivotal in his conception of this genre. Upon comparing it to his first and second, one can hear differences in virtuosity and melodic scope but one also hears a first rate account given by this Slovak orchestra. The three movements radiate with texture, complex voicing and rustic fervor. A terrific offering!The sixth is amazing. Very rarely heard anymore in any concert hall, this symphony is one of Dvorak's finest ever, only comparable to his seventh. The performance here is just as amazing. The woodwinds' work in this Dvorak cycle are unsurpassed as well as Gunzenhauser's ability to balance the orchestral voices. Although he seems to have kept the third movement somewhat reserved, there isn't a single intimate moment lost throughout. The spirit of the score is conveyed quite heartily which makes for enjoyable listening.

I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of his sexual encounters with guys and dolls for a while, also the lists of various meals, but the getting stoned and rambling on philosophy was soooo Seventies! I flipped ahead but that was about it for the rest of the book. And unfortunately, when producing the book in 2002 from his old journals, the author decided to \\"publish my journal exactly as I wrote it,\\" with the unfinished sentences and syntax errors. This is too much enchantment with one's own process for my taste. Even Anais Nin edited her journals before she published them the first time (and not just to keep out the naughty bits, either)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant for Understanding Axis II","review":"Should have read this long ago.

Rebecca Brown's husband, Daniel Yoder (real name: William Stewart) has a criminal record with multiple convictions for various types of fraud.

I figured it would be nice to have a new one, just for a change of pace. I honestly didn't expect it to be harder than the others -- but wow! This is a serious, intense, body-changing workout.I felt pretty dorky at first, because the moves can be complicated and aren't the same basic moves that other workouts use. I'm guessing I'll need at least two more run-throughs before I feel like I actually know what I'm doing the whole time.But if it were so easy to follow that I could get it the first time, then it would wind up being really boring really quickly. I'll trade complicated/interesting for simple/boring any day. (Contrast that with Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred which, to me, was both hard to follow AND overly repetitive.)Thanks, Rebecca!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"I have some of the older Firm workouts and really enjoy them. More recently I have been doing local bootcamps and P90x, based on the good reviews I purchased the Firm Get Chisel'd and the Bootcamp Maximum Calorie Burn for a change of pace.

The workout goes by very fast because it is fun and challenging. Definitely one of my favorites from the Firm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Good workout!","review":"This is an overall good full body workout. I definitely was sweating when I was through. The workout alternates between cardio sections and weight training sections. My only problem with is that the cardio segments aren't quite long enough to get your heart rate going for an extended period of time. With that being said, after I was done with the whole thing including the bonus 15 min. workout I felt really great and like it was a good workout. If you are looking for a huge cardio push this probably isn't the right workout for you. If you want an overall good toning workout with some short bursts of elevated heartrate then it's great! I am going to use this on some of my easier days. Also the instructor is not real personable it sounds like she is reading everything she says but it's not buggy enough to keep me from doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I've taken alot of classes at the gym and this DVD is fantastic. She keeps it interesting and the workout flies by. Make sure you have light and medium weights that you can hold together for the few times she wants you to use heavy weights. The Ab section at the end is unique, you work your abs, your arms, and your lower body all at once. The 15 minute cardio section is also much better than I expected, perfect if you want to squeeze a quick workout into a busy day. She's quick on changing moves in the warm up, but so what! It's a DVD that you do again and again. I definetly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"Get Chisel'd definitely works you out, and the \\"power\\" lunges kill!

Morgaine is an excellent heroine, breaking a lot of the lame stereotypes that lesser writers have fallen back on when it was too much effort to create a strong, unique female protagonist. If you appreciate a heroine who is all business and only fleetingly vulnerable, Morgaine is the genuine article. Vanye makes the perfect foil to her: fallible, afraid, loyal, and very human.To give just one example of Cherryh's descriptive talents without spoiling the book, if you close your eyes and visualize when Morgaine draws her primary weapon, a shiver will probably go down your back. Rare indeed is the author who can scare you without resorting to grossness.You could save time by ordering _Well of Shiuan_, _Fires of Azeroth_, and _Exile's Gate_ at the same time you order this one. If you order this one you are going to want the other three anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most useful biography","review":"Pat Williams' character-focused study exactly satisfied my hope for \\"How to Be Like Walt\\". Williams draws transferable life-lessons and makes clear that Disney's impact happened because of both good Providence and the application of principles that anyone can practice: hope, perseverance, faith, drive for excellence, and helping other people to be successful in the team effort. I grew up with Walt, as did many of my age (60), in the sense of soaking up all his creative products; I became acquainted with the general outlines of his public life, and his collaborators. This book provides not more facts, but much inspiration, and is well worth its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persist and give value","review":"The author clearly showed the different aspects of Disney's life and why he was so successful. Disney wanted his comics, movies, Disneyland, and other projects to be the best he could manage. Thoughout his life, he risked his money and reputation on bigger and bigger projects, trying repeatedly to do better work. Money was a major obstacle for his brother Roy who had to arrange financing for Walt's growing needs. Disney's life is a model for bold, risk-taking leaders who want to do better at whatever they undertake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Book into the Characteristics that Made Disney Great","review":"This book's format, which includes the most relevant details of Walt Disney's life, as well as an analysis of the key choices he made throughout his career and in his personal dealings, reveals a full picture of the man's character in ways that you would expect other, more long-winded Disney biographies might. While Disney had his flaws just like any man (some of which are mentioned), this book is about accentuating the positive and it does so not in an artificial manner, but in ways that you can truly apply to your own life. I believe the author, Pat Williams, is a successful person in his own right because he is a scholar of great people, including Disney. Although I would not classify myself as a reader of \\"inspirational\\" books, this one proved very inspirational for me. I highly recommend it to anyone interested not only in the basics of Disney, but what we can take away from his extraordinary life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A feel-good and charming biography with lots of insight for living","review":"More than a sugary biography of Walt Disney, it's an insider's look into the magic of Disney. Or rather the creation of it. Hard work, paying your dues, never saying quit are all values that make the greats great, but they defined Walt Disney, and the proof is definitely in the pudding. It makes a perfect read if you're just looking for interesting non-fiction, but a great book for anyone looking to learn some core values on the way up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"Simply put, this product DOES NOT work!

I prefer this game because it has great lessons by an International Master. So it can be used by kids and adults alike. It also has a Fun Mode where you can learn the VERY basics without any pain.One of the greater things about this is that it has so many opponents that it will always give you a challenge. Be warned that some of the opponents do not play in proportion to their rating. In Play/Training mode it readies you to face people to up your rating in Play/Rating mode. In this mode it's do or die.

This is the most beautifully rendered chess software yet. It is so beautiful that it makes the entire playing experience much more pleasurable. The 3d graphics are astounding. The natural language advice (and analysis) with an actual synthetic (and amazingly natural sounding) voice almost brought tears to my eyes, I learn something new every game thanks to this!.

I wasn't lucky enough to get the clerk a previous reviewer got - they wouldn't even give me store credit to buy a Vista game. Anyone want a free Chessmaster 10 for XP?

The software requires you to have the install CD in the CD-ROM drive all the time!!!!!3. The game takes 10 seconds to load because the start-up sequence and other crap on the screen can not be disabled.4. If you leave the game on in the background, after a couple of hours the game becomes very, very unresponsive. And slowly your computer comes to a halt.The manufacturer of this software should be penalized for releasing this buggy piece of crap.

But its engine is notas good as Fritz 9. I would recommend buying both ofthem if you really want to improve. The problem withneeding a CD to run is solved with a new patch CMX 10.03from the Chessmater website. It runs fine WITHOUT CDdisk in the CD drive NOW. All other good things mentionedby other reviews are true. For me, I will add:1. Unmatched learning tools, Chess Academy and others. Thisalone worths the price for the software.2. For rated game under 1500, it makes unrealistic mistakes,not behave like a human player. For playing chess, getFritz. There is no match in playing ability.Conclusions:If you are below 1500, you will learn a lot from CMX's ChessAcademy. So, buy CMX for learning or training young kids.If you are above 1500 or even 1300, need a chess partner,get Fritz 9. You are not going to improve by playing withCMX.

Some of the good things said are true, too. But does the good outweigh the bad? Let me put it this way: If customers were allowed to test-drive this loser-program before paying for it, Ubisoft would be bankrupt in no time flat.No, no, don't believe me....-- Go ahead. Buy it. Join the rest of us suckers. Misery loves company.:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont even waste your time","review":"I wonder what the hell UBI was thinking.First of all you always need the cd in your drive to play...retarded. what if you have a tablet? are you going to carry that external cd drive with you everywhere just because you want to play chess? what if your running on battery power? are you gonna drain your laptop battery just cause you want to play chess?secondly forget about even trying to backup this cd. the amount of copy protection on it ...and upon all this the engine is faulty! a lot of times my opponent makes moves that are obviously wrong and that any chess amateur could see.. even when the ratings are in the 2000+ ration. This software is a total waste of time.dont even bother to use the only gameplay... have to enter a 16 digit cd key everytime you login. get fritz instead!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascist copy-right protection.","review":"Automatic 1 star for punishing legit owners of the game. This is typical of the BS that UbiSoft has imposed on gamers:I bought the PC version of Grandia II, which they published, and, although it was extremely buggy, not a single patch was released...If you absolutely must play a game by Ubi****, I suggesst you not pay for it.(Note a mes amis Quebecois: UbiSoft est control�� par le Parti Liberal du Quebec. LIBEREZ NOUS DES LIBERAUX!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It dosen't work on CD/Writer or Burner","review":"After I loaded the game on my Laptop, it never could start with the CD constantly spinning in my CD rom. According to their tech support at NC, it won't work on CD burner for the sake of illegal duplication. His suggestion was that I need to buy an external plain CD rom to play this game. This info should have been printed on their product box!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection makes it useless","review":"I like to play chess when I travel with my laptop. I needed a program that would be self-contained after installation. This is not it. Ubisoft makes you insert one of the original CDs, every time you try to start up you \\"full installation\\" from your hard drive. This is just wrong. When I travel, I don't even have my CD-ROM drive. In it's place is an extra battery. I feel like I've been ripped off by Ubisoft. If you care about fair use rights, don't support this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic software deployment requires the disc everytime.","review":"The folks who designed this software should go back to kindergarten. How on earth does anyone make a software that does not install onto a hard drive, is beyond me? Are these guys so paranoid about their intellectual property that they forgot the fundamentals of software deployment? Not everyone likes to carry around a CD with their laptop, once a software is installed. I'm sick and tired of software designers who do not trust that many people who use software actually pay for it and buy it. Josh Waitzkin should reasses his association with UBISOft. In their brilliant attempt to thwart piracy, they have created a totally useless piece of software, especially for the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teaching Aid","review":"While Chessmaster is a great way to play a game if you're missing a human opponent, it's real strength lies in its chess lessons.I've known *how* to play chess for many years but have never really been very good at it. I would usually lose or, at best, stalemate. I knew the rules and the legal moves of each of the pieces but didn't know how to take those and develop more sophisticated strategies and tactics that might take my game to the next level.Chessmaster has gone a long way towards fixing that. The lessons strike the right balance of information and \\"quizzes\\" (quizzes in the form of \\"white has mate in three moves - find it\\" and the like).I can't recommend Chessmaster highly enough! The value for the price can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"This is a terrible product, and I say this as a formerly loyal Chessmaster fan who has used three previous versions of the program. Other reviewers have pretty much covered the problems with this product; I want to emphasize the insensitivity (?dishonesty) of the manufacturers in not making it clear under what restrictive conditions (dedicated CD drive, disk always in the drive, incompatibility with many other programs, etc, etc) it can be used. It's just not worth the hassle and the risk.Buy Fritz (or Shredder, or Rebel, or Hiarcs). These (and other programs) can be set at different levels of expertise, provide you with fun and training for years. And Fritz interacts with Chessbase, the chess database that most leading chess professionals use, so that even if you get up to grandmaster level, you will still find the program useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Windows 2000 compatible!","review":"For all of you that have had bugs with this program running, you need to know that it is not compatible with Windows 2000. Furthermore, UBI has not in the past and will not in the future make it's Chessmasters 2000 compatible. You are better off with Fritz.Others have already mentioned the install problems due to the copy protection of the CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimum requirements must not be possible","review":"I bought this game two days ago for 20 bucks and now I see why. First I will state my PC info.....2 GB DDR sync ramAMD 64 bit CPU running at 2GHzWindows XPDirect X 9.0c512 mb pc-express x 16 ATU graphics cardThat should be enough info and enough to run any game.But not this one. I can play it, and it does not crash, but you have to wait a good 10 seconds to make a move for the program to catch up and you lose time on your timed game. Also, even with FULL installation and the CD in the drive, the voice overs skip. I can play Doom3 all day and never does it skip a beat. Thief Deadly Shadows runs like a dream. Not chessmaster though. Once the PC made the next move before I even got to put my piece down. Just awful. And they just do not seem to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Chess Computer or Another Software","review":"I have been a user of various Chessmaster packages for Windows and Mac for many many years. Recently, they have been a disappointment, using copy protection that inhibits legitimate users from enjoying the game.Using a notebook computer on batteries? Better play a fast game before the constantly-running CD wears down the power.Don't like hunting for the CD everytime you play? You'll have to.Get irritated if Chessmaster stops other programs from running? That is totally inexusable and downright rude.I'm sure there's a great chess engine in there, but who cares, the software is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not By This Product!!!","review":"Foolish me, I should have read the other reviews before I bought this product.

My daughter's favorite is the fairy tale animated chess board, where the pegasus Rook flies from one square to another. The game automatically redesigns itself to suit the player's age -- for example, young beginners will receive easy enough opponents that they won't get frustrated. The lessons are interesting, well split into small units, and sprinkled with wonderful \\"try it out\\" exercises. All told, I'm thrilled.I have a three year old computer and had no troubles getting this game to run.

So far I am very pleased with this purchase. Great tutorials and playing games in Training Mode helps me figure out how to use what I learn in the tutorials. Just these features alone make the game more than worth the purchase price in my mind.Negative Points about this product:There is one thing that I find HUGELY ANNOYING about this product...every time you start the game the CD must be in your CD/DVD drive. The more I use the game the more negatively I perceive the product because of this \\"feature\\". Without the CD \\"feature\\" I would rate this 5 stars.

It stated that I had a CD\\\\DVD emulation software on my pc and it had to be removed. Ubisoft copy protection is to blame. It looks for any clone software such as CloneCD, Alcohol 120%, Daemon Tools, etc., that use CD\\\\DVD emulation. If it finds any it will not start the program even though you have the original Ubisoft cd in the drive. What they are doing is telling you what you can and cannot have on your own computer. After I found this out, I brought my Chessmaster 10 back to Best Buy. The computer tech geek there was so upset when I explained and showed him why there was a problem that he gave me a full refund despite a store policy of no refunds on open software. He said he had some of this same clone software on his own pc. As for me, Ubisoft has lost a customer. Never again will I buy their software."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews","review":"I paid good money for this game and I can't play it.

It includes snippet interviews of the other UP film series, but these are identical to what you will find in the \\"flashbacks\\" in the 42 UP film. There is a little bit extra here from the 35/42 Uppers than in the movie but not enough to be hyped as \\"never-before-available out-takes from 35 UP and 42 UP\\". The interviews themselves are raw transcripts without descriptive comments like \\"sighs\\", \\"laughs\\", \\"winces\\" which would help put the verbal comments in perspective.It saddened me to see such classy people like Michael Apted and Roger Ebert involved in this book project which clearly came from a marketing person. This book will not enhance your experience of 42 UP in the least.My advice is to get the 42 UP series DVD and listen to Michael Apted's commentary track.

Even the ending is bizarre. It stops in the middle of relationship and unresolved loss. Okay, we get the picture when you say this is book #1, but come on, this isn't a TV serial with a new season coming up. I want books that have closure.

I always enjoy books about the Amish. While I don't agree with their beliefs, I admire their dedication to their simple life-style. We \\"Englichers\\" are pretty soft people when it comes to giving up our modern conveniences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I chose four stars because the storyline was so engaging. I could not put the book down. I was even tempted to read this book at church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"I could not put this book down.

This was my first Kindle book and it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book--Learned About the Amish","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Also, it was a nice clean book without lots of questionable things for a young person."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Covenant","review":"Was an excellent book. Could not wait to reach book #2. Really made you think about my faith and or lack of."},{"rating":"2","title":"right gut","review":"This is a nice introduction to the author and genre. I read this with my mom. We both couldn't put it down. Leah and Sadie are two sisters going down different paths. This book follows their divergent journeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting more!!!","review":"Very good book but I wanted to know more of what had happened to the characters. The ending left me with tons of questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covenant review","review":"This book was awesome! 5 stars! I a want to read the next book \\"the betrayal!I cannot wait until I can get the next book! I could not put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to begin with...","review":"Started out slow, but picked up half way through. I can't wait to read the next one in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I live next door to an Amish Family and although some of the situations in this book would never occur next door, there was also alot in common. I already knew of the singings, etc. I am dying to get the next book. Can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"Book was dissappointing. Full of deception and secrets...unlike the Amish. Also full of characters who cared more of their own pleasure then concern or care for each other, again, unlike the Amish. A mother who basically turns her back on one of her children...even during Rumspringe, Amish parents are concerned, involved and caring, not at all like Sadie's mother is portrayed. A child as well behaved as Leah would have never ignored the issues she did in this book without turning to her guildance system, parents, bishop, etc for help. I won't read further. I already know where the author is going. No one will find any joy in this series...or if they do, it will be after a life wasted on lies and secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Beverly Lewis knows how to spin a tale. I especially enjoy how she brings our Lord into her novels, and I love reading about the Amish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Covenant","review":"Any of Beverly Lewis' books are going to be outstanding. This particular series was so interesting and I enjoyed it very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is so captivating!!!","review":"I was drawn into this at the beginning. And, I stayed up too late a few times just because I had to find out what happened next. I hope they offer a special price or FREE soon on the 2nd book. I need to continue the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull characters, boring story","review":"I'm forcing myself to finish this book with little actual interest other than finding out if my predictions will come true. I understand that this is a well-known, much loved author, but I won't be buying anything more by her. I'm grateful that this was a free download to my Kindle because I really feel \\"meh\\" about the plotting and characters. Sorry if I've offended anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the look into Amish girl life","review":"This was my first time reading this author. The book keep my interest to the end.

Trust me on this: you won't be disappointed!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The covenant","review":"This book was amaturishly written . I felt as if it were for preteens instead of adults. Regretfully, cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Covenant (Abram's Daughters book 1)","review":"I was glad to find out that the book continues. I became frustrated at the end of book 1, not realizing that it was a \\"to be continued\\" novel. Lewis sets up her characters well, but leaves all the story lines hanging at the end. I am compelled to read the series now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Convenant Abraham's daughters #1","review":"I was very happy to read this first book The Covenant. I look forward to reading the next book. It was a quick read and I enjoyed the plot of the book.

The ending leaves u wanting to read more. I would recommend this book to any one who likes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amish teaser","review":"This is not the kind of book I usually read. (A story about the Amish? Yawn!) It was a gift . I probably wouldn't have bought it myself. But I'm glad I read it. The book was a bit slow paced at first-like what we imagine Amish life to be - but before long I was hooked! If Ms. Lewis doesn't hurry up and write the sequel ( Abram's Daughters 2), I'll break out in a rash. I guess I'll just have to read her other books in the meantime! Did I mention there is no graphic sex, violence, or swearing? And you DON'T CARE!! There is love, mystery, happiness, tragedy, loyalty, all the ingredients of a good read. Just what I like in a book. I'm itchin' to read the next installment in the lives of Abram's daughters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Pleasant Read","review":"Having taken vacations yearly to Lancaster County all through my childhood and often in my adulthood I was especially drawn to this book.It did not disappoint.It is beautifully written and filled with charming characters and full of knowledge about the Plain People. I can't wait to finish the series so I can find out the ending of all these dramas.I have to know what happens to people who are so well defined they make you feel you know them in life.Read this enjoy it and you'll agree."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const L=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-31519805"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/47.md","filePath":"people/47.md"}'),H={name:"people/47.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
