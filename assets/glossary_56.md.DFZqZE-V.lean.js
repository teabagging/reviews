Women are portrayed so often as solid creatures that know exactly what they want. The men are always the ones who are confused and stray. What I think is important here is how this movie explains what goes on in a woman's mind. What a woman must sacrifice Women are sensual creatures by nature, and as Billy pointed out near the end \\"real life and romance do not generally go hand in hand\\". I think all to often women sacrifice their sensual side for that of family and security.

On the drive back from the airport, Red talked about the origins of the song \\"Phantom 309\\". Red let me sit in on one his radio interviews with a local station. He even let me carry his guitar case! Another thing I distinctly remember was those black rimmed eyeglasses. He was truly a fine gentleman and a class act.

Must admit I haven't heard of A Fine Frenzy' but was game enough to try one of the Amazon recommendations when I bought Coco by Colbie Caillat.

There is 1 awesome song and 2 or 3 OK songs. The rest pretty much sucks. Almost all of the songs sound the same for the first 5 or 6 times i listened to the CD. The lyrics are a bit pretentious and it sounds like she wicshes she was famous not a good musician just my opinion. Go buy an Ivy, Sarah Blasko, Natalie Merchant, or Laura Veirs CD. You will be much happier with your purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Good Songs","review":"Don't waste your money on this one. It only has 2 good songs on it that I listen to.

I don't think the vocals are all that strong, and was surprised by all of the praise for her voice in the other reviews. The songwriting is OK, nothing special, and the keyboarding is just back up. I agree with the reviewers who felt that it got boring as it went along. I did enjoy parts of the first few tracks, which are simple but pleasant enough. This album seems best suited for a very young crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"disc unfriendly to mac computers","review":"This CD (disc, case, book) is in great shape and I love the album.

Their products are not very useful to me.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Fine Song Only","review":"This artist is okay.

I don't think she's that great; the only good song is Almost Lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has such a pretty voice, but......","review":"It's only too bad that I just couldn't get into this album. I got this album on the recommendation of a friend, since we're both into female singer-songwriters, but this one just left me cold.I really wanted to like this one, because Alison is indeed a very talented pianist and singer. But for me, the songs were all so melancholy and same-sounding, that I was left feeling very depressed when the record was over. If only she had included some more upbeat songs; she certainly could do it with her voice.Overall, guess this just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable lyrics","review":"I saw recommendations for this album on Brandi Carlile and Colbie Caillat's pages so I gave it a shot without sampling first. What a mistake. The first time I listened to the album, I was instantly turned off. The lyrics were predictable. If rhymey was a word, it would be very fitting. I thought I may have been a bit harsh at first so I gave it another shot. Same reaction. I will be trading in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fine ??? Frenzy","review":"Big let down all the way around. She changed her album cover, and it looks like death now. Almost Lover is the only decent song. She needs to throw the rest of it out to sea! Beautiful girl, horrible music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Major-Label Debut","review":"A Fine Frenzy's first studio album, ONE CELL IN THE SEA, marks a promising start for the band and in particular, singer/songwriting Alison Sudol. Unfortunately, the production on the album lends itself to generic top-40 pop music. Even so, there are many times where the songwriting overcomes the bland production to create memorable, (and remarkable) pop songs. For example, \\"Almost Lover\\" drops most of the music in favor of Sudol with a lone piano accompaniment, and the results are outstanding. On ONE CELL IN THE SEA, we find Sudol still working on finding her creative voice. The lyrics and music are all personal, but it is sometimes lost in the noise.In terms of A Fine Frenzy, I prefer the second album,Bomb In A Birdcage. Either album is a good place to start listening to the band. Fans of Ingrid Michaelson, Sara Bareilles, or Feist will love a lot of these songs. Recommended tracks to sample/download: \\"Almost Lover,\\" \\"You Picked Me,\\" and \\"Come On, Come Out.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"one cell in the sea","review":"This CD is way out of my usual genre of music but I heard them perform on Leno one night and couldn't get the song Rangers out of my head.

I like to know what the singer is saying and with this CD I've no idea what she is singing, the words are all mumbled, maybe she had too much to drink, not sure, but sure don't like it. Needless to say my garbage can has already received this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I read some of the other reviews and I'm happy that some people were able to get something out of this album but somehow, I never could. I listened and listened to the songs thinking, \\"This has got to be for me because she's recommended based on other female singer-songwriters that I love.\\" However, instead of loving this album, I was bored and frankly, a little irritated by the boredom that insued from listening. Lyrics were dull, music was all the same and I would say to people looking for a good female singer-songwriter try: Brandi Carlile, Regina Spektor, Tori Amos' older stuff, Missy Higgins, and/or the first My Brightest Diamond album. But don't bother with this one, you can do so much better!I really wanted to like this but I really didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"just so pretty","review":"This is a really great album if you want something really pretty and melodic to listen to.

In my opinion, MUCH better then the Toris of this world (she also happens to be stunning-looking, but that shouldn't be part of a cd review :-))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've Heard in a While","review":"This is the best album I've heard in a good long time. Great hooks and memorable lyrics in every track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, beautiful ... positively different.","review":"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. Alison Sudol has a wonderful voice, and a way of drawing in the listener and leaving you wanting more. I have listened to this CD in its entirety several times, and for me there just aren't any songs I want to skip. The music is beautifully arranged, and her voice works with the score to enhance each song even more.Have a listen to the Amazon snippets of her music, and if you like what you hear, as I did, then you will most likely love this compilation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing voice and talent","review":"This is simply one of the best talents Ive come across in a while...excellent voice, lyrics and music.

What makes a truly incredible album (in my opinion) is one that takes time to absorb, where you're always hearing something new in the music. One Cell In The Sea is mellow and soothing and it took me a few listens to really get into all of the songs but every time I listen to it I hear something that I missed before. This album is a true gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had heard people gushing about this album, so I decided to get it. I wish I hadn't. While Alison Sudol does have a very lovely voice, it is lost in the editing and back-up vocals. My main issue, though, is that all the songs sound the same; I have a difficult time telling them apart. And it's sad, because I really want to like this album. But I just can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST GOOD MUSIC.","review":"She hits all the right notes, and poetically voices wonderful lyrics. To be self taught and only playing for 3-4 years and have this sound in an album is exceptional. Her cd has been in constant play for the past 4 months. Waiting for he next one with much anticipation. My only wish is that she was a Christian singing for God. Her music is extremely delightful. Good job Alison, and mini-band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly beautiful voices","review":"For all of you that are moved by hauntingly beautiful voices such as Alison Sudol's, check out Over the Rhine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I like this album so much, but it's not my favourite. Sometimes I've got the feeling that some songs resemble the others so much is kind of annoying. Even so, This album is really good in my opinions: you should let it grow on you. And the sound is so... delicate that sounds perfect every time you're feeling blue. I reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Cell In The Sea!!!","review":"Alison is such a phenominal singer/ songwriter, with wisdom and maturity way beyond her years!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine New Sound","review":"I saw this trio perform on Jay Leno's Tonight show. I was instantly taken with the fact a band would have the audacity to feature only a keyboard, piano and drums. Allison has a marvelous voice and the music stylings are as rapturously unique as once was attributed to Norah Jones. Long may this group live."},{"rating":"1","title":"the meter maid made a meat-eater out of me","review":"This book is truly awful. It's an attack on Platinga and Forbes' views (well, and of course Lewis as well) concerning actualism, possibilism, modal realism, and related areas. It is poorly written, the arguments are unconvincing, and the logic, where it occurs, is unmotivated and uninteresting. There is virtually nothing novel to be found in the whole book, though I confess to not having read the *whole* thing. I made it roughly half way, and that was quite unbearable. I even read reviews and went over the stuff that was supposedly interesting, but it turned out just more of the same crap.The book hardly even deserves a review, except to warn others with a serious interest in metaphysics and good philosophy to avoid it. And with that I shall close."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Release - Anamorphic Format","review":"Why would Disney do this second release of The Cat From Outer Space (first DVD release was in 1999) without going to \\"Family Friendly\\" anamorphic format?Why would anyone want a non-anamorphic format?

Instead of black and white, this movie is in color. The movie is filled with quirky one-liners and good old-fashioned shoddy acting, so it is still worth the money for anyone fond of older movies, or something kids would love.Also, clocking in at almost two hours, it's a little too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie, with more emphasis on the younger kids","review":"The kids enjoyed it, and even we did.

Definitely a typical \\"older\\" Disney film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite flicks - then and now","review":"The Cat From Outer Space... this was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid that came from the very early 80s. Talking felines, flying bug-like spaceships, a very 'lite sci fi' plot that you can sink your teeth into... I think the Disney Channel (back when it wasn't just low budget pre-teen fare) showed this movie atleast two or three times a month and I probably watched it each time. After nearly a decade later or more, I saw it again for the first time about two years ago and was delighted, it was still a fun flick to take in over some popcorn. Just ignore some of the cheesy effects and you'll make it through fine. A 'gateway' sci fi film that serves as the portal to getting into 'harder sci fi' with bigger spaceships, planetary attacks on earth, giant buglike space aliens and all that good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles?","review":"Where is closed captions or English subtitles? :-(When I was young, I loved to watch it but I don't understand a story as I am deaf.

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because i have 3 Bratz Babyz (Sasha, Roxxi and Phoebe) and they do get boring after a while. So, just a heads up to all you parents- eventually your child will probably get sick of their Bratz Baby. So if you have a child who wants something, gets it, gets sick of it, and asks for something else (and then the cycle starts over again and again and again) then the smartest move would probably be to not buy it. But if you have a child who wants something, gets it, and is happy with it I think you should definitely buy this. Now, I'm not saying this is a boring, stupid toy that shouldn't have been made. I just wanted to give a little warning. So, anyway, I think Meygan is so adorable and if you are a Bratz collector you should definitely add her on to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever","review":"This is definitly my faveorite bratz babyz.

This OLDie is a keystone cop type, poor quality, poorly acted, poorly edited joke. You don't laugh at jokes, you laugh at the movie itself. It might have been entertaining in the 1930's but not now.

The image quality of this DVD is about the worst I have ever seen and I therefore urge you NOT to buy this edition.

Audio hisses at the beginning but gets marginally better which isn't saying much as it's so very poor to begin with. At times you can't make out what the actors are saying.Save your money, folks. Even a die hard John Wayne fan like me feels like a fool for ordering from a company called Passion Productions (a division of PMC Corp). If you can purchase it for 99 cents go ahead but that's all it's worth.Even if this DVD had been digitally remastered it does not qualify as a classic. It's representative of similar movies from the early 1930's, which makes it interesting, but not a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding portrait of an important political leader","review":"Every student of U.S. politics or Arizona history should read this book. Carson and Johnson thoroughly and brilliantly chronicle the life of a man who profoundly influenced the course of America in ways that politicians of greater renown never did.

Unlike the previous reviewer, however, I think Boreanaz's strongest role is as a leading man in an action movie with, of course, some of those funny quips. He is so great in Bones and was wonderful in Angel. He's an alpha male and shines in those roles.As for the movie itself, the plot was unlikely, but most movies are. I liked all the characters and think the movie took some great plot twists. You just never knew who was going to get shot next! Now, that's entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good vehicle for David's talents","review":"This film is really bad - if there was a zero star rating that's what I'd have given it. I was watching it from the perspective of a David Boreanaz fan but, even so, I had to force myself to keep watching until the end. The plot concerns two separate groups of people plotting the same heist. Potentially this could have had hilarious consequences but the writers forgot to inject any humour into the script. The role of Roger really was a waste of David's talents. He has such a gift for romantic comedy I have no idea why he would accept a role like this. It was certainly a mistake. Let's hope his next film is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"The wide brim is good for use if you've been out in the sun for a while.

Don't get me wrong, DAC does a good job; but his heart and soul appear to have gone as smooth as the Tennessee Whiskey he croons about. It's almost like he has sung these songs so many times that he is tired of cranking it up and just wants to lay back and relax.

The final verdict should be to find the two eras to be one and the same era, by a concordance of rational skepticisms. This collection of essays, perchance the philosophes to strike back, shows the inevitable reaction to the postmodern turn, with a return to renewed consideration of the original culprit history. We find there the birth of the modern and the postmodern together, witness the scrutiny of rationality in the period condemned for this trait. One should think Rousseau has outsmarted the lot, as he was pre-modern and the first postmodern, and the very one to ignite the modern, as a principal suspect. The problem was never the Enlightenment as much as the mechanized version of its significance.

It was almost mirror-like. C.S. Lewis' own experience and the answers he came to from the questions he had of God and life hit home for me. I found more help in this book than all the books that were recommended through my grief counseling class.Perhaps you need to have a brief and intensly happy marriage that is cut short to appreciate it as I did; perhaps greif in some ways is just universal.

This is a grief that has him questioning his belief in God and exposing the raw, painful, angry emotions that accompany his grieving process. There are many ways to grieve, but one thing is certain - it has to be faced, and Lewis has done just that in this book. The harsh reality that everyone who lives will die means that we must all face grief at some time if we haven't already done so. His experiences with grief are not unique, but he is to be applauded for sharing his palpable pain in a way that may help others who suffer a loss of such magnitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great but terribly hard book","review":"This is one of if not the best book on Grief.

But, more than that, it caused me to have empathy for his devastating feelings of loss and, ultimately, of hope in a new day. The epiphany he shared that when he finally let go of his anger and grief, is when the spirit of his wife became clear and he was able to remember her as she really was, was both inspirational and revealing. He discovered that the grief was keeping him from being able to remember her face and hearing her words clearly. It occurred to me that sometimes one may wallow in grief for a very long time, the grief itself becoming a compensation for the loss one feels. He found that in letting go, finally, he let her in and he was comforted.The book is one to keep and re-read at a time when one may need to remember.Francesca Molanphy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very honest, very helpful","review":"Like the other reviewers have noted, here Lewis is at his best when he's at his worst, so to speak, since he is able to turn his sharp, honest, and descriptive mind upon himself to reveal the inner tensions, doubts, and hopes that linger around us when we are in sorrow over loss.

I found this book awfully unoriginal, dreadfully boring and quite unengaging and unappealing. Giving this book two stars is only because the writing was superb. The author articulates emotion so vividly and well. Very realistic. Every emotion was described in detail.

I read this book, I read it very slow to make sure nothing was missed. This book rambled on, with meaningless sentences, very complicated hard to read pages and at the end of it, I had learned nothing except he truly loved his wife and she suffered until the end of her life, and it is his thoughts of her after her death. There was not one single thing I could apply to my own life or use as something to comfort others. The bottom line for me is 1} I would not read it again 2} I would not buy it as a gift for someone enduring grief. sincerely, r. jeansonne"},{"rating":"2","title":"Byron's Review","review":"The book was exactly as advertised and I received it much faster than expected.

The book was in excellent condition. Stellar service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well loved classic","review":"Over the years, this is probably the most popular book among my clients.Personally I'm not terribly fond of memoirs (thus the 4 stars), because they're only one person's perspective. Grief is way too varied and unique for that experience to be relevant to everyone else.That said, this one resonates with many people who are grieving, and has withstood the test of time. So I'm breaking my rule about not recommending memoirs, and do recommend you check this one out.Susan L. FullerAuthor ofHow to Survive Your Grief When Someone You Love Has Died"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Insight Into the Grief Struggle","review":"I felt like I was reading C.S. Lewis' unedited stream of consciousness, which is why I loved the book on one level but it was also hard to sort through at times. Lewis is vulnerable about his questions and struggles; he wrestles openly with God. It is a gift to read a prolific Christian writer journey openly through his hardship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Glimpse at Lewis the person","review":"First of all, I should note that I read an older edition of the book without the forward.Some reviewers have noted that the book helped them through grief while others felt otherwise. I will leave those opinions to be discussed by those who have had more experience with them and will consentrate on the book's revelation of Lewis as a person.\\"A Grief Observed\\" is at times a powerful and emotional look into C.S. Lewis's grief after the loss of his wife to cancer. Lewis had seen suffering before, he had lived through the Western Front in WWI, but Gresham's death may have been the greatest blow of his life. His journal captures some of his reconsiderations of faith, inner sorrow, and finally a return to faith. Overall a concise and interesting personal story of dealing with grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and true","review":"CS Lewis looks death into the face; he does not flinch and does not console himself with platitudes. He had lost the love of his life and his pain is palpable to the reader. This is a raw and honest book but it is not at all depressing: At the end of the book, Lewis begins to recover: his wish is simply that, on his own death bed, his lover will come back to him and give him the consolation of seeing her face again.Rather surpisingly, I was diagnosed with terminal cancer myself three weeks after doing this review. The Lord gives, the Lord takes away, blessed be the name of the Lord! If you read this, say a prayer for me that I may die with courage and joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for grief","review":"This book obviously already has plenty of praising views, but I read this book and found it so great that I can't live with myself if I don't write a review. Coming from a kid who grieved a traumatic death, this book *IS* the book to buy if you're grieving, want to understand death, or want to find a book to help out a confused friend (no matter what age) who's grieving. It's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant piece of work","review":"this is the second c.s. lewis book i have read, the first being \\"the four loves.\\" after the four loves, this book was quite a stark contrast, but it was just as powerful and just as moving. it's short, and a very easy read. i read it in a day. but it's length doesn't matter. every page of this book is packed with profound insights. lewis didn't write this book to be read by others, he wrote it as a journal to vent his feelings over his wife's death. this book is, if nothing else, a window into the soul of a tortured man. quite possibly one of the best books i've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book of Great Beauty and Intelligence","review":"Although Lewis was, of course, a renowned and devout Christian, this book will speak to anyone who's lost someone with whom they shared real love. All of the questions, angers, and doubts that fill the mind during the numbing time following great loss are shared in the first person, generously, by Lewis. This is, I think, a beautiful, powerful, and deeply healing work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Widower's Journal","review":"CS Lewis began writing this journal one month after his wife died of cancer. He was distraught, shocked, and confused, especially about the meaning of life. The journal rambles from one throught to another, reflecting his daze and despair.I found the book rather difficult to read. It is only 72 pages long, but each sentence needs to be reread, carefully, in order to follow Lewis' thought processes. He finds no answers to his questions (mainly: How could God take his beloved away from him?); he simply asks them.For me, this was not a particularly helpful or insiteful book on grief, merely one person's thoughts on the subject. I am sure however, that admirers of CS Lewis would find it of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Support","review":"This booklet by C. S. Lewis is too cerebral; too spiritual; too philosophical for me. It did not provide the support I needed. The booklet \\"The Tander Scar\\" (also available from Amazon) by Richard Mabry is much more down to earth with practical guidance on what the grieving person will experience and how to cope with it. It was much more meaningful to me in my time of need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goju Ryu 03:Essence of Karate","review":"Higaonna greatly underachieves with this tape which has the potential to be a valuable addition to the martial artists video library.

There is no explanation of any of the keypoints of execution of the techniques. I would say the tape is \\"interesting\\" but the customer absolutely is not getting value for the money. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific, fun book","review":"This is a hit with both me and my daughter. It's a lot of fun to read aloud (and to hear read aloud!). The text is predictable and rhyming, which are both great for learning to read, and it teaches animal sounds. The pictures are bright and colorful. My daughter loves looking at the pictures, and she loves hearing me make the animal noises that go along with each page. We both love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even for young babies!","review":"I got this book for my daughter when she was a newborn, and she started reacting to it when she was only 2 months old. She smiles at the rhymes and at the brightly colored illustrations. It is also fun for the parent b/c you can embellish the story in so many ways while reading it--talking about the colors, counting animals, finding the goose & the butterfly on each page, etc. I'm sure there are several years of wondeerful readings ahead of us yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST!!!","review":"This book is simple yet fantastically fun and educational. My 7 month old loves to hear it and smiles as soon as I begin the first page. He can be in the throws of whaling anytime, anywhere and I begin to recite the rhyming animal noises and he just giggles! It is amazing how such a simple idea, so well written, can bring so much fun!

We adopted 2 large mixes this summer and at 8 months, they've broken one of the plastic clasps, so after 2 months we already have to replace the red collar part. Other than that, we've been very pleased with the ability to adjust the strength of the correction to suit the dog's personality and all 3 dogs stay in the yard now. We are even able to let the puppies out without a collar - we rotate the remaining good collar back and forth between them until we can get the other fixed. Take the time to train them to the collar the right way and you shouldn't have any problems. They know the beep and the flags and they understand what they mean.

This is the first collar we've had to replace. We have 2 big dogs and this contains them...most of the time.

Keep up on your battery replacements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second lost collar","review":"We hava a 120# mastiff/shepherd mix who has a very strong prey drive. The collar stops him in his tracks. Little training needed before he got the idea of where his bounderies are. The only problem is with the collar. He came in this morning without his collar - again. We searched all over the full boundry but were unable to find it. Leads me to beleive that perhaps battery died without warning and he was somehow able to rub his collar off. He would have had to un-fasten it as his head is too big for it to slip over. In process of ordering 3rd collar and can not help but agree that petsafe has us over a barrel. Wish it were not so expensive as this will probably mean top ramin soup for the rest of the month. Definately going to put receiver on a buckle type collar this time. Other than collar failure and price we love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"wireless fence colar","review":"Surprisingly seems to be working well on the dogs.

I don't know how that happened). until now i still can't find the two screws that attach the receiver to the collar so it's no use to me and i have to buy a new pair of collars.and the collar seems a bit short compared to my english mastiff's neck.other than that problems, the system works wonderfully. love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"petsafe wireless fence xtra recever","review":"Love the fence and the extra collars.. works great. keeps my dogs in the yard where they belong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"effective training tool","review":"Implemented according to directions in manual & accompanying video with original unit (previously purchased for first dog).

For almost a year after that experience she would avoid anything red - the color of the flags we used to do the training. She's a rescue dog, so there was likely some excess baggage from previous owners, but this experience set our training and progress back months. Do yourself and your dog a favor and never, ever buy these things, especially if your dog is even remotely sensitive or nuerotic.

The manual says to call customer service for a long prong/probe to use with long haired pets. Customer service wanted to charge me for the kit. First, the replacement collar is expensive enough that it should come with both short and long prongs. Second, the packaging should state an additional prong purchase is necessary for long haired dogs or PetSafe should send you the long prongs free of charge.

Unlike the wired inground systems, there are no wire breakage issues, and it will NOT shock your dog on the way back to your house if they managed to run through. The perimeter will always be a circle, so keep that in mind if you have a long, narrow lot. We have found the batteries much cheaper on amazon. The best price was $15 for a set of four, including shipping. Follow the video and set up the flags to train your dog. Do NOT just plug it in and let your dog find out for itself about the new perimeter. It will become neurotic and afraid of the yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Have a 2 1/2 year old beagle who was always getting out of the fenced in yard. This works great.

On trips with the animal you can even set this up wherever you stop for the night and the radio beacon will establish a safe perimeter for your pet to roam. Kind of pricy for both the necesssary radio transmitter and the collar (picured above) but we found it worth the expense. Batteries last about 3-4 months. It would be good if there were some competition to drive the price down a bit but, if you can aford it, this is the solution to keeping your pet close to home and safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bands are cheap and large dogs will chew them up","review":"I have three golden retrievers and after about 35 days they chewed the cheap red collars off of each other then chewed the receivers up. Unfortunately, the free warranty lasts only 30 days. I called PetSafe and as a one-time courtesy they are replacing the receivers and collars for $45 each.

I tried Huggies again with my daughter, but they just aren't as good a fit at the Pampers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service on my favorite diaper","review":"Diapers may be a personal choice for parents and their kids, but these Pampers Cruisers (formerly called Pampers Premium) have been wonderful for my first two children and our third will use them too. What is WONDERFUL is Amazon selling these and delivering them free with no sales tax. If I go to Sam's Club and buy them wholesale, the big box (equivalent to four of these Jumbo packs) is $28 + some change here in the Dallas area. You also pay sales tax and factor in the time you spend waiting in line and in the parking lot, etc. I just ordered four packs of these jumbos three days ago, and they arrived already, free of shipping, free of sales tax, and at $7.49 per pack I still spent less than I would have at Sam's. I'll DEFINITELY continue to take advantage of this if they continue to offer the diapers at $7.49 or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"THREE DOLLAR INCREASE","review":"I have been buying diapers on Amazon for several months and all of a sudden in the last couple weeks they increased the price by THREE DOLLARS! No longer is this the best solution to buy diapers. Go to Target -- They are cheaper there and take the pampers $1 off coupon that is in the paper almost weekly. BOOO on AMAZON for a ridiculous price increase. The grocery store even has a better price than this! The diapers are the best ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer a good bargain","review":"I heard from a friend that Amazon had great prices on diapers -- this is no longer true. $10.49 a pack is way more than any B&M store around.$7.99 was a great deal -- increasing the price to $10.49 a pack stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish Theater at its best","review":"This is a fantastic play written by Lope de Vega during el Siglo de Oro (the golden century)and has been recreated in this most excellent video. The costumes are beautiful, the scenes are fantastic and everything is very very well done. This is a classic Spanish Comedy full of beautiful poetry and flowing Spanish sonnets. A must see for all students of Spanish Theater, Spanish Culture, Spanish Literature or the Spanish Language."},{"rating":"1","title":"More BS from Jim Walls","review":"Gee, we have to have \\"Faith Based\\" organizations to change lives and neighborhoods across America. What a load of BS. From the day this country was formed there were people taking care of people whether faith was involved or not. Walls just loves to get preachy on the platform of righteousness. People who care about others are religious or not. They just have a basic need to get outside of EGO and place the welfare of others equal to their own. To place Religion doctrine (which is NOT necessarily \\"Christian\\") before the feeding of the hungry is as anti-Christian as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"sugary sweet\\" for me.","review":"I purchased this book for my 12 year old son and I to read, and we laughed so hard, we both were in tears. I'm a diabetic, and felt it necessary to check my blood sugar after reading how-it was SO sickeningly sweet! It seems to be lost in a time warp, far more apropos to the 1950's, rather than 2012, when I purchased it. We are Christians, and that was one of the book's selling points. Now that I have read it, I couldn't give it away-that's how bad it is.

She immediately asked me to buy copies for not only her own family, but for the library also.It is simple, yet packs such a powerful message for all pre-teens who may have questions that they don't feel comfortable asking their parents about.It also warns them of what to beware of when dealing with males and even touches on the dangers of the Internet and pornography.A great resource for schools and families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know how I missed...","review":"I don't know how I missed that this was a religious book.

The very first chapter turned me off of this author forever. If I ever do get bored enough to pick it up again, it will be for a laugh. I'm sorry, but there is a particular sentence towards the front of the book that is so stupid, I was embarrassed for the author. I bought the book because my two favorite authors didn't have any new books out so I decided to try something new. I wish I had saved my money. I don't usually give bad reviews, but....I had to do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly lively","review":"I liked this story a great deal and plan to keep the hardcover copy I bought as part of my collection. It wasn't overly dramatic but at the same time it made you sit up and think. I enjoyed how the heroine became part of what she had been brought into and the way she overcame things.

I thought I was going to go crazy if I heard about Raven exploring her \\"sexual\\" self again. Raven was a total twit, Heath was definitely hot, and I have no clue what attracted him to her. Oh, and the ending? Completely unbelievable. Two stars for Heath, and that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"What are you guys crazy? How could you leave such bad reviews?

Border Hostage was the last I will try. I found the sex scenes lewd and too graphic and the characters shallow. As an owner of two mares I particularly didn't like the lead in pages to the story. Perhaps people don't mind reading a detailed account of the mating between a stallion and mare which at first gives you the impression that it is two people and not horses, but I didn't like how it came across. I wouldn't recommend this book and it's the last of Ms. Henleys' I will buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I did not care for these characters. The dialogue was so blah that they didn't feel real at all. The secondary characters were more alive than the hero and heroine. In fact, I think that the secondary characters took up more of the plot than Heath and Raven. It was almost as though Virginia Henley was plotting out her next sequel and couldn't decide on which characters she should write about. Too many to keep track of. Through more than 1/2 of the book Raven and Heath weren't even together. Even when you thought they were it might have all been a dream. When they were actually together it was so wooden and boring that there was absolutely no chemistry. I'm sure they deserved each other though. At least they believed that there was a connection. All the magic and earth healing got to be sooooo old. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"I could not get through this book. The dialogue was horrible!!!

If I had previewed it, I wouldn't have allowed my children to watch it. Yes, the rating says there is \\"adult language\\" in the movie, but with PG, that usually means just one or two words. That isn't what it meant with this one. There was foul language throughout the movie and not just from adults. Even the kids were cursing throughout the movie. Personally, if I was going to make a movie for families, I wouldn't have had so much foul language in it. It was not necessary for the advancement of the plot.On a positive note, this was a good story with a great (though predictable) ending, but if you don't like your kids' minds and ears being filled with ALOT of senseless cursing, don't let them see it or at least preview it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've gotta be kidding me...","review":"Okay, I realize that this is not intended to be Lawrence of Arabia.

It is an exercise in predictability.Memo to Hollywood and the geniuses over at Starbucks Entertainment (Starbucks Entertainment?): Kids want to be challenged too. They DO have brains, ritalin-addled though they may be. Even the poor kids have brains, god bless them.

The actors are all great, the script is intelligently written even with some cliches thrown in, and it does what most films like it are supposed to do; it inspires. My favorite element in this film is how Fishburne's character attempts to teach Akeelah the difference between fitting in with one's peers and creating self-imposed limits on one's potential.The other reviews on here say enough along with Amazon's synopsis and review of the film, so I can't add much more here.

Meanwhile, her single mother has struggles of her own trying to feed her family and hold things together while also mourning the loss of her murdered husband. Akeelah wonders if all the hard work is worth it, but soon finds that there are many people in her family and community who believe in her, giving her the courage to stand up and 'shine'.

Otherwise, the movie is fantastic and my daughter really enjoyed it despite the cursing (that was used as a teachable moment for myself and my kids)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Should Add This To Their DVD Collection","review":"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I highly recommend everyone adding this movie to their personal collection.It's a movie the whole family can enjoy watching together. It's good movie to show in any group setting that includes children. I believe this movie give children the opportunity to see what hard work will do when you approach something with a deep passion for it.I sent friends and family out to buy this DVD even though they went to see it in the theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging story of perseverance","review":"Akeelah and the Bee was an inspiration story I had to see a second time. I enjoyed it so much and was happy my kids did also. This was a story that taught perseverance and dedication to realize a dream. It showed hard work and cooperation and how sometimes it takes more than a dream to win. I loved how the characters evolved over the course of the movie and Laurence Fishburne's character was strong and forceful, a true inspiration. I highly recommend this movie for all ages, it's a true winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie for All Ages. Very Inspiring","review":"Fantastic movie to see again and again. This movie is not just about a spelling bee. It shows real people in everyday life and the emotional situations that we encounter and how to deal with them. The Peaceful Warrior is another that you can't turn off until it is finished, and extremely inspirational. I was stimulated to see it because I use to like to participate in spelling bees myself. All of the actors and actresses are superb. The director could not have picked better people to play the parts. Akeelah is soooooooo cute. You will easly fall in love with her and the part that she plays. I have printed all of the reviews and have enjoyed reading all of them. I will not go into details about the movie itself, but see for your self. Be sure to see the Special Features,they are very worthwhile, as with most movies. This is a 10 star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"I re-watched this movie a few weeks ago and forgot how entertaining and educational it was. It's not Oscar material but it's fun. Good story line and if you're not careful you just my learn something. Can you use the word in sentence? Can you give me the definition? Can you give me the word origin? Can you use it in a song? Funny stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akeelah","review":"This is one of the DVDs that burned in our house fire Feb 2012. It was actually a borrowed item, so now I can replace it and I believe I will order another to keep for myself because the story of tenacity of a goal is well worth watching more than once and even though I have no desire to be in a spelling bee, the idea of finding a goal and putting your all into it, applies to any age. Thank you Amazon, it arrived yesterday 4 Jan 2013 securely packaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akeelah and the bee video","review":"Was pleased with the quick shipment.

I thought my son (4-year-old) would like it, because he loves to read and thinks words are pretty cool.The actual story of the movie was awesome and truly inspirational, but I was dismayed by the use of foul language in it. Now, I realize that in reality people often don't know better than to use cuss words every other word, but was it needed in a kid's movie? I wouldn't let him finish watching it, because I didn't want him cussing me out over dinner and thinking it was the normal way to speak.Can you imagine, \\"Hey dad, pass the f____ing peas?\\"\\"Don't use language like that at the table.\\"\\"But I learned it on the kid's movie.\\"So what was the moral of the movie for me? Teach your kid a few big words to make him smart, but teach him a few dozen cuss words to make him cool to the other kids? Not for my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cusing for a family movie.","review":"I would have enjoyed this movie much more if I hadn't had to remind my children that the curse words used in this movie were not appropriate. I was shocked at the frequency of the four letter words used in this PG movie. Who cares that the story line was to be inspiring??? I was too busy explaining to my boys that we do not approve of the language used in this movie.I do not care that this movie was set to depict a rough family life...that could have been done without the language. I thought this was a family movie. We had to stop the movie half way into it to explain to our 8 year old boys why this movie is not acceptable. We chose to watch the rest of the movie without the kids to decide if we were going to allow them to see the rest.Bottom line.....this is not an appropriate movie for 8 year olds. I am so disappointed in this movie for this reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent History of the Confederation","review":"Merrill Jensen's \\"New Nation\\" is an excellent account of the first constitutional government of the United States in the period of 1781 to 1789. Jensen refutes old myths and nationaist propaganda about how the Confederation government was a failure. Jensen rightly points out the accomplishments of the first Federal government. He points out the laws to settle the huge western territory,the commissions develpoed to settle land disputes between states, and the establishment of foreign diplomatic establishments.He also points out the propaganda and power of the nationalists in the nation who were attempting to create a centralized government.He shows how many Americans were quite content with a weak central government and thought the Confederation was a sucess.Overall and excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great release from the best ska band","review":"This album has a bunch of awesome songs and a handful of mediocre as well... it has ska anthems and if you don't own this album you are not a true LTJ fan.

If you're not sure about buying it, you're out of your mind. It has so much energy throughout the entire CD, it's unbelievable.

This CD never leaves my disc changer."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st full length LTJ release isn't quite as good as i hoped","review":"Less Than Jake's Asian Man records release, \\"Pezcore\\", is an ok CD.

I couldn't because it was at my grade level it was too low. Then I heard the movie was coming out so I was excited. Then time came around to see the movie, but it didn't come at my theater. Then a week later it came. I went to see the day later I heard it came out. It was a wonderfl movie. I just read the book. The only diffrence is Stanley Yelnats was fat, but in the movie he was skinny."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think this movie was awesome. It followed the book so close that except for minor differences the script could have been the book. I liked the scene where Stanley was looking for the hidden cameras and tape recorders. The actors that played the people in the book were just like I thought they would look like in my imagination. I loved this movie and think everyone should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Excuse me?\\"","review":"Based on the book of the same name, \\"Holes\\" is a rare movie that follows the book pretty well.Stanley Yelnats IV goes to Camp Green Lake, a jail for young people. There's no lake at Camp Green Lake, it dried up a long time ago. Instead of a lake, there are countless holes. If a boy digs holes all day, that'll turn him into a good boy...according to Mr. Sir (played superbly by John Voight). The Warden of Camp Green Lake is none other than Sigourney Weaver. Why are the kids digging holes (which is 5 feet across and 5 feet deep) in the middle of a dry lake bed? Well, I leave to fill up the holes yourself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing flick...I am getting the DVD as soon as I can!","review":"For those of you have who read the book \\"Holes\\" but haven't seen this movie, what is wrong with you! Every time I read the book, I thought about what an awesome movie it would be. Picking Shia Labeouf to play Stanley Yelnats was the best choice the casting directors could've made in a million years. He is my favorite actor, and I hope he rises to fame. The performance by Sigourney Weaver is definitely different than her normal roles, but its not bad. I saw this movie in theatres, and I was so happy I did. I just bought a DVD player, and I almost got this for my first DVD, but went for another movie. I plan to make Holes my second DVD. In short, get it, watch it, join the millions who love it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVEABLE MOVIE!","review":"Wow this movie was great!

That louis Sarcher is one talented writter. How can someone just think about that. I gave this movie 5 stars because it kept me on my seat though the whole movie, everything flowed together and the wonderful actors: Khleo Thomas, Shia LaBoufe, Miguel CastroIII and so on so forth. They are so talented. If they keep makeing movies as wonderful as Holes I will see it in a min. But I surely dought that there will ever be a movie that is better than Holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Movie of the Year","review":"Don't just drop your kids off at the theater, because you'll want to see this movie also. Sachar's book set a high standard for my daughter's reading, and this movie is one of the closest and tightest adaptations I've ever seen (yes, even better than the Harry Potter adaptations).The story is very clever and funny, although some aspects might be a little dark for younger kids. Younger kids might also be challenged by the intertwined plot lines, but everyone should be pleased by how the different stories finally come together.The actors are all very good. The kids are comfortably relaxed and low-key, the adults delightfully exaggerated.The soundtrack is also very good. \\"Dig It\\" over the final credits was worth staying in the theater for, and the songs for the star-crossed lovers play up the emotion which is nicely underplayed by the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holes, Holes, Everywhere","review":"I saw this movie today not knowing anything about it and walked away with a big smile. A lot of kids movies today are just thrown together like a last minute Halloween costume.Holes is an exception.

Then he killed the black man and so the lady the next day, asked the sheriff if he still wanted the kiss and then she shot him and kissed him after he was dead.

Now my daughter LOVES movies and will sit forever watching a movie if it's good and entertaining. This didn't hold her attention for more than 10 minutes. After it was over we were left with a feeling of \\"what the heck?\\" It's really odd and way too hard for a kid to follow. It switches around between present day and old West constantly and never ties it all together until close to the end of the movie so you're left with a feeling of confusion. The scenes all looked the same, not much variation and it just seems so odd to me that this was marketed towards kids. There is some language that I would prefer not to have my child hear and the casting wasn't that great. Sorry Disney, but I'd have to give this one a thumbs down for a poorly done confusing mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex movie for young people should satisfy adults, too","review":"Stanlet Yelnats IV (Shia LaBeouf) is a good kid who is mistakenly sentenced to a boot-camp type place called Camp Green Lake, which is located in the middle of the desert, miles from the nearest water source. There he and the other boys are forced to dig one hole a day for a mysterious purpose known only to the warden (Sigourney Weaver) and her two bizarre henchmen (Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson). Stanley finds himself caught up in a complex web of fate and coincidence.With no less than three flashback stories going on (one of them actually a flashback within a flashback), the plot is surprisingly complicated for a children's movie, yet director Andrew Davis and screenwriter Louis Sachar (adapting his own book) keep everything clear. The whole cast is wonderful, but I was especially impressed with Jon Voight's wonderful, quirky comic perfomance as Mr. Sir./"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"We had low expectations because both of my children (now 10 and 12 yrs old) disliked the book. In fact, both chose not to finish it and they are avid readers with a pretty broad range of interests. The movie was something different. We liked that it was a unique story line. The acting was pretty good. They have been walking around for days saying \\"Excuse me?\\" which you will understand after you watch the movie. We laughed, I cried (though that's pretty typical for me!), and we only slightly disagree on the number of stars. My kids say 4 and I say 5 because, as a parent, I also appreciated that there was no sexual content that was inappropriate as most movies nowadays have.

But effective the film is; few of the reviewers on these pages are able to discern this criticism; their consciences are completely blind. Could there be a double standard in this country?

It is.HOLES is a wonderful movie even though it flips back and forth between three different periods in time; deals with literacy, racism, and other big issues; and takes place in a juevenile prison camp in a desert in Texas. Those who like the book are almost sure to enjoy the movie. However, those who have never read the book will probably enjoy the movie as well. The film is hard to describe because it is such a hybrid of so many different things. It is both a chain-gang film (like COOL HAND LUKE) and a buddy picture, with elements of a Western thrown in.

I bought the DVD on a hunch,looking for a new production of this extremely beautiful opera,knowing only the severalaudio recordings and the b/w film with Rudolf Schock and Isabele Straussconducted by Hans Zanotelli,which remains up to date the only video recording of the piece showing the time period and what the librettist wrote.As soon as I watched I returned to the record store and wanted my money back,not being though rewarded for the aggravation....A new video of this wonderful opera is still due.Hope a good stage director comes up with a good production shortly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesque Eurotrash","review":"I knew (and admired) this opera only from audio recordings, and looked forward to finally \\"seeing\\" it. I was profoundly angry & disappointed when I watched this \\"modern\\" production, yet another ghastly example of a \\"creative\\" director's lack of respect for the composer's and librettist's original work. By shifting the framing scenes to a 21st-century mad scientist's laboratory, the passionate story of the three principals - all yearning for love whether naive, brutal or brutalized, loses much, if not all, of its power. The music is, of course, quite beautiful, the singing is adequate, but all the sets (not only the lab scenes) are so far removed from \\"reality\\" that it was difficult to get involved with the tormented characters. A shameful enterprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery without Campion, but still very good.","review":"Just a warning--Campion does not appear in this book. But it is a good, solid mystery with a lot going for it.The action centers around the Ivory's art gallery, where a series of malicious pranks are causing problems. When a valuable painting is slashed right before an opening, things really come to a head.There's a pretend engagement, a man come back from the dead, an unscrupulous business manager, and finally, a murder. The ending is very exciting. My only complaints are that the policeman in charge of the case is more of a characture that a real person and that the identity of the weapon is not as much of a secret to the reader as it is to the police."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent timepiece","review":"This is truly an exceptional wristwatch/computer that will no doubt live up to the Suunto namsake.

They say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose, despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUUNTO PRODUCT. Whatsmore the shop I bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either. It is also very difficult to use and you cannot hear the alarm at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two failures in 3 years","review":"I got a vector 3 years ago and was very pleased with it most of the time. The altimiter is not very useful because it is based off barometric pressure so your reading will vary wildly and you need to keep resetting it. The big flaw with this watch is that in 3 years the face has broken twice. The first time the bezel broke off. Luckly it was still under warranty and they replaced it. Now the faceplate has cracked and is letting moisture in. I don't use the watch for any crazy sports, it's just my everyday watch so the fact that it is broken astounds me. Sunnto have a minimum $85 repair charge, which could go up, so at this stage I'm bowing out with two watch failures in 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second one I've purchased","review":"This is the second Vector I have purchased. My first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works. The watch has a large dial and is a little bulky, but you get used to it. You trade that for a large easy to read dial. The watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it. It has the compass, barometer, temperature, and altimeter. The 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather. The watch is a nice instrument, but I would warn against abusing it.

That means at night the watch is not illuminated hence the watch can not be read. It requires you to push a button for 2 seconds and then the watch will illuminate for a whole five seconds before it goes dark again. I thought they invented this technology in the 80's. The watch was a pain in the ass to use at night and almost worthless and I ended up sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after seven months","review":"I bought this watch approx the end of May last year. At the first of January the numbers would fade away when I pressed the light button. I assumed the battery was going bad and replaced it. The problem was that I was home on leave, my last day. I returned to Afghanistan and the watch started to zero out. I would wear it for a few hours and the time would go to zero and flash. It will no longer keep time. I have not abused the watch as the price I paid for it is a little steep and I would not take the chance on destroying it.When I looked online to return the watch, I found that I have to send it to the nearest service center with the receipt for purchase. I am in Afghanistan, this is not an easy option for me. I loved the watch when it was working, but now it just sits in a footlocker. Way too much money for gear that you cant use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Watch Functions Okay But Dies an Early Death","review":"The watch generally works okay for backpacking and higher altitude hiking (my uses) until it fails. One quirk: The ones I have had always understate the altitude by 100-200 feet after climbing more than a few thousand feet. The error compounds above 10,000 feet even if you adjust the master settings. That I am on watch number five over a 12 years period is the problem: these watches fail sooner rather than later. The plactic that holds the crystal in place will crack and leak under normal use. The watch will get permanently stuck in a setting. The electronics will just go nuts until they fail entirely. Since I have found no better watch brand than Suunto I rely on my Garmin GPS more and more these days.

With reluctance, I got number 5. It is soooo goood that you crave for more, and it makes you play all of the rest (except #4). What is so good is that it stays in your head. The beat never goes away.

I really enjoy MJ #4 and MJ#5 picks up right where it left off. Great jazz riffs mix with nice East Coast hip hop beats. This is a nice escape from the commercial hip hop of \\"HWhat!?\\" and \\"Yeah!\\" that crowds the radio waves. Get this cd. Cook some dinner for your man or lady.

Though certain aspects of Mark's life are shocking, they only help to give you a better understanding of the environment in which he lived and make Mark Mathabane human..

Equally inspiring is the strength and character of his mother, whose courage and determination to gain a better life for her children almost steals the story from her son.

This part was talking about his stormy youth and described the discrimination for black people.Johannes Mathabane was born in Alexandra, one of South Africa&#65533;s black towns. He was raised with fear and hunger. He had a passion to love his family. This was a time when his family was poor. They couldn&#65533;t even celebrate at Christmas. His parents had a pass book which the black people had to carry. But, that pass book was not in order so the policemen took Johannes&#65533;s parents away.I really liked reading this book, because it gave me a lot of information so I can image each scene very easily. I can&#65533;t wait to read the rest of this book. I think it is a great book to know what was going on in South Africa and of the discrimination for the black people.

Mark Mathabane gave great details. This book has really touched me. When I read what happened, I felt like I was there and a part of them. A lot of people say that it was very distasteful because of the sexual parts. I think that it just showed one of the ways the blacks were treated.

These laws prevented blacks from doing anything in their community. They had no freedoms, and no hope for jobs to make money to live their lives. Mark Mathebane was the young boy in this book. He talked about his life and how horrible it was. This book was extremely graphic and sick minded for high school students. He gave every detail about how he lived and how he survived. One section of the book that comes to mind is where Mark is getting raped by a man. He gave every single detail that made me want to throw up. In another part of the book, a man made him step in a bucket full of human feases, which is flat out disgusting. This book is horrible in the fact that he or she reading it will have a stomach ache from the gross facts.

I found it a pity, actually, because the story is inspiring yet I could not get past the grapics in the first section. Needless to say, our 9th grader did NOT read this book. As important as it is to educate about the horrors in this world, I firmly believe that if youngsters are given this much graphic exposure we are perpetrating the crime upon their souls.

The weights have removable 1 lb. sand packets and have 2 velcro straps that actually work! I think this is a great addition to a workout or just cleaning the house. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing description!!!","review":"I was expecting two 10# adjustable ankle weights. Instead I got two adjustable 5# weights. Description was not clear. Not worth sending back due to the weight and cost of shipping. If you are very weak, these might be adequate. But even older adults doing strength training soon are able to lift more than 5 pounds per leg. Difficult to put on. Would very much benefit from a velcro stap to hold weights on ankle, until strap is put on and tightened. I like the 7 1/2 pound adjustable weights by Millenium better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much bulkier than expected.","review":"I find these difficult to use because they are so bulky.

Forget this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for walking","review":"Really, this is a great product for walking, or cleaning, or just being around the house...But don't run with these since they don't stay in place. I like mine, and use them in spurts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly functional for the price","review":"I bought these to use with my Brazil Butt Lift workout. Overall, these work well. I like that the weights can be added or subtracted. My last pair of ankle weights did not offer this feature. One thing to point out, the ability to add/remove weight makes these weights a bit bulkier than others because the weight is divided into five sections. My last pair were not bulky because the weight was evenly spread throughout the ankle portion.I do have two compaints. 1) These are five pounds max each. The description can mislead the buyer. 2) I had a hard time with the individual weight packets. It was hard for me to take them out and put them in the little pockets. My hands are small. I am sure that someone with larger fingers/hands would have more difficulty. It can be done, it's just not an easy task.Oveall these are highly functional for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can handle the uncomfortable feeling then the price is ok","review":"I bought these for my son who complained that they were very uncomfortable on his ankles. He doubles up on socks to try to add padding. He wears them none the less and is over all happy enough with the product but if you ask me they should focus on comfort a little more. I would not personally recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjustable Ankle/Wrist Weights","review":"I was very pleased with my purchase of adjustable ankle/wrist weights. They came in a timely fashion and will be perfect for my rehab."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little awkward on the wrists, but very useful weights.","review":"These are a pair of 5 pound weights, for a total of 10 pounds. The advertising for this product may not be clear, so i thought i'd say that from the start.I use these as wrist weights, because i have ten pound ankle weights already. As wrist weights, they are a little awkward to wear. Though they are advertised as \\"Ankle/Wrist\\" weights, they are clearly designed with the ankles in mind. I am 5'10\\", with 7.5 inch wrists (if you put a tape measure around my wrists), and it is difficult for me to keep the weights from moving around or slipping down to my forearms.That said, the slipping does not take away from my weighted workouts (i use them for boxing). If you are worried about the weights moving around on your wrists, i would say avoid these weights, and buy weights with a thumb hole for better stability. Otherwise, they are among the best for their price, and you will enjoy your workouts with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well constructed but bulky","review":"Well constructed - will last many years - but are bulky and hurt my ankles when I run with them. I think they must be made for walking. Good for wrists. Overall I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple, works great","review":"These are very easy to use and work great - no ankle discomfort, holds tight, even upside down. The double velcro and double D-ring fasteners are really heavy duty. So they should last a very long time (probably for life!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Sturdy, weight bags are easily inserted and removed, Velcro straps are good quality. I gave it one star less because I find the comfort to be less when I use low ankle support shoes. When I use regular shoes, the weights rest on your shoe, not on the foot and that is OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Expected","review":"Very good product. Easy to put on and take off. Also very comfortable. Good beginner weight. Adds just enough extra weight for many different leg, ab, and butt exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"These are terrible...once you take the \\"weight\\" out of the pocket, it's virtually impossible to put it back in...the strap broke after i used it twice, and the actual removable weight leaks some disgusting black stuff that got all over my floor...not recommended at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"These work great as paperweights but that's about it. I used them once and tried adjusting the weights. The little packet does not go in easily at all. Plus the black cover on it ripped almost immediately. I was not using a lot of force but it just came completely undone. Then the inner packet broke and that grainy stuff went everywhere. I tried using them still but they were very uncomfortable. Going to try another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"velco straps break easily","review":"After having this item for only two months one of the velco straps broke. I wouldn't purchase from this manufacturer again. I have similar ankle weights I bought at Big 5 over 20 years ago and the straps are still holding strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"bulky and slips off","review":"The weights are not very good for using around the wrists. I have medium/large female hands and it falls off easily unless you strap it in this awkward way (I have to tuck a lot of material under itself so that the velcro can be adjusted tightly enough). Also, the insertable weights themselves are bulky and cut into my wrists. Other than this, though it seems pretty functional and as described is adjustable for heaviness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh voice in darkness","review":"I read a decent amount of new horror/suspense novels, and most of them aren't very engaging. Obviously, since I wrote a cover blurb for the book, I recommend this one, but blurbs don't tell the whole story. The Unwelcome Child has a lot to say about motherhood, loss, longing, and living despite it all. At turns creepy and uplifting, it's a ride you won't soon forget. I can't wait for Pampellone's next.Thriller writer Scott Nicholson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done and a fresh voice in this genre!","review":"Terrific read with people acting and reacting the way REAL people would when facing odd and frightening situations.The only problem I had was that in a book about pregnancy and pro-life versus pro-choice, it seems EVERY character is either pregnant, miscarries, had an abortion, is an orphan, etc. It gets a little over the top, the story is maybe 50 pages too long, but it breezes along nicely and I look forward to more by this writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Story Buried in a Flood of Stereotypes","review":"Somewhere underneath all those silly character stereotypes is a decent story screaming to get out. Unfortunately, I found myself chuckling at the absurdity of things more often than I was creeped-out by the horror of the story. None of the characters is very likable or even remotely sympathetic. With the exception of the ghost, you get the impression every other major character brings most of their misery upon themselves. It's hard to root for the heroine when you spend most of the read shaking your head and/or laughing at her. Again, there's a decent story buried amidst the political and social stereotypes. If you're willing to overlook a good deal of silliness, it's a decent enough story to kill a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water gets into the placemat easily","review":"Everyone raves about how easy this is to clean and how durable it is. The truth is that the seal separates from the paper inside within a few washes and then the placemat becomes fairly useless. Liked the dinosaur concept; too bad its not well made. Also they should invent these things with suction cups on the bottom so the kid can't sweep it off the table so easily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I bought this for the Rammstein scenes but theres not many. i do like the other bands but i expected more. If you want to see Rammstein live get (Live Aus Berlin) very good not a waste at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Limp tried to get the crowd pumped up but it seems like they all just wanted to see koRn and none of the other bands. Orgy was one of the boring ones too. Ice Cube was trying to get all the people in to it but didn't seem to have enough crisma. To me Rammstein was great, lots of stage presence like when they did \\"BÜCK Dich\\" or Bend Over. koRn likes to talk about themselves alot and the road to being famous...."},{"rating":"1","title":"One long, boring \\"music\\" video.","review":"This \\"movie\\" is an idiotic waste of any humans' time. I got more entertainment out of a Pauly Shore \\"movie\\", and more thought too. The money would be better spent on shaving your dog than this \\"movie\\". It is one long very expensive music video, MC Hammer has done better. Those involved in the production are very brave to put their name on this \\"stuff\\". For that reason only I give it a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This video was pretty cool.The KoRn performances were the best, and the Rammstein performance was quite disturbing. I didnt think Limp was that good simply because Fred doesnt get into the performance enough and his voice can get annoying. I dont like Orgy much but Ice Cube was ok. I recomend you buy this. I also recomend you buy \\"Who Then Now?\\" if you havent already bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better if u were actually at a Korn concert.","review":"I really enjoyed the movie, i seen Korn, orgy and incubus in concert, wasnt part of the family values tour, but its nice to see how it is, cause when your in the crowd you dont get a chance to see all, especially when your getting kicked and stuff. Too bad they couldnt get a couple incubus songs on there. They coulda competed with the rest you know, and it might if boosted their sales also. The only thing that bugged me was the second rammstein song, which was totally gross All in all i think it is a very good video for all u metal heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad DVD","review":"This is one of the worst dvds. The performances are bad and the quality is bad. I like Korn, Ice Cube and especially Rammstein, but there are better dvds featuring these artists than this one. And by the way Rammstein rules, watch their concerts on the \\"live aus Berlin\\" and \\"lichtspielhaus\\" dvds and you will see how a live performance has to look like.-> this family values 98 dvd is crap"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty damn good","review":"I saw this video at my best friend's house and it was pretty sweet. Limp Bizkit did a great job getting the crowd pumped with their opening performance. Orgy was great, Rammstien put on a weird show, but they weren't bad, Korn was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of theirs. Ice Cube was great, too, but he seems out of place with mostly metal bands. I personally like both rap and metal and I think that it's good of the genres to overlap, but being the lone rapper on the tour makes Ice Cube seem like he doesn't belong. So overall, great video, although it doesn't dethrone the king of all live videos (at least in my mind) Rage Against The Machine: Live. If you only buy one live video in your life, get Rage. But if you buy two, Family Values isn't a bad choice at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ROCK VIDEO","review":"THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO.KORN,LIMP BIZKIT,AND ORGY DID A GREAT JOB PERFOMING THE SONGS THEY DID.THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED WRONG WAS THAT ICE CUBE WAS THE ONLY NON-ROCK PERSON THERE SO HE SEEMED OUT OF PLACE.THE ONLY WRONG THING WITH THE PERFORMANCES WAS WHAT RAMMSTEIN DID.IF YOU R THINKING ABOUT BUYING IT YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A BIG KORN OR LIMP BIZKIT FAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"If u missed family values in 98', here's your chance.","review":"This dvd has oustanding footage from the greatest tour in history. Behind the scenes shots and interviews with the bands. For example, you'll see: -Nathan Davis's birthday party (Jonathon Davis's son) -Orgy dressing Korn up like themselves -Interviews with all the artists -A few women getting \\"more comfortable\\" in Ramstein's dressing room, if you know what I mean -And finally you'll see tons of songs performed live for the Family Values crowd of 98'.A small word of caution for the people youngsters in the house, there are some shots of naked body parts so be careful when ordering for your household. I encourage everyone to purchase this dvd, it really is worth every cent you pay. And what better way to get it cheaper here on Amazon than at the store...? Order it now, you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Variety","review":"If your just buying this because you love Rammstein, it may disappoint you. But I love the DVD even though I am not much into Ice Cube and Limp Bizkit. Now Orgy and Korn is great! I love the behind the scenes and dressing room clips. It is sooo funny!

You'll love it. If you're a Rammstein fan, think twice. Do you have Live Aus Berlin on DVD and VHS? If not, spend your money on that first. The Live Aus Berlin DVD has an interview, multi-camera, the music video for \\"Stripped\\" and many others. But the only way you'll see \\"Buck Dich\\" is to get the uncensored VHS. Family Values has \\"Buck Dich\\" and \\"Du Hast\\" but it is bady filmed (with terrible sound quality) and the audience is just annoying. There is barely any backstage footage... no interviews, no commentary ... I'll keep my copy just because I keep anything that Rammstein is in, but if you have no interest in seeing Till kiss a member of Orgy and hear the correct pronunciation of Flake's name... don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful, historical and educational","review":"I bought this coloring book by Tom Tierney because of my 12 year old's delight in his art work. She has enjoyed the historical notes at the bottom of each page. She had several of his books in the past and was so pleased with them that she asked for more, even if it meant reordering the same coloring books. My seven-year-old granddaughter has also enjoyed them. The simple line drawings are easy to color. In several of the books, Tierney instructs the reader on the colors that would have been used in the fabrics; in others, he doesn't, allowing the child to use her imagination.

Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it contains so many curious George stories. You could read a different story each night for several nights. My children have quickly become as fond of George as I was when I was a child. The accompanying illustrations are very colorful and they definitely grab a young child's attention.

And I enjoy the leisurely pace of the dialog, and the clever and charming illustrations. I also like that the stories are somewhat longer than her previous favorites as a challenge to her attention span.The treatment of animals sometimes seems a little anachronistic. I don't personally see any harm in this, but I think there are parents nowadays who might not be keen on the story with the pet bunnies, the depiction of a zoo that has a bunch of cages, or the story with the travelling performing animal show.The binding on our book has been quite durable.

First, the phone receiver is so tiny that only a very small child could hold it to their ear and still be able to talk into the mouth piece. Second, the phone is so oddly shaped....lip-shaped...that it is IMPOSSIBLE to prop the phone on your shoulder and talk. It slides off your shoulder. It is EXTREMELY uncomfortable to hold because of the shape of the receiver. It is like holding a lip-shaped rock to your head. If you move the receiver the slightest while talking, the sound is GREATLY EXAGGERATED and is heard in the receiver. The phone turns over VERY easily. If you pull on the phone cord while talking, the phone WILL turn over. In all, if your child wants a Bratz phone, check out the other Bratz phone model. I haven't seen it, but it at least looks like a more comfortable phone to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!","review":"I got this phone 4 christmas and the head peice is to small and it always falls and the cord is too heavy so think its cool its a night mare gone worse!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I bought this phone for my 8 year old and she loved it...UNTIL we plugged it in, the handset wont stay on the base good therefore the phone wont stay hung up.

Example: \\"If these are Union soldiers, then why is there so little uniformity in their uniforms?\\" Or: \\"This body is described as that of a Confederate sharpshooter . . . but that's a federal issue Springfield rifle propped next to him.\\"William Frassanito raised such issues to the level of scholarly inquiry, and through painstaking research wrote the story of the Gettysburg photographs. We now know what and who we are looking at, and on which portion of the battlefield. This book and his companion volume on the Antietam photographs are indispensable for any serious student of the Civil War in the East."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone remotely interested in history!","review":"I feel that Mr. Frassanito's work has been the catalyst in America's renewed interest in the Civil War.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vive Monsieur Elting!","review":"This book could stand on its own as a work of literature. This is an exhaustive study of the minutiae of Napoleon's Grand Armee, and might easily have become a plodding reference work.

I find this book very objective - a very important factor since some readers come from those nations participating in the Napoleonic wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the typical Napoleon biography","review":"Swords Around a Throne is not your typical Napoleon book. Elting concentrates on topics which MAY rate a sentence or paragraph in other biographies. Elting concentrates on the different divisions of the Grand Armée including uniforms, in-depth looks at his marshals and the navy instead of regurgitating the different battles he fought. Swords Around a Throne is a good change of pace to the other biographies of Napoleon as it provides a different aspect to the Napoleonic Wars and his empire.

In between the examples, you'll find a tip on a shortcut key or other, \\"I didn't know that\\" type information. The two weaknesses that I would give it are:1) No example CD so I could follow along with the book (this was painful because I had to take time to create similar examples)2) I wish it would go over all the shortcut keys. Perhaps I missed this but I have found these to be useful and wish the material had been better organized so that you could find them all in one place rather than sporadically buried in an example that had no indication it was teaching you a new shortcut.Alas, there is much more positive than negative and I would definitely recommend the book to someone wanting to enhance their excel skills and learn a lot of tips they might have never learned otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading for MS Excel","review":"As excel becomes an increasingly important tool for use in business, knowledge of excel is crucial.In this book Mr. Excel covers many topics, ranging from simple (but important) beginner problems to much more advanced problems.

These particular cartridges were defective: (1) The plastic liner tube was significantly shorter than the pet store liners -- a little more than 1 fill-up of the locker rather than 2 fill-ups, and (2) the end of the cartridge was not signaled by a black line along the liner. Both of these characteristics will make cleaning the litter box even less glamorous and fun when the unsecured tube of cat droppings falls unexpectedly into the locker, necessitating manual contact of tube contents during cleanup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product!!","review":"This litter locker is worth a million dollars!

Even though the disc is labeled as a \\"CD Single\\" it contains, if I recall correctly, 65-70 minutes of music.The song is remixed about every way you could think, from small rearrangements of sounds to complete destruction of the original into slow ambience. So even though the same song is listed, many of them sound nothing alike. For the money of a used CD, which is apparently the only way to get it, it's definitely worth it if you're an Eno fan. I was not aware that Moby had anything to do with this disc, since this came out in 1992 and I wasn't even aware of Moby's existence until his 1995 \\"Everything is Wrong.\\" I will have to go back and look at my Fractal Zoom case now and listen with a new perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"= so-so (bought it in 1992)","review":"This is a single - one song spread across remixes (how fractal!)

No translation can truly capture that, especially when the languages are as different as English and Persian are. There are many translations of Hafiz that give us some idea of the meaning of his poetry. Many are pretty plodding as literature-the ideas and images are there but no music. At his best, Le Gallienne could transmit a feeling of lyricism and beauty that one doesn't often find in Hafiz translations. For this I feel he is a useful addition to your library if you're trying to study Hafiz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Shoe","review":"I am horrible on Shoes.

But for 35$ this is a huuuuuge rip off, you can buy the she pack at walmart for 6$"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd found these earlier!","review":"LOVE these diapers! Honestly, I think every little body is built a little differently, and one diaper will not fit every baby perfectly. But these are worth checking out. I tried them looking for a good, cheap diaper and these were recommended by a friend. After reading various reviews I was a little worried, but gave them a go. And I am so glad I did! They have never leaked other than a few overnights, but they sure did put up a fight those nights and even the \\"night time\\" diapers have had a hard time standing up to my 14 month-old daughter. They are thin, inexpensive and I actually like the smell better than the \\"pee smell\\" we'd get with others. Only cons- a little crinkly sounding and somewhat transparent (which can be a good or bad thing depending on where you are and what you have). Give them a try, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for \\"The Artist\\".","review":"This piece of work by \\"The Artist\\" has been ignored too long. Though this piece had been released years previous, it is mesmerizing. The lyrics compelling, and the music addicting, the listener is drawn to it. The story that unfolds in this song is significant, if not important. It is by far one song that should definately be on a greatest hits disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 4 me, but maybe 4 u","review":"I really enjoyed the acoustic remix of \\"7\\" and trak # six called \\"To Whom it May Concern.\\" Whoever appreciates the dance side of \\"O(+> will dig this or anyone who is obsessed with the overcommercialized \\"7.\\" Not downtrodding it, but it wasn't aquatic enough 4 my anti-radio taste, u know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prison Break","review":"Wow!

This is simply false advertising and a minimum of a downloadable fix for the subtitles should be made available immediately, if such a fix is possible - otherwise, my discs should be replaced with ones that work as advertised.I am extremely disappointed given that the reason this product was purchased was for the Japanese features. I have heard that the Blade Runner Blu-ray may be similar, although that is currently en-route, so I won't find out for few more days.Visual content, great, 5 stars; audio and subtitles, well, what is the minimum rating? So overall rating is poor. This will not affect many users who are only after the original English, but beware...amazon should also notify users and consider how to repay users who have fallen foul to this problem..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but drawn out.","review":"This show started out VERY well, MUCH better than Oz. However, as the episodes dragged on, the show became very repetitive. I will not be purchasing the second season, since the first season did not offer enough closure.No closure = waste of time = no value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD, or BAD?","review":"This has to be the best show I have ever watched in my entire life. Reading peoples 1 and 2 star reviews made me realize how critical people have to be. I think if your looking for a show that can keep your attention and keep you guessing, this is where you want to begin. Season 1 of Prison Break was FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant Show","review":"This show is absolutely awesome. Very suspenseful with great writing and acting.

And I blasted through the whole season in about 5 nights. Its raw, engaging, and smart with great writing led by great acting. Michael Scofield and his fellow prisoners who comprise the main cast are a dynamic group of characters. Each has their distinct traits, reasons for being in prison, and something to offer in aiding in the attempt to break out of prison. Don't miss out on this show! Its much like 24 in that the end of each episode leavings you teetering on the edge of your seat desperate to find out what happens next! Can't watch just one episode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of your seat!!!","review":"Prision break is one of the best new shows on tv.It is an edge of your seat type thriller.It also has hot guys which does not hurt.I think it is really worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best tv show since 24","review":"i love it it the best now i am watching season 2 its nice.\\" the escape was just the beggining \\" i like this line. good show give 10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like show.","review":"I like the action and intensity of this show.

No review would be complete without giving Wentworth Miller a mention, in a word, delicious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, albeit flawed series","review":"I enjoyed the first season of Prison Break immensely. The characters shine in their own respects and they develop nicely as a somewhat dysfunctional family working towards a common goal. T-Bag and Abruzzi (played by the hilarious \\"V-Dub\\" Mark V spokesperson Peter Stormare) are EXCELLENT in their respective parts and terrific scene stealers.The main issue I had with the story is some of the plot points and \\"barriers\\" the characters faced. Some of them seemed like the writers just threw them in to keep it an hour-long show. However, I enjoyed seeing the separate plot points diverge and converge during the course of the season.All in all, good series. Well acted and enjoyable (although at times outrageous) plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Bag for Vice President !","review":"This is some firstclass acting displayed in this series by surely all of the actors. But if Hannibal Lecter is THE most memorable villanious character ever to appear on the silver screen (and he is) then T-bag is a close second! Gaddamn thats some marvellous acting this guy shows here!! he just creeps me out every time he appears, his unpredictability just adds so much more suspense to this series then it would be without him. I won't forget to mention sargeant Bellick and the icy cold killer-agent Keller.. yes I have a slight inclination towards bad guys :).While waiting for the 3rd installment of Lost, i'm again greatly entertaint by another pathologically addictive series! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Prison Break Season 1","review":"I rented the first season after watching Deadwood and Rome Seasons 1-2.

This TV show has an amazing plot that is full of adventure and and action, but also has intellect. Prison Break is much like the movie The Shawshank Redemption. The actors are great, the story is great and you get completely sucked in. I would recommend this to anyone who likes an intelligent TV show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and Terrific !!","review":"In the deluge of Action/thriller based serials that are present today, its refreshing to come across a serial that manages to hold your attention throughout. I came across this serial quite by accident and since the first episode, I've been hooked ! Great casting, well thought storyline, stylized presentation and plenty of thrilling moments, this serial is a must watch. Highly recommended !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-in-throat drama","review":"If you're like me and you're into excitement when it comes to television, Prison Break is the series for you. The plot twists and turns, and because of this, some parts are nerve-wracking to the point where it's almost unrealistic. However, the events that unfold nonetheless prove the series worthy of continuation. I highly recommend Prison Break to anyone interested in ingenuity (an original take on escaping from prison) and suspense (you'll never catch yourself yawning)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADDICTING!!!","review":"Prison Break is a great show, very addicting and although fictional, presents a fun and worthwhile time watching with friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fox has done it again!","review":"Although often unbelievable in its portrayal of life behind bars such as the prisoner's easy access to chemicals, cash, and weapons-grade metals, death row inmates intermingled with the general population, and the respect offered the sexually sadistic child killer T-Bag among his peers, \\"Prison Break\\" is superb in its ability to grab the viewer's attention and hold it captive throughout each episode of the entire first season. If you require realism and attention to detail when watching a movie or TV program, you won't be satisfied with this series. Otherwise, prepare to become absorbed into this great story interwoven with dramatic subplots and surprising twists which will keep you glued to the television. The series flows well due in large part to an excellent cast of new faces and veteran actors, making \\"Prison Break - Season One\\" network television at it's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way over priced!","review":"The show is amazing on blu ray, but come on the price is rediculous.

I never watched season one on TV but I've been a fan since season two so I was really anticipating this... it lived up to the expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 seasons, really?","review":"I just couldn't watch all the way through. The acting is okay, cinematography is very good, but the story line is just so far fetched. Most of what is put forth in this script is just implausible. Unbelievable. I can enjoy an adventure but it has to be something close to reality.What irks me is a program like this makes it through four seasons while so many other much better programs are cut after the first season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Received as stated","review":"This product was received and met all expectations.

If these 2 boxes weighed 40 lbs each it is a miracle. When I opened up the 1st box the bubble wrap looked dingy like it had been used before. I couldn't believe my train was in these 2 boxes. Remember 190 lbs. The 2 large wheels for the engine was on top. One wheel has a whole in it and is all scratched up around the center.

Very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"A poor Metroid knock-off in every respect, the only thing differentiating this game (the top-down perspective) actually ends up being a detriment. While having a third axis to traverse does add something to the exploration aspect of the game, all the other elements are lacking. Enemy design is uninspired, the main character's hair is almost seizure inducing at all times, and aiming can be clunky because the three dimensional environment doesn't really feel right with the d-pad.All in all, I really can't think of anything good to say about this game. Children of Mana and Lunar Knights are two good alternatives if you're looking for this style of play, but I'd recommend staying as far away from this game as possible, it'll only disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better then the movie!","review":"This is one of Stephen King's interesting novels. It's also too bad that the movie is not more like the book. The book also really gets good toward the end and it becomes very hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"So this would have been the first Stephen King book I read cover to cover. I was REALLY excited with the story line and could not wait to start reading it. The mistake I made and am warning you about is that during the introduction \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" King gives away the ending!!! Not just a \\"Oh, and then something negative happens\\" but \\"Blah, blah, and then he blah blah\\" specifically. If you want to enjoy the book (as I am CERTAIN I would have) DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION!!!!Who does that?? Yes, I get it, it has been republished so you want to add a note, but for those who would have picked up the book for the first time (never had seen the movie either so I don't know if it tells the true ending) the book has been ruined!!!. . . I always pictured Stephen King as a smart man. . . WRONG!So please! Add a HUGE SPOILER warning before you give the ending of a book before the story even starts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the book. Don't read the preface from King!","review":"First off, do *NOT* read the preface from King. He gives away the ending. Arggh. His comments should come at the end of the book.Good, enjoyable easy read. Little darker than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King 's best!","review":"A seat gripper all the way through!

This was a great story, and ended up being one of my favorites by Stephen King. If you want to read King, but don't have time for a 2000pg like The Stand or IT, the Running Man is a great alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent short story - great as an audio book as well","review":"Read part of this book, listened to the rest (forgot I purchased the recording from Audible.com after I downloaded the Kindle book).

DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! it's terrible, awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read..short and intense","review":"this was so different from the movie, thank god. it is a story about a society out of control and the tv game shows head the pack. one man gets fed up and takes matters into his own hands. if you think this is the movie, you are misguided. do not assume anything. the end is different(i did not like the ending and thats why i only gave it 4 starts. also i liked the long walk better and i gave that 5 stars) as are many other twists. a good read. took me one week. short, sweet and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book and forget about the movie","review":"The running man is the best of Stephen Kings Bachman books in my opinion. It reveals a gloomy and depressive future scenario where poor people take part in bizarre TV-shows to earn a few bucks.The main character decides to enter the worst of them all - the Running Man contest...Now...The movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger is an abysmal attempt to make a movie out of this book. The overall tone of the book is completely lost and the Hollywood way of rewriting everything to fit the \\"Lowest common denominator\\" makes me outright sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of thee best books I've ever read!","review":"I could baley bring myself to put this bok down! I'd read for hours every night trying to get to a good spot to stop, but I couldn't find one, the book made me read! The book has to have gotten a message across, but what? Anyway, King again discribed so good and clear that it's against the laws of nature...READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It...","review":"This is one of the few books I started but didn't finish. It was incredibly depressing and after a while I simply lost interest. I was hoping for a book that would describe more about the strict society in which this story takes place, but I felt that details were lacking. Overall, I don't recommend this book, although it was my first Stephen King read and it's possible that his books are just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story","review":"This story was a great story written about the future.

This had a great ending one that I did not think was going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has a higher rating than Roadwork? Really?","review":"Of the Bachman Books, this is by far the worst story. It boggles the mind that this book has a higher rating than Roadwork (which is great, 5 stars, see my review). The Running Man had promise. It's the story of a dreary future world where those who have no other choice due to poverty, illness, etc. are driven to compete on gameshow for the chance to get out of their terrible situation, but where ultimately no one ever wins. And if you don't win, you die. Even though the basic idea has been done many times before it still has the potential to be a great story. But potential is all it has. I had a hard time finishing this book and by the end I really didn't care what happened to anyone. I just wanted it over. Nothing really captured my attention. I felt the story dragged on. I typically love the Bachman Books, but this one was terrible. If you must read this story, buy a copy of the Bachman Books and get 4 novels. Don't buy this one on it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragged on a bit, but still an excellent read","review":"I found this book well written, and had a thrilling edge to it.

His running from the hunters dragged on, when I would of rathered King write more about his life before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"The Running Man well written. The action is pacey and, the humour is a bit odd, Nontheless is a hell of a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick fun read, even if sloppy in execution","review":"Such a perfect concept. Weak in execution-- which makes sense given the amount of time King gave himself to write this. Four stars instead of three because I found myself wanting to talk about this book with everyone. I'm curious to see how the film version stacks up. There's so much action in such a small amount of space-- I had to reread a couple of sections just to make sure what I thought happened actually happened. Already because of the casting, I sense that the movie takes some different choices with the story than the book. Anyway-- interesting. Thought-provoking. Worth reading. And quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY 50 YEAR OLD WOMEN SHOULDN'T WRESTLE!!!!!!!","review":"This tape has only one worthwile match, and even it stinks.

Also nice was that it didn't squeak like many of the other cots.Pros:* quiet* wide* storage compartment is already attached* comes with a sleeping pad, which is nice I supposeCons:* heavy, made of steel not aluminum like many others* cross-bar had burrs on it so had to do so carving to get assembled, but won't be necessary next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"too big a pain to put together","review":"This thing was absolutely ridiculous to put together. We managed to put the first end in just fine but we did about everything we could think of to get the other end in. (There were no instructions.) By bracing our feet on the frame and pulling the rod we managed to get the third corner in and about 30 minutes later with my mom sitting on the corner and me pulling with all my strength we got the last corner. We're not using this for camping but for another temporary bed while my grandmother recoups. I would have returned this if we were using it outdoors because there is no way I'm taking this thing apart again. It slept well but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice cot - comfortable","review":"I had back surgery less than a year ago, and I was not ready to sleep on the ground while camping, so I ordered this cot. Very Comfortable, sturdy, and no squeek noise in the frame. The only complaint is putting the second strecher in...very difficult pulling the support into place. Besides that, a very nice cot, with a nice storage pocket underneath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, heavy duty, large cot","review":"I needed a durable cot in a full, twin bed size, and this one was priced well. It meets all the citeria and then some. High quality construction, perfect size (even a bit longer than needed!), and it has proved to be very durable with heavy use.The only drawback was assembly, mentioned in reviews I had read. Same as with cots I assembled while in the army, the end cross-bars are really tough to stretch into place. I got a flat pry bar and that did the trick.But thats a probem with portale cots, and it did not detract from the quality and utility of this cot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and comfortable","review":"This is one impressive cot! It seems very sturdy and is extremely comfortable. It collapses into a relatively small space and comes with a heavy canvas carrying bag. It is, however, quite heavy. My 9 year old son had difficulty lifting it. But, I'm 6'4\\" and quite happy with it.I particularly like the pouch underneath for wallets, flashlights, car keys, etc. Things that often get lost in a tent.It takes real strength to get the last bar attached during setup, but anyone big enough to want this cot should be plenty strong enough that this will not be a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Last","review":"When I first used this cot it seemed excellent. The frame is very sturdy and the cot was comfortable. If I had written a review at that point I would have given it 5 stars. But the second trip I took the cover burst like a balloon. Really, I could feel it give a little, and by the time I could get off it there was a 4 foot long rip. It was then I started looking closely at the material of the cover - it is some rubberized material with a few threads in it - not a real canvas. And it has zero rip-stop capability. I tried to sew it but it was like trying to sew a balloon - it just doesn't work.

It doesn't have any strength and won't take any abuse without ripping. It might be OK for a spare bed in the house, but don't even think of taking it camping because it can't stand up to real wear. Even hauling it around in the car will probably damage it beyond use. I called the company to complain, they said I could get a new cover if they had one, but they don't have them and haven't had them for a year. So don't expect any customer support from Slumberjack. My recommendation is get a cot that advertises a cover with ripstop nylon or canvas. Don't buy this cot if you plan on using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to set up and it stinks!","review":"Very difficult to get the wide bars on their pegs each time and the odor does not go away.

Not only can you remove individual weight packets from each weight attachment - but the entire design is SUPERIOR: Valeo weights close with a 'D' ring plus velcro straps, so the straps don't stick out (I wore a rubber band around the other designed weights to hold the strap down, lest it catch on something &/or come loose) & the Valeo's are SECURE & SAFE! They stay exactly where I put them around my ankles when I walk through brush, etc. The Valeo's don't twist or loosen, regardless of what I'm doing. I would recommend these over all the just 'wrap around velcro straps' closures, without the 'D' ring design, to everyone considering buying any wrist or ankle weights. Don't waste money on the inferior designs (that actually cost MORE!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"awkward","review":"I bought these weights to go on my wrists so I could build up strength. I have a hard time wearing them because they fit very awkwardly. They don't adjust tight enough to fit my wrists (I'm a woman) so they eventually slip off. They are kind of long so it makes it difficult to wear them while doing other things. What attracted me to these weights was the adjustable weight (5-10 lbs.) but after you take a weight out of its pocket it is a real pain to get back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"These things are horrible!","review":"These weights are horrible if you ever actually remove the weight packets to adjust the weights. I bought both the 5 and 10 pound versions and both do the same. It does not matter how gentle you are. the little weight bags split open right off the bat, and when they do they leak grey, gritty, nasty sand everywhere. These are useless!

The velcro holds nicely but can feel a bit slippery on the wrists, just make sure you get em tight enough if slinging your arms.I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily adjustable","review":"I bought these weights for a couple of reasons. First they are easily adjustable, more adjustable than any other wrist weights I was able to find. If you flatten the soft weights out and put them in on a level surface they go in easier. Second, the velcro strap holds the weights in place pretty well. My wrists are average sized for a woman. On smaller wrists the weights would slip. I have had these weights for about 2 months now and have used them for my aerobics, circuit training and walking routines. I like having my hands free to handle various equipment. I think they are a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Description?","review":"It would seem to me that 5 pound ankle weights means two 5 pound weights which is what I wanted.

I must note, however, that I found the full text online on what appeared to be a reputable site, making me wonder whether the copyright has expired and perhaps this price unwarranted."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I got this book because I was exploring whether or not I was going to come back into the church. I was looking for some guidance around the changes that have occurred. The author continuously makes the assumption that the reader has already decided to come back and is enthusiastically ready to begin. This was frustrating to me as I was not in that category. It is also quite judgemental on a lot of levels, making a lot of assumptions about people that are quite disrespectful and not very catholic (excuse the pun). On the whole, while I learned a bit about some of the changes in the church while I've been gone, mostly this book convinced me that coming back would be the wrong choice for me at this time. So, I guess, in some ways, it was helpful after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-catholic","review":"This book was purchased to give to a sibling that has been away from the church for years. Fortunately it was read before, and promply trashed. This book has nothing to do with authentic catholic teaching. It has quite a bit to do with discent. This book was purchased from a \\"catholic\\" book store, which I no longer patronize. There are a number of good Catholic authors, Scott Hahn, Karl Keating, Frank Sheed, to name a few. I now investigate the author prior to purchasing Catholic material. I wish I had prior to wasting money on trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book a returning Catholic can read.","review":"The is a fabulous little book for those Catholics who are thinking of returning to worship.

It's written with love and care and has a wonderful list of resource books at the end of each chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chock full of dissenting opinion","review":"Perhaps in an attempt to make fallen-away Catholics feel better - or sway them into returning - Fr. Bausch presents a strangely anti-Catholic come-back-to-the-Church book. His choice of words paint a very dim view of the Church and carries a \\"come back, we're all fixed now\\" connotation - that somehow the Church has been wrong all along, but we're finally getting better.Fr. Bausch refers to \\"frightened Rome\\" starting a \\"reign of terror\\", \\"censoring\\" and \\"tightening control\\". It \\"scoffs at\\" and \\"makes fun\\" of psychologists and scientists, in Father's opinion.When you come home to the Catholic Church, you should be able to come home to the 2000-year old pillar and bulwark of the Truth.(Also, Mark Shea wrote an article on some examples from this book, calling them Junk Catechesis: [...].)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"This book is so far to the left that it falls off the table.

This author serves no useful purpose, alas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing lesser-known facts, well researched","review":"For those interested in knowing all of world war 2 history, and not just the rosy view from the perspective of the victor, this book is a must read. My mother's side of the family are ethnic German expellees from Yugoslavia and this book aided in explaining why my family went hungry in the American zone.All too often the rhetoric we hear is the sufferings, both real and alleged, caused by those we defeat in war. We never hear about the atrocities that our side commits. This book exposes the atrocities the Allies committed willfully against civilians, leaving the reader asking why does our country claim the moral high ground?This certainly qualifies to be called a \\"holocaust\\" against the German people, yet in our politically biased atmosphere it is unknown. For those of you interested in the human rights of all peoples, not just those we support in wars, this is a must for you. It will make you wonder what is wrong with your history books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another view of war","review":"War history is usually first written by the winners so it was very interesting to read this book which shows a different view to what happened after WW2 in Germany. The author courageously wrote this book to show that the military victors were not as wonderful as we may have been taught during our history classes. The mood to punish and re-educate the German people after WW2 was strong. It is a wonder that the country was able to rebuild amidst the starvation and denouncement of its civilian survivors who were left to their own creativity and wits to survive. A study of Post War Germany is not complete unless this short book (140 pages) is read. In planning a trip to Germany, it would give the visitor insight into the culture which is missing from the travel guidebooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag - some interesting quotes and aspects - some ideological rubbish","review":"This book is truly a mixed bag. On the one hand it is very frank at exposing several important and serious aspects of the terrible revenge against German civilians during and especially after the war. But at the same time the author mixes some historical facts with ideological statements that are nothing but rubbish. It may be partly related to the style of writing back then (the work was initially published in 1947). But still, this way of exploiting the fate of these civilians for ideological purposes is repugnant and disrespectful. Therefore, I recommend rather reading e.g. \\"A terrible revenge\\" by Alfred De Zayas, \\"After the Reich\\" by Giles MacDonogh, or maybe even \\"Crimes and mercies\\" by James Bacque. These releases are more pragmatic and put down the facts, yet do not abuse history for idiotic ideologies."},{"rating":"2","title":"gruesome harvest","review":"An excellent overview of the postwar (1945-1948)sell-out of eastern Europe by the allies to J.

I was annoyed though, that the person on the back right, Lisa, was suppose to be the \\"modifier\\" for those who are not able to do the workout so easily at first. Most DVD's (like Leslie Sansone), the modifier person, really does tone the moves down. I found that throughout the dvd, she did the work out at full-tilt, almost more intense than the instructor/lead. At one point, they had these side lunges with the knees and she was doing them full spread and deep (impossible for me). The only thing modified was that she did not move her arms.

When it first came out, I thought it was great - but I was only 15 - I didn't understand it really, so it wasn't as great as I think it is now. Actually, I totally forgot it existed until a few months ago when I went to Blockbuster and there was nothing there to rent - I saw \\"One Fine Day\\" and took it home - I watched it and was surprised that I'd forgotten more than half the plot, which was good - it was like watching a movie I had never seen before. It was great understanding the movie - the subtle flirtation between Clooney and Pfeiffer, the role of the kids in their relationship, and looks on Clooney's face when he sees Pfeiffer walk into the 9th Street Drop-In Center. The movie is timeless - the plot is a little cheesy, but I love it - I've watched it so many more times cause I think it's just great. By the way... as a 15-year-old, you don't realize how subtly hot Clooney is until the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, there's a soft side to Mr. Clooney","review":"\\"One Fine Day\\" depicts a very hectic day in the lives of two single parents just trying to get throught the day. George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer beam from the screne. This movie shows that George Clooney is a very versitle actor and that Michelle Pfeiffer can still look great in smeared eye liner.

Parker, being upset at this point, refuses to associate with Taylor. However, fate comes into play and they are forced to depend on each other, which will cause them to develop feelings for each other.

Don't get me wrong, with the premise it could have been a cute love story, but the writer must of been paid per word and not for quality.

That being said, though, few people do the eternal loveable batchelor better than Clooney, and this movie definitely makes use of that.I love this movie. The kids are cute, George is funny, New York is hectic, and Michelle Pfeiffer is adorably anal. When George takes the kids for the week, he forgets to telephone Michelle (forgive me, I never remember characters names) and let her know that they wouldn't be needing her that particular morning. This sets off a chain of events leading to their having to trade baby-sitting duties for eachother.

I read 'Death of an Addict' wondering the whole time where Hamish's pets were. That took away from my enjoyment of this series. This one was off to me in other ways, too. Hamish looking for a wife and willing to settle for the cold police woman or even the Dutch girl? He barely knows either of them. The book just touched on characters, the girl renting the chalet, or plotlines, the religious cult and the husband and wife running it.I see this one was written in 1999 so I won't worry the author became like Lilian Jackson Braun and 'The Cat Who...\\" series and just phoned it in or had it ghostwritten to terrible results later in that series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing effort!","review":"Having read all of the Hamish McBeth series, I was eagerly looking forward to the latest installment. I have deep suspicions it was written by someone other than M. C. Beaton, as the charm of Scottish village life was almost completely absent from the book. The way I picture Hamish, I could never mistake him for the head of an international drug cartel even disguised in an Armani suit. Ms. Beaton's work started to change, for me, a couple of books ago when she killed off Towser, Hamish's dog. He was an imaginary dog - he could have lived forever.

Remote control helicopters are tricky for many adults to control so we decided that getting him one would just create frustration - and most likely it would get destroyed quickly. I think this toy is a good alternative for younger kids. It is NOT an indestructible, super durable toy - but it's also not expensive AND being made out of foam is what makes it \\"lightweight\\" and safe to use inside. It's not heavy enough to hurt someone or break something inside. After a couple days part of the bottom started to come off. I simply used a dab of hot-glue and it is fine.

The plot is deeply flawed and implausible. It tries to be a number of genres and fails at each. It fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. It almost succeeds as science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, cute cherub face that she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is Helen Mirren. Her performance is fabulously nefarious and is (almost) worth suffering through the rest of it. Her ability to transmute from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range. Other than Marissa Coughlin's delightful Exorcist rendition, Mirren is the only reason to see this movie. A solid 3/10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie","review":"Mrs. Tingle is a teacher that is much-reviled and feared through her school. The opening sequence shows students turning away from her, scrambling to get out of her way, etc. The movie then goes on to show why. Mrs. Tingle is a hard-nosed teacher with a mean streak, she completely disregards Leigh-Anne's hard work and the effort she put into her project, merely giving it a C instead of the A that it deserved.Eventually, Mrs. Tingle gets her comeuppance as she is held prisoner in her house by several irate students, and though the title implies that the teacher becomes the student, the students learn quite a few things themselves.

First off, I am teen and I thought this movie was incredibly stupid, unfunny, and annoying. It had a ridiculous plot--give me a break they had to tie up the teacher otherwise Katie Holmes wouldn't go to college. Not to mention it was ridiculous that the kids were such clay in Tingle's hands ands would do anything Tingle wanted even though she was tied up. Tingle only had to talk for a few minutes about BS and the kids would get all depressed and do stupid things even if it would totally hurt their friends. I could forgive all this for the movie if it was funny, but it wasn't. Also the redhead was a very annoying, stupid, and feeble-willed character. The only upside to the movie: Katie Holmes is hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"First of all, how in the world can anyone call this a comedy? It shows some lady that gets pleasure out of making honest students' lives a living hell.Three kids cheat and she turns them into the office.

The plot was so ridiculous and riddled with bugs (she's held captive for days in her house tied to her bed ... how does she go to the bathroom? ) I actually thought that maybe a twist was that one of the students might have been her daughter / son but even that plausible diversion was not to be. The ending was absolutely incredibly bad.

So instead he just wrote it in his own words and called it \\"Teaching Mrs.Tingle\\". Anyone who read Duncan's novel can see that Williamson just stole her idea. It's even more obvious that it happened after she was unhappy of HIS treatment of her other novel. I remember seeing it in the theater so I could do a compare and contrast afterwards.

The strict, mean teacher was portrayed well in the movie, but the drastic degree the students took to get what they wanted. They break into her house and nearly kill her with an arrow.

This fillm was also Williamson's directorial debut, and included the very talented Katie Holmes.So, to be honest I was probably looking for a lot from this movie, did it deliver? Well to be honest its probably unfair to say if it did, or didn't. To me it just could have been a Dawson's Creek episode(ok, maybe if it had been toned down a bit).

The characters are completely one-dimensional archetypes, and as another reviewer has noted, just devices to keep the sloppy plot moving forward. Mirren can't manage to make Mrs. Tingle believable, because the writing is so poor. This is inspite of being a finer actress, by several orders of magnitude, than the other leads. The conclusion is mind-numbingly and spirit-chrushingly inept: 3 kids hold a person hostage for several days, yet at graduation one of them wins the award for best student, to cheers and a cheesy pop song? It's amusing that the title was changed from Killing Mrs. Tingle out of \\"sensitivity\\" to the events in Columbine; if they'd really wanted to show some concern, the whole story should have been scrapped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I had waited so long for this movie to come out, and then when it did, it completely failed to live up to my expectations.

However, there was very little about this movie that was funny. It should have been labeled a thriller. Helen Mirren, as Mrs. Tingle, is just as frightening as any masked ax murderer, and she does on several occasions try to kill one of the teenagers. My children and I were very disappointed--not in the acting ability of the actors (they did a fine job), but in the film being represented as something that it wasn't.

The plot's very much the same, but the acting here -- if you can call it acting -- is infinitely worse, and too many of the characters are not very interesting and simply unlikable. There's also nothing memorable about the filmmaking itself -- it's very inconsistent, a hodgepodge of styles that never come together in a true directorial vision. In fact, sometimes it seems all director/screenwriter Witkins is interested in are his actors pretty bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and twisted, this movie rocks.","review":"This movie reminds me a lot of Pedro Almodovar's movies.

On the one hand, it is well-written, and I certainly enjoyed Cowan's earlier book on shamanism. However, I am a student of the life of Desiderius Erasmus and I bought the book to examine Cowan's evidence on Erasmus' purported homosexuality. I was deeply disappointed to discover that Cowan's research on this matter was skimpy. It appears to be little more than a recitation of some earlier, equally poorly researched works. Cowan does not include some important material from the readily available Collected Works of Erasmus. Either he never bothered to do this small bit of primary research, or he deliberately suppressed some of the information to be found there. I suspect the former, because there is also some supporting information in CWE Volume 1 that he never cited.I suppose I could recommend this book to a gay man with serious self-esteem problems, but for most people, the factual errors in this book deter me from recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually nothing for 71-73 mustangs","review":"Contrary to the online \\"Book Description\\", this book has virtually no reference to 71' to 73' Mustangs.

Much of the information I need such as location and operation of switches is not there. Other things such as the inner transom plate layout are absent as well. The photos are also very poor quality reproductions, many so dark you can't see the object in question.

Most of these books I'd not known about, but am glad that they are available on Kindle.You must realize that this man lived in a totally different world, and many references are obscure and not available in either dictionary. Also, that at this time extensive verbiage was used. However, the stories are by and large, extremely interesting in themselves and also shed light on the politics of that time. In many ways that has not changed and you will find many parallels in our own time.I have certainly enjoyed re-reading my favorites, such as the 3 Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. However, this is certainly an extensive book and will take many days to finish the entire volume.There are a couple of problems in the Count: continuity is not very reliable in certain parts - missing or misplaced pages, and misspellings (not as intrusive and the former). I have not read the entire volume but look forward to doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A british crime movie that tried too hard to be Snatch-like. I couldn't get into it. Not that interesting.

When the crime boss Don Barber is let go by Mickey he suddenly realizes that Mickey is a man he wants on his payroll. Mickey is tasked with trying to find out who attacked Don and to extract revenge. Since \\"Snatch\\" came out it seems like everyone is trying to make the next one, or be the next Guy Ritchie. Since \\"Snatch\\" I think that \\"Layer Cake\\" is the only one that can be compared to it. This movie is very violent and bloody, that's where the similarities end.

This is absolutely impossible to replicate in my early 1980s townhome with shallow fiberglass baths/shower enclosures.Overall, I liked author's gentle approach to teaching the baby to swim because it is i disagree with the \\"throw the baby in the water and let him figure it out\\" approach recommended by some."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"this book is only good if you started teaching your baby to swim when he was a newborn and it doesn't give many different choices. had some helpful tips, but overall I think I'll buy another one. my recommendation...skip it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd recommend this product only to people who ...","review":"I'd recommend this product only to people who have dental appliances.

But it's a good book for its history and its knowledgeable, if sometimes dry, descriptions of places of interest. Kamil wants to emphasize the distinctiveness of the Coptic church from other manifestations of Christianity, and tries to tie it in which earlier Egyptian pagan practices. I appreciate her effort to not subsume the Coptic church under an indistinct universal \\"Christianity\\", but sometimes her examples seem strained. In any event, that's a topic for a much longer and more in-depth book than this introductory guide, which serves its purpose pretty nicely.

I first read \\"Brief History\\" at a time when I was drawn to two spiritual communities with opposite values: one New Thought and the other Fundamentalist with great music (as detailed in my book, \\"The Bishop and the Seeker). Wilber showed me that I was not backsliding but integrating, and my life has been juicier ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"more psychobabble","review":"it is a measure of just how much surplus capitalism generates that psycho-babblers of this variety are able to make a comfy living trying to impress impressionable coeds. Wilber is convincingly and repeatedly debunked by real scholars who have taken the path of scholarship within their discipline"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that befuddles","review":"He seeks out a lot of important ground and introduces you to it in his own evangelistic way, inextricably mixing in his many confusions. The innocent who reads this book first will probably struggle to unlearn it for decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"A half-baked premise using made up words in an annoying Q&A format. The worst book I have read in five years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brief mystery of nothing","review":"This book is clearly not a scholarly work, in my opinion. This is not a history book. The contents of the book are, in my opinion, pseudo-intellectual babble. I feel dumber for having read as much of the book as I did before throwing it into the trash. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointment","review":"I was looking forward to reading Ken Wilbur's book, expecting a logical, \\"scientific\\" explanation for many questions which I had. Instead, what I read was a series of \\"spiritual musings\\", an author who likes to hear himself write, sententeces full of words, signifying nothing. The form in which the book is written, a question and answer interview, is a good one but it still did not help in clarifying Mr. Wilbur's point of view. Indeed, it is difficult to say what Mr. Wilbur is trying to say although he uses a great many words to say it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as all of his books are","review":"I purchased this revised edition through Amazon, and like it as much or more than I did the original version. I think Ken Wilbur is an excellent source of information, and I respect everything he has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"As a psychotherapist who has used system's thinking as a basis for my work, this book has proven to be a revolution. Wilber's incredible capacity to glean salient facts and then synthesize them, understandably, for the reader is amazing. If I had only read the first 30 pages of this book, my work would have changed. The cherry on the top is his suggestions of the directions we need to work toward. A rare book indeed, that marries spirit with science, philosophy, psychology, physics, etc. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to reality.","review":"This book--a simplified, not \\"dumbed down,\\" version of Wilber's massive tome _Sex, Ecology, Spirituality_--provides a wonderfully clear explanation of humanity and the various means by which humanity has tried to understand itself. It is, indeed, \\"a brief history of everything,\\" covering everything from matter to body to mind to soul to, finally, the absolute No-thing that transcends and embraces all those things. It is humorous, very well-written, highly informative, and the product of an obviously profound spiritual realization. As with all of Wilber's work, I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Introduction to all Integral","review":"This was the first book I've ever read by Ken Wilber. Since then I have become an avid student and practitioner of Integral Philosophy and read almost all of his books.

Not only that, but their spelling in general leaves something to be desired. To be sure what is presented here is no great revelation for any serious student of philosophy- it has been written a thousand times before. But he must be commended on his unique and entertaining way of getting the point across. There is definitely something to be said about his fluency and the clarity of his thoughts. Here is a true scholar. I feel sorry for the readers not able to appreciate the truth and the beauty contained here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"Wilber, in essence, explains they way \\"things just are\\" in our world today. The clarity of his explanations (and their supporting philosophies)are powerful in their completeness.

The title is a bit misleading in the sense that this is more a \\"collection of essays on aspects of English History.\\" It should also be seen as a critique of other popular histories of his day. However, he remains the best Christian apologist in the modern era and of the modern era."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cynical, biased, and disappointing book.","review":"There is a fine line between true wit and cynicism. In this book, the normally witty Chesterton comes across as a cynical old man who longs for the good old days of medieval England when we had popes and kings and queens and guilds and common lands. He is quite snobbish in his rant against contemporary snobs, and he is anti-Protestant and anti-modern to the point of being tiresome.Chesterton actually viewed the English Reformation as nothing more than a power grab by the wealthy. He conveniently downplays the corruption and tyranny of the Roman Catholic Church throughout these centuries. He seems to think that the history of England is a downward slide since the days of the Middle Ages. Indeed, Chesterton was a Catholic medievalist who is still worshiped by Catholic medievalists today.Despite some nice sections, particularly on the Puritans, this book is tiresome and delusional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read of women's lifestyles in 1930's","review":"This book is essentially a how to book for young women growing up in the 1930's. It is fascinating reading on what young girls of that period were taught about becoming a woman. All the required \\"domestic\\" skills of the day are explained in great detail, as well as the requisite social skills. Topics include how to dress in style; care for a home; care for children; sew your own clothes, to name a few. The graphics are delightful, portraying images of that period.If you would enjoy taking a trip in a time machine to the 1930's world of a young lady, then you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to just use the 6 bucks at Taco Bell","review":"This poster is so God awful I can't even bare to look at it.

If I'd run it over the dough twice, I could have created pencil sized strips, but I ran it once and made street vendor size pretzel strips. They were beautiful pretzels and so very easy.

I played along with the record version of this for years on a fretted Steinberger copy. Enjoyed the daylights out of it. Now with a Lightwave fretless, I can get it right.Ton of fun to play along with if you're a bass player. Nothing like a glissando on a fretless...no sir!

It rolls up nicely with velcro and the only thing that would make it better would be if it had a handle. It's thick enough to provide padding, but doesn't take up much room. When it's unrolled, it tends to roll back up, but if you put the flattest part by your feet, it's very useable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"This is a good product.

Since I'm considered a \\"bony\\" person, I couldn't do crunches on many surfaces(Tile, wood, carpet, etc) because it would hurt the tail of my spine. The padding on the mat is great and the cushion cushions he tail of my spine so I can do my crunches correctly and comfortably. It rolls up at the end but that's no problem, has straps so it can be packed up and moved easily making it quite convenient. The mat is quite huge and is perfect for any other type of exercises. People keep ranting on the smell but it only lasts for about a day or so until it goes away (well for mine it did). Overall 5/5 mat in my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a simple foam mat","review":"This mat is nothing but a camping mat with straps attached.

I weigh 145 lbs, and my hands and elbows are smooth as a baby's bottom, I promise. I have a picture, and I'll try to get it uploaded.2) Smells like oil. I live in a single in a college dorm, and this mat stinks up my entire room.

After looking around at different mats and reading reviews like, \\"this one is too thin,\\" and \\"this one is too short,\\" I settled on this and it's perfect. People complain about the end curling up but it doesn't affect anything you do on the mat - either you are tall enough to have your head or feet weighing the curled part down so it's flat, or you are short enough that you don't even reach it.

It is really bad for yoga because it stretches a lot and you can fall. For the mat itself, 3 stars.But one star for the distributor. When my mat arrived, there were noticeable friction marks on the mat where you can see that someone previously rubbed on them and stretched them out. It makes me kind of queasy to use a mat after thinking someone has already drenched their sweat on it. I would try to return this, but I have yet to find a box big enough to fit the mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Pad is great, super soft and rolls up even smaller than I anticipated.

Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent for the price","review":"Good solid exercise mat. I use it mainly to stretch and do ab work. Only annoyance is that since it rolls up, it tends to stay rolled at the very end, instead of being laid out flat.

Wtf?It's an excersise mat. For lieing down and doing excercises. The description could not be more simple. But, I'll review it in case others are confused (either by the product or by the other ppl's reviews).The material that it's made of could not be better for an excercise mat. The mat is about and inch thick. It's made out of like a kind of synthetic-rubbery material. The material is such that it's equally supportive of your contours and firm enough where you'll avoid the distraction of whatever surface is underneath the mat.The mat is a little bit bouncy. Not bouncy enough to jump rope off of it! But just enough to give you an extra push to do 4 or 5 more sit ups.The corners do roll up a little bit but the length is long enough (just over 6 ft.) to not need the whole amount anyway.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"exercise mat","review":"I love this mat!

When not on the mat, it buckles in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thick mat for the price","review":"Like many others, I bought this for P90X Ab workout. Its a nice thick mat with built in straps and it really helps cushion your tail bone and hips when doing the ab workouts.I read some of the other comments about the yoga and jumping and tearing the pad, I can see that happening. I do my yoga barefoot and so far so good. I will I do land pretty soft on it, but also I haven't had it that long either.The biggest thing to note is the smell, it is VERY strong foam/chemical smell.

It sticks to my gym shoes and my hands, and the smell when you first get it is pretty strong. It was a nightmare trying to clean the sweat off of it from the hot yoga session too (I probably should have brought a beach towel for the top though)If you're looking for a mat to keep rolled out all the time and for weightlifting it works but for other purposes it's not quite right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mat.","review":"Bought this for use for a pilates class.

The reviews complaining that they are too short, too long, or that they don't like the material may have valid points for their applications, but if you are looking for 4 foot flat latex bands in three different levels of resistance, than look no further. These bands are exactly as advertised.I agree with other reviewers that longer bands are better for some applications, but my point is that you shouldn't complain about a 4 foot band being 4 foot, if that is what it was advertised as being.These bands are what they say they are. If that is what you need, I recommend them. If you need something longer, they also sell longer ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stretch Bands...for My Purposes at Least","review":"Length:: 2:48 MinsMain Points+ 3 different levels of resistance= Satisfactory quality= Workout booklet- Probably better bands out there"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best 1989 Rippingtons album","review":"I like this album a lot!

I purchased the first three and I was very happy at the quality of the products. Not so happy with the Skydiver. It has quite a few poorly finished edges and it does not come with a display stand. It just sits and rolls poorly on a desk. There is not flat spot for it to sit upright. The Sky One part is made of cheap plastic and it mounts into the SkyDiver with a pressure fitting. The paint is already rubbing off at the pressure spots. Why couldn't the manufacturer of this model use a magnetic fitting as was used for the Fireball Jr fitting.The SkyDiver is not one of the better reproductions and I would not recommend it in it's current state of manufacture. Considering the high quality of some of the other models I have, this one does not make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture didn't match","review":"I ordered this with the excitement of a 10 year old on Christmas- I've been desperately looking for the Where in The World is Carmen Sandiego that I played when I was a litle girl. I ordered this one because the picture of the item showed the version I've been looking for-the 1996 version, however, when I got the CD, I got the 2001 version, which is A) not the one I want, and B) not the one in the picture. I wish they would've specified to me that they were going to send me the 2001 version instead of having me order it thinking that I was purchasing the 1996 version (which again, is the version pictured). The only good thing about my experience is that I got the shipment really fast-about 3 days after I placed the order."},{"rating":"2","title":"KISSING? TELLING?

Stay in the pink. And pucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected from DK","review":"We have other \\"Eyewitness\\" books which we enjoy very much. This one is a disappointment.

I find most of them are cheap imitations of THE RING, or THE GRUDGE-with the long hair and creepy girl. This is no exception-you have creepy girl with long black hair. Sounds familiar? The acting is downright stupid, and I have an extremely difficult time keeping my attention on this piece of trash. On the plus side there are a few nice gorey scenes, but, well, that's about it. Stupid idiotic acting, a very disjointed plot (typical of a lot of new Asian horror)-hard to understand, and BORING. A few nice gory scenes do not make a good movie. UNLESS you like young semi-nude asian girls squealing (rediculous screaming-which is obviously very silly and fake due to BAD ACTING), even a scene where a girlie is bulemic and you get to (oh joy) look at her vomit-then by all means get this movie. But I was NOT looking for an asian flick. HORROR THIS MOVIE IS *NOT*."},{"rating":"2","title":"The seanachais weaves a magical tale","review":"I've read all three of Mali's books, each one more delightful than the last. Perhaps by virtue of being her first novel, Steenie O'Shea is the most intriguing. It operates on at least three levels- the first, a well-spun tale that leads the reader across continents and worlds, through mysteries and surprises and revelations. The story is also a light breaking through gloomy clouds, a vision of the world that could be, the hope and the promise of the Blue children. (I find myself gazing into people's eyes, looking for the tell-tale signs.) And for me, personally, the story wrought a transformation. Opening up a dark corner of my psyche, exposing in a gentle way my wishes for vengeance, hidden and denied but so powerful in my responses-bringing them into a light of healing. I thank Mali for guiding me to love for all the children. Looking to curl up with a simple good read or on a spiritual journey, Steenie O'Shea is a book to reach for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is an extremely boring book and I don't suggest it.

This book was given to me recently at a conference. Several of the phrases used in this book are taken from other education books.

She believed in this book so much that she didn't even share it with her staff in Texas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refining Common Sense: Moving from Data to Information","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews I have read. I recently heard Ms. Phelps selling her book at a conference I attended. She did a good sales job so I bought the book. Big waste of money! It is just common sense information nothing new. I too met someone from the district the author is from at the TASSP conference and they didn't even know she wrote a book on data. In fact they said she never used or discussed data with the administrative staff. Isn't that ironic! Save your nickel don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only tolerate tutorial books that are clear","review":"When you're a beginner, and obviously one usually is when reading this type of material, you can't afford to waste time and energy reading 3 or 4 books to compensate for their flaws. You want one solid one that can quickly get you up to speed without tripping you up. I found the writing style to be awkward and perhaps it is the more formal British writing style. The material seems to be comprehensive but unfortunately the explanations are too brief. I found that I understood some stuff only because I have read other OOP and algorithm texts, and for a newbie without that background this book would be rather confusing. I might give it 3 stars but someone gave it 5 so I want to even it out immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading title","review":"If you step into the Java universe bubble, then \\"Java Collections\\" means the standard core API with the same name. This book does not cover the standard classes and interfaces that form the Java Collections API, and this is a real shame.

If you like \\"On The Run\\" (and it is a worthwhile song), then try to uncover an out-of-print copy of the full length album \\"Steel Works!\\", because it's got \\"On The Run\\" plus other great songs, like their second claim to fame, \\"The Bog\\". The prolific remixes of \\"On The Run\\" on this single are fairly unoriginal and annoying after three of them in a row. \\"Tschirm Tschikwirk\\", the other non-album track, is just a lot of noise..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, excellent, Soon to be a classic","review":"This was the first peek at Bigod 20 that most of the mainstream saw. They have several remixes of the title track, \\"On the Run\\"; however none of these mixes have that stale redundancy that often brings down dance singles. The cover of \\"Like a Prayer\\" makes a great B-side.

It also creates a bond between me and my boys. They ask question about some guests appearances and characters as well as my childhood and life in the 80's, which is always good.

She has a whirlwind mind and a gift for pithy expression, though once in a while she slips into a kind of gauzy equivocating that weakens her arguments. Still, this idiosyncratic take on ancient eros has moments of great insight and deserves the attention of classical scholars and non-specialists who are interested in the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"This brief account of eros is beautifully poetic distillation of the multiple instantiations of the logic of eros in ancient Greek philosophy and myth. Carson is a first rate classicist and her powers as an interpreter of ancient Greek texts is abundant here. More importantly, her poetic sensibility illuminates the lightness and complexity of the movement of eros; through readings of Plato, Sappho, and others, a vibrant picture of eros and its place within Greek thought emerges. I was particularly struck with her writing on the temporality of eros, which does so much to encapsulate its paradoxical essence. A supremely beautiful and enlightening text."},{"rating":"1","title":"The color bleeds","review":"I was disapointed that the navy color bled onto the white of the blanket.

His smooth, expressive tone is what many guitarists can only dream of coming close to.He is also probably one of the most requested session musicians ever. His early work with Steely Dan was just brilliant and here on this disc, although you don't get the Steely Dan stuff, you get a very good representation of his first 12 years in the business.As is expected of a GRP recording, the sound quality is excellent coming from a digital master and there are two never before released recordings as well. The best track is \\"Sleepwalk\\" which shows you just what great phrasing the guy has, probably one of the hardest things for any musician to achieve is good phrasing and LC achieves this with ease.A brilliant musician and a great disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry carlton","review":"Larry Carlton is possibly the best american guitarist at this time.

From what I can tell that really wasn't the world view of this guy. What he does predict most is off, some he gets right. Some of the really wacky stuff is that China nor India would never be a world economic power and Israel would join a union with other Arab nations. Some of what he gets right is the creation of something like the EU and that governments would push the mixing and intermarrying of different races. The biggest thing that he missed was that the big plan is that soveriegn nations would be a thing of the past and all these countries that at least on the surface were at each others throats are now interlocked and interdependent on each other at the high levels. Its the new world order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is a must for any Duck fan and a great collection of tasty lines that are fun, accessible and bound to improve one's playing.

So already it's $8 too much.I needed this spoon for a stubborn moped tire that was impossible to put on. I realize this tool isn't a chisel, but the difficulty of the tire necessitated some tapping on the handle with a hammer to get it past a very taught part of rubber. A couple taps with a hammer and the handle just broke off. Realize I wasn't pounding in a nail, I was tapping the handle to push this tool past taught rubber.Cheap garbage. The handle is a cheap piece of plastic barely mounted on the metal spoon. It looks like a quality tool in the pic, don't be fooled. It should be priced around $4-5.

The reason I only give it 2 stars is for 3 reasons. 1.) It uses a proprietary cable. I lost it and could not find it anywhere, including on the support web site iclickdigital. 2.) The slider control is now broken on my unit after using it to navigate from folder to folder. I've been pretty light on the touch so to see that it is broken now is very discouraging. 3.) The support for this device is virtually non-existent. There are some chat rooms on iclick's website but no one could tell me where I could get a replacement cable.

A Clever Segway For Indoctrination","review":"Author Marcus Pfister couldn't have written a more clever segway for the indoctrination for socialistic / communistic attributes for today's children.In a nutshell, the Rainbow Fish had more than other fish. The others were jealous and wanted what the rainbow fish had, shiny scales. They would constantly ask Rainbow for some of his scales, but he wouldn't opine. So, the fish alienated him.He grew concerned that no one would talk to him, so he sought the advice of an octopus, a creature in this book that I would equate with any modern US democratic party politician.The octopus says if you give each other fish each a shiny scale of yours, they'll like you and you'll be happy and have friends again (wealth redistribution). Rainbow does this, and the other fish hang out with him, and Rainbow's happy, so the book claims.I will never read this book to my daughter again, and this book now serves as a bottom liner for my bathroom trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"rainbow fish big book","review":"the story itself is fabulous for sharing and being a good friend.

The octopus directly instructs the Rainbow Fish in \\"correct\\" behavior. Why should the Rainbow fish give up pieces of his body that protect him, to these other fish just so they will leave him alone? Some might be inclined to call this a Marxist philosophy incorrectly, but for the fact that the other little fish had no \\"need\\" for the Rainbow Fish's body parts. They simply wanted them.

All the other fish (that looked the same) shunned the fish that was different because it wouldn't give the other fish it's shinny scales.

Rather than creating a story where the fish must deal with his pride, the author instead points to the fish's beauty as the source of his problem. In order to win acceptance with the other fish, he removes his beautiful scales and gives them to the other fish to buy their affection.

The fish is advised by someone \\"wise\\" to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it. It follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy. For me this is a terrible moral! It's wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way?

Instead, I see a uniquely beautiful fish who has a hard time making friends because he is different. So he starts giving away the very thing that makes him both unique and beautiful, his rainbow scales. Soon, everyone has his scales. Not only did he give away the essence of himself, but he created a world where, in order to get along, everyone is exaclty the same.

It doesn't give a positive message such as we should respect people's differences. It says to a kid that you should merge with all the others.

It is about giving everything away that is yours, and then people will like you. Seems very communistic to me. My 4 year old also wanted me to read it to him. After I did, we had a big discussion about how you should not have to give all of your things away to have friends, and those are not the type of people you want to be your friend anyway.

Yes, there is the lesson about not thinking yourself so grand that you do not want to play with others, however that concept is quickly lost in the prose as the fish gives away all of his scales until he looks like the other fish. WHAT NEXT??? Are we going to have a book about a wise owl that acts stupid to gain friends?

However, The Rainbow Fish goes a bit beyond that, telling a story where you are not able to have friends unless you give them gifts. It reminds me of a very lonely child at school who gives people things so others will like him. On the up-side it does speak of the happiness that can be found in giving things to others (Why I gave it two stars) and the illustrations are very captivating - especially for toddlers and infants.Overall I would Not recommend this book to other parents, even with all the pretty pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures but terrible message","review":"Am I the only one in the world who hates the Rainbow Fish's message, i.e., that one has to buy friends by giving them the things one cherishes most?

All the sea life presented has a bland sameness about it and the colors are limited to a cold blue palette.More important,I think the lesson presented in this book is shallow and one-sided. Yes, the Rainbow Fish is vain and selfish but the behavior of the other fish is never questioned and therefore assumed to be correct. Why, for instance, does the little fish deserve a shiny scale? When he doesn't receive one he immediately tells the other fish and they all shun the Rainbow Fish. Apparently, the only way for the Rainbow Fish to regain their friendship is to \\"buy\\" it with his beautiful scales.I would have much rather seen the Rainbow fish do something heroic and perhaps lose or dull his scales in the process.

Quite frankly, I think the Rainbow Fish was the ugliest fish in the sea . . .Whatever happened to themes like \\"never judge a book by its cover\\" and friendship will come when kindness comes from within, when you are accepting of another's inadequacies as well as their excellence, or when you are honest and build trust by caring and sharing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be: A toddler primer on the communist ideal","review":"This is a terrible book.

It is only after he gives away all but one of his unique scales that the other fish befriend him. I think that's a horrible message! After reading this to my child we talked about the outcome and I told him that the blue fish was very mean and that you should love and care for someone just the way they are, and that envy, for shiny scales or otherwise, is destructive.

Do I feel that strongly? No, but I believe his argument has definite credence to it. There are plenty of other books that teach sharing in a better way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Round yourself down to be like others","review":"Someone gave us this book as a gift, I never would have purchased it myself for my kids or any kids. To echo what others have already said, it's about a fish with shiny scales who tears off her very skin so that she can buy the friendship of a bunch of mooching losers. I read it to my kids verbatim only once, but after that made up an alternate ending in which Rainbow Fish refuses to give her scales away. Rainbow Fish is lonely for a while but eventually encounters other fish with shiny scales like herself and lives happily among them, while the other fish who tried to beg her scales away from her end up being caught by fishermen and eaten.Read your kids Aesop's fables like The Ant and The Grasshopper instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grotesque","review":"It is unclear how this managed to get published in the first place, but the message of self-mutilation for the sake of appeasement and egalitarianism is appalling, not appealing. It entered my house as a gift and, I am happy to say, quickly became the topic of an ongoing \\"twisted moral interpretation\\" contest among my children, all of whom categorically rejected the story in turn. On first exposure to the story, my latest two year old closed the book and forcefully discarded it shortly before the end.I await with some anticipation their exposure to Das Kapital, Mein Kampf, and Mao's Little Red Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurt to read this","review":"Someone I love dearly gave it to my son, so I could not avoid reading this to him. If you believe in personal effort to achieve goals for your children, do not read this to them. The message of mediocrity as a goal is painful to articulate to your child, unless you see no hope for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of My Library","review":"Synopsis: The Rainbow Fish has lots of shiny scales. All the other fish won't play with the rainbow fish. Then the wise octopus says give away your scales. As soon as the rainbow fish gives away his scales, the other fish play with him. The end.Analysis:1. I do understand that this is *supposed* to be about sharing, but I think that pulling parts of yourself off and giving them away is not a good idea2. It seems rather socialist to me--everyone simply must have a shiny scale whether or not they have the capacity to grow their own shiny scales or not.3. Why should anyone have to pay people to be their friend???I don't think I like this book at all. The lessons it seems to be teaching are questionable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book a child could ever read.","review":"This book is pure socialist rhetoric. It would teach children that there is something wrong with being prettier or having more. It suggests that someone could not be accepted or valued because they have more and should simply give away what they have to get friends. There is no exchange in this book at all...the little fish simply complain and the \\"government\\" tells the rainbow fish to give his shiny scales away so that he'll be liked. It's a horrible lesson to teach children. Not only does it teach them to just give their stuff away to earn friends, but it also suggests they should not like those who have more, are prettier or work harder and should expect a handout without any effort or exchange."},{"rating":"1","title":"An obnoxious testament to socialism and bullying","review":"This is a book that hides a hideous message under its brilliant illustrations. No one will disagree that Pfister can draw up a storm, though I wonder about his sly pen name, derived from the Latin root for fish.But the book celebrates ostracism that drives a fish with colorful scales to tear off his scales and give them one apiece to the ostracizing herd---so that aesthetically he is dragged down to their level and so that the masses gain only a marginal improvement by completely destroying the appearance of the standout.Sounds wonderful to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This book is simply terrible. It claims to be about sharing, but the real message is that you can buy friends if you give them gifts. It also teaches children that fish can remove their scales and attach them to other fish. While adults know this is rediculous, children think they have just learned something new. I would be thoroughly embarrassed if I were the author of the book to have my name on it. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long for a Toddler","review":"I have a one year old and this book is too long with their short attention span, but she likes to play with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a very educational and fun book!","review":"I used this book in a classroom to teach a lesson about sharing. The book fit in perfectly to what I wanted to teach the children about sharing. After I read the book and discussed the theme, we did an art project where the kids made their own fish and painted them and then we stuck a \\"shiny\\" scale on it. It turned out really cute and the kids really enjoyed the project!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I am one of the countless many that think this book is for the trash-bin. Did they import this from North Korea and translate for fawning liberals??If you really don't think you child is exceptional, or should never think of himself as such then you should buy. If you believe your child should lower his standards or be embarrassed for possessing something others don't have then definitely buy this book. If you think a book where one indiscriminately gives away material stuff to be popular gives a positive message about sharing then this book is a must-have.....Otherwise save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Fish","review":"This is a great story but I really expected the book to be a little bigger. I thought I was buying the hardcover but I ended up with a very small board book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches","review":"I think this book only deserved 4 stars because it showes kids how to share but it does it in a serious way and most kids dont enjoy serious stuff that much. To make this book better they could of made it fun. This book teaches a good lesson though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The anti-value book","review":"This book preaches conformity and enforces that different is bad. I will NOT allow my children to read this trash. Each and every person and animal on this planet is different, and for someone to actually waste the paper to publish a book like this absolutely disgusts me. Differences should be accepted or even celebrated. This book teaches the very opposite.What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfish Fish Demand Payment for Friendship","review":"Won't you take off those protective scales that grow on you so that I might look good wearing them. NO? Then not only will I not talk to you any more, but I will go and tell everyone else that they should not have anything to do with you either. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to give up whatever you like about yourself, give in to my demands, and follow me.Of course sharing is good and right, but sharing is not in response to demands that say \\"Give me what I want or I'll make your life miserable.\\" The positive feeling that comes from giving should be about doing what is right, not about buying friends or paying off enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!","review":"The author depicts the beautiful Rainbow Fish as constantly and impolitely snubbing the other fish until they no longer want to play with him. Thus, he shares his scales with all the other fish so that he's no longer special and they all look alike. What?! This is not good.The message should have been that however you look, you should be humble and kind to others, not that you should rid yourself of (or share) all that makes you special and unique. Rainbow Fish should have kept his gorgeous scales and learned some manners. This is a bizarre and disturbing book whose popularity baffles me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible, Horrible Lesson","review":"This book must be properly framed for a child, otherwise they will take away the lesson that fitting in is much more important than finding out what it is that makes us all different and unique. The book reads just fine up until the rainbow fish is told (mandated, nearly) to share with everyone the very thing that makes it unique - hence, to dillute itself and bend to the whims of others.I would have preferred to see the authors take a harder line against this, but I suppose that it's fitting in this day and age to teach our children that fitting in is #1, and realizing what makes you different, or special, or unique, is secondary and expendible.A real shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Rather Rotten","review":"I was gratified to see the trillions of lousy reviews for this book on Amazon. Still, I thought I'd throw in my shimmering scale too! And for those who think the book is some sort of insidious left-wing plot -- sorry, I'm as progressive as they come, and I hate the lousy thing too.The book's \\"Give up what makes you special and bribe your way to friendship\\" message has been adequately dissed in other reviews, but even leaving that aside, this just isn't a very good book. The text is insipid and the illustrations (once you look past the very lovely hologram foil effects) are weakly executed. If it had no \\"message\\" at all, this would still be a mediocre book, with no wit, originality, or compelling characters to recommend it. Two stars for the pretty kid-attracting fishy scales -- I would give it 1 1/2 if allowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaching children to conform","review":"Forget about \\"buying friends.\\" This is nothing less than a picture book version of the society Kurt Vonnegut described in \\"Harrison Bergeron.\\" Everyone must be exactly alike. No one must stand out. What a terrible lesson for a child. Would you cut off most of your child's hair to \\"share\\" with her supposed friends? Then why would you applaud a fish giving away its scales? Instead of celebrating what makes each of us special (and perhaps teaching a lesson in humility) \\"The Rainbow Fish\\" celebrates rigid conformity. Pretty pictures aside, it's repulsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entitlement Fish","review":"This book was given as a gift to my infant daughter, who loves the illustrations. Once she is able to read, however, I think I'll put this book where she can't find it. This book claims to be about sharing, but it is really about buying friends - friends that feel entitled to have what is yours. The Rainbow Fish in the story is vain because of his beautiful scales. The other fish don't like him because he won't give them his scales. The way the Rainbow Fish makes friends is to give his scales away - there is never any mention of \\"sharing.\\" I think this book sends an awful message about entitlement and jealousy, and the only thing that makes this book worth a look is for the illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bore.","review":"The story in this book plods along. Even for little kids, it's very \\"preachy.\\" My children enjoyed the shiny fish scales much more than the story. This book was a disappointment. It just goes to show, don't judge a book by its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rainbow Fish","review":"If you're a parent who would like to teach your child the values of socialism then this is the book for you. The story suggest to the reader happiness cannot be had by those who have more than others.When the rainbow fish asked the octopus (the 8 greedy arms of big government) for advice he told the rainbow fish to give his scales away to the other fish. If you have doubts as to whether of not children books can be used as propaganda watch the movie Closet Land. Though the sympathy is meant for the heroine, there is a good argument made against her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful book with a very dangerous lesson","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated book which, on the surface, is a lesson about sharing. When you think about it a little more carefully there's another lesson: Conformity is more important than Independence. By the hero's sacrifice of the essence of what makes him special, we are also taught that mediocrity is to be valued above excellence. I think that it is neither wise nor desirable to teach our children to lower their expectations and do anything necessary to fit in with the crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous moral lessons here!","review":"The illustrations are beautiful.The moral messages are not beautiful: change who you are so others accept you. Give what you have to others who don't have what you have so they will like you.This sounds like the author is a socialist. Coming from Switzerland, it's a real possibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Thought Out for an American","review":"Pros: colorful, easy read for beginning readersCons: gives the reader the belief that you must give away what makes you special in order to make friends.I personally don't want those friends, nor do I want my children to have them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want To Be Friends?","review":"Most (I hope) would agree that sel\\"fish\\"ness is not to be admired. However, I cannot admire a story which teaches that the best way to \\"lure\\" friends is by offering them some cool stuff.If nothing else, this book confirms that it is too easy to buy friends. It does not remind the reader that no one really wants to be friends with those people in the long run.Two points for the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Make People Like You?","review":"Illustrations are beautiful, but the story is terrible.

I just don't hear the quality in the songwriting this time. Everything sounds forced and plastic to me.I read concerns from fans over the female drummer but the drums sound solid to me. Not an issue at all. Just no catchy songs.The thing that I think made RB great was that they took what AC/DC was before they became a caricature of themselves and made it better. Albums brimming with swagger and raw energy from top to bottom.I hate to put anything negative down about such a great band but, since I tend to check the customer reviews before I buy, my advice is: buy any one of (or all three of) the previous releases: Pain, Get Used To It, Rhino Bucket. If you're reading this I'll be shocked if you don't love them. Skip this album. Hopefully there will be a next one and it will be better. And....definitely see them live if you get a chance. Like most great bands, the recording is just a shadow of what they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"and then it got old","review":"the title of this album says it all, a huge letdown after the first three releases"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Albumn Since \\"Potshot 'Til I Die\\"","review":"This CD is kickass.

The book and cd waste a lot of space with some of the most commonplace forms of poetry - Mother Goose rhymes and limericks - to which many parents will have already introduced their children. The book veers from nursery rhymes to multiple poems involving death to Shakespearean sonnets. The choices of poems within each form introduced could have been improved upon - many are downright uninteresting. Finally, I reached for the CD, hoping the purchase could be saved by the careful, luscious reading of selected excellent examples on it. Alas, alack. Two \\"professional\\" actors read - neither, unfortunately, possessing either the gravitas or the tonal depth to make the poems ring. And again, the cd is littered with limericks and nursery rhymes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging for both child and parent","review":"My son is only in preschool and has a lot of fun with this book, and I think it has enough variety and range that we'll return to it for years. There is great background material for parents to read and think about, and perhaps share with their kids as they get older. The performance of the poems on the CD is lackluster, but the overall quality of the book's text and selections is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read along for kids and intro to poetry","review":"Really nice book, lovely poems and my children read along with the CD. With all the state exams coming up, it is an excellent way to teach figurative language in depth and learn some of the classics long forgotten in school books today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whimsically Thorough","review":"I found this book through a bookstore display, and am very pleased with it. This is a well thought out, thorough introduction to basic poetry forms, with familiar poems--a comfort to the parent who may want to read this material to the younger child. The drawings are really fun, with enough on the page for the jaded 21st century eye to look at. If that weren't enough, there's a CD of the poems, so the reader can also hear them spoken, an important element of poetry.I think the breadth of the poetry styles chosen, including the nursery rhymes and limericks, is just right, and can be expanded on by the parent or teacher by reaching beyond the book. I plan to use this book as a basis for some directed summertime reading for my grandkids, but this book is easily enjoyed by the adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"The book and cd came is great condition and the cd was scratch free.

King's tongue in cheek performance is notable. And they really could have done without Kenny G..."},{"rating":"2","title":"11 out of 12 ain't bad at all","review":"As the title says, there are eleven wonderful tracks on this CD. Ones that outshine the rest are B.B. King's rendition of \\"Joe Cool\\" and Dave Grusin's \\"History Lesson\\". Also deserving of recognition are Patti Austin, who does a stellar job on the classic \\"Christmas Time is Here,\\" and Dave Brubeck's track entitled \\"Benjamin.\\" It has a wonderfully Brubeck feel, complete with solid flute lead. In short, even if you don't care for the sax styling of Kenny G., buy this disc.

Love isn't always tidy and all of the characters Will, John, Sharon, Griffin and Candace define love differently and deal with it differently.

Our old one worked well for many years before wearing out. Though this one looks the same, it won't open cans well at all. It continually slips off the can rim, requiring innumerable reinsertions. Several rounds are required to finally open the can and then I have to use a knife to pry the lid back because it is inevitably held on by a thread of remaining lid. The only hope you have in getting a good opener is if the particular one I received is a coincidental, rare dud.

When our manual opener broke about a year ago, I found that Amazon carried openers that looked like what I remembered. I ordered one and was impressed with its operation until after 10 cans or so when it began to ride up and out of the 'groove' leaving the lid only partially cut. There are no adjustments and trying to keep the cutter in the groove was not successful. Looking at the experiences of others with this product on Amazon, I found they had the same problem. In hunting for other manufacturers, I did not find any. Seems the openers are now made in China and the quality seems to have suffered. It amazes me that it appears there is only one manufacturer for this product. It is disappointing because it really is much easier to open cans on a wall mount (that works)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China - What Else is New?","review":"Poorly manufactured by cheap labor in China.

So if the can has any liquid in it, like soup, it makes a huge mess.Also, because of the thin metal of the body, the opener fits very loosely inside the slot on the bracket and constantly pops out, which requires one hand to hold the can and the other to do double duty - turning the handle and holding the opener in the slot.What an annoying waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONLY FOOLISH PEOPLE USE ELECTRIC CAN OPENERS","review":"Swing A Way is simply the best can opener ever made.

That said, this is a beautiful novel that is quietly and carefully written. McLeod's spare writing style is very evocative of the stark Cape Breton landscape and the generally taciturn nature of the Scottish clan who lives there. But the author also has the rare ability to write a few sentences that carry enormous emotional weight, then leaves well enough alone. But somehow the brevity of the writing only deepens the impact of what he's just told you. And if you're like me and a total putz for any story that includes canine loyalty symbolism, you can't beat this book. I won't give anything away, just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Hundred Percent Masterpiece!","review":"I was engaged from the start, and kept savoring my very limited reading time, hiding away with Kick for ten minutes here, twenty there, like a guilty pleasure.

The clues are obtuse and the motive undetectable. It needs to be explained in the final chapter.Back home Charlie is running amuck again.

We'll be painting these to go with our steampunk costumes (don't paint any of the moving parts! ask me how I know...).

I find watching grass grow to be a lot more entertaining than Stay Away Joe, which is remarkable considering I'm a huge fan of Elvis, his corny movies, and a couple of the girls in this movie. Quentin Dean (In the Heat of the Night) is a total sweet potato...but she nor Elvis can make up for how horrible this movie is.It was a struggle for me to watch this movie, and to be honest, I can't even say for sure if I made it all the way through to the movie's end. It gets no worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the two or 3 worst Elvis movies","review":"I've seen all of Elvis' movies, and this is one of the worst three.

For sure, the plotline should have been tweaked here and there, along with some sexier-looking chicks and a better Elvis soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY !","review":"Just like the title says...STAY AWAY ! It would be a great movie for insomniacs as it is sure to put anyone to sleep. And to the powers to be...please don't ever let this escape onto DvD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away Joe - Elvis","review":"I have a collection of all of Elvis' movies - this is one of only two that I didn't particularly care for. Doesn't show Elvis' talent at all and frankly I just felt the movie lacked substance. Elvis could have been an excellent star if he would have been given roles to play that tapped into his dramatic side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly dreadful - stay away from Stay Away Joe","review":"I found this at Big Lots for $3.00. One of the most truly dreadful movies ever to use up perfectly good film stock. Now and then there is a scenic view of the beautiful country around Sedona, Arizona, but you would be better off looking at a National Geographic magazine of the same. To call this movie \\"slapstick\\" is an insult to the Keystone Kops and Laurel and Hardy. Do not be fooled by the supporting cast of formerly good actors. They must have been desperate for a movie role to have accepted these roles. This must be an example of why Elvis became sick and tired of making cheesy movies and went back to performing on stage. I saw Elvis in person twice (Honolulu, 1957 and San Diego, 1976) so am predisposed to like Elvis. I liked him before he was cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Threw Away The Boilerplate and Still Made a Bomb","review":"If you watch the original trailor or listen to the songs from this movie you can't imagine that it could be so bad - the primary reason is that Native Americans are portrayed in the most stereotypical way possible. This is amazing in light of Elvis' Pacer character from \\"Flaming Star\\" eight years before, which received formal recognition as a positive portrayal. The film also has a very low budget look. For Elvis historians, it's possible to view it as a step closer to the '68 TV Special and re-emerged credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Elvis Curio","review":"Elvis Presley gives one of his liveliest performances in \\"Stay Away, Joe\\" (1968) while singing only a few songs. Though a significant departure from the musical-comedy formula, the overall film is a misguided adaptation of Dan Cushman's satirical novel. Scenic Arizona locations and a fine veteran cast accomplish little in this hopeless mess. Nevertheless, curious Elvis fans might want to take a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER LOOK BACK","review":"I GUESS THIS MOVIE MUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST EMBARRACING MOVIE MADE BY ELVIS.

One of which, was stated on the blurb, that \\"Arnrings' past begins to unravel, revealing a shattering secret that reaches back nearly a century\\". IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I kept waiting for something spectacular to come out, but there was nothing there. If they meant the fact that he was illegitimate that appears in the beginning of the book. It also states that he went west....but he ended up in Texas??? I adore Ms Plain's books and will forever keep on reading them, but these mistakes should be caught before publication.Actually the book is stated as a generational book, but it takes us 310 pages with Adam's story, and leaves us with only 46 pages of the next two generations. I was confused with the story of Mr. Snow (Leo). It states that he picked up the litter of puppies abandoned beside the road, and it was in fact Adam's mother Eileen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain's gone downhill","review":"Every year or so I look forward to the new Belva Plain novel and each year for the last 6 or thereabout I've been disappointed. This has been a LONG road downhill since Evergreen, whose pages I still re-read when in need of a classic.The Sight of the Stars has a boring, plodding lead, Adam, who performs not a single exceptional act in the entire book. Plain leads you to believe that it's his very decency that is heroic; but instead, even to the end, you're left wondering what great event is going to hapen to make this book worthwhile reading. Subplots concerning his strange brother, Leo and his other brother's fiancee, with whom he spends two cheating nights (not even detailed!) fail to arouse any interest. Even the last few pages, which I will shall not spoil by revealing, do not close the book satisfactorily.Oh, for another Anna, Joseph or Paul...

I think that I will stick to reading her earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"There are so many time-frame discrepancies in this book. She refers to a guidance counselor in the high school. It's 1907 for Heaven's sake - no guidance counselors back then! Most people didn't even earn a high school diploma! Author also speaks of bio-chemistry. In 1912, it would have been just plain chemistry. The sons in this book referred to their father as \\"Pa\\", but called their mother \\"Mom\\". Surely she would have been either Mother or Ma. Mom is a much more recent name. And she speaks of people taking accounting classes. It would have been bookkeeping back then. These concepts were so distracting to this reader. Belva Plain's writing has deteriorated with every book since her first terrific \\"Evergreen\\". Don't bother to buy this book. Borrow it from your local library, if you feel the need to read it at all. Such a disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the author of Evergreen?","review":"I have to say that this is one of the most disappointing books I have ever purchased. It was an incredibly bland story, with absolutely no point. Honestly; there was one paragraph that essentially read... \\"she got sick, she got sicker, she was really sick, she died.\\" And that was about one of the primary characters. There was really nothing endearing about the characters, nothing memorable about the plot.

The only problem is the mat itself.The mat is smelly, which will probably wear off with use, and it's a bit narrow. But the worst part is that it's not sticky. It's SLIPPERY. Imagine my surprise when I moved into downward-dog pose and almost fell flat on my face because I couldn't get my hands or feet to stop slipping!! I ended up throwing the mat to the side and finishing my practice without it.Now I have to run to the store and buy a $15 Gaiam mat. I would never recommend this brand of mat.

PVC is dangerous to our health and environment from start to finish - in the factory, at home, and in the trash - releasing poisonous chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects. (I should have checked this prior to purchasing it, that was my error.) My hope is to make other shoppers aware that there are numerous healthy and eco friendly alternatives out there. (Gaiam, Enviromat, Prana, & so many more.) If you are doing yoga for your health and well being than it only makes sense that you are doing it on a material that supports that goal (as well as honoring our planet - PVC is so incongruent with the practice of yoga). Perhaps Valeo will phase it out if enough consumers let them know why they didn't choose their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Kit, Good Price, but Purple?","review":"I started exercising more at home (P90X), and needed a good mat to work out mat for our hardwood floors. The Valeo Yoga Kit does the trick with a pretty big mat and good cushioning. It's the same thickness as the other \\"generic\\" mats out there, but it comes complete with a strap, bag, and 2 yoga blocks (which you use in P90X).My only gripe is the ridiculous purple color (not very manly). But it does the trick. The only other thing is the initial slight chemical smell of the mat. Of course, it fades over time. I'd recommend airing it out when you receive it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy with the fumes from the product","review":"At first, I was very excited to receive this kit but then, the smell just didnt go away!

In that case, I guess I should give it a higher rating, although I'm not sure my teeth are any whiter. With whitening pastes there is a price to pay in that they tend to be abrasive and wear down the enamal, and I believe that is my problem. I am now making the connection that since using this product, I have been to dentists (general, endontists and periodontists) more times than I can remember for broken teeth, root canals, root extracts and crown restorations.

I was actully embarrased to tell them that I used a dollar tree toothpaste. It's been several years since that day and I think I've tried my fair share of expensive whitening toothpastes out there all of which were a great dissapoimtment. Not only did they not whiten my teeth nearly as well as this product but they left my mouth feeling unclean and did nothing for buildup. I was so sick of spending all that money that I decided to grab a tube of ultrabrite at the dollar tree on a whim. At the time I just figured that if they're all crap anyway why waste all that money. I was quickly reminded of how great my smile can be. It works better then any other toothpaste on the market in my opinion.

The book is very soft and kid friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Heartbreaking and Enlightening","review":"\\"Please read this\\" is all I can say!

My own three dogs came from situations very much like the fine pooches in this wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"As an advocate for animal welfare and volunteer at multiple shelters, I was really excited to read this book. However, to my disappointment it is not very well written...the stories are underdeveloped and boring. This type of collection has a lot more potential than this, and these dogs deserve a better tribute.

Loved the catchy tunes (still listen to the CD regularly) and moving story line. Anybody who is a Bay Area local will appreciate the inside jokes, but even if you aren't.. you will enjoy this if you like musicals and are looking for something just a little different. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colma:The Musical","review":"Pleasant little surprise of a film with some haunting music and memorable cinematography. Though some of the acting was not as professional as I'd hoped, the mood and energy protrayed was effective. Made me want to see Colma in person, which I did. \\"Colma Stays\\" among my favorite videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...not what I expected","review":"I had heard great things about this. I guess I interpreted musical to mean soundtrack over people singing the story lines. The singing is too muddled to keep track of what's going on.Interesting concept, execution falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive By Transformation","review":"It always amazes when consulting firms produce tomes such as these with the expectation that a relatively shallow skimming of the waters combined with quotes from firm clients is enough to impart \\"wisdom to the masses\\". Even as a KPMG advertisement it fails; there is not enough depth, thought, or original thinking to interest anyone in retaining them to help \\"transform\\" their business. In the pantheon of business books it ranks near the bottom - stick with some of the classics, or better yet - read HBR, Wired, Upside, or Red Herring for a better picture of digital trends and their impact on business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic reading emphasizing concepts much less alive today....","review":"This is a good book to get a quick study on some basic e-business, however, it is dated and does certainly not intent to spark any ideas.If you desire to read stuff more profound and more connected to real business, pick something else, for example, 'Seven Steps to Nirvana' from Mohan Sahwney from Kellogg School of Management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring Words from a Master Showman","review":"Patel, one of the most notorious used-car salesmen in the Big Five consulting world, has most assuredly reserved his place in the clueless hall of fame with this book. Rather than focusing on those who make or break eBusiness initiatives, the dreaded \\"Customers\\", Patel chooses to buy into the nonsense that large organizations should rebuild themselves around their technology.Of course, this is the same line the Big 5 have been handing their clients for years, first with ERP, then CRM, and now \\"eBusiness\\". Can you think of the last time a Big 5 firm actually \\"transformed\\" a Fortune 500 company? I can't.Readers who are looking for inspiration to break themselves out of the \\"old economy\\" mindset of corporate heirarchy and politics, as well as technology for technology's sake, are best served elsewhere. I suggest The Cluetrain Manifesto by Christopher Locke et al. It's a better read and sure as hell more likely to get you to embrace the New Economy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left with Nothing","review":"Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book nor did I find any useful information in it. The book was short and did not drill down in any area of e-business that would give the reader a sense that something useful was learned. If the book costed 4.99 I might recommend it as leisure reading. I certainly expected much more than I left with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and misses the mark","review":"This book is shallow and short. I read it in less than 2 hours. The type is double-spaced and the book is full of blank pages. This is how it gets to 125 pages.It does not even scratch the surface of e-business and discusses concepts at the level of someone who has never read an ounce about business. I found it unchallenging and uninformative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and thorough","review":"\\"Final Fantasy XII\\" was the last Squaresoft-developed Final Fantasy before the Square-Enix merger, and it's known to be a very large game with a very detailed world. In the game there exists a powerful weapon that can only be acquired through a particularly picky method; players don't normally even know of its existence, let alone the long and convoluted method to get it, without a guide like this!Also, being the \\"limited collector's edition,\\" there's a slew of extra production art pieces and all the stuff a BradyGames-published official strategy guide is known to have. If you choose to purchase an official strategy guide for FF12, make it this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpful guide wrapped in a wonderfully artworked package!","review":"This guide was excellent for my tastes in gaming! While the gambit system was not adequately explained (and I was a beginner when it came to gambits!) I thought that this book had quite the right balance between throughness of walkthrough and lack of spoilers.Moreover, the extra mission/sidequest session was spot on! I've had some trouble tracking down a few of the hunt monsters (I don't think all of the probabilities of occurance are correct), but I've saved great headaches by having the guide by my side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted!","review":"The scale is everything the manufacturer claims. However, with minimal use by one average sized adult, our scale lasted only about nine months. The balance part of the scale is very sound, but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components. I suspect that poor Q&A; will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere. Today, my scale will not function unless I hold the batteries by hand (not too practical when someone is standing on it...).Conclusions:* Scale design is nice--looks good.* Construction of balance components is solid, glass is very strong. Design and construction of the power unit (battery) is rather poor.* Scale functions as advertised for a normal sized (80kg/175lb) adult ... until the battery power clip dies.* Buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This scale blows.","review":"It worked quite nicely until after about 9 months the display just stopped working. Changed the batteries to no avail. It's very pretty, but I have a less attractive old Tanita that does body fat measurements which has been working for 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty looking piece of junk","review":"Stopped working after one day! Show scrambled characters on the LCD. This scale was probably made for aliens since its reading is not legible to the human eye. Returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful quality","review":"I bought this scale a year ago. The first unit I got broke within a month, simply stopped working. Amazon replaced it. This one is now broken too, simply stopped working. (Note: It was not a battery issue, I tried replacing them).If that isn't enough to dissuade you, the UI is hopeless, you'll need to refer to the instructions any time you want to do something more than the basic measurements. The accuracy of the non-weight measurements leaves something to be desired as well.Finally, if you're still in love with it because of its looks (as I was), be warned that this scale collects dust, lots of dust. Also, the bottom piece is made of very cheap-looking (and cheap-feeling) plastic.Do not buy it.Sorry about the rant format of my review :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable piece of junk","review":"The first one we got broke within seconds of turning it on - the display just showed some abstract segments of the LCD. The second one seemed to work but could not be changed from reading in kilos - yes we removed the battery as per the instructions. These scales claim German engineering but they are in fact made in China and are really cheaply made - don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine stopped working properly","review":"I got the machine for my fat, muscle and water analysis as well as my weight. After 1 month of use it only shows the weight. The scale no longer works properly. It no longer shows anything else but the weight. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Scale for the Money","review":"The scale seems to be working OK. I like the .2 pound resolution. You can usually see a weight gain or loss from day to day, unlike my other scale that read only in whole pounds. The fat, water and mussel is a nice extra and usually reads very closely from day to day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot can happen between Monday and Wednesday ...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Zoe's woes don't just happen on Wednesday, the drama touches every day of the week. Especially since Zoe is catching it from all angles--current man with baby's mama drama; ex-man who still wants to be the next man; family members who can get on the first and last nerve. What's a women to do? Pick up and run away from home? Hey, that is a thought. But Zoe toughs it out and what she does should surprise everyone. Being born on Wednesday does have its advantages. Hats off to Gayle Jackson Sloan. You'll also enjoy Saturday's child.

Most of the time the three gals and two guys seem to be singing at the top of their (New York) voices but still sound tinny and too far back in the mix. Anyway, the music's great, the fantastic arrangements of standards (such as Caravan and the a bit overlong Round Midnight) as well as the intriguing original material (National Amnesia, Dare The Moon, Street Party). Hard to believe their later albums would get even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pair of monitors!","review":"I ordered these monitors in Sept. 2005.

After some wrangling with Customer Service (I had to fax a copy of their ad to them) they said that Music 123 \\"does not sell pairs of Event speakers, only single speakers\\" and that the advertised list price and savings were in error.

It was one of the few books that I've read and actually thought about years later. Maybe that book was so good I was expecting \\"Seeing\\" to be a continuation of it, but it wasn't. My advice to readers is if you enjoyed \\"Blindness\\", let the story end there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very realistic!!","review":"This novel's plot seems surreal at first, but becomes more an more realistic the more one turns the pages. The characters' absurd crime, which is that of casting blank ballots on election day, is intensified and seen as horrific deeds by the persons in power. The political satire is at first funny but the tone darkens and the tension rises gradually.I myself preferred the book \\"Blindness\\" for the descriptions and the characters' interrelations and mostly for the journey from darkness into light.This book however is an important study, but has a more pessimistic approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"More About Blindness","review":"For those who have read Blindness, this book is less a sequel than a haunting extension of the concept of human blindness, all the more provocative since the literal blindness is over. This time, it is not the populace, but the government which tries to keep its citizens blind, but the government itself is blind.The first half of this novel is grueling, nerve-wracking as it focuses on machiavellian politics, the second half more personal and fluid as we follow one police superintendent who encounters some characters who should be quite familiar to those who have read Blindness, which I would suggest doing before reading this book.Discomforting, maddening, and tragic, this book may ramble at times, but it begins to become strangely coherent and thoughtful in its latter half."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"This is the first book I read by Jose Saramago. I read it in English. Absent a disastrous translation, it has been a total disappointment so far. I have read 236 pages (out of 306 pages the book has) and it has failed to capture my interest. I have kept reading just in case something interesting happens. But nothing so far. The book lacks the virtuosity and the imagination you would expect from a Nobel Prize winner. The book is about the plot 95% of the time. The psychology of the main characters is practically absent. There are no personal conflicts worth mentioning. This is a very shallow book. After I finish reading this book, I will give Saramago another try. But after reading \\"Seeing\\" I will less forgiving with a second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish the book","review":"I guess I was looking for a sequel to Blindness and this book is defintely not a sequel to Blindness.

Don't worry he has more for you \\"Wack M.C.'s\\" on this simple lyric filled tune. The Domino produced title track is a jazz fueled song again where Del shows versitility. He even gets on the subject about women on \\"Boo Boo Heads\\". Three members of Hieroglyphics are featured on the uptempo \\"No More Worries\\". \\"In And Out\\", a highlight for this album is simple yet effective to be a pleasure.

Many non-seen before photos and exceptional color profiles.The information that presented in the book is the Israeli look on the Phantom air-to-air combat results. It is not a traditional ace by ace coverage, but more chronological victory by victory account, grouped by squadrons.There is also a very, very brief biography of ace pilots (not the navigators).The problem is - the Osprey book format (96pp), there is so much information, photos and details to be covered, that 96 pages are simply not enough. To compensate this, the photos are shrunk and the text is very compact. I could wish more exceptional photos to be included, as I've seen some in different sources.Bottom line, I will suggest this book to every aviation enthusiast, who deals with Middle East aviation warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"ive seen military reports more interesting","review":"i got this being interested in the combat history of the phantom and its abilities against soviet fighters,also in wishing to read about how it faired against them when they did not have crippling ROE working against them like in vietnam.I was very very board reading it as its hole text just one sleep inducing jumble of numbers.The decsriptions of the air fights is very brief and usually is SUCH AND SUCH GOT THEIR 3RD MIG KILL ETC ETC.The pictures are good and the plates are acceptable but thats not good enough if the bulk of the text is boring,hence the one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Inspiration.","review":"This DVD is a must have for any MMA fan or anyone who just likes inspirational stories. Jens' story is one of the best examples of coming from nothing and making it to the top. He gives access to this film crew that no other athlete would dare. He wears his feelings on his sleeve and puts them on screen for the world to see. And the best part about this is that most of us will relate to his story in some way. He's a legend, and having the pleasure of actually meeting Jens once and interacting with him a couple of times on FB, it's very obvious that this documentary is accurate. It's very well done, very emotional, and just plain real. Rent it for sure. But buying it will save you some money because you'll definitely want to watch it more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Club Babylon","review":"Slightly dissappointed with this soundtrack.

Now these mixes are different from what you may have heard in the show, and yes songs are mixed as a continuous DJ set with no breaks between songs - just like a club, and hence the title CLUB BABYLON. It's what I expected, and reminds me of the second season's soundtrack format. All that being said, it's a good collection of strong dance songs from all the seasons. The mixes are solid, they all flow nicely, and there are no instrumental tracks... so it's very dramatic and oriented around vocals. Definitely worth it if you're a fan of club music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Club Babylon","review":"Great CD if you like the series on Showtime (that is not on anymore) it's has great music that reminds you of being there in the club... highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the full story without Hollywood","review":"Saw the movie about the first book and now I definitely want to read the first book after reading this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cancel your appointments . . .","review":"Only seven reviews so far and three or four people say they couldn't put it down.I couldn't put it down either.

It's a behind the scenes look at the making of those two superb records, and charts the recording of the albums, the response from fans and critics [includes some great footage of Tower Records in LA the night they opened at 12 midnight to sell them on the first day of release - I didn't spot myself though], the tour that followed and the aftermath - best of all is the music and footage of the band playing and recording the albums.

McIntosh's book is well documented and detailed related to the four generations currently overlapping in the United States. While written for the church environment, if one reads it from a leadership perspective, there is much to gain in terms of developing programming, advertising, and considering what drives the experiences of each generation. The book is just a little dated in material, but overall is well written and helpful for those wanting to understand the complexity of cross generational work."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I love this CD!

Wenham clashes with modern theories about the bible, mostly by exploring early texts and studying verbal independence among the synoptic gospels. His arguments are impressive. In particular, he insists that the synoptics were all written before 70 AD. He points out, for example, that Luke tells us of the fullfilment of Agabus' prophecy of worldwide fame (Acts 11:28). Yet Luke fails to mention the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple, which so clearly fullfilled Jesus' prophecy about the temple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wattles & Health","review":"Wallace D.

Unfortunately, the Eroica Trio seems to think beautiful sound and smooth textures are suited to the style. Unfortunately, they are wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another brilliantly unreadable masterpiece.","review":"Imagine combining 1960s DJ speak with scat beatnik riffs and then introduce internet short-hands, initialisms, and misspellings. It would be one thing for the occasional scrap of dialog or clue, but the entire book, from start to finish, is exactly that. I have no idea what the plot is, what the action is, or what the character are, because I cannot read this mess of gibberish. It might be brilliant, if you took the time to completely translate the entire book into English. Too bad the author didn't bother to do so. Or at least provide a partial translation.If that sort of intellectual flagellation is your idea of a good time, then by all means, proceed. There are far, far, far better books to read, and far better things to do with my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent recording. I would recommend this to ALL who want to develop appreciation for baroque classic music as well as those who already enjoy this genre. Cannabich lived from 1731 to 1798.

My wife has complained about it since day one because while it looks nice, it dispenses very small amounts of soap with each pump (so you have to pump it several times to get enough soap to wash your hands).I wasn't too worried about that myself. However, the straw-that-broke-the-camel's back for me was the rust that was showing up around the bottom edge of the dispenser *AND* on my counter. Not only was it rusting, but it actually rusted *through* and was leaking soap (albeit slowly at this point). Clearly this was *not* designed to be in wet areas (and where else would one put a soap dispenser???).All-in-all a crappy product.I strongly recommend against buying one as you'll end up replacing it in a year or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a family that has adopted","review":"I realize this is a spin off the classic The Ugly Duckling but I would think in this day and age it would be played up to respect and recognize that not all family members look alike now. Interracial marriages/families and those families that adopt a child of a different race may want to avoid this book.The little airplane realizes he doesn't look like his truckling siblings as they peer at him and taunt him for not fitting in or looking like them. He ventures out and meets others asking if he is one of them and still doesn't fit in until he sees more airplanes. Then he feels he has met his family and where he belongs. This book could create confusion and feelings of not belonging to any child that does not look like his/her parents or siblings.That said, I loved the illustration in this book. Kudos for that but none for the author for not modernizing this story to recognize diversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completed the set","review":"This is the third hard cover book of David Gordon's that we have.

Brother Sun Sister Moon; perhaps a bit more historically accurate though.Worth the look.Not much more to say except the program is asking for more words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Movie","review":"I thought this movie was great. Perhaps though I am a little partial to the saint. I loved the part played by Francis' former friend who becomes his foe, only to be reconciled before Francis' death. If you like old movies or if you are a fan of the saint then I can recommend this movie. My wife wasn't too keen on it though, so I suppose it isn't for everyone. It is in black and white and it does have that certain 50's drama like it was done for the stage only filmed. This was an era where movies were still transitioning and evolving from live theatre, so you must give the film some leeway for that.But I loved it and can recommend it to all. Francis is someone for us all to imitate. As St. Paul said \\"Imitate me as I imitate Christ.\\" This is the purpose of the saints: to give us an example of Christ-likeness that we may follow in His footsteps, just as they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden Francis","review":"Earnest, yet so-so rendering bio reinactment, 'Francis of Assisi' doesn't give the troubadour saint the spark he deserves. The film is a product of its times, giving the movie a lot of ceremony, but not much substance. While actor Bradford Dillman musters enough passion at the end and in other, select scenes, he seems like a better fit for a fifties' TV series. The pomp and circumstance aims for the pre-Vatican II pew, and the subplot, a rivalry between Francis and Bernardo over Claire's love, is an accomodation for a general audience clueless about celebacy. Nevertheless, 'Francis...,' mostly accurate and reverent--despite its many flaws--invites a traditional audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a well made or accurate movie","review":"If you are an orthodox Catholic or any Catholic for that matter, this is not the right movie for you. First of all, there are many better classical movies about saints out there, such as \\"The Reluctant Saint,\\" \\"Quo Vadis,\\" \\"Marcelino,\\" and several others. This movie is not a good movie in general. The word that comes to mind is flaky. It is very inaccurate, it shows a Saint Francis who was willing to defy the Pope if his rule was not approved (which is completely false for a humble saint such as St. Francis). It shows Christian Crusaders butchering Muslims and Muslims that treat St. Francis with great kindness. It shows St. Francis as a priest, which he wasn't (because of his humility St. Francis refused ordination to the priesthood, remaining a deacon all his life). And this is just some of the blatant errors the movie makes. A poorly made movie not worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE!","review":"all the reviews on this wonderful TV movie are accurate and very detailed. just want to add my two cents on how wonderful the entire cast is in this gem. Valerie Bertinelli just shines as the tormented sister who feels guilt for not knowing/seeing the abuse of her murdered sister. Christopher Meloni is so good as her supportive, loving spouse. it's nice to be reminded what a good actor he was before he began playing the bullying, smug, jerk that's he's perfected into a career now. the movie is sad, moving, terrifying in it's reality, and stays in one's memory for a long time. but what really makes it stick is the wonderful acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"People watch this junk?!?!","review":"Sorry, but this show is just plain trash. It has nothing of value. I can't believe people watch junk like this. This is a great example of why they show nothing but junk on TV today. It's bad enough people watch this, but to fork over their hard-earned cash for it, don't get me started. In this economy, I wish I can afford to throw away money like fans of this show do. Please do yourself a favor, buy a quality show on DVD instead of this trash. Some quality shows include: I Love Lucy, Happy Days, I Dream of Jeannie, The Brady Bunch, The Twilight Zone, etc. Buy those, not trash like The Girls Next Door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escapist entertainment.","review":"This was one of my favorite television series of all time. (With the original girls, the twins and Crystal were horrible!) I like to pop in the DVDs when I feel like ignoring the demands of real life and escaping to a silly, frivolous lifestyle, at least on the surface. Rumor has it there's a much darker side to the story, but that is not what I'm watching it for.I enjoy the personalities of the girls, but I wish they included a little more of the staff.

Masterful song writers who manage to put southern rock into a melange of post punk/garage rock. Not as furiously fun as the first record but shows a depth that promises a long career of greatness. Slower numbers tend to meander, throwing the pace of the record slightly off course. But given two firne records now, there is true hope for American rock and a band that deserves to be placed alongside the Wt Stripes for bluesy greatness. Of course their much bigger in Britain than back home, making a truely sad statement on the state of American music and youth culture.

All you can do is store Windows Media Player files that are heavily crippled by digital rights management.I'm extremely disappointed by Sony's decision to succumb to the entreaties of a greasy and conscience-free music industry at the expense of its actual customers' listening experience, and will be sure to avoid buying any CDs they sell from now on.Sorry, Kings of Leon--I'm sure this is a spectacular album, but your label screwed us both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of this world","review":"\\"Aha, Shake Heartbreak' is easily the best release of 2005.

If you both expect and want to hear Cold Play-esque tunes (i.e. easy, unoriginal, redundant, unexceptional music), don't buy it this album.When new bands come out, people say they sound like The Beatles, Dylan, The Velvet Underground, Zepplin, The Smiths or Pixies (i.e. bands with distinct, ground-breaking sound). Pretty soon they'll be saying that bands sound like The Kings.Yes, The Kings of Leon are that talented. Yes, this is coming from a music elitest. No, I don't live for The Shins.If you see them live, you won't be sorry. They're rad, rad, rad.And lastly, if you love this album, buy the first.

Apart from that, this is THE best Kings of Leon album. There is not a single track on this record that you want to skip over, the very simple yet extremely catchy riffs of this album will definitely leave an imprint on your musical listening. This was Kings of Leon at their peak, and to say that Only by The Night is better, is a fallacy.

The singer sounds like mypuppy when he got sick after ingesting Drano.I've read where this band is considered southern rock. Thesouth that I'm thinking of is Tierra Del Fuego, which is about as low as you can go. It's horribly embarrassing that theseclowns are supposed to open for U-2.

Gone is the passion, the anger, the madness, the enchanting riffs & the intensity. By the voice you can tell it's the same band, but this follow-up is slow, dull, tuneless and devoid of creativity. 'Youth & Young Manhood' was unique. 'Aha Shake Heartbreak' could be anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Mental Magic","review":"Buy this album! All the songs are good with a few exceptions. Taper Jean Girl, Soft, Velvet Snow, The Bucket and King Of The Rodeo are not good; they are exceptional!!!!!!! I love this album soooooo much, and now I'm used to it, (you will need to listen to it quite a bit before you really get in to it) I just cant stop listening to it. Its totally origional and a breath of fresh air to see that there are still great bands out there who are capable of breaking the mould. Pure Magic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good...","review":"...in my opinion, as their debut, but they certainly avoid the sophomore slump. Aha Shake Heartbreak is a strong album that is almost split into three parts. The first 4 tracks rock and are as good or better than the first album stuff. The album really slows down in the middle for some ballad-ish stuff, and then picks up at the end with Four Kicks and Velvet Snow before sliding off gracefully with Rememo. While all of the songs are good and strong, the middle is too much of a slow down for me...I would have liked to have heard those tracks interspersed with the more upbeat stuff. That being said, my favorite songs are Four Kicks, Slow Night So Long, Milk, Soft, and Taper Jean Girl. One thing I've seen mentioned a bunch is the singer's voice. You're either going to like it or you're going to HATE it....but at least give it a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Revival of Southern Rock","review":"This is simply good southern rock and roll. This album is not over produced slick willy formula rock like what you hear on the radio. The members of the band are very young and are still learning but have great potential for greatness. There sound is definatly a throwback but it's also all their own. The songs are a little short but overall the album is great. Its a great to listen to driving down the road when your needing something to sing.These guys also do a great live show. Lots of energy, lots of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you think the copy-protection is bad, wait till you hear the music","review":"\\"Four Kicks\\" is one of those singles that comes out and makes you think the rest of the band's tunes are just as awesome, yet in reality they have a completely different style. The band's all soft and the lyrics are pretty sleazy and bad. I usually can find goodness in soft tracks but Kings of Leon aren't any good at making'em. Kings of Leon are more like the Jesters of Leon for me. Don't buy the CD, but if you must then be aware that just a press on shift will make the copy-protection lift (that was a poem)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely a joke","review":"To think for an instant these banshees deserve any \\"praise\\" at all is a joke.

I wonder how old some of these people are reveiwing these cd's?

The sound of this album is completely unequaled when compared to most other current recordings.That being said, the DRM appears to be far worse then everyone here is claiming. There is evidence that Sony is employing rootkit techniques to install hidden files on your PC that cannot be removed.

The materials were cheap and the neoprene ended up fraying very quickly. The velcro ended up ripping off. Stay away from the Valeo! It seems like the quality has gone down since it was first introduced to Amazon in 2005I bought the McDavid Waist Trimmer (Item model number: 491R)over a month ago and love it! I am impressed with the quality of the materials and the velcro. The McDavid fits very well. It offers the support I was looking for and neoprene for heat retention.

After using it for a few weeks now I have come to the following conclusions:1- It gets you internal temperature up a lot quicker. Since you are wrapping yourself in neoprene and then working out don't be surprised if you feel really hot quicker then usual.2- Taking it off is slightly gross, after a hard 30 minute cardio workout, I was dripping in sweat, then when I took off the belt it was completely soaked.3- I'm burning more calories and my water weight burns off faster too.4- I like the fact it's washable and doesn't shrink (and you just hang dry it)5- Putting it on can take a few adjustments only because it's stays on with the help of velcro.Don't expect overnight results, my whole goal is to just burn more calories. I was surprised that it actually provides pretty good back support (especially when doing crunches). I recommend it, and for the price you don't have much to lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"material is cheap","review":"Pro: thin, almost invisible when wearing t-shirt over it.Con:1 The material is very cheap, I was just separating the Velcro and got a tear on the belt.2 The Velcro width is same as belt width.

While using it with exercise (and sensible diet) will help improve your outcome as it does help you sweat more but exercise is not necessary if you just want a slimmer waist Why? The neoprene waist trimmer works on the concept of training you to suck in your gutt. Wear the neoprene waist trimmer for just a few hours and you will notice immediate results. The longer you wear it (it takes 21 days to form a habit), the easier it will become to suck in that gutt giving you the look of a slimmer waist. I do not recommend wearing this 24/7 or while you sleep (give your body a chance to adjust to sucking it in by itself)and each day you put it on that you try and pull it just a little tighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I bought it not too long ago and after 2 uses it ripped??

The one slight problem with it is that you're required to brush your teeth for an extended period of time. Then, you're not to rinse for another period of time. This is a problem if you're accustomed to brushing right before bed, and falling asleep before the required time has elapsed.

Despite these obvious errors , the book is funny. the conversations between Lando and the awseome Vuff-Raa are hysterical. and the plot is,nt that bad , just goofy and too unbelivable ( a race of starship biengs that can destroy Imperial Warships in just one shot?).

Without a doubt, these three stories are the worst. The author, Lester Neil Smith III (I was shocked to learn that he has written other novels...) uses jargin that no charactor in the Star Wars films would EVER use, Lando is completely out of charactor. He constantly uses insults, as an aparent running gag, about Lando's strange robot friend. His charactors are boring, and not very creative. One charactor IS \\"Big Bird\\" from Sesame Street. Another looks just like a manta ray... I mean, come on, Smith has no imagination. At the begining of every story, Lando is a is a down on his luck and broke, and at the end his a millionaire. I was so happy when I finished the book, and believe me, that was no easy task.Bottom line is, if you're a collector like me and just have to have all the novels, then it's a must.

I'm giving this 1 star because Amazon doesn't allow 0 stars. Unless you are like me and have to read all the books in the Star Wars series, please save yourself the terrible agony and skip these.The stories are descent, it is the writing that is so darn bad. It is full of cliches and trite expressions, terribly lame attempts at humor that were dumb the first time you heard them, but then the same dumb joke are repeated countless times.

I remember thinking I had just read the names of a list of items in the cargo hold in the last book I had just read--sure enough, L. Neil Smith plagiarized straight from _The Witches of Karres_.While the plagiarism rankled a bit, I continued to work my way through them. The books are the most boring and ill-conceived I've read. Save yourself the time and read Eddings, Lackey, Moon, or McCaffrey--or even Schmitz' _The Witches of Karres_. All write much better than this plagiarizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"These stories were a refreshing change from the more \\"heavy\\" star wars books, and makes for a nice break from the endless arrays of \\"Greatest Threats Ever\\" or giant Superweapons that plagued the Jedi Academy Trilogy, Corellian and Darksaber books. The Calrissian trilogy also has more in common with traditional sci fi than most Star Wars stories. The characterizations of Lando and his robot sidekick, Vuffi Raa, are spot on, even if the main villain, Rokur Gepta is totally generic. The story is pretty light throughout, it is always interesting and full of unexpected twists and turns. The droid, Vuffi Raa, is a classic robot, and has the same appeal as C3-PO and R2-D2. And if many of the details in the book seem wrong, or undefined, just remember that it was written in 1982-1983 when only two films and maybe five books of Star Wars were around. This series is far better than the 1978 Han Solo Adventures. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwhelming","review":"I've always felt Lando Calrissian never got enough attention in the Star War Expanded Universe. I read this book a while ago and just picked it up to reread it. While not all Star Wars books meet my expectations as an adult, I've found a fair amount of them do. Of the bad ones, this one was one of the worst. Lando is utterly unrecognizable as the debonaire man we knew from Empire Strikes Back. He just wanders around on silly adventures that failed to keep my interest. The side characters are even worse, from a \\"sorcerer\\" as the main villain to a starfish droid sidekick. Sorcerers, really?The one saving grace is that these books introduced Sabaac, the poker of the Star Wars EU. Seeing Lando play the card table was worth a reread. Lando is a natural as a con artist, not as an adventurer That's why I gave the book 2 stars instead of just 1. If for nothing else, we can thank the Lando Adventures and L. Neil Smith for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit dated","review":"I thought that overall this was a good book. The stories took a little while to get moving but once they did it was fun to read.

First and foremost the author describes Lando Calrissian with great detail. You get a wide eyed glimpse into the card player, scoundrel with a flair for the finer things in the galaxy. The author explains how Lando comes across the Millineum Falcon. A great deal of effort is spent into describing the other characters of this nuanced novel. There are three books in one. Without giving to much info, please keep in mind that this book came out in the early eighties! So the \\"Star Wars Terminology\\" is not abundantly present here.

The plots were generally bad, the writing was slow, tedious, and missed the point of Lando. I disliked Vuffi Raa because the thought of the all powerful alien droid decided to team up with a smuggler (or allow himself to be won in a sabbac game like property) is ridiculous. The stories took too long to set up and get into, the threatening aspect was never really there, and what was up with the Imperial master mind?

It did not fit.I went to a local auto parts store (not one of the franchised ones) and the filter they had, while a different brand, looked exactly like the photo shown here and fit perfectly.While Amazon took good care of me when I asked for a return voucher, something is wrong between Fram and its Chinese manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong filter","review":"I clicked to make sure this was the correct cabin filter for my car it was not.

She runs a way to a cattle ranch as a cook and the owner who of course is handome falls in love with her and she resists because there's no way he can love her. Sound familiar?

I did object to paying as much again for the postage to arrive in Australia. Sorry but not worth the cost, especially as it was not shown any where until the order was complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Me Cry!!!","review":"I read this book when I was younger and was so intrigued by it, I made sure to read it every day until I could finish it. The book is highly emotional and it is not for those who are weak of heart. It WILL more than likely make you cry. It is not for those who wish for happy endings, but more of the realistic endings instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Wow this is a good read I did it in one setting. A young girl gets involved in drugs and her life spirals out of control. It is her diary and parts can move you to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"misunderstood and unreal","review":"I'm honestly not a harsh critic but this book couldve been so much moredescriptive and powerful . It delivered a \\"short story\\" feel that you readbreifly. I bought this thinking it would be a memoir, the back of the bookwas very weak and created a fake image of the author. To feel for thewriting , you shouldn't have to become a heroin addict. Its like sayingsteriods enable athletes to be great, when really youre not an athlete ifsteriods make you win. Just as the author shouldnt have forced a habbitfor a character to be born."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not So Beautiful After All","review":"Beauty Queen, by Linda Glovach, is an intense story about a teenage girl who gets introduced to heroin by a co-worker. Sam has a problem and believes that taking shot of heroin will help her get by her problem. Her friends find out and beg her to stop, but it's all a little too late. Sam's addicted and she doesn't seem to realize it. The details that Glovach uses put an excellent picture in your mind as you read along. You will soon realize that the \\"beauty queen\\" is not so beautiful after all. As I read more of the story I found that it was hard for me to put down the book. I enjoyed the book very much. I would recommend it to any one who enjoys reading novels that have to do with teens and what they go through on an every day basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Made My Cry","review":"This book made me cry it showed a lot of emotions and I read it in less then a day! Its a great book and will teach someone a lot if you have the same type of problems as she did! I recommend it to any teenager going through problems and want to learn a life lesson.. It wasn't one of my favoirte books, but it was well written and very real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very daring and good.","review":"Even though this book was a bit of a daring thing, I thought it was very good. It shows you what can happen to you when you are addicted to heroin, and what your life becomes. Sam is a character that you love because she has a problem with self-esteem and needs help with it, even if that help is herion. You just want her to feel better and get back to the way she used to be, nice and not in any real trouble or sadness. The topless dancer part goes right in with the herion, and the whole book just fits in together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and toothless","review":"It'd be perfect for an after school special or a life time original movie. It hits every cliché that I could imagine. I was surprised to see her hit all of them in one pretty short novel-way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of the book","review":"I was very disappointed in this book after seeing the graphic cover shot and the enticing storyline. This girl gurgled down the tubes in THREE months - going from a complete innocent working as a waitress to a mobster's moll, smack shooting, bony-hipped, strutting stripper to an angst filled death. Uh....I *don't* think so!!! If the author was a heroin addict as she says, then she should certainly know better than to publish this dramatic skimpy piece of trash. Puh-leeze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony baloney","review":"Linda Glovach was a \\"co-forger\\" of Go Ask Alice, a \\"teen diary\\" which was neither written by a teen nor was it any kind of diary a teen would write. The moralizing in the story is obvious, screaming \\"watch out, this can happen to you!\\" But it does no service to anyone when the stories are so obviously fake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty Queen?","review":"This book is excellent, this is coming from a person that doesn't really like to read books. Sam, the main character, is very believable, at first I thought it was a true story. The way it's written makes it even more interesting; it's written in a journal format. It's as if she was talking to you personally, and it's easier to read that way to. I definitely recommend this book. This is perfect for people who need to learn about drugs, specifically heroin, because it shows some of the dangers of heroin use, which can be very informative. If you want to read a great, entertaining book read Beauty Queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Days to Desperation?","review":"Samantha is supposed to be nineteen-years-old, but Glovach gives her the voice of a fourteen-year-old. She has lived a rough life with her alcoholic mother and the mother's creepy verging on pervy boyfriend. No way would this woman be so immature and naive at the age of nineteen.The other thing is that there is only about three days time between Samantha's first experience with stripping and heroin before she is profoundly addicted to the drug, and inexplicably now a seasoned professional stripper. And again only a few more days until her whole new life of mobsters, obsession with a dirty cop and general desperation.The most unpredictable thing about this book is that nothing unpredictable happens. You keep waiting. The mobster and the dirty cop inspire a little fear, but ultimately fall flat. I finished this book only out of a morbid curiosity to see how bad and ridiculous it would get. If you look at it that way you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dopey","review":"NOTHING in this slim book rings true. The main character is like something from Melrose Place. She is supposed to be 19 years old, but writes/talks like a 12 year old Valley Girl. Very silly and a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUved it","review":"i really enjoyed reading this book. sum parts where a little scary to me because sometimes. but overall it was was really good. one of those books u can't wait to see wat happens next or even fears wat happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"book is sooooo disturbing its good","review":"omg! my name is samantha (like the character in the book) and my best friend's name is Nicole...(like the best friend in the book.) anyway, i think that if Samantha had a lot more people who DIDN'T do drug around her maybe things would of been different. i kinda feel sorry for her because no one really loved her the way she wanted to be loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"beauty queen","review":"i havent read a book since i was in school. i read this book and i felt like i was sam. i went thru everything that she had went thru. this book gave me so much inspiration on not to do heroin anymore, it's just so hard when the high is so great. i loved this book and recommend EVERYONE to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So sad!!!","review":"What a terribly sad tale of the downfall of such a beautiful young girl!The story demonstrates how parents' behavior can affect children. Maybe if Sam's mother had gone into therapy herself, the book would have had a different outcome.Throughout the book, you can see Sam's demise and eventual downfall but you want to hope that one of her friends gets through to her.The author, who obviously knows firsthand, shows all of the dangers that await young women and how they can be taken advantage of by others just by playing their emotions.A great cautionary tale for all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not beautiful.","review":"This book has a strong premise, but the story falters.You'd think an author who had been through heroin addiction would be able to write a more believable, gripping narrative, but that is not the case with Beauty Queen. Sam's journal entries peg her as naive and idealistic, and even in the throes of addiction, she remains unrealistically optimistic. You feel bad for her; not only for her situation, but for the fact that she remains so incredibly oblivious up until the end.This book is akin to Go Ask Alice, minus the introspection. It's a sugarcoated look at the world of heroin, probably most suited for younger, less discerning readers. It lacks the profane truth that i feel is nessacary for a story of this sort to really hit you... If you want a \\"nicer\\", more vague account, Beauty Queen is for you. It's worth reading once, but I'd recommend borrowing it from the library or buying it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"The back of the novel said that the author bought $1,500 worth of heroin, and started to shoot up 10 times a day.I guess her attempts to \\"feel\\" the story didn't work, because this is the worse book about Heroin I've ever read. It was so unrealistic I couldn't believe it. I've met 5 year olds less nieve than the main character. This book was terrible, and I regret wasting my time to read it.I guess I should have listened to what some of the reviews said, I thought people were exagerating when they said the book stunk.They weren't lying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, ill-fitted, and cheap","review":"I previously reviewed these sheets shortly after I received them. Now I have all sorts of new things to say about them. I got them in early March (or late February) 2008. It is now June 2008. These sheets feel cheap, they are not soft, they hardly fit my 21-inch mattrest, and were insanely expensive. They pill!! They feel like carpet, now. I bought a Wamsutta set at Bed Bath and Beyond for $95 (admittedly, they were on sale) and they are TWICE as good as than this set. Don't waste your money, time, or shipping dollars on these incredibly cheap and rough sheets. (Did I mention that I almost gave myself a concussion getting the fitted sheet around the mattress? And it STILL didn't fit all the way down to the bottom and tuck underneath.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I was overly pleased with these sheets! They actually fit my california King! I have a memory foam mattress and have had the worst time finding sheets with deep enough pockets to actually STAY ON the bed.

Aside from oozing Silicone and raw sexual energy, her prose crackles like cottage cheese on an open flame at a Saturnalia celebration. Pamela Anderson has definitely proved herself to be a giant in the eyes of the writing community, she certainly has topped herself. If Atlas Shrugged, then Pamela picked it up! From Bay Watch to New York Times Bestseller List, damn it Pam, you did it! You got me to read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Though this book dishes some dirt, it was poorly written. Just a vapid look at Pam's life. I had a hard time finishing it. I don't think I'll read the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah blah blah","review":"I wasn't too impressed with this book. So she can tell someone to write a story, there's more to Pam then this b.s. I was disappointed with this book. I was hoping it would be more. I guess from all the hype I should have known it was a dud. Come one Pam, you can do better then a junior high quality story."},{"rating":"1","title":"So can any guess who's who?","review":"So this book was okay a little slow at first but it seemed really short towards the end because she squeezes so much into 250 pages. This book wasn't really that great, I guess the only thing that really kept me interested was the who's who of celebrities she was using, I kinda guessed everyone else but who were Peter and Van supposed to be? O and the baseball player and surfer? or were they made up???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more depth . . .","review":"This story has potential, but I feel it was poorly written and underdeveloped. It simply lacks depth and reads more like something written on an 8th grade reading level. The last half of the book is filled with mostly Star (the main character) having sex with one character after another. You just never really get underneath the surface of the character and into her mind and how she deals with all the new found fame and fortune. I think it could have been a great story had it just dove deeper into the main character. Hopefully, there will be some improvements in the subsequent novels as I really would enjoy reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most underrated book of the century!","review":"No one takes Pamela seriously, because of the fake boobs and everything, but honestly, this is a classic. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me understand humanity that much better. In a world of superficiality, Pamela is the sole campaigner for a deeper, more contemplative way of life. In the end, when she choses to take the hemlock and die in an honorable way rather than suffer one more plastic surgery operation, I found myself sobbing. Truly, this woman has hit upon a universal seed of truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad","review":"How could such an exciting life make for such a boring book. If you're going to hire a ghost writer, wouldn't you find a good one? I couldn't wait to read this book. Then I couldn't wait to finish it so I could move on to something better. I expected trashy fun, but this was really a disappointment. Mundane, uneven, stupid.... truly a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is as much a bimbo as she is!","review":"The Hollywood dialogue and the quick changing of people without any recognizable descriptions, made it impossible to get into. Hard to imagine a professional 'ghost writer' having anything to do with this, as it sounded too illiterate. I tried hard, several times to get passed the first chapters, and glimpsed through hoping the grammar would improve, along with the storyline, but it became worse.............. I think she pretends not to know much, so that the little girl act supposedly makes men feel protective of her. No adult can be so simple, without being simple. Everyone says it is really her autobiography, but who knows? I do not believe anyone can have such a lack of morals, as this main character............I shall never buy anything Ms Anderson has written again. Boring, hard to understand, all over the place, no decent storyline, uninteresting characters who are impossible to care about, etc etc.,Donni-Jay (author)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really really wanted to like this book!","review":"But, when I finished it, I decided that liking it, even slightly, wasn't really an option.I am giving it two stars for her effort. Writing a book is hard (granted, it's easier when you have a ghostwriter) and for Pam's first book she gave it a valliant try.The book's tempo isn't steady, which makes it rather confusing to read. Events aren't focused on enough, or consequently focused on too much, and this makes it difficult to discern what the important things are.Maybe if she just wrote a tell-all book about the people she's slept with rather than turning it into a poorly-written novel, I would be more entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"As the story started out I was entertained by the book. The further I got in though, the more boring it got. I found the whole thing very repititive. Star meets a producer, automatically gets a part, meets a new guy and sleeps with him, all way something really stupid things that make everyone give her \\"is she for real?\\" looks.The second half of the book is nothing but sex, sex, and more sex, and the writing style isn't even that creative. Her metaphors and descriptions are all cring worthy. Even the sex scenes are repititve.If Pam Anderson really wanted to write an autobiography she just should have written one. It would have been a lot more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Beach Read...","review":"Since my attention span with two young kids at home is next to nothing, the great works of literature are simply not on my reading menu right now! This book was trashy and interesting enough to hold my interest and read quickly. Plus, being a Tommy Lee fan much more than a Pam fan, this book gave a glimpse into the woman he loved so much. Yup, it' a lil cheesy, but those who down it are too stuck up to admit to liking trashy books once in a while. Worth the price and the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"I thought this would be alot more interesting that it was. I was upset I had spent the time that I had on the book, and don't bother looking for a good ending it kind of drifted off into la-la land somewhere, and that's where it ended. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun enough to be called \\"The Worst Book Ever Written\\"","review":"Pam Anderson is such a self-effacing Hollywood commodity that I foolishly expected more from this book...at least some humor or insight into the self-manufactured showbiz machine she has become. Instead, this is a hopelessly dull and pointless waste of time without even a satirical or titillating plotline to make you want to turn the page. It actually IS a book you can put down. It doesn't manage to fall into the category of beach reading, although you might want to throw it in the ocean.Pam deserves better....Her co-writer could have come up with something more Jackie Collins-esque. Was the BAYWATCH babe playing it too safe, trying to straddle the fence between sexpot and respectable author? I think probably so. Too bad for her readers and/or fans. If the subject matter weren't so distasteful, it would suit the pre-teen girl demographic but instead it is just a story adrift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read if you are die-hard Pammy fan!","review":"I'm not afraid to admit that I have been a fan of Pamela Anderson for the last 15 years or so. I'm sure I'm not the only male who is/was mesmerized by Ms. Anderson's \\"charms.\\" I ordered this book since she mentioned it was loosely based on her life. Although I knew most of the facts of her career since she made it big, it was interesting to get them in a more \\"personalized\\" point of view. Some details were not known to me at all (such as the time before the fame) & in some cases one had to \\"read between the lines.\\" This was a fairly easy read, something very light. I was looking for some pulp fiction to read while I was at work. It doesn't require deep concentation or anything. Easy read, with a good writing style, but I still think the book could have been better. If you were expecting some deep philosophical truths, psychological revelations or some innovative literary work, you are most definitely in the wrong section!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book","review":"I really had a fun time reading this book. It's very sexy, racy... it's not meant to be an award winning book. Just something fun and light to read, and I absolutely enjoyed it. I found myself rooting for Star even after she settled in Hollywood heavily involved in all different kinds of men. Nonetheless, I recommend this book to anyway who enjoys a sexy-hollywood/glamorous easy read. Can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't know what to expect","review":"While walking through the bookstore, I made a rather nasty comment about Pamela Anderson writing a book. Two of the stores employees overheard me and assured me that I needed to read it to believe it. They said it was excellent, wonderful, etc. Upon their advice, I bought it. They must have been thinking about another book, because this was horrible. I only give it two stars because she managed to keep me somewhat interested in the plot in order to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK!","review":"Wow! What did all you people expect from her a classic????? I personally thought the book was done very tastefully and funny. It is a fast read and enjoyable. It lets you see a side of her that is not obviously seen very often. I am not a Pamela Anderson fan, I mean I do not dislike her at all, but I never watched any of her shows or movies. But she is an interesting person so I got the book. I thought the book was good. A fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star : a Novel","review":"I loved this book! i thought it was interesting to see what it was like to go from being a normal person to being a celebrity,Any fan of Pam will love this book! I alos loved Star Struck and I can't wait until the next book comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I really like Pam, in every interview I've seen she's funny, witty and surprisingly intelligent. I'm thrilled she uses her celebrity to help various animal causes. When I saw she released a book I was quite excited. After reading it I must say I'm filled with disappointment. Don't read it unless you want almost 300 pages of self appreciation from her. I really did expect more from her, especially since she used a ghost writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a JOKE","review":"If Pam had actually written this herself, I may have given it two stars. BUT to think she hired a \\"ghost writer\\" and STILL managed to release this horrid piece of work(?) is a shame to the book world. I had such high hopes as I think Pam is so adorable, clever and witty...but this was AWFUL. The ending was great because I was done with it, but what a pathetic, un-wrapped-up ending as well. PLEASE do not even think of comming up with a continued part. Stick to cutsie acting and know when to cut your book losses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on What Kind of Girl You Are (Any Guy Will Drool)","review":"I got to the part where Star smokes pot with a friend and the friend procedes to diddle with her private parts. From there, I stood up, walked to the trash can and threw the book away. Even though the little I read was not well written, I wanted to get through it, but I saw where the book was going and knew I didn't want to go there. Whether you like this book will depend on what kind of person you are. If you are open to anything and everything sexually, this will probably be a great read. For the more conservative person, I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, cute and perfect for the summer","review":"I absolutely was surprised to find that Pam Anderson's novel was actually quite good. I had no doubt that it would be \\"fun\\"--how could it not be, just look at the woman--anything she does seems like fun! But, as I started reading the book, I found myself wanting to know what happens next. I had a great time playing with the game of \\"who's who\\" in Hollywood, trying to place the characters in the book with those who are real in the entertainment world (it's obvious that Marsten Mann is Hugh Heffner, for example--initials are duplicate and everyone calls him \\"Mars\\" just like everyone calls the Playboy mogul \\"Heff\\"). In any case, I loved this book and can't wait for the next one, hopefully out for summer next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring, Unentertaining...like a porno with more plot","review":"I thought this would be a fun and interesting book to read and would be entertaining, but it was just a drag. There were a couple of interesting moments and some spicy sex, but between those few moments, I just felt that the book dragged on. There seemed to be big holes in the story that left me unsatisfied, and the ending really sucked. I only liked guessing who the celebrities were that she changed the names of - Like Tommie Toms is actually Marky Mark, and Salty Keller is actually Kelly Slater! That is why I gave it 2 stars. But this book is really cheesy and I liked Pam more BEFORE I read the book. This makes her seem like a bigger TRAMP than I thought she was. Don't waste your money. Plus there were so many grammatical and punctuation errors, It gave me the impression that it was never proofread!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I just arrived home from a book signing for Pamela Anderson's book, STAR, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised not only by the book itself, but by the lady who wrote it. I didn't dive very far into the book, but from what I have read, it's not going to be long until I finish it. It's one of those \\"just can't put it down\\" novels.I found the author (who signed my copy of STAR)to be more beautiful in person, and seemed sweet. I'm glad that not only did I get this book, but that I was able to get it signed by the lovely Pam Anderson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many inconsistencies....","review":"I wonder who edited this book? I really wanted to like it too, but it was all over the place. In the beginning, Star is described as a natural athlete who is super smart, then she is described as not a natural at anything but a really dedicated hard worker, and finally, she is described as someone who didn't work hard enough and wasn't really good at anything. And that's just in the first five chapters! I just can't figure out why nobody else picked up on all of the inconsistencies. (That was just one example!) I know this is fiction, and I have to give Anderson credit for writing a book, but it comes off as unpolished, and I really blame whoever told her that it was ready for print. A little bit more time and it could have been a really entertaining read! Don't waste your time, it's not worth it. And Pam, if you are going to write another book, find a new ghost writer and editor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Help Me","review":"OMG I was so interested in reading this book until I got to the about the 40th page. I couldn't stand anymore HOW stupid Pamela Anderson made this Star turn out to be. This book also jumped all over the place.

Matter of fact it's still sitting on my floor where I threw it 2 weeks ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"who's the sleaze?? The publisher","review":"This book is just living proof of the (...)and sell-out of celebrity today and the major publishing companies, who should be hung for publishing trash like this and calling it works of serious fiction. Hemingway, Faulkner and Orwell amongst others have to be tossing in their grave. As God awful that Star is, it's even more fake (than Pam's breasts) to think she actually had any hand in putting a sentence into this work. I can see her now after a long hard day, firing up the computer and writing and writing, the whole five minutes she probably put into this crap.

After all, the book actually got published and there was some hype about it, but I guess I was completely wrong.

This may not be the worst book I ever read, but it definitely rates right up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to get through it.......","review":"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. I am literally struggling to get through it. The main character is the most naive idiot and the dialogue is unbearable. She doesn't know what the minibar in her hotel is. She actually thinks the people before her must have left all of the contents therefore she'd better not take anything. There is a gay fair happening in Santa Monica and she asks where the rides are. She enters a mans house illuminated by candlelight and she asks him if he forgot to pay his electric bill. C'mon!!!

The idea of Brazil and Australia becoming super powers is interesting, so too the fact that Space exploration has only been motivated due to war and the quest for power.

So much of a hit, that Eno licensed the song all over the place. Regardless, the song is now a classic, and the 7 remixes found here are amazing (some by the great techno band GRID). Full of variety, surprises, and even a Billy Stewart sample, this CD single is worth buying. Not to mention, the bonus non-ablum track I FALL UP, is a true Eno gem (dark, funky, and some of Robert Fripp's most dissonant moments)."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WHAT WAS NEEDED!","review":"Probably the best bartending video I have ever seen!

Perhaps because of the short story approach, I didn't really get a good sense of why these women were friends to begin with and also, not much of a sense of loss when the friendships ended. I did finish the book for my bookclub and it will lead to very good discussion on what is friendship, and our personal experiences of losing friends (or being lost as a friend). Other than that, wouldn't really recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bummer!","review":"I really had very high expectations for this book. I don't think I was able to really relate to many of these stories. I think many of the writers were trying too hard to make very prophetic statements and/or show off their writing abilities instead of keeping to a story and just trying to relate to the audience. Very few stories actually describe the friendship and how that friendship (or the end of it) affected their lives and instead focus on what events they were personally going through (which is definitely important but not the reason for the friendship's demise). After recently losing a very close friend of mine, I felt that maybe this book could help me by providing some comfort with similar experiences but instead the stories had no affect on me whatsoever.

The bubble bath dispensing feature doesn't work unless you are filling the tub all the way up because the bubble bath comes out way too slow. I never fill the tub all the way up with my 18 month old. I would think by the time your kid is old enough to be safe in a full tub of water, you probably don't need a spout cover anymore!The most annoying thing about this cover is the fact that I almost have to pull the spout out of the wall to get the thing off! There is no way to get to the shower diverter on top of the spout without taking the cover off, so this is truly frustrating. I'm thinking of trying theSkip Hop Moby Bath Spout Cover - Sky Blueas it seems like it would do much better with the diverter issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this.....","review":"The duck is cute and yes my kids did not hit their heads on the faucet but it did wedge itself in between the wall and my faucet and caused flooding in two room downstairs.

However, no one mentions how inconvenient this is for a spout that also works for diverting water to a shower head. This has become problematic in that you have to remove the duck each time after use if you intend to use the shower. In the process, it has been both destroying the duck (it won't stay on anymore) and it has pulled the spout out of the wall from constant handling. I would only recommend if you have another method for turning on the shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildew formed under hat","review":"It is cute, but a pain!

The author skips from battles to intrigues to poets inside 3 paragraphs in a staccato fashion. I would recommend \\"The Teaching Company\\" lectures as a far better way to learn about early modern civilizations.

Fortunately (or UNfortunately, depending on your point of view), Brosnan was under consideration at the time for the new James Bond, and NBC in their infinite \\"wisdom\\" brought the series back for a \\"fifth\\" season. In reality, it was only a series of 2 hour made for TV movies, showing Steele and Holt in their \\"married life\\". These movies were laughable and did not do justice to the series.My rating for this is actually 2 1/2 (Amazon does not allow half stars), 3 stars for Season 4, 2 stars for Season 5.

It is a shame they canceled the show as the interplay between all three actors was really working for three seasons. Maybe they will do like they did with another hit series, Man from U.N.C.L.E., and produce a \\"Return of Remington Steel\\" to at least put an proper ending to what could have been aa wonderful 5th season instead of leaving it undone.

It is necessary to know some basic fundamentals of statistical mechanics, thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.As written in title of the book, I did not point out to advanced studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written.","review":"Grad student here. Solid state is the one subject I really didn't know much about so I decided to take an intro class for it that used Kittel. I have not finished it nor will I probably; I checked out some other references from the library but most other authors even use a different outline for the course so I'm forced to look back at Kittel. I am not afraid to tackle a complex subject but my experience so far with this book has been confusion and frustration: the author uses terminology without explaining it, talks about new concepts without any sort of introduction. At many points in the reading you'll find yourself wondering what is going on.My worst experience with a textbook in my entire education. There is a book by Burns that's been tremendously helpful. Ashcroft & Mermin seem adequate as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unsatisfactory","review":"I think the word which best describes the book is either dreadful or possibly horrendous.While there is no doubt Kittel does indeed know his way around the subject it would appear his long academic career has rendered him unable to teach it. The subject itself is not particularly difficult, but even topics with which the reader may be familiar from earlier courses are so poorly explained and used in the book that the reader is often confused and confounded.The book is dreadful. I do not believe I have ever encountered a worse book. As a student in love with math and physics with grades to match this STILL instilled a hatred for anything related to the book and the course.Professors and universities; PLEASE do NOT use this book. It is absolutely horrendous as an introductory book. Students are in university to learn, they are as a rule not intimately familiar with a subject when taking introductory courses. And the only 'introductory' part of this book is it's title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this the standard introductory textbook?","review":"Simply put, a terrible book. Kittel rarely discusses the physics behind any phenomena; he simply writes equations and expects the reader to understand what they mean. The fact that this is the \\"standard\\" intro solid-state physics book is pathetic. Please, if you are creating your own course, do not force students to suffer through this ungainly book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"comprehensive but not well explained","review":"It covers more stuff than the other books I read. But there are too many conclusions without clear explanations. It's not a good book for the newcomers in this field. It's tough to read. It may help you get something new if you've already studied SS. I think Ashcroft&Mermin and Ibach&Luth's books are much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, lack of examples","review":"Well, the negative reviews were correct. My solid state course has, unfortunately, decided to go with the Kittel 'standard' text, 8th edition. This book is difficult to learn from - largely because there is a severe shortage of quality examples and the material is not well explained throughout.If you also are forced to use this text for a course, I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing supplement texts:1. Solid State Theory, Walter A. Harrison (1979) - one of the best2. Elementary Solid State Physics, M. Ali Omar (1999) - also good3. Solid State Physics, Ashcroft/Mermin (1976/2003) - good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you have to!","review":"Please pay attention to the negative reviews, they are accurate.

This book was one of the main reason that I didn't finish the class until three years later and almost gave up on solid state physics.To be more concrete, some of the problems I have with this beast are:1. Kittel has the annoying habit of saying somethings first, and motivating it afterwards. In the beginning, I found myself constantly agitated because I didn't understand a thing he said. Desperately, I read on and found that he was explaining it on the next page.2. The constant mixture of qm and classical physics annoyed me.3. I always had the feeling that Kittel doesn't understand what he is saying himself. This could be because I didn't, though...Maybe, people find this work usefull as a reference work, I cannot comment on that, but it is a really lousy introductory text."},{"rating":"1","title":"misfortune to see it","review":"This the worst physics book that I've ever studied. The book made me so confused that I got lost even in the most basic concepts.It's hard to see why this book is so popular in the introductory level solid state courses. I began to learn the basic concepts of the solid state physics after I'd begun studying from other introductory level solid state books, such as Ashcroft-Mermin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Introductory Text!","review":"Overall I wouldn't recommend buying this book at all.However, you should especially dread buying it if this isyour first course in Solid State Physics.The book is rather disorganized andthe author is not writing in a very pedagogical style,I have no idea why this text is so popularand how it got to its 7th edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful in the first, and still awful","review":"As with another reviewer, I was \\"subjected\\" to Kittel while at Berkeley (though by another professor) many years ago. It killed my interest in Semiconductor physics completely, and I had to pick it up on the job. I found the book awful then, but hoped he had rewritten it, and decided that with all my many years of Semiconductor experience, I could re-approach it. Sadly, after all these years, he still doesn't get it. Sze is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Writing, Written to Memorize Facts and Not understand","review":"This is a pathetic textbook. The writing in it is awful, and sadly contributes to the stereotype that scientists do not know how to write. It is foolish to always give conclusions before derivations. It gives no motivation whatsoever for approaching certain questions nor the methods in which they are approached. It moves in a very inconsistent manner, developing topics very much at random, most annoyingly fading in and out of discussion of electronic models (Drude, Sommerfeld, Boch, weak periodic, etc). These models are at the core of the development of the field, and Kittel just kind of weaves in and out of random topics without bothering to explain why to describe things in such a manner (no discussion of why phonons are a good way to discuss system, no discussion of why we should obsess over k-space to describe every problem). Ashcroft and Mermin, by comparison, is a fantastic textbook which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is THE classic text in Solid State!","review":"I've taken solid state as an undergrad physics student, a grad at CSUF, a grad at University of Denver, and again as a grad at University of Washington. I have figured out why I just don't seem to grasp Solid State; I've always used this book! ;-) (Different editions) My prof agrees, there are better books out there.IMHO, the presentation is choppy and not coherant. Concepts are just thrown out and the student is left wondering, \\"What was THAT all about?!\\" It makes a GREAT reference if you already know solid state. I think thatis why it is used so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Intro book","review":"This book is an awful introduction to solid state physics. I would recommend Ashcroft and Mermin's version. Kittel dives right into equations without deriving them at all and assumes prior knowledge of quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and E&M. I am a senior engineering college student at the school Kittel taught (UC Berkeley) and we are forced to use his book because it's a \\"classic\\" in the field but it is just a terrible book to try to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduction to Hell","review":"This book is terrible.

I have also taught from this text numerous times. Poor, poor students! The text \\"contains\\" all the requisite material, but its explanations are murky and it it slips major concepts by without making them clear. I have resolved never again to make my students suffer with this text. Ashcroft & Mermin is wonderful book, but too advance as an introductory text. Bube's little book, Electrons in Solids, is a delight but too expensive for students and a little bit too elementary. Despite their limitations, I'm going to use the combination of those from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard for an introduction and disorganized.","review":"I don't like this book very much. As my first contact with Solid State Physics it proved, above all, disorganized. Sometimes you have to reread a paragraph (or a whole section) because the explanation to the beginning is in the end of it. I also felt a serious lack of physical intuition over the phenomena at stake. Sometimes two (would be) comparable graphics were side by side with totally different scales and looks, rendering the comparison difficult. Maybe as a reference it could be used, mostly because of the many tables encountered throughout it. But they are present in other (better) books too... As a comparison, I liked Ashcroft & Mermin's \\"Solid State Physics\\" a lot more.

I wonder why? It's by far one of the worst books I read in physics, math or electronics. It's disjointed, jumping around. Unfortunately when I was a student this book was our textbook. I tried other books--I enjoyed the first few chapters of Ashcroft's book a lot more, but even that book degenerated in later chapters.

The album is on a level with the famous Previn Trio series of albums recorded by Contemporary. What I strongly doubt, however, is the purported release date (1953).

I don't know about the technical facilities used by the \\"Tops\\" label, but I do know that the pioneering (and still stunning) Contemporary recordings were not done in stereo before 1956, a time when most of the major labels were still reluctant to embark on the new technology.That said, I would still place these tracks among the better achievements of nineteen-fifties' jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get what you see!","review":"The picture shown is for a USB card with a dongle but that is not what you get.

They sound pretty much the same except the rapper guy (forget his name at the moment) does more singing it seems and it improves there overall sound for me. including a song that guy wrote (track 8) along with the title track and the heavy track 5, make up my 3 best for this record.

But I'm not the one who made the CD so I take it for what it is and enjoy it!I would have liked a couple more tracks.

There is a laid-back feel to the album, but after 15 years of touring, the effort on this album doesn't take away from the 311 sound. \\"Thank Your Lucky Stars\\" is laced with smooth vocals and amazing melodies. \\"Frolic Room\\" brings together the crafty guitar work that builds up and reminds me of the first time I heard this band.The last half of the album is hands-down, genius. \\"Long For the Flowers\\", \\"Getting Through To Her\\" and \\"It's Getting OK Now\\" really emphasize the importance of each member of the band. It's definitely refreshing to hear more Nick on the guitar and more SA lay down lyrics that'll make you think.This album is another chapeter for a band that will continue to musically challenge most other \\"pop\\" bands out there.

Had it been anyone else I don't think I would have scored it that high.That being said, I also want to say that 311 is a great band who have grown and matured musically. This album is good to listen to if you are making a 37 minute drive and maybe firing up while doing so with a friend. I can listen to it all through but I still feel that it's not as up to par as it should have been (and was expected to be).DTOM is a great song and I like a few others but it isn't as great as From Chaos and Grassroots. Soundsystem was also good. The songs on DTOM are just relaxing to listen to. There's nothing really hard core as their was on From Chaos.Nonetheless, I recommend it to 311 fans but keep in mind that the music isn't as upbeat. It's more downplayed and nice to listen to when you're going to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a minute, things you thought were tied can come straight undone!","review":"For the record: 311's major label debut album was Music(their best work I think) released in 1993, not the self titled, \\"blue album\\", released in 1995. I've read a few reviews that state the \\"blue album\\" is their debut. Now I don't understand how someone can accurately review someone's new album without being famailar with all of their releases. That being said, I am familiar with all of their releases and DTOM is not a good album. Now, I wasn't a huge fan of their last album, Evolver, but I liked it and was impressed with the direction with which they were going with their sound, and was hoping to hear that sound blossom on this album. That was not the case. Instead they fell short of what they are capable of, and I am surprised that they were comfortable releasing these songs. I've been a 311 fan since Music and this album is a major dip in their career. That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"311 takes a slight turn","review":"First of all, they aren't putting out 20 song albums anymore, for better or worse. This CD is more reggae/jazz and less rock/hip-hop than most 311 albums. Reinforcing that fact is Chad Sexton didn't write as many songs this time (and don't get me wrong, he's written some of the band's best work). This is a mature band winding up the end of their careers possibly.I like the slight shift in gears, and SA stands out in this release. Hexum has polished his vocals as well. All in all, if you're the type of fan that listens through entire 311 albums, you'll probably like this. It doesn't exactly have a lot of radio hits. Standouts include the tracks \\"Speak Easy\\" and \\"Frolic Room.\\"I usually don't respond to other reviewers, but seriously man, Incubus, Korn, and Sugar Ray aren't like 311. They aren't even in the same ballpark. Sugar Ray sucks, and so does Stinkubas. 311 are innovators; no other band is really like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let me down...","review":"Why, I certainly feel let down. I am definitely a die hard 311 fan.Their creativity on the first 4 albums (ie from Music to Transistor) blew my mind. Songs like \\"8:16 am\\" have a strong, almost magical undertow - even if i listen to them for the 518th time. Having said that, I want to state that DTOM is an ok POPRecord. To put it in a polite way: That's not a terrible lot if you take into consideration that we are talking about 5 excepitonally giftet musicians/songwriters/producers.So for the next release: Don't let me down again!(Please.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very oldschool yet newer sound...","review":"I just got done listening to a preview of the whole cd and it is amazing...

This album is just simply uninspired, it is certainly not what I have come to expect from 311 - solid, awesome, impressive music - this is no where near that. The title track intro was an immediate turn off as I was praying that it was a song about to rag on bad 80's glam-rock or something but instead it just seems like a poorly constructed intro. There are a few decent songs but nothing stands out and I certainly can't imagine wanting to hear any of this live...overall this album is just an embarrassing bump in an otherwise empressive catalgue hopefully next time around they think of their long time loyal fans and write some more inspired offerings.

Please read on!","review":"This is the biggest piece of garbage 311 has ever recorded. For those who followed them before the \\"blue\\" album will be sorely disappointed. They have gotten progressively worse and soft with every album. This is the most feminine to date. They should have released it under the name, Nick Hexum and the Skirts. Even the one track that rocks is ruined by a sappy chorus. If anything, this cd will make a great coaster! It's no surprise that the album came out 3 days ago and their is already 34 used copies up for sale. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's their best work to date.

I've been a 311 fan for over ten years, bought every album since 'Transistor' on the release day, and I can't stand to even listen to this crap.

This album is such a joke it should be listed under the comedy section. It's so disappointing to see a band who gave us classics like Music, Grassroots, the blue album and Transistor devolve into this mindless pop drivel and lame contrived fake melodies. It's mind boggling what happened to these guys and as far as I'm concerned 311 ended their studio careers in 1999..that last four albums have gotten progressively worse and should be stricken from the record. Don't waste your money this album is a complete and utter disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"311 Fan?","review":"I know many of the folks that have written a review for DTOM are not really 311 fans. Sure, they say they are, but David Koresh said he was Jesus (And it turned out that he wasn't).All I'm saying is that a true 311 fan would recognize that their musical talent, lyric composition, and personalities have all matured as the years have progressed. I have watched them grow as I have grown, and I love them for letting me share their sadness, joy, depression, and smoked-out serenades. :)Would I recommend this album?Damn straight. I would tell you to buy them all, then listen to them chronologically. Only then will you understand what the hell I am talking about. But you WILL see the growth.I love 311 as they are now...Roots, Reggae, Rock, Rebels...in that order.So screw the idiots who posted negativity about my boys from Omaha (and Madison). Buy this stuff, and tune into yourself. It's way more than music! It's a lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes, Jacks Ruin the Realm","review":"311's latest installment, Don't Tread on Me, had great potential. When they submitted the cover art online, I was impressed. Was it perhaps, a 311 comeback? When I heard the demos, I was initially happy that perhaps with a little fine tuning, the 311 of old may come back.I was dead wrong. This cd is painful to listen to. I am an old school fan whose favorite cd is Grassroots or Transistor. I can't pick a favorite. However, I would rather buy 50 Cent's new cd (I don't listen to rap) than purchase this album. 311, you lost a fan. I'm finished. Take a look at 311's progression. At least Soundsystem was tolerable. This sounds like the stuff I can't stand on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooo sad","review":"i am a huge 311 fan and find this cd to be immensely disappointing....this cd makes me want to hold up a sign at the 311 show im going to friday reading \\"dont tread on me play real 311\\"...the way you know that its an awful cd is that it would sound awful live...grassroots and music remain the best of 311 the blue album is up there and even though transistor was experimental at least it was full of dubby reggae not poppy predictable stuff found on tread on me...apparently nick hexum and SA can not rap anymore and settled for sunny choruses...311 does not groove anymore i use to love how their music went from soft melodies to hard guitar raps and drum solos all in the same songs....if 311 continues to sound like this nick hexum might as well put out a solo cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best but definately not bad","review":"This is definately not the best CD 311 has ever produced. But it does have a style all of it's own and I find it appealing. These kids saying they speak for everyone over 21. GO BLOW SMOKE OUT YOUR ARSE!! You can't talk for anyone but yourself. As for me I find there music original as always. I will admit there are some parts in the music wheres SA's flows don't stick all that well but thats part of music not everything has to be perfection. It's the small flaws or certain things band do to make them who they are. So all in all the CD is good. Not phenominal but not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst 311 ever","review":"I have been a fan since the beginning and yes I can name more than 5 songs.

What an absolute disappointment; a true bona fide disgrace to all the long time 311 fans.....and wtf is up with these feeble and infantile lyrics. A six year old could have produced more meaningful and deeper lyrical compositions. This holds true for the entire album -- This album should only be available as a free download, period...What a shame -- Another band who sold their sole to the almighty dollar! Pff."},{"rating":"1","title":"they wont evolve but you might as well take them as they are * * 1/2 stars","review":"311 have now gave up trying anything new, since those atempts came off bland or unusual. And as they said here there going back to the usual. That said the album is entry point 311. But sadly too much of ska-raggae populates the new record in tracks like \\"dont tread on me\\" \\"speak easy\\" \\"Waiting\\" and \\"whiskey and wine\\" populate the record, and the punkier metal numbers are in short change. pretty underwhelming with biteless fuzzed out cky-esque riffs, and raggae style drumming, while the hooks try to surface in the punchy \\"thank your lucky stars\\". while not as flat as Evolver the band cant avoid there inevitable, theyre becoming lazy. As previous releases showcased that 311 have mad skmill and when they want to they can cook up quite a heated storm, but it seems that the energy has surely passed them by. with all the member now in there 30's it seemless like the ganja sound seems to be an aimless save haven."},{"rating":"2","title":"311's got the boom y'all...","review":"Do yourself a favor and go pick up this album. I've been a 311 fan since '95 and i must of listened to each of their 7 previous albums over 100 times each and i can honestly say, that this album would rate somewhere in the top four of the best 311 records to date. The only beef i have with it, is it's length...a whopping 37 minutes long. It's short, but oh so sweet. \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" may not be 311's most ambitious effort, but it is certainly their tightest. They have really matured as a band and this album is the best example of that. It is simply uncanny how well these 5 individuals work together. \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" summed up in a word: Stellar. Just go buy it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean, Precise, and to the point","review":"311 has once again provided an entire album that true 311 fans can be proud of. Although the lighter cuts outweigh the rockers, the album keeps you interested. Speak Easy, It's Getting Ok Now, and Getting Through To Her are some of the best written songs from 311 in quite some time. SA has come to a whole new level of songwriting and singing rather than relying on incomprehensible raps. There is no doubt that the sound is similar to what you have been accustomed to since 1995's Blue Album. The change has come in the form of better songwriting and tighter live performances. Look for a record number of singles hitting the airwaves from this album compared to any other 311 offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Wonderful","review":"I have been a 311 lover since I was about 11 years old when I bought \\"The Blue album,\\" the first cd i would ever own. Now, after listening to DTOM its been like rediscovering 311 all over again! Definetly love at first sound! SA really blew me away on this album with vocals unlike any on previouse albums.Tranquil and just Wonderful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away... fast","review":"I have listened extensively to every single one of 311's studio albums, and this one is just below par on almost every measure. 311 used to be cocky and clever, using their creativity to blend many styles of music in a most pleasing way. This album misses the mark, and painfully. It sounds forced and overly poppy (refer to their song \\"Hive\\": 'The day we turn to pop, the show will stop'), making it really hard to listen to. There are some gems... \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" are the only ones though. I do not recommend this album if you want to keep your view of 311 and their albums uninjured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Sublime","review":"311's new album is awe-inspiring. Rarely do I find a cd that I can listen through completely from beginning to end on the first listen. Last time that happened was with Weezer's Blue Album. I have been listening to the album non-stop since it came out. Nothing else has entered my home, car or work stereo. The lyrics are impressive, as usual with 311. They speak to all ages. The entire album is mesmerizing. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dunno too poppy","review":"I personally didnt enjoy the new cd all too much. It's cool for everyone that likes \\"love song\\" and \\"amber\\" (which were good songs_, but this cd lacks the 311 energy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't tread on this","review":"I'm a huge fan of 311 but this is clearly there worst record they have released. Even Nick Hexum recently admitted this and stated that he felt the album was rushed. The songs are too throw-away and lack the original riffing and riff changes that exists in almost all of their other releases. It sounds like a band that is tired. Look for Transistor, Evolver or Soundsystem for the real 311 masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, But Awful By Comparison","review":"Given the funky, reggae laiden rock that 311 is known for, this album is terribly bland and not creative at all.While still better than any \\"rock\\" album recently released, this album is a really watered down version of 311, where the rap influenced singing is replaced by some of the most feminine singing Nick has ever done.I'm a big 311 fan, but I will not pretend this album is good. I want my slap bass, my hip hop influenced drumming, funky guitars and fresh lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a joke","review":"I have been a fan of 311 for many years and I own all their albums. I was really excited for the release of this album. Let me tell ya, after getting home from the record store, I couldn't be any more excited to put this in my cd player. Boy was I disappointed. Every single track on the cd had that lazy-mediocre feel. I'm not saying the songs are bad, it's just that every single song was written very lazily and did not utilize the band's real talents. Songs like \\"Getting Through To Her\\" and \\"Waiting\\" just make me laugh cause they are cheesy beyond belief, I'm not even sure if the band wrote these songs seriously. I respect the band's desire to mature and evolve, but the way they are changing is not in a good direction (I speak on behalf of alot of loyal 311 fans). I love 311, but this album really got me down. I just hope they do a better job next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"311 fails to generate even a listenable album","review":"\\"The day we turn to pop, the show will stop.\\" Anybody else remember that lyric from the group's Blue Album cult classic \\"Hive\\"? I remember it, but I think Nick and gang have forgotten. My 311 listening begins with the Omaha Sessions and stops with From Chaos. Cancelling their annual 3-11 day show to produce what they called their best album generated high hopes that they might return to form and evolve their sound, as they hoped to do on their previous album, Evolver (also a dissapointment). However, this album sounds as if a cookie cutter no talent band of today melded with a reggae record, and the result is awful. If they were trying to appeal to Ashlee Simpson listeners my guess is they succeeded admirably. To anyone with actual musical ears, the album is far from satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD, Must Buy.","review":"When I first heard that this cd was only going to have one rap and the rest was going to be slow and calm sounding I was a bit skeptical because at that point I really only liked 311's harder, faster paced songs. But when I heard this cd it gave me a whole new perspective on 311. It let me learn to like more of what they have to offer as musicians. So anyone who likes 311 should definately buy this cd. They make the music on this cd very catchy and fun to listen too. The best tracks are Don't Tread On Me, Solar Flare, Getting Through To Her and It's Getting Ok Now. This cd sounds up beat and puts you in a good mood. Just go and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Album from a Great Band","review":"I don't get it. 311 is a good band. So why is this album so terrible? This album is just so boring. Most of the tracks have this real 'island' feel to them - like I'd expect to hear these songs broadcast from the hotel while vacationing in the Bahamas. Not what I want to hear. Anyway, I bought this album based on their previous efforts, and I am horribly disappointed. If you like 311, stick with their debut album from 1995 or their Evolver album from a few years ago. Stay away from this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"311 best band ecver easily","review":"311 proves again that they are just staright up amazing. Go see them in concert they are so tight.

They are and always will be one of my favorite bands, but this album well....sucked. Yes I said it. It sucks and I will tell you why. I enjoyed their previous albums because I felt the music. I felt depth in the tunes. What I heard on this album was a sell out, soft porn approach to making music except for a few songs. Sure you might attract every 14 year old girl on the block, but do you really want to go from a strong soulful message with your own sound to sounding like your an opening band from a Brittney Spears concert? A lot of these songs remind me of music I would hear on a kids show. Cheesy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maggie's Hope Book Review","review":"Maggie's Hope is a great summer read, specially on the beach!

Incidentally, these are two of the best tracks on this one. The other two songs that I like are M.W.A. (Musicians With Attitude), and El Camino Real.

It gives you good examples of the dynamics that can occur in a group counseling session. You get to watch a group evolve over a 2-3 day period. I found it to be very helpful and think anyone, who has not experienced a group counseling session first hand, should watch it. The video was edited down so it would only be about 2 hours. I would have liked to have seen a little more of the work done with each individual. The workbook covers it, but a picture is definitely worth a 1000 words. I think that would have made the video even more valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a DVD","review":"I bought this because I heard it is excellent, and I teach graduate students learning to practice group psychotherapy.

I was excited to find another small melita. It is better then the others but it has some safety thing where the coffee stays hot buy not real hot and if you put in milk it is less hot. It is not as bad as luke warm but not much better. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"I bought this coffee maker a few weeks ago. I don't drink coffee every day, so I haven't put it to heavy use, but I have used it about a dozen times. Recently, it has become unreliable. About 30 percent of the time, it only produces steam instead of coffee. The grounds in the filter are wet, and a few dribs and drabs of coffee end up in the pot. The instruction book said it meant that the thing had to be decalcified, so I went through the whole decalcification process with vinegar and water. It didn't work. Well,I threw out the shipping papers, so I can't return it under warranty.Mine may be the exception to the rule. I thought Melitta was supposed to be pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and lousy.","review":"Why Melitta would replace an excellent 4 cup maker that worked better (hotter coffee) and easier (the basket on this model is a pain) is hard to understand.

Apparently neither means much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"When I first saw the Melitta coffee maker my first impression was that it looked cheap and very fragile. My instincts were correct because the unit stopped pumping water after just two weeks. I've noticed that the older 4 cup machines are built much better. I had a Krups 4 cup that was built like a tank and put out a great cup of coffee. Unfortunately my wife threw away the filter base so I had to start looking for a new machine. I told my mom about my Melitta woes and she dropped off her OLD 4 cup Mr.Coffee machine. That machine is built great and makes great coffee just like my old Krups machine. The newer machines are made much cheaper than the older ones (I would rather not break out my conspiracy theories on Amazon). The Aeropress is an excellent coffee product if you don't mind the manual steps involved. Before you buy go to the store and touch and feel the units for quality. Amazon reviews are amazingly accurate and is a great way to purchase wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Melitta ruined the perfect product with this model. I bought it because of my experience with their now discontinued 4-Cup brewer. The difference could not be more stark. It is well priced, more modern, features a detachable water tank, and easier to pour. However it brews a horribly luke warm cup of coffee. The only up side I can see to this aspect it that if you need to suck down a cup of coffee in 5-minutes or less, this is the coffee maker to get. The unit is a perfect example of form over function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slower. slowest","review":"Ditto to all reviewers who lament the old white 4-cup. I bought the 5-cup a couple of years ago. Makes decent coffee. But the carafe drips unless you pour very carefully and the warming plate doesn't do a good job of keeping the coffee hot. My major complaint is that it takes 25 minutes to brew a pot of coffee. I give it a vinegar treatment regularly and remove and clean the water tank. Trouble is, after exhaustive research, I don't think there's a small electric drip coffee maker that fills the bill. The old 4-cup is still in the garage, seriously stained, pitted and ugly. I'm tempted to haul it out, but I'm now used to that extra cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"Makes good coffee, but the tank leaks :(And the carafe cracked on the bottom already; from the heat?Well the price was right--I paid < $7.00 for this, with free shipping.

This is the case here, but Al B. messed this one up himself. The mixes are almost forgivable until he starts rapping or whatever the hell you want to call that. Yuk! Just Yuk! Unfortunately, his music was popular at a time when R&B was turning into hip-hop and everyone thought adding a rap added to the value of a song. This flawed way of thinking still affects music today, but as far as this particular maxi-single goes, it's a bust.

Clark's apparent hopeless frailty and wanderlust in that picture are deceitful enough to prevent the less wary from a second glance at this piece. However, as time and her further works have shown us, these notions couldn't be less accurate - Clark pours forth a coherent, solid concept which, when properly absorbed by the listener, will cause an upwelling of emotions ranging from empathy and dark humor(Armchair Theatre) to outright tribal frenzy (Homecoming). Technically, the only inch of blame one can eventually find concerns the track order, which could deliver a more savory finale. This is a piece to listen to as a whole (or else buy the Homecoming EP) but one you can notice that was first released in vinyl and which kept the original track arrangement, losing a bit of drive on the early side-A-to-B passage.

All family and friends that have played with us love it. The game is hysterical and unique to each group that plays. For instance, the more adult groups might share different \\"Quips\\" then they would if players under 18 years old are playing. Whatever the group dynamics are we have had lots of fun with this game. Generally we play without the board (using only the DVD, paper and pens). We have found that without the board the game becomes open to all no matter when they arrive or need to leave...

This one plays like Beyond Balderdash, which I love. This one is just missing something. And for what I paid for it, I was very disappointed. The concept is good, and the idea is funny, but the way they executed the game play it is completely dependent on the people you are playing with to make the game funny.

My first book of hers was Dragonsdawn and I've been hooked ever since. At first I only wanted Pern but as I've matured I grew to love all her work. The talent series (both Rowan and Pegasus) have become my favorites. With Pegasus in Space I was enchanted from start to finish. I didn't intend to read it until my fiance had left town for a week but ended up reading it in one 2 to 3 hour sitting. I didn't feel a lack in the older characters because Peter was essentially the focus of this book. Just as Tirla was more evident in Pegasus in Flight. I simply loved it. And I can't wait for the next installment. {The way she linked the Rowan and Pegasus series was just plain wonderful)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiler","review":"I'm afraid I found the book nothing but a potboiler. I re-read Pegasus in Flight once I'd finished it to see if it was my appreciation of Anne McCaffrey's books which had changed and the difference in the quality of the writing was very noticeable. If this had been my introduction to her as an author I would have been put off buying anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suppose you wrote a book and nothing happened","review":"This is what it would look like.

It's a shame that whoever created these ebooks didn't care enough to edit them as if they were print books.I've noticed this in a few other ebooks as well and although I was planning to purchase a Kindle Fire soon, if they're going to just put out poorly edited books to make a buck (several bucks actually) and hope that no one cares about the quality I'm probably going to skip the Kindle Fire, stop buying ebooks and go back to the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pegasus in Space","review":"Great concept to write around.

Her naming convention of ships is fantastic!Well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Talents of Earth take a giant leap into space!","review":"I love Anne McCaffrey's books and her Pegasus series is one of my favorites.This book re-introduces us to some old friends and some new ones as well and starts immediately from the previous book, Pegasus in Flight.The action moves well and is easy to follow. This story mainly follows Peter Reidinger as he grows from an adolescent into a man and how he overcomes his disability to achieve his dreams.As usual, Anne McCaffrey has done a brillint job."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bridge to the Talent series","review":"The Pegasus series is not only an interesting series in itself, but is naturally the bridge into The Rowen and follow-on Talent books. I particularly like the way she portrays telepaths and their often rocky relationship with \\"normal\\" people.I, too, fear that Anne may be wrapping up the series. I hope not, because I would definitely like to know just how Peter sets up FT&T, and learn about the Talents who help colonize the worlds portrayed in the other series.While I adored the Pern series, the Pegasus and Talent series are my favorte McCaffrey books. If you like people stories, instead of technical science fiction, you'll enjoy these books. They do read better in sequence, but I think you'll like them any way you can get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointing","review":"Anne MacCaffrey's books typically hit where the heart is, with excellent characterization that is often deeply touching. This book is entirely lacking that. Yes, it was good to revisit old friends, but when comparing this book to its predecessors, it seems almost not worth the read. Also, the information dumps were handled quite poorly, and I found myself skimming through them.In addition, an entire subplot seemed ridiculous after the motivation for it was revealed. All in all, this book was a major disappointment, and not up to Ms. MacCaffrey's usual standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly a let down.","review":"I love the works of Anne McCaffrey and anxiously awaited the release of a new \\"Pegasus\\" book. The thing I love most about her works is the fact that you feel like you really KNOW the people she writes about. I feel this book was way to technical, very little about the lives of the people. Many times I found myself confused or bored during the discussion of how the gestalt worked etc... I cried like a baby when Masterharper Robinton died in the Dragonriders series but didn't even flinch when Dorotea had her stroke. It was like you already knew the outcome before you ever got there. All in all I am glad to have read the book and did enjoy it but I just didn't get the feel for it the way I normally do with her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not greatest book of hers","review":"this book came out the same time as the skies of pern and i felt that they were both rushed jobs. Pegasus in Space does close the Pegasus series and gives u the bridge to the Talent series, but it seems to be made of a list of facts then an actual story, there just dosent seem to be ne substance to it.

Navigating through the chapters is a nightmare with the index function which would normally be used to at least navigate from chapter to chapter in Kindle being non functional.

Bad idea. Without being able to see the product before purchase, I had no way of knowing how cheap it was.The pages are not perforated, but sometimes they rip out easily because the edge is cut too close to the spiral binding. The binding also works its way out of the pages because there is nothing at the ends to keep it in place. The notebook is also floppy, so it needs to be resting on a flat surface in order to turn the pages.Next time I need a notebook, I'm spending more money, and examining it in person first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good notebook.","review":"This is not a good notebook AT ALL. The pages are very soft. Even worse, the covers are also soft. The spiral binding is not done right and it always messes up the bottom of the pages (you'll know what I mean when you use it). I tried to treat the notebooks like they were eggs to keep the bindings from destroying the bottom of the pages, but it always does no matter what. I bought a bunch when it was on sale, and was stuck using it for 1.5-2 years since I did not want to throw all of it away. It was a bad experience.This is a bad product.

A slightly smaller easier to grip version of the heavier balls would be wonderful for us ladies.Update..8/2012Well, the ball was good until it split open this morning while doing slams with it against the pavement. As a weird coincidence, another teammates medicine ball broke this morning too. Also a valeo.My next medicine ball will most likely be a Nike.

Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid piece of equipment","review":"I put a client on a medicine ball routine to help him get started. 8 lb ball was a good size for him to begin with. If someone is intermediate to advanced, you need to go with a heavier ball. I used the 12 lb ball myself and it still wasn't heavy enough. He'll grow into the 12 lb quickly (within a month) if he keeps working at it. You should buy 8, 12, 20 and 25 pounders if you want to be able to grow with this type of equipment. Make sure you have room to store them as they are awkward if you don't have a stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ball!","review":"I bought this med ball from Amazon about six months ago, and it hasn't deflated at all.

It's easy to keep your grip on it.This is a really high quality product; I use it about once or twice a week for ab workouts, and it's in perfect condition.

We were accommodated with a return authorization and shipping label and had a replacement ball super fast! We were stoked! We thought, for sure, that the first blow-out was a fluke. Until, about a week after we started using the second ball, the sidewall burst. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice.... that wont be happening.

It operates as its own workout at this weight without being too big or bulky. It has good elasticity too, in case you're bouncing it off of something (hopefully something sturdy, due to its mass). The paint peels very easily, which is more of a nuisance than anything else. There's at least one extra layer of paint beneath it, but finding the little yellow pieces all over the place isn't all that great. It's a good product on the whole, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for P90X2","review":"I made the mistake of buying a \\"soft\\" medicine ball before I startred P90X2 and realized immediately that I needed a solid one.

It should be entitled A LABOUR SLANT on Models of Political Economy. Don't come to this book looking for a relatively impartial look at Keynesianism or Monetarism or any other model. All Monetarists have horns. If you don't mind the 'Labour Party good, everybody else immoral' slant of this book then this might be the book for you. Finally, here is the kicker. I have always voted for left wing candidates. But I didn't know that I was buying a Labour tract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"I have Dynaudio BM15A studio monitors. They weigh 41 pounds which is well under the specified weight limit. My studio control room floor is carpet.The spiked feet OnStage provides for carpeted environments did not install easily and are not long enough to be effective on low pile shag. The lack of solid footing makes the triangular base precarious. The slightest bump into these stands will cause them to topple over under the weight of heavy monitors like the ones I own.They would probably work fine for smaller monitors or on solid floors. In my case, however, they are not working and downright dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely stable","review":"The upper pole and plate are fine, but the base is way way too small. It should be either a standard PA tripod or twice as large and square on the base. For the price I paid, I could have bought two pair of pro tripod stands, two mounts, and bolted a piece of black painted plywood to the top... and had four stands that worked instead of two that don't. At the moment I simply took the top pole off and put it on a pair of pro tripods and it's working fine, but that's a lot of money for just a pole and a plate. I would only recommend considering this product for very light speakers (preferrably with a base smaller than 9\\" square) on very hard floors... without anyone or anything around that might bump it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced","review":"The Sonstage SMS6000 does NOT come with instructions and in my case one of the screw does not screw into the hole on the bottom after 1 turn. It's threading is plastic, not metal, so I don't want to crack it. It has alot of plastic pieces which hold the cables which also came smashed with the unit. With all the great stands out there I can't recommend this as it's tilted with the cables showing."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stands for the price","review":"Overall these stands are good for what they're worth. Easy to assemble, sturdy, nice sized top plate for my monitors (KRK rokit 8's). I would've given 5 stars but like one of the reviewers said the cable clips were also broken upon opening the box and one of the stands brand sticker (it says \\"On Stage Stands\\") was scraped up pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Condition","review":"While I cannot hold Amazon.com responsible, when the box containing the stands arrived, the box was crushed and torn - good thing these stands are made of pretty sturdy metal. What I got: two (2) stands, one of which was scratched up, a bag of parts to put them together, and no documentation whatsoever. The only reason this isn't a one-star experience is that for me, function is over form for speaker stands, and they are solid, with pads that will protect your speakers/monitors. Now if my monitors would have come in this condition, I would riot, but seeing as these are just stands...your mileage may vary. Perhaps I got a disgruntled employee that particular day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: Potentially Dangerous","review":"Studio monitors are usually over 20lbs. Heavier than a frozen turkey. If you did not know, a fall with this weight is enough to break the bones in your foot or do grievous harm to a loved one. You don't want to live with these stands. I used 28lb JBLs on this stand with carpet spikes leveled out and they wobble at sitting height. It became painfully obvious that these are potentially dangerous. I would not put anything over 8lbs on these to be honest, they are \\"rated at 100lb\\" but this claim is ridiculous. I have also used Onstage 3-tier keyboard stand and it also wobbled. I will never buy from this company again. I thought I was getting a great product this time, but nothing they make seems good enough. I wasted all of my christmas money. I will caution you again, don't put anything remotley heavy on these. If you have 6 or 8 inch studio monitors these will not be good for you and could hurt someone.

Standout tunes strike me as the Counting Crow's 'Colourblind' for its dark melody, and Craig Armstrong's 'This Love' for it's utterly haunting vocals. Both will transport you back to the heartwrenching scenes in the film in which the songs feature.

I suppose I am partial to more \\"well-known\\" artists, and have yet to grow accustomed to these new artists' styles. The best track, \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" by Verve, is strangely placed as the last number. If you are completely swept off your feet by the movie, then by all means buy the soundtrack.

Have had no problems after one month, no banding issues, great contrast and vivid pictures. I don't think that you can do any better with any other set but I also don't think that you would be able to tell the difference with less expensive sets either. I compared the 92 with a 62 in the store side by side and could not tell any difference. In my house I also have the Sony 52W3000 and can't tell the difference. Going to a friends house (not side by side) who has a Samsung, they all look great. My advise is don't worry about the specs of the TV too much. All the brand names look great and you won't be able to tell the difference.

The sound was also much better when using HDMI.Hopefully my experience so far represents the majority of these sets, and not just that I got a \\"ringer\\".By the way, I bought this through 6ave due to their good BBB rating.

And their hooves need to be trimmed about once every 8-9 weeks as opposed to 4 weeks with a regular horse.

Amazon wouldn't replace their bad product because they said it has passed the return period (within 30 days)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great presentation, great CD...","review":"This live CD is great, except for two things: only 11 tracks for such great presentation, and BURY ME AN ANGEL is missing(I'd rather prefer less songs from the last album and more from the first and second). This Toy's Factory Edition presents a case with a really big double-sided poster, and extra booklet for Japan with lyrics, notes and history of the band,in english and japanese. The main booklet comes with lots of photos on stage. It comes, also, with a four-minute CD-ROM track where you'll find live video cuts, backstage, recording sessions, and M.Amott and S.D'Angelo in Studio Fedman giving us their opinion about this live album, and presenting Fredrik Nordstrom. Arch Enemy sounds killer on stage. Johan sings with a death metal voice instead his thick heavy voice that we're used to. It seems a great crowd and a great show. The other guys simply sound and rock like hell!!!!! If you're an Arch Enemy fan you should get this CD. Those $36 will be very well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reed's Back","review":"First Water Boy, then the Old Dogs project, now this, Reed's first feature-length album in 12 or so years. This boy doesn't get retirement. Jerry sings on half the songs (the odd-numbered ones, to be precise), and picks on the others. As with the LPs from his halcyon days in the 1970s, the instrumentals slow things down a touch. But, it's good to hear him getting away from the novelty numbers and back to some serious singing and strumming. OK, it's not likely to make anyone's desert island list (although Reed's Georgia Sunshine LP from 1970 makes mine), and it's not going to get played on any country radio stations. But, if you've appreciated Jerry's work in the past, you'll agree it's refreshing to hear him recording again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"She is a tremendous artist.

This is nothing new, the entire record is kind of a Motown soul replica, and could easily have been made back in the early 70\`s.Amy has a cool voice though, and the lyrics aren\`t too bad, but the production quality is so unimaginably crappy you couldn\`t believe it. The bass-sounds are boomy, there are distortions in Amy\`s voice, and the arrangements all over are poor and monotonous. Because of this, I think it\`s annoying to listen to this record. The crew responsible for this thrashy production, should have been punished.. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard this before","review":"when I first heard this cd, i actually was diggin it a little bit, but i realized why... these songs are all rip offs from diana ross and dusty springfield and other greats. people praising her originality need to take a listen to the greats of the past who've already done it, and did it waaaayyy better."},{"rating":"1","title":"White chocolate Erykah Badu...","review":"To be fair, girlfriend can sing. And even Lauren Hill has some demons that she needs to clear up. Both Amy and Erykah Badu channel that same lazy drawl that Billy Holiday often had from being in a drug-induced haze. Although Amy's singing is good and the record has decent production, the material is hardly fresh or innovative. Psychedelic Copycat is more like it. There must be a lot of folks out there that want music to get high to. This record provides it in spades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fouled mouth soul music","review":"I bought this album at a sale at Carrefour Penang. I have heard the great reviews of this album.

And my dad says I'm fine, so obviously he knows everything.\\" If she wins any awards, especially for this song I am going to be very disappointed in whoever gives it to her. She is also very masculine and tattoos, what the hell? I hate this woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripping off real artists.","review":"Amy Winehouse is so freakin' ugly, how does she sell albums? A total druggie, alcoholic, and god how much does she weigh, 45 pounds? She is a terrible role model, she is just as bad as Lindsay Lohan. Winehouse can't sing, she thinks she is some rockin' soul singer from the 1960's but she isn't, she is just a wannabe. Take my advice and stay away from this over-rated album, but if you like to hear a troubled and pathetic woman whining about going to rehab which is where she is now, then this album should make you happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE that jazzy voice of Amy Winehouse","review":"What a wonderful CD. I absolutely adore Amy Winehouse's voice. Her songs have so much meaning (although a bit brutal at times...hmmmm like life is I guess). If you love jazz, then you will LOVE this CD. I cannot wait until she writes more songs. All of her songs are so heartfelt...you can almost FEEL the pain and emotion coming from her.

That was one of the best things I've done. Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with \\"odd\\" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton). Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.I have a wide range of taste, from Bob Dylan to Janis Joplin to Antonio Carlos Jobim to classical. I see or hear no reason to purchase Ms. Winehouse's warblings because they just aren't good enough ... they're BORING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Say Yes, Yes, Yes ...","review":"Unlike most solo female recording artists these days, Amy Winehouse is the real deal.

Basically, Just Buy The Album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"Back to Black is the second studio album by English recording artist Amy Winehouse, released on 27 October 2006 by Island Records. It is the last album released in her lifetime. The album incorporates 1960s soul music styles and modern R&B; production, with subjective lyrics that concern relationships and reflect on Winehouse's experiences with drinking, sex, and drugs. The album produced several singles, including \\"Rehab\\", \\"You Know I'm No Good\\", \\"Back to Black\\", \\"Tears Dry on Their Own\\", and \\"Love Is a Losing Game\\". Back to Black received generally positive reviews from music critics, earning praise for its classicist soul influences, Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson's production, and Winehouse's songwriting and emotive singing style.This vinyl version exalts the sound and the tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best","review":"I bought this CD on March 29, 2007 and have not stopped listening to it. Amy Winehouse is the most talented singer I have heard in years. What a voice! What an attitude! Rehab and You Know I'm No Good are two of the best songs ever. She should win a lot of Grammys this year.I then bought Frank from Amazon UK. It is as good if not better than Back to Black. Clearly, Amy Winehouse is simply the best talent around right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Retro Jazz/Blues Album Ever!!","review":"The voice and the lyrics are out of this world!!

Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just alright","review":"i have heard this album and I don't get all the hype. AMy Winehouse is creative to a extent,but she sounds like Ronnie Spector trying to channel Lauyren Hill and it has a mixed reaction. the retro Girl Group style and sound of the 60's is charming for a while and then it starts to wear then and feels gimmicky after a while. Production and Musicianship is solid, and the writing has some moments,but the overall vibe doesn't knock me out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Winehouse Back to Black","review":"Amy Winehouse Back to Black CD is Excellent a given 5 stars.Amy Winehouse in my opinion has a marvelous gifted talent.Amy Winehouse reminds me of the old jazz and blues singers.I am hoping that Amy Winehouse will have many years of good health and happiness ahead of her to continue providing the public with her gifted talents.This Back to Black CD shows the range of Ms. Winehouse's talents. It brings you to intimate jazz or blues clubs with that special someone.Thank you Ms. Winehouse and please provide us with many years of listening to your gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"This was an ok CD but I think her previous one was way better.

What makes it even better is the fact it was cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been 5 stars, But...","review":"I love the music and Ms. Winehouse's voice and tone are wonderful. However, I think this cd would've been really great if she didn't use vulgar language unnecessarily. Don't get me wrong, I'm no Puritan, I own music with explicit lyrics, that are used to fully express thoughts or feelings, but the amazing lyricism of this artist doesn't need them. It seems like she peppered these words into her music in order to make sure that the listeners would know without a doubt that we're NOT listening to a throw back band or maybe to make sure she stayed connected to her age group or maybe street cred. I don't know, I feel like her lyrics are hard core and expressive of a young woman's deep angst and desires. I just would've enjoyed the cd more withouth the oddly placed and awkward use of vulgarity. I hope that Ms. Winehouse has a long career and that she continues to grow as an artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, disappointing album","review":"She's got a great voice, some of the lyrics are really interesting, but musically this CD is repetitive and tedious.I will never ever listen to it all the way through again (though I may cherry pick one or two numbers for a mix) because every song began to sound the same. Another reviewer commented on the drummer and another on the production values of the CD. I agree. Relentlessly base heavy and boring. Motown recordings suffered from poor production values, but that was then -- we can have better today.I wish her luck. She has a neat style and a fantastic voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that a drum machine on Rehab?","review":"The production value of this disc left me cold. Great songs, but did the producers skimp on the budget or what? Get a drummer with some real chops to liven this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice!","review":"This is a great CD. I received it over a year ago and still listen to it. What makes this CD all the more interesting is the troubles that Amy is going through. When I first got the CD as a gift, I didn't know who she was or what she was about. But as soon as I heard the first few notes from her voice...WOW! She is incredible!Unfortunately, Amy is going through a lot of issues. When a singer goes through what she is, most people want to toss the CD aside and figure, \\"yeah, I ripped it for my iPod, it'll go to craigslist soon.\\" But with this CD, you want to keep it. You want to listen to it; not for messages or any of that psychology stuff, but because it may truly be the last real recording she does. And even if it isn't, the music is fantastic. Don't ignore this, it's a classic sound brought into the modern day."},{"rating":"2","title":"So beautiful","review":"After all these years, I can't stop listening to that raspy-but-polarizing voice that showed her vulnerability, compared to many other artists who just make songs for hit-making.

It's really hard to enjoy this music anymore now that she's playing \\"Back to Black - The Home Version\\". Hopefully she can get herself together.Then again...it was always the tortured and troubled souls that made the greatest Soul music of our time, right. Sad but true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing something Back to Blues and Soul","review":"This ballsy effort from newcomer Amy Winehouse has rightly caused a stir. Full of attitude and her unique vocal this album has brought back some of the feeling modern (mainstream) blues/soul has been missing.A well produced effort will ring a chord with music lovers across a broad spectrum with the passion inherent from the lyrics and their delivery touching anyone that has been in or out of love; or re-hab as the first catchy offering from the album reminds.A worthy addition to the collection and one that I am sure will be cropping up in my playlist for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This is one of the best albums I have purchased in a long time.

It can only end in disaster, which would be such a loss to her family and the music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...really!","review":"A CD I can truly listen, not skip a song and listen to all over again. A soulful singer and CD. I love the old beats. This is a throwback that works! Amy is doing the damn thing.

Amy hits the mark in a combination soul, funk and jazz.Definitely her best, so far, this album should not be missed by those who love this style. I am looking forward to many more great hit albums such as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpretentious while un-disguised superhuman talent","review":"Amy Winehouse cannot be concealed any longer. Whinehouse is surpassing in talent of what has been put out since vinyl went digital! This album is a phenomenal achievement as she bridges soul with a throwback to yesteryear. The 60s? Arguably, she has much earlier influences. Nevertheless, I believe that the band really comes alive by the muse of her inspiration. Joshua Alston of Newsweek describes her as \\"a perfect storm of sex kitten, raw talent and poor impulse control.\\" I simply say she's a genius and to keep the record button on, while wishing her a prosperous and prolific career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing piece of work!","review":"This album is beautiful and solid from start to finish, as long as I do not have to see Winehouse and her f**** up shenanigans I will truely enjoy the work she has done here for many years to come. My personal fav: \\"Tears Dry On Their Own\\", achingly beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece in no uncertain terms","review":"Whether you are talking about the playing by the Dap-tones, the production by Mark Ronson or the singing and songwriting by Ms. Winehouse this is without question one of the finest examples of popular music made in years.From the lo-fi aesthetic of the drums(one mic!)or the roomy vibe of the ensemble captured on analog tape this recording is a textbook case of what happens when the technology does not subsume the art. I cannot recommend this album highly enough and for people that produce records for a living, as I do, it is the kind of high watermark that makes you feel like this thankless world that we inhabit is still worthwhile, she may not see her 25th birthday but Amy Winehouse is an artist that reminds is why we loved music so much in the first place"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Black","review":"Great album. Amy Winehouse is so talented. Anyone will enjoy her music. Definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another music industry rip off!","review":"I did some, but not enough research before purchasing this. It is a major disappointment. The quality of this recording sucks, the bass and drums are boomy and too loud with no depth to them at all. I'm positive that in a year or two, they will put out a remastered version of this so that the people who really like this stuff can be seperated from some more of their money. The band arrangements suck, they do absolutely nothing interesting. The monotony of the 8 and if you are lucky 16 bar drum machine patterns is mind numbing to listen to. Admittedly, Winehouse has some skills and nuances that can be pleasing, but this recording seems to stress her more abrasive and nasal qualities instead. Maybe that's all that can cut through the cheesy, overly loud arrangements the band is playing. I fault the Island/Universal Records for this dreck. They did Winehouse no favors with this production, it sounds like it was made by a bunch of amateurs with bad attitudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original...??? NO, NO, NO... Sounds like a recyled product!!!!","review":"I don't know why, but since I heard \\"Rehab\\" from Amy Winehouse, the first thing that came to my mind was, \\"Gosh, she sounds as a prefab-recycled product from the Record Industry\\"!Therefore, you may like or dislike her musical style. In my very humble opinion, I don't like this singer at all. Her music is a well-made 'collage' of other musical styles. Nothing new. She pretends to sound like... Etta James?? Her image of the 'New Bad Girl in the Music Scene' appears completely false and empty. Lots of dirty language in her songs, add nothing better to her music and image.Then I say: AW is a NO-NO-NO choice for serious music listeners! Don't spend your money buying music from this artist. Period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Winehouse may age better with time","review":"Despite the critical praise heaped on Winehouse's debut, it's not all it's cracked up to be. That's not saying it doesn't have it's moments. Both \\"Rehab\\" and \\"I'm No Good\\" are great tunes and really capture a great 60's R&B vibe, but after a dozen listenings I'd be hard pressed to remember any other tunes that grab me. The \\"rewriting\\" of Ashford and Simpson's \\"Ain't no Mountain\\" is sort of clever, but if your going that far, write your own original tune. I hope Amy's aging process will produce a better product with future efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"too soon","review":"really hate to see someone who seems to have sometalent for show business, some singing ability,but it is wasted on sloppy singing and nodirection. it is too early to give this girl any awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered the latest Joss Stone CD and your site said if I liked her, I would like Amy Winehouse.

It's fresh and new; totally different from everything else out there; you get that retro vibe. There is not a bad song on it; unlike most albums if you know what I mean.

About 10 tracks maybe. This Cd is perfect if you are depressed and in need of mourning. Her tortured soul bleeds through her songwriting and you really get a peek into her inner turmoil. The songs also tend to sound the same. This cd is addicting but I can't say a classic. I personally love it but I don't want to call it a GREAT piece for every ear out there, but definitely a very good piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality: terrible","review":"Can't listen to this CD on a reasonable installation.

The music is probably OK, but I haven't listened to it enough to know. The sound quality is totally unacceptable.It's hard to believe this is the sound the label was shooting for. It can't be just a case of one incompetent dork in the studio, because at least a few people must have heard this before it was released. Maybe I got a lemon somehow.A guy I know told me that it might be a black market copy, but I bought it from Amazon, so that doesn't seem likely, and even an illegal copy should sound better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy on Vinyl?

I'd recommend this to any who wants to listen to great music on vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Blues Siren","review":"This is one of my favorite CDs in my whole collection. Amy purrs like a housecat and roars like a lioness. Her lyrics speak truth and she sings about everything that makes a young woman's experience beautiful and terrible.

Rest in peace, Amy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Soulful British Import","review":"Amy Winehouse's \\"Back To Black\\" is another release in the vein of Joss Stone and a number of other British recording artists who have gone to the 50's and 60's to either redo those era's songs, or create new songs with that era's sound.With Wall of Sound production values, a smoky, whiskey-inflected voice that calls to mine Macy Gray, but not quite as harsh, Winehouse's CD shows songwriting skill in addition to a great voice.Songs like \\"Rehab,\\" \\"You Know I'm No Good,\\" \\"Back to Black,\\" and others capture and hold your attention. There is a frighteningly self-destructive nature to a lot of these songs, and judging from what is know about Winehouse, there may be more truth to these songs than we or she would like to admit.Here's hoping that Amy Winehouse will make more great music like this for many, many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I was told Amy's voice was amazing. So when the video for Rehab started, I thought I would come across an angelic Dido-esque voice. but Instead, i was taken aback.Yet I was so intrigued. Her voice is so unique and beautiful. It sounds sultry, but classy. Black, but white. Raspy, but smooth. I was like in awe of her voice. I think the last time I was this intrigued by a voice was the first time I heard Norah Jones.I immediately bought her album, and LOVED It. She truly is amazing, and I am so glad I found her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young with an old soul","review":"Her voice is amazing. She has a lot of variety on this cd. Her songs are in the style of jazz,pop and r&b. I love the song, \\"Me& Mr. Jones\\" it has an old swing beat to it, but the lyrics are up to date. She has songs on here that caters to everyones taste. I can not stop listening to this cd. I love it. She sings better than some r&b artist out here! And to repeat she is an excellent writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauryn Hill and Billie Holiday had a child and its Back to Black","review":"Spectacular praise for Back to Black, this is without a doubt the best blend of jazz, and R&B to come along in years. Combining soul and jazz, Winehouse has produced a feast of music that is a rare treat in this current musical desert. Where does one start in the accolades for this work, without a doubt Back to Black and Rehab are pieces that I play daily, for the sheer musical joy that it produces. Nevertheless, the entire album is a delectable treat. Winehouse has done a splendid job in combining various genres of music and producing a masterpiece. Sadly, Winehouse like so many great artists has \\"gone to soon\\". Nevertheless, the legacy of Back to Black and Amy's sincere and wonderful voice will remain like a sparking diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep going back to this excellent album","review":"I love this album. I keep playing it over and over again, and it never gets old. The rest of the album is just as good as the radio tracks.This is the kind of album that I've been wishing for years that Christina Aguilera would record: a classic, Motown-esque power collection of great tunes, backed by solid instrumental work. (No cliched guitar riffs on this album - we're talking horns, keyboards, backing vocals, strings - you name it.) Winehouse has the same fantastic voice, but less of the annoying R&B; coloratura that Aguilera has, so she's dynamite on these soulful tunes.I love Winehouse's raw, pouty, expressive voice, even if she can't articulate worth a damn. (She must have gone to the Stevie Nicks school of pronunciation) She could sing me the phone book and I would love every minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLASHBACK","review":"THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY GOOD. A VERY SOULFUL ALBUM. IT TAKES YOU BACK. TO ME ITS AN ALBUM THAT I HAVE TO BE IN THE MOOD TO LISTEN TO. HER HIT SONG \\"REHAB\\" I CAN LISTEN TO ANY DAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the Publicity, She's Good Yall...","review":"If you are into the rich, deep, soul sounds of yesterday mixed with some of today, then you are in for a treat with this Amy Whinehouse CD. She has a very intriquite way of saying certain things. Her deep raspy voice is melodic and you can tell when she sings, she is in a moment. These songs will stay in your mind and on your mind, and make you sing a loud. Check it out; you may be surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous","review":"Amy Winehouse appeared at the Brecon Jazz festival a few years ago and sadly although I was there that year, I missed the chance to see her live. With this new album she moves the goalposts from Jazz to Soul and what a triumph it is.If you like Motown or 60's soul with an occasional hint of doo-wop you are going to love this. Brassy (literally - Sax, Trumpet etc) sometimes funky, with Amy's expressive vocals singing her own earthy lyrics this is a classic album and undoubtably the best I have heard this year, regardless of style. The single 'Rehab' and 'Me & Mr Jones' are the stand-out tracks for me.As previous reviewers have noted it is short (35 mins) so I have docked it a star, but there is no filler on this album and I recommend it strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough","review":"I can't stop playing this album. Amy Winehouse was so amazing. It is so sad, that myself and all her other fans will not be able to hear her fabulous voice anymore.Love is a Losing Game - my favorite, RIP Amy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this new CD from Amy Winehouse","review":"I love this new CD from Amy Winehouse. My favorite track is \\"Rehab\\". This is a very groovy sounding song about someone with a drinking problem who refuses to go to rehab. I love all the instruments on this song especially the trumpet and saxophone. \\"Just Friends\\" is another hit on this CD. I love the musical arrangement of this track. It makes me want to dance. \\"You Know I'm Not Good\\" is the sexiest song I've ever heard about a person being unfaithful. This track is another one of my favorites. \\"Back To Black\\" is another highlight here. This track has a 60's retro sound with the superb piano playing. This song is about a dysfunctional relationship between two people. Amy sounds so soulful on \\"Love is a Losing Game\\". I love the slow tempo of this song very much. \\"Some Unholy War\\" is another good track. It is about supporting a loved one in a time of crisis. This is a very enjoyable CD to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't sleep on this album!","review":"As much of a Christina Aguilera fan I am, Back to Black is the album she wished she'd recorded when planning the concept for her own throw-back inspired disc, Back to Basics. Where Christina's throw-back sound ended up a mish-mash of 50s and hip-hop with insipid lyrics on love and swagger and her trademark over-singing, Amy Winehouse, with the absolutely stellar producer Mark Ronson in tow, created an album that could have been sung by Aretha and Etta--had they written songs dealing with alcohol and drug use/abuse and f*cked up love affairs. Back to Black is that rare concept album that comes about once in a lifetime that sounds like its concept(60s soul/jazz/girl-groups) and yet remains current and relatable--and edgy. Couple Amy's blunt lyrics with the smoky, gritty quality of her voice as she allows it to dip and trill and scat(with the absence of over-singing), and Back to Black is an album I can declare to be the best of 2007 long before this year is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"This is an amazing album that gets better with listening. There is not an empty song in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little Ronnie Spectorish","review":"Why is it that every white girl on the market seems to think that to validate themselves as a cross-over artist you have to put a rap artist on at least one track? The last track could have been left out completely, other than it is a great c.d. and I like every track. Some times it sounds a little like Ronnie Spector or Etta James. I think you'll enjoy, if you are putting it on an mp3 player omit the last trck. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Keep Coming Back","review":"BACK TO BLACK, the latest album by British singer Amy Winehouse, is a stunning exhibit of what passes these days as Neo-Soul. Winehouse has delivered an album that is both contemporary and nostalgic at the same time.To my ears, there are four solid classics included in this collection, REHAB, YOU KNOW I'M NO GOOD, TEARS DRY ON THEIR OWN and BACK TO BLACK, with ME AND MR. JONES close behind. Each of these songs mines a 60's Motown/Phil Spector vein, but is made current by Winehouse's strong vocals and cunning, detail-oriented, love gone wrong lyrics. Amy's voice brings to mind jazz singers such a Billie Holliday and Cassandra Wilson as well as the full gamut of 60's singers from the Shangri-Las to Dusty Springfield. The album tends to cool off towards the second half, but overall is very strong.BACK TO BLACK is a solid album that seems to have struck a chord and could be the soundtrack to the summer of 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I received the CD in a very timely manner. I had been wanting this CD for some time. Glad I got it. And really glad I used this person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely TERRIBLE","review":"I don't get what all the fuss is, particularly now since Winehouse died. Fortunately I didn't buy this one, a friend loaned it to me. So glad I didn't! It's a complete ripoff of earlier artists and music, and not in a good way. Ms. Winehouse's voice would have been put to much better use if we could take out the do-wop rip-offs and replace them with unique blues songs. Could have been great, but completely misses the mark here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad package Vinyl was delivered damaged","review":"I am a consumer of Amazon books and this kind of problem almost doesn't happens, but this time the product I bought was delivered damaged, the cover of the vinyl came very mashed. What we can do about that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man i just wanted to puke","review":"WOW what a lousy CD........This girl's talent is a ZERO and you know what.......the RECORDING quality is even worse!!!!!!!!!!!

That is all~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry folks....","review":"Don't see (or hear) the hype about this one. Actually, I'm not sorry.Too many of these non singing folks who are just here for a minute. We need to hear more Amel, More Jill, More Goapele(?). Talented folks who can sing. BTW, Where is MAXWELL? What's he doing? Tyrese SURPRISED me! Brova' can sing! And Ac k t (as Marisa Tomei says in My Cousin Vinny)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy is a breath of fresh air","review":"Her voice is magic and it reminds me of how good R&B used to be and still can be without the preservatives. When she sings, she hits me in the gut and I can relate to her songs in some ways. For someone so young, she sings about a wide range of life experiences. She will go a long way and she's truly an amazing talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinah Washington meets David Lynch","review":"I love this album.I know everyone wants to compare Amy to someone like Ms. Badu or Billie Holiday but Amy's too far out in front and over the top .This is like Dinah Washington on a Phil Spector album from a David Lynch Movie. Its Bluesy & Earthy & all the while she still has a Spector type late 60's groove & reverb. I've got to hear her old stuff to see how she got here. I'm hoping its as much fun as this one .PS anyone got tickets for either Chi-Town show ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Amy Winehouse is friggin incredible. I've heard about her personal demons, battle with the papparzzi, etc. But her music, unfortunately has not gotten the exposure it deserves in the US. Take an absolutely gorgeous, bluesy voice add a dash of amazing lyrics and incredible hooks and you've got one of the best R&B albums of the year. If only US soulsters could make it this good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This is an absolutely abysmal LP. It is an embarrassment to Amy Winehouse who has a great voice and Vinyl should bring out the depth and quality in her unique voice. The reality is that they have stuffed up the engineering on this record so it sounds disgraceful. At first I though there was a problem with my stereo. After labouring through the first two songs I swapped it for a some other records I have which all sounded awesome. Then I put this back on and it still sounded horrible.I believe there is a European version that does sound good but this US version should not be on the shelves. Do not purchase for any price......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's \\"Addicted\\"?","review":"I've been waiting for this to be available in the US. Fabulous album by a real talent.One disappointment, why'd they remove the song \\"Addicted\\" and put the remix of \\"You Know That I'm No Good\\" in its place? Maybe the record company thinks the theme is too controversial for the US?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seminal Classic","review":"Too many reviewers here have compared Amy Winehouse to Etta James, Diana Ross, Billie Holliday.......the list goes on. Surely the point is whether the songs are beautifully crafted; the vocals dextrously performed? It was producer Mark Ronson who decided to give the songs a 1960's feel; but they are sung with such a great heart that the quality of this album will shine through for a very long time to come regardless of what genre you care to place it in. Americans should hang their head in shame that their parochialism prevented them from awarding Amy Winehouse with the Grammy for 'Album of the Year'. That the prize was given instead to an album of rehashed Joni Mitchell songs just shows you how stupid and pointless these award ceremonies are. Go and ask yourself, which of the two albums will be remembered as one of the creative highpoints of the decade - the 'Joni Letters' or 'Back to Black'? Answers on a postcard please......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!","review":"I don't have much time to write a good review, but I will just say that this CD is great!

Her lyrics are also personal and yet universal which is what makes almost all great lyrics great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 10 Tracks","review":"Just a quick note about what appears to be the same version of the album I bought from a retail store in San Francisco. I have the same version with the shiny sticker in the upper right-hand corner... and it only has 10 tracks, omitting the final song \\"Addicted\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD!!!","review":"I FOUND THAT THIS CD VERY GOOD, AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE INTOOLD MOTOWN OR JAZZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...what's all the hype about?","review":"This is a very bad wannabe jazz CD and it's terrible.

And the rest of the Top 10... who are these editors? What kind of musical background do they have? None - from my point-of-view! The most descriptive word I've seen about this album is 'drivel'. Amen. This is just plain awful. Sometimes I wish I wasn't a trained musician and didn't know what I know about composition, but the simple truth of the matter is that albums like these are a slap in the face of artists out there with actual talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"People really need to stop giving this album 5 star reviews.","review":"I cannot believe how low people's musical tastes have dropped over the past few years. This drivel is given over 100 5 star reviews!?!?!?! Are you serious!?!??! It isn't about how she compares with older R&B/soul divas (she doesn't) or how contrived and boring her lyrics are (Your going to rehab? congrats!!), the fact is that people like this album BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD TO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winey House","review":"This album is terrible. Winehouse grabs her attention by being a druggie, not showing up at gigs, and by being just plain weird. Her voice and music are lame. I can't believe people buy her music.

Please don't make her a martre by buying her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it","review":"I just don't get it. I'm a true old school fan. This just doesn't compare at all.

You could probably pick any female at random from the Cabrini Green neighborhood in Chicago, and they would be able to easily match her chops. Her \\"hit\\" single Rehab sounds like filler material from Motown. Not even a single. I guess if you're a British white chick, this qualifies you for all manner of accolades and critical praise.

Highly compressed music falling victim to the \\"louder is better\\" philosophy and breaking up into obvious static in the high frequencies is immediately apparent on anything but lower quality audio systems.

A shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"WTF happened to \\"Addicted\\"?","review":"Everybody knows this record is a 5 star album, but why did they take \\"Addicted\\" off of the US version?

I will still have to press the skip button, which negates the whole point of buying a clean version!

That is how much I liked it.Long version: The content and style Amy has is great. I do have a bias though. I have seen Amy recently in concert on TV. If I have one complaint is the fact that she mumbles through some of the lyrics. That takes away from the music in my opinion. Now that we have that part out of the way, Back to Black is a brilliant body of work.Amy Winehouse is a throw back the people like Etta James and then mix it Johnny Rotten. She is raw and powerful. She may be the most rock n' roll chick I have seen in a long time. I hope she is not all Courtney Love (i.e. self destructive). There is a fire burning inside of her, and I can't wait to see what she has in store for us next. I think boredom will prevent this artist from giving us just another repeat performance.Kevin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Winehouse Rocks the House!","review":"What a great CD, it's so different than other rock/blues music, she adds horns to give you that throw-back sound to earlier jazz and blues music.

Buy this cd, and you'll have a pretty close idea. She became very popular in the early 1990's, mostly because she played a leading role in a cheessy soap opera (the leading man, was, by the way, Erik Estrada - Remember CHIP's?).

Massie gives a moving insight into the life of the tragic figure Tsar Nikolai II, although he does not stray from the history of his reign. Nikolai was a man who did not want to be Tsar from the start, he had not been trained for the role of Tsar by his father Aleksandr II, and this was to be a major factor in his misunderstanding of his role and position in the Russian hierarchy.He was a weak man, dominated by his wife and followed the views and advice of the last minister he saw, proving that he was neither willing nor able for his chosen role.With excellent photographic evidence of the Tsar and Tsarina and family, Massie's account of his life is detailed and easy to read. If you want to find out about the structure of the Russian autocracy and Nikolai's life, then this book is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"An excellent account of the last Tzar's reign and final days, very well documented and written, I highly recommend it, will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantically written as well as an excellent reference","review":"My parents presented Mr. Massie's book to me when I was 17 years old, a high school student who hated history so much.

Although this is not a novelization, it reads like one. The author's own personal insights are fascinating (eg: what if such and such happened?). My only negative comment is that sometimes the author describes events that happen up to a certain point,then backtracks in the next chapter or even paragraph. Therefore, there is some repetition (especially about Rasputin's death). The book is fast paced, entertaining, and very humane. The quotes selected are fascinating, and funny.

Massie jumps out of his skin trying to find excuses for all the blunders the Tsar and the Tsarina are commonly blamed for, from the Japanese war, to the Bloody Sunday, to Rasputin. Yes, they were mere humans, and a loving family, but they had a JOB to do, and that was to rule Russia at one of the most critical point in that country's history, and they mostly failed at it. Unfortunately, the author attempts to convince us that the Romanovs were purely victims of tragic circumstance. While this may be said about many historical figures, this is not what I was interested in when I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book does not do justice to the complexity of this story","review":"Massie represents the one of the worst tendencies in popular historical writing, namely the sacrifice of historical complexity in order to tell a pleasing story. Massie completely romanticizes the Romanov story, without devoting nearly enough attention to the fact that at the same time that the family was enjoying their time together in splendour, everyday Russians were suffering and dying as a result of their policies. The fact that some peasants may have been awed by the czar and his family does not tell the full story of the Romanovs' relationship to their subjects. There is a fascinating and complex story here; sadly, it is one that Massie neglects, choosing to make us feel \\"like we were really there\\" rather than giving any sense of the significance(s) of what he depicts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I appear to be in the minority, but I have found this book really second rate.

There are indications here that she will eventually by a wonderful writer, but I would not qualify this as a wonderful book. It drags, it meanders, and occasionally it restates itself. The reader feels sympathy for the main character at first, but after about 100 pages of \\"pity poor Theodosia,\\" it gets a little old. In the end, instead of sympathy, I felt only a kind of disgusted pity for a very pathetic character. This is really too bad, because in the beginning Seton creates a very strong, interesting character, then begins to whittle away her good qualities. I especially liked the parts about Alexander Hamilton and his conflicts with Aaron Burr. Historically, this is a very interesting novel. Romantically, not so much. There are streaks of a compelling story, but if you want a really good Seton book, read Katherine or Avalon or Devil Water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok book, terrible editing","review":"Kindle should really make an effort to edit the older books.

Though I understand people saying that, I wouldn't say that it's a bad thing. The desperate Heavy Metal of 'World Of Hurt' and the ultra heavy blues of 'Spiritual Void' still are on the OverKill-set today, but the album has other great songs, take 'Dreaming In Columbian' or the sensitive 'Shades Of Grey' for instance.For the Thrash fans there still are songs like 'Weight Of The World', 'Just Like You' or the Sabbath-like 'Ignorance And Innocence' (which are all at the end of the album).'I Hear Black' is maybe not what many fans expected from it, but it's the most varied album they released."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent thrash album!","review":"I used to listen to Overkill-I hear black all the time,I had it on cassette when I was a kid( I was in the 5th or 6th grade at the time) and since then it's always been one of my favorite albums of all time,that and The Killing Kind were my absolute favorite.What more is there to say about Overkill?The have awesome guitar and drum work,the vocalist is great, and I must admit Overkill's older albums are great but if you start from their older stuff and work your way up..you'll notice their sound becomes more focused,which is rare for most artists.I highly recommend this classic thrash metal CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I love Overkill, but my dissapointment is imeasurable.

Millet's prose is fun and engaging, clever and insightful. The characters and storyline are reminiscent of Tom Robbins and Carl Hiaasen, and the protagonist, Dean Ducetes and his midget cohort, Ken, could have found their way from one of Bukowski's works. Sex and religion and the collateral damage that comes from living in LA are prevalent themes of the novel. Ducetes, a hedonist nonpareil, is a self-anointed messiah, while his sister Bucella, pure and nave as they come, is a follower of Christ, devoted like no other. In rapid succession, through a series of narrative vignettes, they and the story's wayward cast of other eclectics undergo a variety of haphazard encounters and off-the-wall scenarios that keep the reader entertained and laughing. Grab yourself a copy and get reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd Give It 4.5 Stars If I Could!","review":"What a fantastic little book!

Now I know that it's doubtful that this \\"under the radar\\" gem would ever make it to the silver screen, but I couldn't help imagining either Phillip Seymour Hoffman or Jack Black as the vulgar, yet magnetic personality of Dean Descetes.

Some of the descriptions I felt were too long, but the was very well written. I can't wait to start the next book in the series. Anyone who has enjoyed the previous books in the series should read this one. Be aware that it has no chapter demarcations. I notice that the next book in the series does, so that is a nice change of enhancement. I won't bore you with a plot summary because other reviewers are fond of including that. I still hope that in the future books Flinx is allowed to find a life beyond the constant searching for his origins. It's almost sad \\"watching\\" him go through everything he experiences because hardly any of it is happy. However, that's part of what makes it such an engaging read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Pip & Flinx Book","review":"It's long-awaited, and it brings the agendas of the wide question of \\"what is Flinx here for?\\" another step forward.Unfortunately, it feels like something of a place-holder. It resolves very little, as far as the characters are concerned. Flinx figures out a _little_ more about his family, but that hardly seems to justify a whole novel. He explores an interesting planet, but it seems unlikely that the planet will be of continuing interest. The plants of Midworld apparently get in touch with some other aliens, but none of the characters in the book are aware of this in the slightest; in effect, the _real_ story in the story mostly takes place off-stage.It would have been nice to have some tension added in involving Flinx being reacquainted with some of the Church characters that we actually _liked_, as opposed to just the dysfunctional family members that are rather unlikable.Hopefully the next episode will come along sooner, and be a bit more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best in the series, but gives good insight on Flinx","review":"An earlier review complained about how Flinx treated someone. I didn't care for it either. However, I think the book showed adaquately how much Flinx disliked doing what he did. Overall the book was ok, though not the best in the series. I dislike how Foster did the majorly destructive computer trap though. To do something like that, the person who designed those computers would have to have been a complete moron...I also felt that it was odd how Flinx went back to earth to get info, after he already failed the first time going there (and not finding much)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reunion: A Pip & Flinx Novel","review":"I am a Pip & Flinx fan from way, way back. I have all the other novels in the series and do enjoy rereading them periodically. I eagerly awaited my receipt of this one. I consider this to be a readable novel (I finished the whole thing), but it was not as good as I had hoped. I have noticed that this series is very mixed as far as quality is concerned. I think the idea has a great deal of potential that has never quite materialized. As I said, I enjoyed this novel, but it could have been much better. I was left feeling vaguely unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I've been reading Foster's books for many years, and enjoy following the adventures of Flinx and Pip. But I almost didn't finish \\"Reunion\\". I was very disappointed with the novel. It seemed like a short story padded with a bunch of ten-dollar words. Foster totally lost me when he used the word \\"yclept\\". It was so out of place in the context. Lyrical word-pictures when the hero is trying to save his rear gave me mental whiplash. I did finish it, but was left feeling that the story really hadn't advanced much. This was just a way-stop at a motel from hell when I was expecting a nice hotel, ...Hope the next one is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rewrite of the Tar-Ayim Krang with a few new characters","review":"Definitely the most disappointing Flinx book--I felt like I'd read almost everything that had happened before, witht he sole exception of Flinx's new AAnn encounter. One of those novels you want to toss against the wall in frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Greatly","review":"This book is by far the worst of the P&F series. I have all the other books and have read and reread them multiple times. Most of the book merely rehashes parts and themes from his other books and never manages to create any level of storytelling. The whole story is unsatisfying, especially the conclusion. I think that ADF has hit the wall with regard to the Commonwealth theme bacause all his recent books are very unimpressive. The sophistication and compelling plots are not present in the newer books. I highly recommend all his other P&F but stay as far as you can from this latest installment. I am seriously thinking of donating this book to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Standards","review":"I have read all of Foster's past Flinx novels, sometimes twice, and most of his other science fiction and fantasy offerings. This novel is not up to any of his other books, not even close, as if most of it were ghostwritten by someone who had only read his Mid-World, and proceeded from there to come up with 326 pages of sequel. I could not finish it. The plot is comic book, and the verse pallid. A Theasaurus seemed to be the author's major tool, as a few quotes illustrate sadly: (Page 80) \\"Or comets, or a visitation from a perambulating nebula. Decorative simulacra of anyuthing in the universe were available for the asking.\\" (Page 92)\\"Unmonitored glowing consoles beckoned, efficient instrumentation silently declaimed reams of unperused information, and chairs reposed unoccupied.\\" If anything, I would rent it from a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This book is a complete waste of time. I'd hoped that the author would finally allow Flinx to discover the secrets of his background and his creation. Instead, the book can be summarized by the following: Flinx breaks into Computer Database on Earth to learn about his past; he finds nothing of interest except one file that mysteriously disappears; he follows the trail of the file; finds his sister in a mysterious alien vessel; loses his sister and the file he seeks; learns nothing of interest. What a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best in the series","review":"I've read all the books in this series, I'm used to Flinx loseing all of his abilities at the start of the next book. This book has plot holes and inconsistancies big enough to fly the Teacher through. It just seems thrown together quickly and not very well thought out. If your die hard Flinx fan like me you'll try to ignore the gapping holes and enjoy the story, if your not I wouldn't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foster phoned it in","review":"Complete disappointing - I'll just give the two biggest reasons.First, it seems that Mr. Foster just discovered the thesaurus, and wanted to impress us all with lots of obscure words for ordinary events and feelings. It doesn't come across as Flinx maturing and gaining wisdom, but rather as just poor writing.Secondly, the ending is rushed and unsatisfying; it is nothing but a deus ex machina ploy. In fact, it's two of them, and both have been used by Foster in previous Flinx books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flinx in a Flux","review":"I have been enthused and enthralled by the Flinx series since the beginning decades ago. However, this is by far the worst of the series. Flinx in an unfriedly environment is trite by this time.

Most of the rest of this album is also very good but doesn't stand out the way \\"Wednesday's Child\\" does.

I chose this OTC brand because OTC is known to be top of the line equipment. The 1725 is a much better design than the old square tube models. Yes, it is wide enough for full size cars. Yes, it stays in place much better than the old square tube models. It is heavy and very strong. With proper care it should last for many years. If you do a lot of transmission work like I do, consider the OTC 1725 model. I'm glad I passed up the less expensive engine supports. I guess those are fine for occasional transmission work? As for the price, it's about the same as you would pay for a good 1/2\\" drive impact wrench. The OTC 1725 is a piece of equipment that will do great in your shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, looks nice, minor complaints","review":"I really like my capo, the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic, and it works as it should. However, I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. For example, I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer, and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded, after all). The spring could definitely be tighter...I do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. Also, the design is fairly nice, but it's mostly aesthetic...it's not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.Don't get me wrong, this is a rather good product, and it's priced about right. It just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent capo for acoustic guitar","review":"Kyser capo is a very good functional capo for all your acoustic guitars.

It seems to put the right amount of tension on the strings so that it gives a nice, clear sound when playing but not so tight that it tugs the strings and alters your tuning. I haven't had any trouble with going from using the capo right back to playing without it without having to re-tune.I thought that the pink would be a little bit darker than it is (it is a baby pink color) but it still looked very nice.It has solid construction and I don't think I will have to replace it for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, simple operation","review":"There's not too much to say about this Kyser Capo.

I looked at capos my friends have and I checked out several sources on line and found the Kyser to be the best and least complicated. It just clips on - no screws, straps, bands, bolts or anything.

It's also the nicest looking capo out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick on and off","review":"This capo is simple to use.

It's perfect for just about any guitar (I've used it on 4 different guitars) and is easy to use. No screws, no big moving process. I've used it almost every day since I got it over a month ago, and it's shown no signs of flukes yet. As far as sound, there were no \\"buzzing\\" or any unwanted noises caused by the capo. The back of the neck remains unmarked thanks to the bottom cushion.

This may be the last kyser I will buy. They will work for some people but I use mine a lot and with taking the capo on and off, the springs wear out.Also, they mess the tuning up on my guitars. I am moving to G7's for acoustic and Planet Waves for electric."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, gets the job done","review":"Capos with thumb screws, or the strap on capos are always a pain to use.This Kyser capo is simple and works great.

I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and Durable","review":"One of the first purchases I made to go with my new classical guitar was the Kyser capo. Like all capos, it provides a solid bar across the full set of strings. I found the Kyser capo very easy to use, and very solid once it was put into place. It holds down the strings fully without any buzz or issue.I have had my Kyser for several months and have not had any problems with it at all. I will update my review if I end up someday having issues with it, but it seems to be quite durable and solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Capo I've Ever Used!","review":"I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one. It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine. It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Capo","review":"This capo is of excellent quality for a very reasonable price and I have been using it a lot for months.

This picture should be changed so that no other people are fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"Unsatisfied. I may as well put a bench vise on my guitar neck. It's huge, not easy to store because of its odd shape and not something I'm comfortable putting on the guitar I have invested good money and time into. I read this advice in a review and now I leave this advice in a review -- buy a Shubb. They are worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This capo is almost perfect","review":"It's a little hard to open, but that could be a good thing because it'll be sure to hold down the strings. Also, this capo is just a little short. It barely holds down the sixth string on my classic guitar. Sometimes, if I'm not carefull I can actually miss the last string and have to regrasp. So, it's definitely not a quickly moveable capo, until I master it.Other than that, the rubber guards do not stratch my guitar neck and aren't hard on my strings. Great capo. I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"i am new to playing guitar and didnt know what was a good capo. but i made the right choice great product, works very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I have two","review":"I already had one of these capos and decided to buy another for my other guitar.

Kaiser Capos work well and I enjoy using them.If you are looking for other options, check out the Paige, G7 and Shubb. The benefit of the Kaiser is that it clips on to the headstock when not in use and it has a spring that automatically clips on.Shubbs are also well regarded. They clip on when you lock them.One of the G7 is really neat as it clips on very easily. I really like it, but it is expensive. The Nashville version seems to be more like the Kaiser.The Paige a very different design and I really like it. I recommend that you consider that option as you can leave it on the guitar and slide it onto the headstock when not in use. Some folks don't like them with guitar stands that hang the guitar by the neck, but I find you just have to be careful in how you place the guitar in the stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This capo is not only sturdy, but the pink gives your guitar a little bit of flair.

Quality seems top notch, design is simple and effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks and Works Great","review":"I'm a beginner guitar player, so I was looking for a decent capo at a decent price so I could add some more songs to my repertoire. Before this one, I had ordered the Kyser Pro/Am 6-String Guitar Capo. The reviews on it were good and they said it was easy to take on and off, but I hated it. It was really difficult for me to get a good sound on it, it just wouldn't tighten enough.This one is great though. It's easy to put on and take off, and holds all six strings down without a hitch, delivering a nice even tone, without the \\"buzz\\" you sometimes get when the strings aren't held down hard enough. You can just leave it on the head when you're not using it, and then just clip it on when you want to play with it on.It also looks sleek and classy, with the all black design, which is always a plus for me. All in all, a great buy and I highly recommend it for anyone beginning to play guitar or unhappy with their current capo."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Very nice quality.

Decent price and good sturdy spring mechanism. Seems like it will last a good while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, most of the time","review":"I initially bought this capo because of the good reputation Kyser had for making them. I have a friend who but one of their capos about 4 years ago and it still clamps onto his guitar's fretboard with an authority. I went ahead and but this one here. I've had it for a few months but imediately after using it I noticed that it takes a more careful positioning to get it to clamp down on all the strings and not get a buzz. This one seems to be made to a more lower quality standard than its earlier counter-part. However I wont give it less than four stars because it does do its job, just takes about ten seconds more time to set up.

Maybe it's a form of species self-loathing -- it would also explain why people would want to attribute other monumental achievements (language, the pyramids, etc.) to alien intervention.Like George Carlin says - Napalm & Silly Putty.

I found it confusing and not very well presented as science, but as an attempt to convince not prove. Mr. Kaysing did not hit the nail on the head. The most credible part may have been that the ground underneath the space vehicle was undisturbed, not showing evidence that it had landed, but was placed there. His notion was that the vehicle would have made more of an impression in the soil at the landing site.

While it's certainly true that none of the other songs are as good as the title song, there a number of very good songs on this disc. Those other 8 songs are divided between ballads and rockers. The ballads are OK, but I don't have any especially strong liking of them. But I am glad that none of them are the awful stomach turning kind of stuff that some other groups have put on their albums. So the ballads are OK, but not much more than that. But those other rock songs are all quite good. This CD shows that Survivor was not just a one hit wonder. There is power and energy in these songs.

I don't think so. This is heavy all the way through. I don't know why every song on this record wasn't a hit, because they are all very good and catchy songs.

This song sports a similarity to Janet Jackson's 'Alright' in it's rhythm section and so this song sounds like it could have been another production from Jam & Lewis. 3 Boyz from Newark do the honors in remixing this into something that is a cross between Hip-Hop and Dance. You won't find the 4 to the floor House beat here. If anythng, the remixes expound on the original feel of the song.

The book of Proverbs teaches us in verse 17 of chapter 27, \\"As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.\\" This could not be more true of what transpires between these two men as they face their mortality together.

Morgan Freeman is a down-home mechanic, very intelligent and very family oriented. They are placed in a hospital room together and they learn to like and trust one another.

It managed to bring a very difficult phase in the two main characters and their families lives to the silverscreen in a very positive manner - and shed a positive spin on the inevitability of growing old and eventually dying.

From the first baritone note of Morgans character you know you are in the presence of a man you like and care about. What other actor could bring so much to his character as Jack Nicholson, whom Morgan Freeman has to ask his loyal assistance(Sean Hayes), is he crazy? Of course, he is, he's Jack, and we love him. Rob Reiner pulls the strings on this serious film with adequate doses of laughs and creates a moving piece. You might know where it's headed but you will find yourself pulled in and unwilling to turn away.

I know I'm going to get clobbered for this review but......It's not like I have anything against THE BUCKET LIST premise but really, what is so exciting about these characters jumping out of a plane, racing cars and being digitally imposed into the world's most famous landmarks ? Obviously Nicholson and Freeman have great chemistry but it's not like this movie is a lot more exciting than showing them playing cards or something. I love Freeman's narrations but: a) I don't think the Nicholson character earns his and b) enough is enough of them.On my personal bucket list, missing this DVD will be item #1."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Bucket List","review":"Great video of an exceptional movie.

Having now seen the film I ask the film's critics what they have been smoking. Nicholson and Freeman riff off each other like they've been working together for years. What were they expecting, \\"Hamlet\\"?! Nicholson and Freeman are in their golden years and this is the perfect vehicle for the both them. Considering that the film deals with cancer patients it could have been maudlin and saccharine. \\"The Bucket List\\" earns every ounce of emotion and tears it engenders from the audience.

First, the movie marketed itself as a comedy, yet clearly was not. The movie was dramatic and philosophical but not particularly deep. And this is my second point - the movie tried too hard to be philosophical and deep, yet didn't cover any new ground in the arena of death and life. There wasn't anything new here that I haven't already seen in other films. The movie was not even entertaining, it was laborious and self important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my Life!","review":"I love \\"The Bucket List\\". It has changed the course of my life.

It has something for everyone.'The Bucket List' features Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). These two great actors do not disappoint. Both Cole (a wealthy curmudgeon) and Chambers (a family oriented auto mechanic) have terminal cancer and are given but a few months to live.This unlikely pair become great friends throughout the movie. They begin developing a 'bucket list' - items that they have always wanted to do before their deaths. The roster of 'to do' items includes such things as skydiving, driving race cars, visiting the Great Wall of China, laughing until you cry, and viewing something truly majestic.Due to Cole's unlimited financial resources, they are able to fund their dreams. They also come to realize what things are really important.There are many funny parts along with the somber ones. I think it is well worth watching. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the critics said.","review":"I went to see the movie and can't wait for the DVD. I noticed critics gave it a C.

However, Rob Reiner's directorial skill deserves something more substantial than this manipulative piece of schmaltz. The film's selling point is the first-time pairing of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately, the Oscar winners display little chemistry in their scenes together. Nicholson overacts in desperation to keep the shuck and jive afloat, but \\"The Bucket List\\" is dead on arrival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not spectacular","review":"Not as good as expected with these 2 great actors.

Eminem is good at putting things together and riming and stuff. But, seriously he isn't that great some good rappers put more depth in there music.

Eminem took rap to a whole new level with the Slim Shady LP and earned himself millions of fans as well as haters. It definately doesnt match Marshall Mathers Lp or Eminem Show but it is much better than Encore and this was only his first album. Every song has something different to offer and each is worth a listen. The best songs are My Name Is, Guilty Conscience, Brain Damage, 97 Bonnie & Clyde, Role Model, My Fault, Bad Meets Evil & Still Don't Give... Anybody new to Eminem should start here and see why he is as famous as he is. While this album is far from perfect... it is still better than a lot of junk out there and is easily worthy of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Em. you got a platinum album kid.","review":"This LP is tight. He isn't trying to come hard core like so many other \\"gansta\\" rappers. He is coming at a different angle and rapping about his life, and just adding some really psychotic twists to it. There's only one song that isn't onpar with the rest, but that's better than most other artists' best single. Some of the beats can be tired, allthough they are heavy in bass.. but the lyrics is what get's ya...

Now the bad Meets Evil song is sick, which I feel is the best one on here, and Royce da 5'9 does a great job of holding his own. But then there are crap songs, like My Name is, which is pure garbage. That is sad, since Dr Dre is behind the productions, which should be tight for the mastermind of beats for NWA, but man, what the hell were they thinking with that song. Eminem is great, not the greatest lyricist, but great. To bad I can't say the same about the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I generally do not like rap very much, but this cd is awesome.

Well, people, there are indeed classic hip hop albums...Is Slim Shady a classic... no.Is it good... yes.Outstanding hip hop should shine on both the lyrical and rhythmic aspects. Eminem's lyrical style is original and contains an interesting syncopation. Lyrical style should also include depth through simile, metaphor, analogy and other tools. Eminem tells a good story.

We can't sell Mr. Mathers short now can we? 2 stars for effort. I bought this CD to check out the new breakthrough in white boy rap and found all this kid was doing is trying to pull off what the brothers do better. This CD is full of shock value, i.e. my statements are ignorant and their only purpose is to slap you in the face. Well... Slim is certianly not the first person to attempt this. Secondly he seems to be trying a little to hard to push his \\"I don't give a...\\" image, so much that he comes off as a womanizer and a bigot. I would have more respect for eminem if this record was the record company's idea and he's just playing along to bank, I mean we know their is a world of twisted kids out there spending their summer job money on this and taking it to heart, and that is the truely sad part.

Do you really want your money going to someone who has such disrespect for women?Additionally, please consider the fact that Eminem is a white boy from Detroit. Detroit is about 95% African American, with a strong rap scene, yet the person who makes it big is Eminem? Let's explore the racial politics here. Do you think that if a black man rapped the same lyrics that Eminem does, that he would receive the same treatment? I certainly don't.

It's Em's best in my opinion. The songs are a bit less poppy then on his latest album and that's why I like it. Rock bottom is a great song about being poor. I'm shady is pretty funny.

JUst buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem is the best rapper ever!!!","review":"Eminem is quite simply, in my humble opinion, the best rapper ever. Talk about sarcasm and biting social commentary--Slim Shady is sharp! Instead of focusing on the \\"violent\\" nature of the lyrics, critics better recognize Eminem's mind-bogglingly vast wit :) I love every single song on the album, by far the best album I've heard in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"outrageous orriginal style","review":"Mr. shady creates a vivid \\"mental movie\\"as you listen to each song.

There are really only two good songs on it, \\"My Name Is\\" and \\"Guilty Conscience\\". The rest of the songs are alright, but not good enough. Also, some of the lyrics are very disturbing, like in 97 Bonnie and CLyde were he talks about taking his son out to throw his murdered mom into a lake."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD AIN'T THAT BAD Y'ALL PEOPLE ARE SAYIN'","review":"There's a couple of good joints on it and you can listen to this a couple of times before you get bored.

RATHER BY INFINITE BY EMINEM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim's so crazy...","review":"Eminem is my favorite rapper of all time. His music and his sound are very different from other rapppers. This album is crazy, funny and shady. My favorite tracks are: \\"My Name Is\\" \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"I'm Shady\\" and \\"If I Had\\". If you like crazy, and twisted fun then you should buy this album. His second album (\\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\"), is also a good and crazy album. To the people get offened or don't like Eminem or his harsh lyrics, here's my advice to you: DON'T BUY HIS ALBUMS!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Name Is.... (Slim Shady)!","review":"Anyone with a little bit of sense would know when Eminem is joking or not... This CD is hilarious, and one of the best CDs I have. And is a lot better than it's second LP-The Marshall MathersLP... Is great when a rapper have something to say, and don't just sing about b**ches and \\"thongs\\" or whatever... Eminem may have a LOT of enemies but for me he's the greattest rapper since 2Pac. So you may be wondering why didn't I gave the five stars for it... The reason is that I think that a CD to be perfect must have more than 20 execelent songs and at least 25 songs to be perfect. Anyway if you are wating to buy a execelent CD of a great rapper... There you have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is how it is","review":"\`this is how it is .

Luckily, I didn't have to pay money for my copy, but at least I won't have any problems unloading it on anyone, judging on how many positive reviews it's getting.I really wish I could say this is a good CD because I liked the music, but I felt the lyrics were so violent and misogynist that it was making me sick. He describes getting rid of his ex-wife's dead body. I was told this is supposed to be funny.Sure, make your verse funny. But don't joke about beating the snot out of women and pass that off as humour.I am by no means a prude (I own and regularly listen to CDs by Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, and KoRn), but this CD really crosses the line."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"The subject matter is trash, plain and simple. MTV should have better ethics than to promote this indecent album.

Eminem, do me a favor and write with class."},{"rating":"1","title":"WACK!!! wasn't alloud to give it a zero ya'll","review":"This cd is annoying, \\" my name is \\" has to be the most annoying song of all time in the rap game.

However I am rating the dirty version with one star because the subject matter is VERY offensive. I buy lots of cds that have dirty language on them, the dirty language doesn't bother me on this particular cd. The subject matter is what bothers me. He's rapping about having indcent liberties with a minor. He's rapping about killing his' little girl's mom and then dumbing her in the river. He's rapping about drugs, murder everything thats against the law hes rapping about. It does have a great beat, it does have artist style, but the subject matter is where I draw the line. If I had a teenager under 18, I would only allow them to buy the clean version. The clean version has a tacky censoring job, (full of scratch sounds instead of curse words), but this dirty version is really where I draw the line. Everybody has to draw the line somewhere. Everything isn't \\"ok\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"M y name is down the drain","review":"This is the worst cd i have ever listened too. I have two words to summarize it all. It is pooh pooh. The lyrics are great but the music sucks. He sounds like a martian when he sings. This cd is just the poopiest cd i have ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"MTV gives us another piece of trash","review":"My roommate bought this cd after hearing the annoyingly stupid \\"My Name Is\\" on MTV. The only thing I can say is I'm glad he doesn't listen to it when I'm around...because I'd probably throw his stereo through the window. I want to know where MTV finds people like Eminem. So what if Dre is his producer? That doesn't mean Eminem can rap. This \\"90's Vanilla Ice\\" is all about killing people, doing drugs, and all sorts of other crap. If you think that stuff is cool, go ahead buy the cd. After you finish listening to this cd full of bullsh*t and its many \\"messages,\\" be sure to send me a letter telling me what prison you're locked away in so that I can come visit you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it.","review":"Innovative, thorough, deep. Not exactly every single song here is a bumper, but most of them are. All of the songs have messages worth figuring out. Here, Slim is hilarious, and then serious on some tracks. It all makes for a classic mix.His flow isn't corny, like the bland white rappers before him. His voice is intense and gripping, like an actual rapper. And he's used that to build his career. Just buy it already, but you probably already own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD RROOCCKKSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Eminem is the best rapper of all time. He may have a different style but its great. I hope all the rest of his CD's are as good as this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not living up to his potential....","review":"As good as this album is, he is losing his original sound. Maybe its his hook-up with Dre, but his first album 'Infinite' was great lyrically brilliant. And this album is very good, but not the best Eminem can do. The best tracks are 'I Just Don't Giva A F**K', and 'Still Don't Give A F**k'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of the songs on this cd are good.","review":"The songs are good and there are alot to chosse from. This isn't one of those cd's that only has one or two good songs this cd has about 10! The songs are also funny.

If he doesn't forget where he came from, he will live forever. \\"Rock Bottom\\" is one of the best songs expressing the feeling of the \\"low class\\" culture. He reminds me of Brotha Lynch, or Bushwick Bill, but with smoother, quicker rhymes."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing album for a talent rapper","review":"As an Eminem fan and fan of rap in general, this was quite a disappointment. (Perhaps, because I bought it after the other two and had high expectations.) This cd lacked any real showcase for his talent. The beats are somewhat deccent but the juvenille ryhmes are pretty pathetic compared to him today. Although, the overall album was pretty annoying and- for lack of a better word- crap, a few songs I liked, such as Rock Bottom and Still Don't Give A F**ck (which were some of the better tracks and are reminesent of the insightful and careless views found on Eminem's other two albums.) Bottom line: Fair Effort for a 1st run but definately not worth the money, unless your a fan who wants to own everything his ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"To all you haters who gave this album 1 or 2 stars.","review":"To all y'all haters out there.

I would give this cd a Grammy and on a scale from 1 to 10 it would be a 10. Eminem is plain rap!! His Lyrics are absolutely Phinominal! I wounder why he didn't start earlier in his life.

Eminem can say what he wants, but he crossed the line on the song where he sings about what he'd do to his wife and child. Is it even legal for him to say those things? I thought not. His lyrics in that particular song are definitely threats, and if any regular person was caught on the street speaking that kind of [junk] they'd be thrown in jail for assault.

Forgive me for bringing race into the picture, but I beleive that much of eminem's popularity is due to the racist attitudes of white america. As usual, the true innovaters of the music are given less credit than the white boys that rip them off. Overall, this album is as rediculously melodramatic as a 1920's theater soap opera.

M is seems like a sick little geek that would torture animals and wet the bed.also -- there are only 2 cuts where he keeps the jokes up enough to be entertaining. he's lucky that there aint that much competition in his arena right now. there are a lot of funny m.c.s out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHITE MEN CAN JUMP BUT THEY SURE CANT RAP","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst cd ever.

Eminem is everywhere now and I dont see why. Save your $ everyone...Get a cd that is NOT a disgrace to rap or hip hop.(i.e. 2pac, Wutang, etc.) Dont buy this \\"cd\\" cuz u think its funny.

Skye Dennison, school psychologist, uses her brains, humor, and ultimately, great courage to solve the resulting murder, a crime her own brother has been accused of committing. The same characteristics enable Skye to help the kids she works with and put the administrator from hell she works for in his place. Both Skye's personal and professional lives are complicated by the fact that Scumble River is her hometown where she has roots, relatives, and memories. I loved seeing Skye disprove the old saying that you can't go home again and was chewing my cuticles until she solved the murder. What's more, this book made me think twice about e-mailing my high school boyfriend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Honey of a Debut Mystery","review":"I have read several mystery series and always like to start with the first--believe me, some of them have been really bad, but as the author matured his (or her!) writing improved. This first novel by Denise Swanson is written like a seasoned author. Skye Dennison is a fun, intelligent, and very real character. I am from a small midwestern town and Ms. Swanson has captured the essence of living there, from jello salads to magenta polyester pansuits to employment nepotism. All of this humor and description is cleverly woven into a mystery involving, of course, a member of her family since she is related to almost everyone in town. I look forward to Ms. Swanson's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me up all night reading!","review":"Frankly, I'm glad that Ms. Swanson has only written two books, or else I wouldn't get any sleep! I read both books in two days, and stayed up until about 2am both nights to finish them.FANTASTIC!!! I loved them both, (Murder of a Sweet Old Lady was a hoot, as well.)I am addicted to Scumble River, and can't wait to read more. I live close to the area where the fictional Scumble River is, and really enjoyed her extremely accurate view of the people and area.The things that I liked best about the books, aside from the great characters, and sayings was that it was about very realistic people. It shows that you don't need an exotic location or famous people to have a great mystery.I am looking forward to the next book!Great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite","review":"Half way through this book I decided I could care less about any of the characters. Badly written.

When I read mysteries I never try to guess who did it. I prefer to just enjoy the unfolding story. However, I figured out who did it without even trying. The story wasn't very original and the motive behind the murder was so (for lack of a better word) lame.I may give Ms. Swanson another try just to see if she has improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read with believable characters","review":"School psychologist Skye Denison reluctantly moves back home after losing her job and her fiance. But the hometown folks haven't forgiven her for telling them off 12 years earlier, and the police chief is determined to prove her brother Vince murdered a vicious former resident.Mostly believable characters make a pleasant change in this fast read. Skye isn't a wuss, she just gets out-maneuvered. The obligatory romance did not ring true, and the stereotypical religious-type character was unbelievable as well as annoying. And I'm not sure the evidence was there to figure out whodunit. But the story kept me reading and I found the ending believable. The title was very appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adios Amigos/Joshua the black rider","review":"Be warned...SHODDY transfers of these Fred Williamson classics.

It is nice to look at, but the content is very biased and non-scholarly. The author oftens voices his opinion about what is 'acceptable' or 'attractive', and questions people who use body modification to \\"take things too far\\". There IS a wide variety of body modification discussed and shown in the book, however, the author often repeats things he had previously stated in the book, making for very little content of value. Overall, not one of the better books on the subject.

It's still in great shape.Many presses I've used have broken, some are a pain in the neck to clean, some don't press cookies neatly. Except for a slight bit of work cleaning one particular area of this press, this press is easy to clean. It takes me five to seven minutes to clean and dry thoroughly after use, and that's counting all those nooks and crannies.This one is easy to use. My daughter has used this press effectively since I've bought it, and she was in elementary school back then. Some presses require a lot of maneuvering to get presentable cookies!

I have looked for about 2 years for a replacement and actually bought 2 other presses that didn't work. I have been looking for a press ever since. This year I was asked by at least 3 people why I didn't make my wonderful wreath cookies. I explained that I didn't have a press. I went on line to find this one.

The result is a book that wanders quite aimlessly at times, spouting off tidbits of information at irregular intervals."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy","review":"Avoid this book.

You will definately dance to these. Bad Girl is a great ballad from the very underrated Erotica Album. It talks about a girl who get's drunk by six and invites all types of guys to her place not even knowing them. She is obviously not that happy with her life and she does these stupid things. It is actually a metaphor Madonna uses to describe her life. Her mother died when she was almost six and after that she has been a \\"bad girl\\". Brilliant video with Christopher Walken playing her guardian angel. I highly recommend this maxi CD. I like the way the Bad Girl extended version opens up it's just great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BAD GIRL IS GOOD, FEVER SIZZLES!","review":"This is a really good song, the production could've used a little more polishing, but nonetheless worth your money. It was not really a mainstream pop hit, but if you like music about topical issues, this is for you. Lyric sample: \\"Bad Girl, drunk by six. Kissing Someone Else's lips. Smoked too many cigarettes today. I'm not happy when I act this way\\". The second track \\"Fever\\" is one of the sexiest Madonna songs ever!

If you love the Prunes, you MUST own this CD! Once you get it, darken the room, light some candles and incense, and enjoy the trip!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mass in F minor","review":"The Mass in F minor is the best Electric Prunes album. Although, the majority of listeners usually consider their other music to be better I find that the complete opposite. I do think there are many traks on the other pieces that are very good and I even own all of their other cd's, but I find that best listening comes from this piece. I don't the Mass to be cheesy per se and I dont think there is such a thing as \\"outdated\\" music. I listen to every music type, I'm a musician, and, depending on what I'm listening to, I can always connect in some way or another to a good piece of music made and performed by other gifted musicians.

I have to agree with a previous reviewer - this is the MOST acid soaked album of all time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who remastered this?","review":"With all due respect to the previous reviewer, I must say that the remastering on this CD is appallingly bad. That's because I have heard the previous CD of this album, which was on the German Line label. This CD sounds like a Dolby-encoded tape being played back without being decoded, except not as bright sounding. There's lots of hiss, though, and the sound is very compressed. No, somebody goofed with this one, folks. The definitive version of \\"Mass In F Minor\\" has yet to be released. But if you can find the now-deleted Line CD, buy it instead. Even with its flaws, it's still better than the latest version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a totally original idea.....","review":"The \\"mass\\" album concept was actually done first (and better) by an Italian band called I Barritas in 1966. Although the song titles are very similar, the music is totally different. I Barritas \\"La Messa Dei Giovani\\" is a great psych pop beat album and is worth searching out. I'd skip this one and try something more consistent by the Prunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indulgent pap","review":"This is not the Electric Prunes. This is David Axelrod's project and it reeks of late 60s navel-gazing and self-indulgence.

Ms. Strauss, this sounds like a bad B SF movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Back and Read This","review":"Strauss' The Arm of the Stone starts off a little rocky. I had a difficult time trying to figure out who all of characters were -- most had so little character. And the back of the book was rather lame -- the sort of writing that I despise (see the \\"product description.\\")But I was glad that I kept reading. The characters I couldn't follow smoothed out or left and she set the stage for a brilliant piece of fiction that relates to many facets of life and religion.Strauss keeps you reading by laying out the story with perfect clarity. You know how it's going to turn out. And then she adds a new layer that changes your perceptions on everything. And she keeps that process up all the way through the end.If you are to read only one book this year, don't read this one. But if you like to read and you love unique writing with fresh twists, then pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enjoyable airplane book that tries, but alas, falls short","review":"I picked this book up shortly before boarding a trans-US flight, not expecting much except that it would help pass the 5+ hours trapped in coach. Suffice it to say that I wasn't disappointed, but neither was I especially enthralled. Ms. Strauss has created an interesting world, with some innovative ideas, but never really goes anywhere with it. I, personally, did not find the characters all that interesting, nor did I notice any development, despite the fact that the story takes place over the span of several years. In the end, this was just another, decent fantasy work. A good way to pass the time, but not something worth reading twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly original with lots of intrigue","review":"And I don't give out big numbers casually.Ms. Strauss has created a new and different kind of world, in which characters are more concerned with a better plow than a better sword. In \\"Arm...\\" draconian Luddite laws keep the people trapped in a perpetual middle ages, enforced by overwhelming mind power.How the hero resolves to tear down the oppressive government from within, then becomes seduced into accepting its ideals, is the meat of the story. \\"Arm of the Stone has a great deal of intrigue and treachery, with a bit of forbidden love tossed in for extra spice.This is a terrific novel.

The photos are grainy and indistinct, the layout is haphazard, and the techniques often deal with unrealistic stuations (unless you really think that, for example, you might be accosted by three people who will simultaneously grab your right lapel).

It is poorly organized; text and photos are mismatched and incomplete. The production quality is really terrible; everyone in the photos is wearing black, the camera is 20 feet back, and the halftone screens in the photos are extremely coarse making it impossible to see any detail. The text descriptions of the katas are disorganized and inadequate; filled with grammatical errors and mispellings. The katas themselves are preposterous set-ups showing Prof. Soto overwhelming 3 and 4 pistol wielding attackers at once. A great deal of content is dedicated to Prof. Soto's celebrity shots. For the asking price, one might expect more than this thin paperback provides. I am not sure what Prof. Soto set out to accomplish in this book other than a sideshow of self aggandizement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 'learn by book' disappointment","review":"I was fortunate enough to have been able to read this book without having to purchase it.

Unfortunately, 'Atemi Cobra-Jujitsu: Martial Arts for the Millennium Years to Come in the New Generation' falls into the category of books that fail in their attempt to actually teach martial arts in a practical manner. The photographic quality is of below average quality as are many of the descriptions of the techniques shown.

He gives practical insight of how to get started, describes aptly the promised joy we experience as a result of our giving, and wraps it all in the allegory of finding a buried treasure.The kindgom is often out of our sights in our daily lives -- absent from our calendar, our schedule, our checkbook, and our goal list. Alcorn makes the case for changing that, and making God's kingdom a priority in our lives. It is the true treasure, after all, and during this time of economic difficulty, it is also the path to financial freedom.This is a quick read, but if we follow Alcorn's advice, the results are lasting.

Alcorn challenges our cultural obsession with stuff through his call to \\"send it on ahead.\\" He argues that the prospect of reward is not wrong in and of itself, it is simply that we often aim for earthly rather than eternal rewards. We are focused on having it all here instead of using the resources God entrusts to us for others now and receiving eternal rewards later. This book provides a great argument against the prosperity gospel, especially in Alcorn's phrase, \\"God prospers me not to raise my standard of living, but to raise my standard of giving.\\" This book is simply the application of logic to the truth of the Bible. If God is real and the Bible is true, and the Bible teaches that eternal life is real, then it only makes sense to live for that which will produce the most eternal good and bring the most glory to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"not made for men","review":"this has the smallest seat cut out ever! if you are a male its impossible to sit down and go number 1 you will end up going on the floor. its nice and sturdy and came already assembled and you can adjust the legs to fit over your toilet but like i said it only works for women or going number 2. i like that it came pre assembled but we end up not using it because my dad couldnt use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the pads?????","review":"I don't know if you were supposed to get pads or not,because I never received any.

While it is NOT a text book, it was very effective in helping to look into the mind of a child. I read it again when my daughter was young and it proved to be essential in helping get through some difficult situations. I purchased it again as a gift for some friends who are parents of an almost three year old. I know they'll get some help from it as well. Essentially, it helps to understand that small children's minds don't work as ours do, and what solutions can be most effective during times of night terrors and such.

There's no other material in the world of music quite like Dome's; their sound is remarkably creative, always highly intelligent, and most definitely unique. This album is very good, although I must say that 1 + 2 are slightly superior--a bit more substantive, more varied, more multidimensional. That is not to say, however, that this album is lacking, for it isn't.On 3, the first album here, standouts include \\"Jasz,\\" \\"Ar-gu,\\" \\"Ba-dr,\\" \\"D-D-Bo,\\" and \\"Roos-An.\\" \\"D-D-Bo\\" is an especially interesting tune, being sort of an experimental jazz piece--very playful, yet highly intelligent. On 4 (Will You Speak This Work), \\"To Speak\\" is a masterful piece. \\"To Duck To Dive\\" and \\"Atlas\\" are also very fine works, unique in their sound, well work many listens.This album, by the way, is definitely a basement blaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"I'm a big Wire fan. And I enjoy some of Lewis and Gilbert's work. But this is the emporer's new clothes.Dome 1 & 2 were not great, but not nearly this bad. So many of the sounds on 3 and 4 are imitative of records that The Residents had been making. Other than cobbing sounds from that band, much of the rest of what's here is STREEEEETCHED out as if to quickly make a record out of as few ideas as possible.There are records (\\"8 Time\\" particularly) where that minimalistic, \\"inside the sound\\" concept works for me. But throughout here it just sounds awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"Don't get me wrong, \\"The Mark of Zorro\\" is a classic of the silent era. My rating is for this particular video version which I got when I thought I was ordering a restored version of same. Despite the skillful design of package, the video it contains is a different story. First off THERE IS NO MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT...This is a truly silent film, so unless you would like to experiment with adding your own soundtrack I'd pass. But even if you chose that option, it brings us to the other big problem which is the horrble quality of the video transfer.It looks as though it were video camera filming a projection. This is NOT the tape with the restored tints, and the print is inferior at best. Still, the box IS nice..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Release","review":"Whoever said that music was not instrumental in movies should see this version of the Mark of Zorro.

He is great in the part-daring and dashing about here and there as Zorro while yawning into his hankercheif like a 'fish' while a rich gentleman. (You'll note the story is very remniscent of the Scarlet Pimpernel.) The 'lines' are great, the acting very well done and a number of parts will have you chuckling (like when the girl slaps him not once, not twice, not thrice - and with both hands on either cheek!) I'll have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable silent films i've seen in a while. When I put it on, even my little sister came to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product or Defective Unit","review":"I bought this scale, in part relying on the German stereotype of precision and quality (Soehnle is a German firm), and was dissapointed in both regards.

It is of course possible that this particular unit that I purchased was defective and that others would work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Inaccurate","review":"I purchased this scale 6 months ago and am VERY disappointed.

Andrea Parker slices and dices with the best of them with fairly brooding and dark undercurrents. She opens with her (very good) mix of Depeche Mode's It's No Good and slides seamlessly into Dr. Octogan's Earth People...and it all seems perfectly appropriate and ecletic. Other times, transitions come off choppy. Parker's DJ Kicks lacks the overall sweeping collective of DJ Kicks contributions from Kruder & Dorfmeister and Thievery Corporation. Nonetheless, it is a fine body of work, that any electronic music listener would like to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"just bad","review":"This is one of the worst mixes I've ever heard.

While I'll admit that right off the bat I'm skeptical of artists that self-publish (if they're so good, why hasn't a recognized publishing house taken them in?). Usually these are vanity publications and this is no exception. I will agree that some of the women are attractive -- mostly Suicide Girl-types -- but the imagery is rather derivative and like the text, incredibly self-conscious and \\"artistically high-minded.\\" If I were a twenty-something goth perhaps this would appeal to me, but otherwise I think not.

The other additives, including sugar, totally reduce the real peanut flavor, and basically ruin the product. I think I'm going to return the two jars to Costco and get my money back!In my opinion it is a big mistake to buy this (or any other) peanut butter that is made using added sugars and other oils...no one who knows what real peanut butter tastes like, would buy Skippy peanut butter.

Perhaps the last one will be twenty minutes? Either way so far I enjoyed the series though I still hope an SDK is released allowing fans to create their own content. With the game and movie bringing in poor reviews user made machinima can only bring continued life to a series that will more than likely fade if two more films aren't made. All in all if we don't get an SDK we can always use Valve's Source engine to create content since that universe is somewhat post apocalyptic too and the engine has been out for five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"prequel to Terminator Salvation","review":"I was skeptical at first of animation made with video game technology, but I quickly forgot this while watching and enjoyed the story. There are interesting programmer-hacker themes that are mentioned, such as the importance of attacking Skynet's communications network, and not just its robot drones.

In fact not one character says anything cheesy like \\"Come with me if you want to live\\" or \\"I'll be back.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Par","review":"Originally saw this at BestBuy but it had a $9.99 price tag so I bought it at Amazon because it was a lot cheaper and I wasn't in a hurry. Good effort for the crew that made this dvd but they wasted the talent of Moon Bloodgood for such an inferior movie. They had the right idea but the technical crew messed it all up. The animation looks highly unpolished and the dialogue is cheesy and repetitive. You will notice even the mouth movements were not synchronized with the lines. I ended up fast forwarding the dvd 70% of the time just to get closure and somehow get my money's worth.I love animated movies but this one is probably lightyears behind what our current technology has to offer. I thought this was going to be similar to Appleseed Ex-machina but I was mistaken. Appleseed Ex-machina should probably be treated as the model for this kind of animation although the process in making then I think is somewhat different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Combination of smooth jazz/schmaltz","review":"The CD features primarily smooth jazz or schmaltzy arrangements. Not too much actually grips the listener or is passionate. To overcompensate for this, Dianne tends to oversing shrilly on a few numbers, hitting high notes for the sake of hitting high notes, rather than for the sake of the song. There are much better albums of hers out there. As another reviewer notes, there are a couple of good cuts. My favorite is where she swings the blues with Joe Williams in a big band setting on \\"Deed I Do\\", which is a lot of fun. But when I want to listen to Dianne, I'll be reaching for one of the jazzier or more soulful albums she has recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pure Schuur","review":"Very simply put, Diane Schuur is too talented a singer and has too good a voice for it to be covered over by the needlessly overdone orchestration that is found on several of this CD's tracks. That said, there are a few choice pieces here. They surface when the orchestration supports instead of competes with her voice as on Unforgettable and I Could Get Used To This. Schuur also shines when there are only a few instruments accompanying her as on You Don't Remember Me and We Can Only Try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super cross over tire or road with gravel!","review":"This is great tire at least better that 75% of the tires out there.

We bought this for my five year old on his birthday and he was bored with it within an hour. The graphics and sound are similar to what you would find in 10 year old video games, but the real problem is the lack of any challenging aspect to the game. The missions are very simple and are easily completed, even during the first attempts at using the game. And the controls were not fluid - steering the vehicle requires stopping, adjusting the direction, moving forward, stopping again to adjust direction, etc.. Overall, this toy is simply not worth the price. I can't comment on the durability as we are returning after two days of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the age range it states","review":"My son received this for his 4th birthday and enjoyed it that day, and maybe once since then.

It's just one box of 40 filters. And you'll pay, as I did, $11 for FedEx to bring you this one box.Soon after I submitted this feedback, I was issued a partial refund of $7.

My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else. Weight says 4.20 pounds.

The amazing drawings, many of which painted in an almost feverish surrealistic style, are accompanied by insights into the lore of the Dalai Lamas, with thoughtful excerpts from their writings. I am also much obliged as a book shopper to show my appreciation to the book's publisher, Thames & Hudson, for the excellent printing quality and overall layout and binding of this book, details which for me always work to enhance the message of a book and to demonstrate the seriousness and loving care with which the authors themselves have treated their creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring, interesting book to own!","review":"Honestly, I have not tried any of the art projects from this book yet, but I know that someday I will. However, that said, it is still a really cool book to have! I keep it on my coffee table, and find myself flipping through the pages quite often just for fun and enjoyment. It is a must for a paperdoll collector (like me), as well as for anyone interested in altered art and/or collage. Nice book to add to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never too old for paper dolls","review":"This fun book is all that it was cracked up to be. Written by Terry Taylor in a light-hearted, fun style,it explores the various forms of paper dolls and the whimsical world of the child-at-heart. Well illustratedwith explicit instructions for even the klutz-- like me. Taylor's book will inspire you to try everything hepresents. And to draw from within yourself to create more. Have fun, you little cut-ups!!!Now, back to my scissors and paper....NOTE: This was supposed to be a 5-star rating. I'm new at this..... DUH."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"This was not at all what I expected and in some cases a little creepy. The idea of creating paper doll images by using different items such as photos,magazine cutouts,newspaper clips,feathers, etc. seemed like fun - but then he gets into jointed paper dolls that look more like marionettes with limbs way out of proportion, using exotic bird heads on top of female bodies, sad and angry childrens photo faces on magazine bodies and finally let's not forget the skeletons 'dressed up' in clothes and the 'ever so mirthful' shrine dolls. Some of the book is good and I'm sure the artists showcased are well respected in their fields.. but I'm involved with this type of collage art to create 'happy' or 'contemplative'designs - not stuff that makes me wince when I see it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have Aid to Success with Legal Writing","review":"Professor Volokh's book has been invaluable to me as a writing guide. Relying on the guidance of this book, another student and I co-wrote a 2nd year independent study paper which received a high grade. Then we used his strategies to submit our work for publication offers--and received multiple offers! Prof. Volokh's tips and pointers are exactly the information no one else seems to teach you--particularly how to strategize sending out your work. Note that even his own writing style serves to inform readers what clear, concise, straightforward writing sounds like. It's not some airy-fairy, heavy treatise on what writing ought to be like with boring exercises--it's a compact, tight book on how to get it done efficiently and excellently. Best book purchase I've made in law school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is an okay gift box, only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage.

The book exemplifies this by being well organized, very readable and packed with valuable information for any photographer wanting to market and sell photographs.The three divisions of the book are well thought out.

Bad Master!","review":"This band is great Grace is the whole package. The problem I have is the CD itself, the Master Copy is not good. There is alot of noise and garble at times.I bought my original autographed copy at a live show, Grace and the band autographed it on the spot. When I got it home and listen to it I had damaged the CD, so I bought a new one. The new one has the same noise.Whom ever mastered this CD did a pooor job.I have other CD's from theis band abd they are of good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 on the Richter Scale","review":"Toss Janis Joplin, Bonnie Raitt, Norah Jones and Aretha Franklin in a blender, add a sprinkle of mountain soul and a dash of funkadelic, let rise in a cool Vermont breeze and you get Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. Enjoy straight up or on the rocks. Be prepared. It's a mix of bluesy, funky, gospely, folksy, ass kicking stuff. This is a tight band with an amazing vocalist. Potter is a reminder that those who thought great music ended in the 1960's just aren't listening. When her voice finally breaks through the barren world of canned culture, she'll rock the music world. Five stars don't do it justice. This music is a 10 on the Richter scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I was hoping for","review":"This is my first purchase of Grace Potter music, and it was exactly what I was hoping it would be.

I wish she was not so hidden. I would not have known about her unless I had fallen asleep on a Saturday night with PBS on TV. When I woke up I heard this voice that I immediately became drawn to. I had to watch the rest of the show to get her name and within two days I had ordered this CD. I have listened over, over and over again! Getting the DVD in the package was an extra bonus. I'm Looking forward to ordering more music from this talented band and front woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing performance","review":"I first saw Grace Potter last year on HDN's \\"True Music\\" playing an amazing version of \\"Nothing But The Water\\" for the Boston Music Awards.

I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I've never written a review before, but I love Grace and the Nocturnals' music so much I couldn't resist.

I can't get enough now. When I saw this was on sale at Amazon I had to download it, and then I had to download 'This Is Somewhere\\" and 'White Rabbit'. Reminds me of a mix between Stevie Nicks, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Janis Joplin, etc - basically a great, unique female rock-n-roll voice with an excellent band. I am prefernetial to this album over Somewhere, but I have been enjoying both this past weekend. It is great to hear a band like this - new, but with their roots obviously in the 60's and 70's. Being an old hippie I am glad to hear a group like this and hope they continue to rock-on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Potter","review":"This little girl can wail!!!

Yea that's pretty much all you need.","review":"My first exposure to Grace Potter and the Nocturnals was live, and that night I picked up this CD right after their set ended. It didn't leave my CD player for weeks, and that was only because I ordered their first CD \\"Original Soul\\". Though back to the business at hand. The CD has a very 70's feel to it, and thankfully doesn't sound overproduced like alot of today's CDs. There's a perfect blend of songs, higher energy tunes like \\"Sweet Hands\\" and \\"Nothing But the Water\\", bluesy tunes like \\"2:22\\", and mellower tunes like \\"Toothbrush and My Table\\" and \\"Ragged Company\\" which have a sort of a 'sit back and take it all in' vibe to them. I've already worn out that first copy I bought of the album and have purchased a 2nd as well, money well spent. If you haven't seen them in concert, do yourself a favor and do so as well, you won't be disappointed in the CD or the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product","review":"Stay away from this product, it has a strange substance, not enjoyable at all, and the worst is the fragrance, quite nauseating, gave me a headache. I've tried a number of facial moisturizers and this got to be the worst !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst writing ever","review":"There has never been a more poorly written book, to my knowledge. The subject matter is fascinating and it is hard to imagine a less well-executed explanation of this material. It is difficult to count how many times that concepts are introduced and explained with statements that begin \\"It is obvious that...\\" - I've got news for the author, not much of those things are obvious, and smaller books explain the same material in much clearer and accessible language. I personally prefer the writings of Bruce Schneier on the subject. The rough thing is, the professor of the class I'm taking picked this for the textbook... I've had to download errata, search out information online, and buy other books to try to cover the material. One of the exercises is to brute-force attack a misprinted encrypted message, and one has to know to go to the author's website to download the corrected ciphertext. That totally sucks in an $80 book."},{"rating":"1","title":"aweful","review":"This book is terrible. I am forced to read it for class and it's simply awful. If you want to learn cryptography get 'Applied Cryptography' by Bruce Schneier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting topic, good exercises, included additional topical content which was frequently updated","review":"Interesting topic - exercises illlustrated the theory. Additional content is available via web. Not a surface read - does require you to pay attention"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well organized","review":"This is probably a nice book if you are all ready an expert in network security. But it is not a good book for people who are new to the subject. Though this book covers a lot of material, it is written in a disjointed, inconsistent manner. This text was used for a graduate class and our study group found this book unhelpful because of shifting notation and a lack of consistently building the models in a logical sequence. In one section one type of notation is used, then a section or two later, the same notation means something different, or the same concept is notated differently. There was also a lack of explanation in how the protocols fit together. The study group unanimously agreed that this book made the topics more confusing than they needed to be. Wasting time on sorting out notation rather than focusing on the protocols themselves was irritating. The next version of this book should edit the cohesion of the topics and the notation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Book","review":"I found the material mostly interesting if not occassionaly difficult to read. However, I found it infurating that the review questions and problems asked at the end of the chapters, could not be answered based on the materials in the chapters.Nothing like setting you up for a fall. This isn't unique to this book, it seems a trend in most text books these days. It reflects poorly on the material, the publisher, and the author. You'd think an instructional book, would endeavor to provide its students with the tools necessary to answer the questions asked, instead of asking questions that the material doesn't cover.Really piss poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good conditon and timely delivery","review":"The \\"Cryptography and Network Security (4th Edition)\\" book that I bought through Amazon was delivered timely. The book was also in the good condition that was said of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed.","review":"I like to think that in this world there is a difference between being mean and doing mean things. Just because someone might do something that wasn't nice, doesn't necessitate calling them mean. Granted, there are mean people out there, but this book leads you to believe that anytime someone makes a wrong choice, or expects obedience to rules, they are mean. True, when parents yell, they aren't being nice. But most parents aren't mean, they just lose their temper, like most other people do, at times in their life. When you expect your child to eat good food, go to bed, clean their room, etc., that is definitely not being mean. I don't think a book of mean people should be written at all (we don't need more negative in this world), but if it is going to be written, write it about truly mean people. In other words, I don't think this book ought to have been made, let alone be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully Inappropriate","review":"The book conveys that teachers, parents and other people who try to help you learn the way of things are just as mean as people who yell for no reason. This self-indulgent bit of writing by Toni Morrison's son may be an excellent example of how blind a mother's love can be. She supported him in this publishing effort. We should not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. It is not appropriate for children of any ages. This book portrays teachers, mothers, friends, siblings and grandparents as mean people because they have expectations of the child.When I read this book to my 4 year old son, he looked at me and said \\"Mommy you are mean because you make me eat green beans\\".(A true fact from the book). I don't think it's appropriate for children to see caring adults as mean because they are trying to guide children into making good decisions.I suggest you check this book out from the library or borrow from a friend should you think you want this book. A total disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtlety Is Not For Children","review":"I borrowed this book from the library and after one reading, I put it away so that my kids couldn't find it. I agree with the other reviewers that the definition of \\"mean\\" used in this book is too broad. Maybe it was written so that you could discuss whether something was truly mean with your children, but try discussing subtleties such as that with a three-year-old. My six-year-old saw it as vindication of her calling me mean when I get her out of bed in the morning to go to school. I kept waiting for a page to come up saying that just because someone asks us to do something we don't want to do, that doesn't make them mean. That page never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!!!!","review":"I bought this book for my 5 year old daughter hoping it would help with the bully issue, but after reading it, I hid it. I showed the book to three other adults who also thought it was somewhat frightening and depressing for a child. An adult might think the book is somewhat humorous as to how a child labels people who set limits, babies who pull hair, teachers who correct homework etc. all as being mean. A child sees this book as justification that mom is mean if she makes me eat vegetables. It seems to say to the child that everyone in the whole world is mean. A somewhat pessimistic and dark look at humanity. Not cool for kids! Save your money!!!(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the Mark!","review":"I am sadly dissapointed by this book. Toni Morrison is one of my favorite authors--for adults. As a children's librarian, I think this book has missed the mark. My experience with the intended audience for this book, is they will miss the point and take it very literally. The ending appears to quickly close a book that seems to have had no real point from it's inception."},{"rating":"2","title":"great IA book that's useful","review":"I have to say, this was one of the few books that can beused out of the box. Like the book said, this book may notbe too useful for experienced information architects/UI desingers, but you may still learn some new tricks.There are lot of IA/user experience books for the websites outthere, and you may spend lot of money....but if you couldonly afford few books and you are a practicing IA or desinger,new to this field then read this book couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, sharp and helpful","review":"This is a clear, concise guide to Web site architecture written with a sense of humor and whimsy that makes it an entertaining read.Christina brushes aside pat answers and offers an extraordinarily sharp analysis of Web architecture based on what counts most: helping users find what they want.Here's a book that offers important basic information on everything from organizing your content (she's exceptional at approaching a complex concept analytically) to deciding where on the page the links should go. And it's illustrated with loads of screen shots and examples from Web sites to help it all make sense.I'd rank it an \\"A\\" or \\"A+++++++\\" on the eBay ranking scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Overview of IA","review":"I'm a web developer and have always been fascinated with the interaction of humans and web sites, and this book does an excellent job of explaining the subject in simple terms while addressing more complex issues, as well. I read this book back in 2003 when it was first published and, not being an information architect, was happy to find it spoke to my level of knowledge.With chapter titles like \\"First Principles: Some rules of thumb, and some thumbing of the rules\\" and \\"Gurus and Rules: In which some people like to boss you around, when we know that's my job,\\" the book entertains as it educates, and leaves you with a comrehensive set of steps & guidelines when designing a site from scratch or improving an existing one. Numerous case studies, screen shots and diagrams also break up the monotony of what could otherwise be a boring subject.If you're new to IA or are looking to expand your knowledge of architecting user interfaces for the web, this book belongs on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trendy opinionated hodge podge","review":"Christina Wodtke says she doesn't like rules, so she calls them principals. Whats the difference? She says she won't recommend software. So why does she give us a click-by-click review of Adobe InDesign, her \\"program of choice\\"? She even recommends a tall triple latte if you need a caffine high. Hello? In between, she also says some relevant stuff (and takes a lot of time saying it), but the true nuggets of wisdom are easy to miss in this hodge-podge of opinion spiced with California-webchic. Blueprints for the Web reads more like a blog than a book, which is to say it's pretty badly organized for a book that's supposed to teach organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good learning book.","review":"There is a little bit of a chicken-or-egg paradox in reviewing a book such as this, in that I would probably have to be at a more advanced level of Italian study than the level of the book, in order to really appraise it properly. As it is, with the book representing a learning tool, I have to assume that the translator is accurate in his efforts. Indeed, where I know the proper Italian and English, it appears to be correct, thus I am giving 4 stars. The stories are slightly uninteresting to me, but the primary focus of the book is for learning the language, not reading stories, and on that count, it seems to be quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big negative disappointment","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. The author was so negative that the book was one great big downer. After the misery of making it through this book, it became clear that it was written by someone who just doesn't get the whole disney thing. I returned the book and purchased birnbaums and fodors guides which are about 100% better and written in a positive manner. My husband and I have been to disney world and disneyland many times over the years and are planning our first trip with our children.

These are all great albums for driving, for relaxing and unwinding. If you're looking to expand your listening horizons and have not heard Howard's work, I recommend this one, plus the other 2 I mentioned, for starters.

It was well formatted, starting with his early years through his wife's passing, and the quotes used reveal so much about his work and personal ethics. You really begin to admire him for much more than his basketball legacy. I felt like I had a sort of personal brush with John Wooden when I was done, it stayed with me for quite a while.

But even a great sound can get stale. I think Brian knew it was time to shake things up. Sounds like he may have closed a musical chapter in his life by going full retro with Rockabilly Riot and opened a new one with 13. I love the variety and the fact that he's using some really muscular guitar work on this disk. He gives many of the hard rock guitar gods a run for their money but without the horible vocals and bombastic drumming that often accompanies hard rock guitar heroes. I can't get enough of this disk. I hear that Brian's next project will be to reimagine classical music. Can't wait.

The first track was ok, then it proceeded to go down hill from there. Not much rockabilly happening, then it all comes clear with \\"Really Rockabilly\\" when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans...world wide. He even gives us Aussies a serv, even though I don't think he has ever set foot here. If Brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing, jazz, rock or whatever, then go ahead, but why slag your old fans?.

Just when you think you can expect one thing from him he turns you on you ear. I won't touch on all the different styles on the album as I think everyone else has done a pretty good job.

I do some photo editing, word processing, spreadsheets and lots of email/web browsing - seemed to work fine for these past two years.

Then I read the flap note that mentions a BBC series.Gone Hollywood: written in short episodes for readers with a short attention span; lots of ready-to-film violent scenes with little characterization or connecting plot; plenty of stuff for the special effects people; mean and nasty in tone; way too many murders for the locality; little charm or local color; anti-religious and anti-rural cliches; hero of infinite strength and endurance; and of course, a major role for a girl with a bare midriff.In other words, Superman transported to the Highlands with less sex.Hard on the reader -- several sympathetic characters are needlessly killed or seriously injured. A little more work on the plot could have avoided that.Read an earlier one in the series -- or read \\"Evans Above\\" by Rhys Bowen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light and amusing Hamish MacBeth","review":"The eighteenth book in the Hamish Macbeth series was not so much a mystery but a compilation of several little mysteries in the daily routine of Hamish Macbeth. It was a good book for light reading as Hamish is very likeable character.While Hamish solves these little mysteries, such as the husband batterer and the nursing home scandal, but his attention keeps getting drawn back to the village of Stoyre where strange happenings are occurring to the townpeople. Is this village truly haunted, or is it something else more sinister? It is up to Hamish, but not so much as to draw attention to his heroics - because then he might get promoted.Hamish wants to stay in Lochdubh with his dog, Lugs. He definitely does not want to be promoted in any way.How he does solve the mystery of Stoyre, and how he gets non-promoted makes for a delightful book for all Hamish MacBeth.

He builds up the sound, layering his instruments with accomplished ease and adds the smoothest vocals in the business. Try 'Sense,' 'Tingle Tangle' and 'Marooned' for starters, but most of this album is five star stuff. It finishes with one of the all-time classic ballads in 'Thinking Up, Looking Down.'

DEEPER AND DEEPER is a throw back to the disco sounds of the Seventies. Madonna even said it was in memory of her STUDIO 54 days when she was a struggling artist in New York.For me all of the mixes have a different disco feel, with pianos samples of her voice and hip shaking grooves.

His son Peter is easier to take but if you've got good footage, why do you need a host at all? Why do you need expensive sets and wardrobes if all you're doing is introducing clips? You'll find yourself fast-forwarding past all the boring chatter (Pam Dawber expounding on why she likes Candid Camera, for instance) for just a handful of clips, and very few of the really classic ones.

However, one definite virtue it does possess is that it is not another in the endless series of Napoleonic sailing stories.

The reason is that the content of the disc is not as it claims - Intermezzo 1936, but a copy of the Hollywood remake of 1939. As you can see, the advertisement carries the original Swedish poster and the violin player on the poster is clearly NOT Leslie Howard of the remake. But as soon as you start to play the disc you know you are deceived. I think this is a false advertisement which should not be permitted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Harlequin Romance for the screen","review":"Given what great scores this flick gets in all the databases, I was shocked at how poor INTERMEZZO is. Sure, Bergman is gorgeous, but that isn't enough to compensate for the trite plotting, two-dimensional characters, and laughable dialogue. Want a strong romance from 1939? Try DARK VICTORY. A 1939 pageant? GONE WITH THE WIND. A 1939 comedy? NINOTCHKA. 1939 Family fare? THE WIZARD OF OZ. 1939 was a fantastic year for movies, so go buy/rent/watch something with a little creativity behind it, and stear clear of this time-waster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aurora Consurgens \\"In Excelsis\\"","review":"This is great stuff man.

In my opinion I think it was this album that spewed forth the now cliche punk idealisms...it was pretty much this release that would put the british hardcore/street punk/oi! movement from the late 70's into the early 80's into full gear for a rip roaring movement.Politically charged lyrics and fast aggressive music and a lead singer who was probably the biggest jerk in the world made up for a chaotic time in punk..and we got bands like Anti-Nowhere League , Chaos UK , Varukers , UK Subs , Special Duties , and many others because of this.Holds up well today musically and lyrically except in the hard to accept fact that once again...Punk is Dead...maybe..;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a classic...","review":"This is a must have for anyone in raw early 80's UK punk.

Silly hair cuts, smelly arm pits and super dumb lyrics hardly consitute good rock'n'roll and this album proves it. This stuff has none of the soul or groove that groups like Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, New York Dolls, Ramones or Dictators had. American punk bands understood rock'n'roll history and didn't abandon the roots of punk. The Exploited really do a fine job of turning good 'ole red blooded AMERICAN rock'n'roll into a brainless, stupid and moronic embarasment. F*%k The U.S.A?

As much as I love Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney) and Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), my favorite is Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq LaSalle) and I liked when he stood up for what he believed in when he faced off with Dr. Vucelich. Towards the end of the the season, we see him become close to married Physician Assistant Jeanie Boulet, who he hired to help take care of his sick mother. They subsequently had an affair, and Jeanie finds out she's now HIV positive thanks to the extra-marital hijinx of her husband Al. To get down to the nitty-gritty of season 2, check out the reviews of David Anderson, Belvis and Phyllida Ludd. I don't think I could say it any better than they did!

Britney has no real vocal talent and sings meaningless bubblegum-pop. All I can say is that she has great managers because, considering her complete lack of talent, her CDs are not as bad as some. My least favorite songs on here are \\"Oops...\\" and \\"Satisfaction\\". The best tracks are \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\"- she almost sounds as if she can sing on these two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, she did it again (unfortunately)","review":"Yes, Britney did it again, everyone. She blows up the pop scene with her not-so-talented voice paired up with ok lyrics. I am a teenager and of course I love pop music. What teenager doesn't? I really don't think this album is much more than a over-hyped immitation of a ...good singer. All she is , is a dressed up 18 year old with not enough supervision, too much freedom, and way too big ego. My advice to you as a fellow cd buyer is, please, don't buy this. You will only be wasting money that could be used on better cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solipsistic Foolishness","review":"She croons the album title, \\"Oops I did it again\\" with a fake sincerity. I should say this of the whole album.There is missing a sincerity and intelligence that was definitely audible on her first album. Before her lyrics had force and what gave it that was its ambiguity, its unwillingness to tow the line. The old Brittany would never have given into corporate pressure or public opinion. So no she did not do it again.She seems to be more selfish than ever with words that refer always to herself. That's usually okay, but she has lost some picture of who she really is. Who is the \\"I\\" in \\"I did it again\\"? Clearly it's not the \\"me\\" in \\"Baby, hit me one more time.\\"I was disppointed with this album, though I believe in her. I believe that she can see what she has become and learn that she has lost that wiseful innocence and become privy to something less. Though I must admit there were a couple songs that made me cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is brittany spears?","review":"i have to say that i did not enjoy her at all. her music reflects a stereo-typical white girl that thinks shes a stereo-typed black girl that lives in a \\"ghetto\\" neiborhood with \\"played-out\\" boy problems, and identity crisis. i believe that the media should give up on believing that \\"this is what sells\\", and give a chance to someone else who can truly express her life as a teenager with this day and age in her music without being an Agreeing-Associate to so&so records and having co-editors like maybe some guy named 'steve' that writes first drafts to most of britannys' songs. truly i feel sorry for her that she isn't yet 18 and already sold herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Did it again","review":"I think this CD is good. The songs on this CD are great. The songs that I like best is Stronger, Lucky, and Can't Make You Love Me. I hear a lot of stuff about her that is so negative.

I Did It Again With Another Absolutely Artless Album","review":"Music is an art. If you are in the music buisness, I guess you are called an artist.

Ahem. *cough, cough* If memory serves me right, I don't believe she writes her own songs.

However, her much anticipated sophmore album is a huge shortcoming. The title track cannot be compared to the first hit and the rest of the album is just another remake of her first. For example, the song \\"Stronger\\" has the repeating line of \\"My lonleiness is killing me no more\\". What is up with that? Once again her voice has been enhanced with machines yet she will never be able to reach the heights of stars like Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, and Celine Dion, or even her fellow teen peers like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson and never reach the height of success with any of her ballads like \\"Dear Diary\\". Britney Spears has 5 years tops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes I .....Wonder?","review":"I'm still left to wonder how Britney really made it. But hey the public must like her if she sold millions of albums. Oops... did it again is kind of cute but the ballad \\"don't let me be the last to know\\" is a waste of voice for her.

We'll see how long this one lasts...."},{"rating":"1","title":"She makes me sick","review":"I normally love pop music but she just ruins it! forget about girl power here.

And no I do not think she's a bad mother. The only problem is that she can't write a decent song to save her life. She's no Madonna or Janet. They at least add creativeness to their songs and perform them well. Want proof? Get Madonna's Like A Prayer or J's Rhythm Nation. Back to the product. There's nothing remotely different from her first effort. I mean nothing. And the worst part is that she covered a Rolling Stones classic. I'm surprised Mick and Keith didn't shoot her down for it. Well, they did get their money. Stronger is ear poison to the fullest and the rest of the singles...pure MTV garbage. She's one of the reasons why MTV is going down hill. A great album from 2000 that you all should check out is Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun. If you disagree, then you are officially brainwashed by MTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad influence to children of any age","review":"Please don't buy this CD for your kids.

Her material is stupid, who cares if she is stronger or she can't get some guy to love her or she doesn't want to be the last to know. The music is whinny and she sings whinny to. She even does things when she'll talk to her friends before a song so you'll get the song, if it's a good song you shouldn't need an explanation. Even if she changed her material, she has no vocal ability what so ever. Please, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"same old thing","review":"I really didn't find the cd that great.

I think that \\"Lucky\\" could be a very sweet song, but Britney's vocals really take away from it. Her voice is too nasal and might be better with some proper training. On this cd, Britney again works with songwriter Max Martin on many of the songs, which was a bad decision. To be honest you could sing the vocals to \\"Crazy\\", \\"Baby One More Time\\", or \\"Oops! I Did It Again\\" over-top the music of one of the others and you wouldn't be able to tell a difference. Most of Max Martin's songs sound alike, which makes for a really boring album. I think that Britney Spears has SOME potential, but if she sticks to material like this, she'll be gone before she can do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"THIS Cd is a flop. It proves to everyone that sex sells and it's obviously the only reason why people would buy this cd. It's certainly not because she can sing. She can't, period.

Save your money and don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS A \\"NEW\\" RECORD?","review":"The title says it all: she made the same record again.

Britney Spears does it again.","review":"I know, I know (you parents out there), it's Britney Spears. For the past year she has had our youth walking around with exposed tummies singing, \\"Oh baby, baby...\\" Now with her new CD, Oops!.. I Did It Again, she has indeed done it again. The beat is spirited and the words mix pensive, teen-love reality with a nice boost of attitude. (What love-struck teen doesn't need a little self-esteem?) Each track emanates what America finds enduring about this teen superstar; sexiness, innocence, and savvy-ness with talent. You can dance to this CD, exercise to this CD, and simply enjoy listening to this CD. It has substance. Yes, Britney Spears is young with what some might term a \\"mature message\\" but she continues to enrapture young guys and girls with her good image and good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"In general, same style as before but not done as well","review":"I really liked Britney's first CD and bought this one because of that. However, the CD has been disappointing. I like \\"Ooops!...I did it again\\" except for a section in the middle where a dialogue was inserted - it was unfortunately very fake and takes away from the song. The rest of the songs are just okay. There are many dialogues inserted into the various songs but all of them sound more empty-headed than anything. I am quite disappointed. As someone who loves her first CD the second one does not live up to the first. I do not believe I will buy any more of her CDs in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Princess!","review":"OK. First let me tell you, I really like Britney's music! I have this CD, and well, I thought that the other CD was better, but now I'm getting used to this one. None of the songs are as good as Hit me Baby One More Time, but some are nice. Opps...I Did It Again, I got used to, and I actually like it. The only thing bad about this Cd, though, is that she took 2 songs from famous singers, and that ruined her image to me, a bit. But I think she sings them well. They are: I can't Get No Satisfaction, and Don't Let me be the last to know. By The Rolling Stones, Shania Twain. But, in this CD Britney actually writes her own song! It's not that great, but it's a start. Dear Diary is the name of that song. If you like female singers, and Britney's old Cd, then you'll like (or get used) to this one. SO try it out, and you actually might like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't Britney lucky?","review":"Isn't she lucky. Her new record Oops I did it again was great. Her video is awsome. In this album she once again proves that she has an incredible voice and not just another cute face. She sings like no other female singer. In my opinion her hits just get better and better. You thought her first record was great, you should get her new CD. Lucky is my favorite track from the CD. You could tell I really like the CD. And to all the people that say that britney can't sing or that the lyrics are boring, you're wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop music at its worst","review":"In this album the record producers attempt to make her seemmore \\"mature\\" by throwing in [...] catch phrases into her songs such as \\"Im not the innocent..\\" or \\"Im stronger than yesturday..\\".Also, in this album the producers try to give her songs which rely more on her vocals rather than a catchy beat and with amplified vocals, BAD MISTAKE. Her voice is horriblely whiny as well she has horrible singing ability in the first place.All of the songs are very shallow and teeny-bopper oriented. Even \\"Lucky\\" which attempts to tug at the heart strings falls horribly short when you listen to the [...] lyrics, also since Britney didnt even write the song it loses all of its sincerity.I hope this trend of selling the singers image over the actual songs ends soon...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!... She Messed Up Again","review":"This album could be on the of the worst produced albums. Sure, it has a few catchy songs like Oops!... I Did It Again, Stronger and What You See(Is What You Get), but the other songs are downright rotten. The remake of I Can't Get No Satisfaction is less than nothing, Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know was written by Shania Twain and yes, it has good lyrics, but what ruins it is the beat and Britney's poor vocal talent. Dear Diary is a good example that. Personally, I think she should have slowed down a bit and try to make real music. As for all you fans of her singles Oops!... I Did It Again, Stronger, Lucky, and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know, the songs WILL get annoying after about two times going through the whole album. I recommend Christina Aguilara or Jessica Simpson, the ones with the excellent produced records, real vocal talent, and the people who want to give their best and who don't care about money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney ROX!!!!!! ~*~cAnDy~*~","review":"The cd is the best cd I have.

This girl may have some talent but it is no apparent on this CD. With her huge lack of writing credits and her odd vocal range why would she want this to reach the public. It offers no portion of her true-self, seeing as she only co-wrote one song. I'm sorry I cannot recommend a CD with such a horrible cover song as 'Satisfaction' - it was done great in the Julia Roberts movie 'Satisfaction' aka 'Girls of Summer.' The entire album reaks of bubble gum trash re-engineered to make the listener think it's something new. I can only Britney will soon stop tossing us ABC (already been chewed) material and offering something original and from her own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"She needs help","review":"I used to be a fan of Britney Spears but then her voice....changed.

But let's face facts, she cant sing. This CD was awful. I think the only reason I bought it was because I gave into the Britney hype. All the tracks sound alike. The only reason shes singing is because she has the look. Everyone loves the little blonde belching out sweet melodies about heartache and love. But did they ever actually stop and listen to her sing? Take my advice, if your a person who does stuff just to be with the \\"in\\" crowd, go ahead and get this CD. But if you have any sense, go get Aaliyah's new CD, or if you like the blonde teeny bopper idol, get Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"Britney Spears is the worst excuse of a female singer I've ever heard!

The songs, the depth, the lyrics, it all comes together for an enjoyable album. I got the first album, and though I liked it I hated the lyrics. They were all about a girl who was totally dependent on this guy and was despertly trying to win him back, and that's just not what I want to hear. In this album the lyrics are strong, but sensitive. Some songs are easy to dance and sing along to.The missing star? I have to say, not all the tracks are so great. My favorites are Stronger, Lucky and Dear Diary. Ooops....I Did it Again, and Satisfaction are fun, but not amazing. However, the ones that are good are really good. I think this album is worth your money if you're a Britney fan or a dancer.I say, good for Britney, she did it again........only better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This CD is awesome!

If you know those songs than all you have to do is relearn new words because it is the same turn (almost:>)) But i do like some of her songs.

This whole album is pathetic! i would love to gouge her eyes out with an ice pick for butchering up one of the best Rolling Stones songs! The rest of these songs on this album are overplayed trash written by a bunch of horny forty year olds who can't get any action from their spouses! I'd probably buy these songs more if they were sung by Janet or Madonna, instead of a little pop tart who claimed to be proud of being a virgin for how long. If anybody ever brought this album into my house, I'd smash it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on!","review":"I can't believe people actually buy this garbage. This is the very lowest of music forms. First off, Britney doesn't even write her own music, all she does is show skin. She has no real talent because shes a [sham.] Not to worry though, because I think she only has 2 albums let and then no one will care anymore. Then, she will start doing Playboy shoots to start her popularity up and find out thats all shes good at.

What did she do the first time?","review":"\\"Oops I did it again\\" does everything but impress me! Britney Spears is supposed to be the \\"next Madonna\\" but wouldn't that imply re-inventing herself?? This album sounds exactly the same as the last one...computer generated. The only change Britney has made is taking off more clothes. I gave this album one star because 0 stars was not a choice. I see a huge lack of talent here! Jessica Simpson has much more talent and I would recommend that Cd over this one anyday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too formulaic and recycled stuff","review":"Not that I cannot appreciate pop music - in fact I rather find Lucky and Oops - I did it again rather infectious with Britney Spears manipulating her vocals to the mechanical line of previous hits like You Drive Me Crazy. In this album, it proves a grave disappointment with the rather superficial lyrics and lack of stretch of her range. \\"I can get no satisfaction\\", \\"What u see is what u get\\" - provocative titles but shallow insights. The only other song that I find good is \\"Dear Diary\\" - Britney has that innate talent to entrench herself in the pop-arena - but with monotonous and formulaic approaches - it won't get her very far. We will appreciate more daring stunts instead of feeding us easy fodders by Max Martin. Maybe the next album will have fans calling out \\"Oops- she already did that.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end?????","review":"Does anybody notice that all of these songs sound almost exactly alike? Does anybody notice that she has never managed to sing any song of hers live??? This album consisted of some of the most bland tracks I have ever heard in my life. I think this had to be the worst album since Vanilla Ice's II D Extreme. (They should do a song together!) This album has manipulated the minds of young, naive teenager girls all over the world, hopefully Briteny Spears non-existant talent will be exposed. Teens dont be mislead!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another hit song from Britney that sounds the same...","review":"This is DEFINITELY not my forte' of music, but I'm always willing to give everything a chance before I judge it; unfortunately, it's albums like this that make me want to disregard that last statement. Let's face it...Britney just isn't musically inclined. All of her so-called \\"SMASH HITS\\" are all composed around that same beat over and over again - all it is is the beat to \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\" but re-mixed and re-arranged. When I got to track 3, I was pretty much at my breaking point where I wanted to take the CD out and break it, but it's okay because now I know that her next \\"big hit\\" is going to be the beat to \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\" but backwards. THIS ALBUM WAS GARBAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops is right! She did it again :-(","review":"If you think Britney Spears has a full, remarkable voice you need to clean out your ears. In her latest single, \\"Oops...I did it again\\" she sounds like a baby trying to sing the menu of McDonalds. She hasn't come a long way in voice maturity in the past couple years, that's for sure. Still the same annoying, teenybopper sound. If you want someone with real sound, look for the new POP album coming out by LeAnn Rimes. That's true talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops she did it again and made a bad album.","review":"Yes maybe Britney Spears is only 18 and has the number one album in the US. But I still didn't like it. First of all it lack originality and good music. Second of all it's just irritating, Britney's singing (which even worse than before) makes me wanna rip my eyes from their socket. If you want to listen to an overhyped, bubbly, sugary, teen love album pick this up. If you have any shread of dignity or sanity in you, then you won't buy this. I'm very glad I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT waste your money!","review":"There is no getting around the facts~this is a horrible excuse for a CD. This is American music at it's worst. I am ashamed that I have this CD. Britney's voice sounds like a dying cat and it basically sounds like shes getting \\"busy\\" on most of the CD. She shows no talent as an artist. Britney co-wrote the last song on the CD, called \\"Dear Diary\\". My four year old sister could write a better song than that. I am boycotting all Britney music forever and I hope you do the same. It's sad that she gets all the fame and money when there are many more young musically blessed girls waiting in the shadows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no. Please don't do it again.","review":"I am not here to criticize Britney Spears' obvious lack oftalent or the fact that all she is selling here is sex. I am here togive my honest opinion of the album, so that inquiring minds and people who plan to purchase this album will know how I feel about it. This album is bland, recycled, pop garbage. I would not listen to it again for anything short of a million dollars. Britney Spears won't be sticking around for the long haul. She doesn't have the talent to carry her through. It is my advice to potential buyers that they purchase *any* CD other than this one. Good luck, Britney. You're going to need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops I did It Again? What the heck did you do the first time?","review":"The fact that my sister keeps listening to this CD like it's actually good is driving me crazy. This was worse than the first piece of trash. I wasn't shocked to find that there is not even ONE actual SONG on the whole so-called album. I mean, were there any actual INSTRUMENTS used to back up that \\"voice\\"? Man, talk about overproduced. Can this even be called music? Oh God, and the little voiceovers before songs like Lucky and that Rolling Stones cover that she butchered (Satisfaction) are just absolutely the epitome of awful. Please, don't waste one cent on this CD.UPDATE: Considering all the garbage that was released after the Days of Britney and Friends, I now feel that this album is not the crappiest recording on the planet. This is a sad day in music, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"She calls herself an artist?","review":"OK, this is just sad that anyone would want to listen to this! Britney's nothing more than a model who they thought they could teach how to sing! She doesn't even write her own music! I assure you that you're wasting your money if you buy it. Oops!...I did it again is even worse than Baby One More Time. I still can't believe she stole the awesome song, Satisfaction from the Rolling Stones. If she's going to redo a legendary song like that, why not at least put some feeling into it, if possible? I'm sorry if I'm harsh, but I personally don't believe that Britney deserves to have her so-called \\"music\\" on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Blows","review":"man i heard my girlfriend playing this horrible cd, i was ready to throw her stereo out the window lol. britney has no talent, she is a lip synching fool i have no idea why people like her.

I am pleading with you not to let the marketers win. Britney is talentless, but she makes a fine looking puppet who says all the right things. Unfortunately, these days that equals huge success.

Blue Racer: This hypocrite doesn't even write her own songs(like the awful title cut, Lucky and Stronger which are all worse than being chased by a crane), they were penned by a Swedish meatball named Max Martin and the results are bubble gum at it worst. Japanese Beetle: Worse of all is her sacrilegous cover of The Rolling Stones' masterpiece Satisfaction and for that HAASAH(chops Britney's head off). Blue Racer: One good this was this record sold less than her debut with only 10 million sold in America.

TRY AGAIN BRITNEY","review":"This album is a rehash of what she thought worked in the first album. It is simply a case of \\"It worked the first time so let's do it again\\". The title track \\"Oops I did it again\\" is quite pointless and sounds almost exactly like the \\"Baby one more time\\". Ms Spears should not be afraid to try a new sound and mature her music a little - and by mature I mean using new beats and new lyrics, not using the same music and adding a few pert lines. With the popularity she has amassed she could certainly afford to test the waters a little. In she lasts long enough to do another CD, hopefully she'll wise up and not offer a discerning public this repetitive fare again."},{"rating":"1","title":"oops.....its crappy again","review":"this has to be one of the most overated albums ever briteny spears i just the product of a record company out to make money.this is a lot worse than her first album at least you can listen to it.this i just a bunch of realy badly put together pop tunes dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"icky","review":"In a few words: this CD stinks.

Britney Spear's voice holds no appeal; she has a small range and cannot even hit a note in a clean mannor. Instead she growls up to every note. She is receiving attention for writing \\"Dear Diary\\"; for one, she only co-wrote it and it is not a song that you should like to brag about. This cd is absolutely terrible and disappointing; when is there going to be a 18 year old girl who can actually sing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm sounds the same to me..","review":"Maybe I'm not being fair. But I really dislike this cd. Maybe it's the fact I'm really sick of ol' Brit, or maybe it's the fact SHE KILLED THE ROLLING STONES SONG! Am I the only one who hates what she did to it? Mick, Keith and the rest of the Stones : what were thinking when you allowed this to happen to your music !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!...is quite appropriate","review":"I gave this album two stars because it contains two good songs-- the title track, and the Rolling Stones remake. The rest of it is very forgettable at best. Britney's last album lacked strong vocals, but at least it had a high percentage of rather catchy tunes that went over well despite her lack of vocal prowess. The songs on \\"Oops\\" are bland at best, and the annoying dialogue between songs is enough to destroy any hint of artistic merit lurking somewhere on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless pop garbage","review":"WHY? WHY DID HER SONGWRITERS HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND PROVIDE HER WITH THE SAME SONGS TO SING AS WERE ON HER DEBUT? Ms. Spears has once again released an album of songs that all come in two flavors: brainless, recycled techno/dance tracks and fluffy, inane ballads. Nothing here is even mildly listenable, nor intelligent in any respect, nor even musically interesting to listen to. The least the writers could have done was be a little creative inside the two cookie-cutter boundaries. As I had feared and anticipated, she did indeed do the same thing over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maturing into a great singer","review":"When I heard Britney's previous debut album, ...Baby One MoreTime, I thought she had some potential, but she had a limited amountgood songs...mostly by Max Martin.

But this is nothing comparing with this: The Cd includes 4 Videos of the singles releases 'Oops!...' 'Lucky' 'Stronger' and 'Don't Let Me Be...'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the whole family!","review":"I think this a good CD and my six year old loves the title song as she sings it word for word. My husband likes I Can't Get No Satisfaction and my three year old dances with the beat to Stronger. Myself, I like all of the songs, feel like they are a good mix on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Fan","review":"A more mature Britney. The title track \\"Oops!.. I did it again\\" is my favorite song. I like this CD better than her first album ...\\"baby one more time\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops...She's done it better","review":"I am not really a fan of Britney Spears but I did purchase the album as a gift for a friend. I must say when I heard it I was very impressed. It is definately more mature then her last alblum. Also I think it showcases her unique singing voice very well. Two or three of the songs will still send you into sugar shock but she's only 18 and her musical style will grow as she does. I think the songs Oops..I did it again, Stronger, and What you see (Is what you get) are the best. They do well to answer her critics and show her new found maturity. Also her remake of the Rolling Stones song Satisfaction is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops is right!","review":"Sounds like her last cd and just as bad! I'm surprised that Shania Twain would want such an untalent to sing her beautiful music! (Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know). What's even worse is that Britney only thanked Shania's husband for the song and not Shania! She then had the nerve to say on television that he wrote all Shania's music, which is untrue. I think Britney is jealous of Shania when all she should be is grateful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait to show off that nasal cavity!","review":"I can't believe the lows the music world has sunk to! I swear you can sing \\"Baby one more time' along with at least three songs on the album including \\"Oops\\". I think she should sue herself for plagurism. The only thing that has gotten better then the first album is her ability to sing through her nose. The songs off the first album I could tolerate when they were on the radio but I have to change the channel instead of listening to \\"oops\\". At least the commercials don't grate on my nerves. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the version of \\"Satisfaction\\" was actually ok, just a little long."},{"rating":"2","title":"this rules","review":"I got this cd for \\"Oops!.. I did it again\\" just like everybody else did. I have bought all the pictures and the ones in this jacket and hung them up in my room. \\"Stronger\\" is one of the best songs on the cd, boy does she look hot in the video, with the dancing with the chair. I did not really care for \\"Don't go knocking on my door\\". I don't like the R&B sound to it. A lot of people don't like \\"Sattisfaction\\" because it does not sound like the original by the stones. I love the version on the mtv vma's where she was full of energy and also stripped [warning if you are under 10 do not watch that seen on mtv} Lucky was my favorite song on the cd, it shows full emotion and it is also nice how the video and the song have a plot to it. I am not really into the \\"Balads\\" [aka slow songs]. When I was listing to \\"Dear Diary\\" it seemed like she was singing about me. Buy this cd if you enjoy pop music, a teenage girl, or any guy who likes the videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Step Up","review":"Ok, Im a very big Britney Spears fan. People think she is cheesy, well so what shes making money and shes not putting out vulgar songs. This album is very good, much much better than the first. I love STRONGER because I can totally relate to it and I can hear Britney crying out in the song. She is progressing at about the right speed I think. Some I think have expected too much out of her. If she changed her style all together, we'd freak out. Its like sticking a frog in hot water, it jumps out. However, if you put it in cold water and gradually warm the water up, it will stay there. My only complaints are that she needs to sing out more and don't hold back as much. Shes got a wonderful voice, Britney let us hear it. And second, Max Martin needs a new sound module. Some songs were good tracks, but Oops and What you see sound alot alike, very much like Baby One More Time. Next time take a step higher, but hey good step up and take it too the bank. Britney Rulz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If I could rate this zero stars, I would. Anyone who says they like this is playing mind games with themselves! Britney Spears has an occasional interesting throaty vocal--but by and large her music (and videos) are absolutely terrible! The lyrics, the composition, the performance, it's all cheese! Commercially designed to sell to young girls! And you're buying into it, congratulations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the trash bin it goes...ooops! I missed!","review":"Good grief, they call this music? Someone gave me this CD, and I gave it as a donation to a thrift store, but regret not tossing it in the trash. This floozy named Britney Spears and her musical style is for the immature and morally vacant and is so lacking in content and class. Sorry, I can't stand this gal's music (good grief I said that word again...THIS IS NOT MUSIC, IT'S GARBAGE). Worth ZERO stars, but I regretfully am forced to rank it with a minimum of 1 star....ISH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice but bad cd","review":"I can't deny that she has a good voice, its obvious that she does. She has great talent, but talent can only take you so far. I was very disappointed with the way Britney flaunts herself with her sexuality...Shortly after buying this cd I've broken it and threw it away. Its a little too teenybopperish for me. I'm sick of listening to Britney and watch her prance around like some little madonna wannabe. I'm sorry I ever wasted my money on this cd.When people buy cd's, videos, games, food, etc. The money that they buy a thing supports the company, artists, corporation, etc. I don't want to support Britney with my money since cd's are expensive. I want to support artists that I like for their music, and that I respect.This is why I don't listen to Britney Spears anymore. I can't respect her or support her with my hard earned money. I now opt to listen to Stacie Orrico. Who respects herself, while still singing cool pop songs, that have depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the giggly teeny bopper...","review":"Much thanks to Max Martin, who wrote almost all of the songs for her. I actually like Britney Spears' music, but it is really the folks behind Britney that make this happen. The only song she helped out with (she gave them the idea, they wrote the song), is a weak prayer for what she can do. She giggles with her friends in between songs about a boy that is looking at her, but she is scared to talk to him. Give me a break. It's embarrassing to listen to this one. Britney doesn't have much talent, but she does look good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I must admit, this cd was a huge disappointment. Britney needs to learn what the word \\"diversification\\" means. All her songs sound the same...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, even for pop","review":"I think it's about time pop singers get some talent and heart. Even talented pop singers get sucked into a boring and predictable style of music. This sounds exactly like every other pop album I've ever heard. This one is even more see through, sappy and pointless than her other album. I don't recommend this album to anyone over the age of 7 and I think it's time that pop gets some heart and originality. It doesn't look like that's going to happen from where I'm standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is garbage!","review":"The first album by Britney, which opened the Pandora's Box of similar manufactured MTV and untalented windbags. Britney is the first in a long string of artists that are more marketing than real talent. Her songs are all written by professional songwriters for mass consumption, and are soulless and void of any real meaning.Instead of teenybopper albums like this, dear readers of Amazon, I implore you to support REAL AND TALENTED ARTISTS who write their own music and put their hearts and souls into what they do, not this waste of plastic called \\"music.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, Oops she did it again!","review":"I'll start off by saying that Britney Spears has no talet as a singer. So why bother listening to someone if they can't even sing! The songs on this C.D. are either sappy, or just plain stupid. Plus, they all sound the same. If you want to buy this C.D. to use as a coaster, then please, be my guest, but don't buy this C.D. thinking that it will have good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Ok, but it's NOT HER DEBUT!","review":"Ok, this CD is pretty good. The title track is great. I like \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Where Are You Now\\" the best. The latter is a great ballad that everyone can relate to. I took a star off because, um, she has obviously never heard the Stones. The \\"Satisfaction\\" remake is horrible. I think I could sing it better chomping on gum. If she wants to remake songs, she should at leats listen to it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops!...She did it again","review":"My opinion on each of the songs- 1. Single...Hit...A-Okay with me! 2. Catchy chorus...really cool edgy beat. 3. Nice RnB influenced song...beat is a little over used. 4. Lengthy...Great attitude...Good beat. 5. Sounds too much like an actually Shania song...good song though. 6. Catchy Chorus...'Okay' beat. 7. Excellent Song...Good Lyrics! 8. Off Track Song...baad. 9. Great Ballad...good lyrics. 10. Excellent Dance Song! 11. Boring...grows on you after awhile. 12. Sweet...Short...like a poem...or should I say Diary Entry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney, go hang with Christina Aguilera","review":"I think this cd was really cool, but why did she want to record songs that were the same? I say go hang with Christina, they are a perfect match! They are both so girlie girlie. I say if you like girlie girle stuff buy it but if not don't waste your time. My fav. songs were Lucky and Oops!...I did it again. The other songs were kind of bogus."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised by how much I liked it","review":"Normally I buy a cd knowing I am going to skip tracks regularly, but this time I could listen to the whole cd through and that really surprised me. Oops is better than Baby, her old cd, which I felt only had a couple of good songs. Here, there's a lot to more to like. The songs really are catchy. My review is more like 4.5 stars. Didn't really like all the talking inbetween, but overall a very good cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not disappoint...","review":"I'm rather new to the Britney craze. I didn't buy her first album though I did like \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Crazy\\". I thought I'd give this one a try and I'm glad I did. While I could have done without the 'conversational' interludes that segue certain songs together, I think musically - as far as dance pop is concerned - the album is terrific. I don't think there's a single weak or \\"filler\\" song on the album.My favorites - \\"Oops...\\", \\"Satisfaction\\", \\"One Kiss From You\\", \\"Lucky\\", and \\"Where Are You Now\\".Britney's follow-up lives up to the hype. It's great fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops...BUY SOMETHING ELSE!","review":"ack! this CD TOTALLY shows that she has NO VOICE whatsoever. i mean, HELLO! Dear Diary, i met a totally bad CD today. she can't sing, write, and is a ditz. if u want to hear some people that have REAL talent, listen for Mandy Moore (5 stars), Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, or NSYNC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better","review":"Everybody says her voice & the music has matured. The only thing that has is the music. And that's only a little bit. Her vocal ablity has not mature at all. Just because the songs are more catchy,does not mean she has matured as an artist. Her & the songs lack a great deal. Other than the fact that her songs have got more uptempo it sound like the first CD. Don't get me wrong I am not saying she has no talent,it just not as impressive as other artists. As far as being enjoyable it is probably 5 on a scale of 1-10. If you like pure pop you'll love it, but if you like me it's okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies and gentlemen, run, hide! BRITNEY'S BACK!","review":"Ok, now I know at the beginning of Brit's career everyone embraced her as the new idol for young girls, but from recent appearances she looks and acts very far from that! There's been so much hype on this star that most people have felt it their duty to just buy her album to get her to shut up. The only reason that her CD is selling is for people to say to their friends \\"Yeah, I have her new CD\\" (come on, you know you do it!) I didn't actually buy the album, but listened to it at friends'. There are only two songs that I consider \\"listener worthy\\" (Stronger and Lucky). Just trust me, there's no reason to buy this if you really like good music. All in all, this big star is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a little weird...","review":"Britney Spears...I don't really like her but after listening to her new album...I found that I liked the songs. Something weird around here though... I like the other singers' voices not Britney Spears's, and i really think she is a lousier singer than Christina Aguilera, she cannot sing ballads and that's why there are less of them this time round. Do you all agree with me? Here, many are CRAZY over her, but i think the ppl who gave Christina the 'Best New Artist' award were obviously thinking along the same lines as us... i think Britney Spears is only a pretty face and no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoultly horrible.","review":"Hopefully this bubblegum garbage will end soon. .... The music is all heavily over produced, her voice is over produced, the lyrics are horrible. She can't sing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total ...","review":"I just don't see the attraction of all this manufactured stuff. A friend of mine actually bought this and played it whilst I was at his house. I had trouble keeping a straight face. I just could not believe anyone could want to torture themselves in this way. Do the people who actually listen to this {stuff} really enjoy it, or are they only listening because it is cool to do so? If they would only open their ears they may discover that there is still some really great non-manufactured music out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she have to?","review":"This album is perfect for those who enjoy catchy, sometimes cheesy throwaway pop music. If you want an album you can dance around like a lunatic then go for this- I particularly recommend Stronger- but if credible music is your thing, then look elsewhere. For the majority of teeny-boppers though ... this album is good. I personally didn't like it. The sound is too over produced and no offence to Britney, but at times she sounds like a strangled cat. At the end of the day though, she has become such a phenomenom that she will fade into obscurity soon- remember the Spice Girls?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! I wasted my hard earned money!","review":"She can dance, she can wear sexy clothes, and she can smile real big, but lets face it, this girl can not sing to save her life. The whole sacredness of the art of music has been lost. The songs on this CD have absolutely no depth to them and have no variety in the style. It is an insult to the pop culture and to the music world in general. I beg of you! Do not waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Crap","review":"Please stop and consider whothis is aimed at and stop support the exposure of our kids to ignorant pop stars who will lead them to say oops and distroy their integrity and lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best PoP CD from Britney","review":"I just love this PoP CD from Brit. One of my online friends bought this CD for me, and mailed it to me. When I listened to it at the computer I loved it. my friend ,,she also has the Oops! CD, and I listened to hers when I stayed at her house ,so I know what the songs sounded like before I got it. I also know that some people hate Britney, either buy her dressing or singing voice or that she doesn't write her own songs. But please people grow up & don't judge Brit by the way she dresses or how her voice sings or that she doesn't write her own songs. I used to not like Britney..myself until I got this CD!!! Now I'm getting use to liking this girl. She has da coolest PoP singing voice. Please don't listen to those people who say not to buy this CD.. Just buy it! My CD is the European Version, so it has one extra track called \\"Girl In The Mirror\\" That song is good. My favorite tracks are \\"Stronger\\" , \\"Lucky\\" , and \\"Cant make you love me\\" Great work Brit!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad service","review":"my cd came and the cd case was cracked it was not the original wrapping and the cd was scratched. i tried to contact the seller multiple times and they never replied do not buy from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too many","review":"My sister, a former Britney fan, is beginning to tire of her music, thank God! This album is pure torture. She can't sing, she can't write, she simply wouldn't survive if she didn't do stripteases. On satisfaction, she almost sounds as bad as Mick Jagger. There is no point to this album. Oops, I think Britney put out another bad album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"I will resist the temptation to make any of the cracks the title of this CD offers us. I was fine with Britney Spears making her disposable garbage for the gullible, close-minded masses until she went too far - covering a Stones' song, and probably their best one at that. Hearing \\"(Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" covered with all the poppy bubblegum added is like listening to yourself slowly choke to death. This track is such an insult to the ears it almost makes the rest of the 15 dollar piece of plastic sound good. I can't even believe her producers and whatnot let her do this. Imagine if Debbie Gibson had covered \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\"! Britney, please fade away just as quickly as any bad trend but do it without covering classic songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One the best albums Britney released to date","review":"Oops!...I Did It Again is perhaps the best album that Britney Spears has released to date. I'm saying this because I'm a fan of music, and not just a Britney fan.Rock on Britney!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first!","review":"Oops!... She did it again! Britney has made an even better album! This is much bettter that Baby One More Time. She is all grownup and even co-wrote one of the songs (Dear Diary)! If you loved Britney's first CD, you'll love this one which includes Oops!... I Did It Again , Lucky, and Stronger. A must for all Britney fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, unfortunately, she did it again...","review":"The title track's rather weak, in my opinion. The other songs are almost equally forgettable. The redeeming songs are 'Stronger' and 'Lucky,' and they'd be even better if it wasn't Britney singing them. Currently she has a vocal range of about three notes, and all the moaning and groaning doesn't help much either. I read somewhere that we're being sold pure hype, and that's pretty much how I feel. I only hope that, in the event that she'll put out another album, someone will take the time to teach her how to sing an entire octave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britneys failure","review":"I think that brits album totally sucks. for one i only did like one song out of 13!!! what a rip off! if u want it buy a single! she can do MUCH better than this junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!?...well yeah!","review":"i dont know why im talkin bout this peice 'o crap cd. but i heard it so i though i might review it...anyways everysong sounds the same, and its really really bad, even for pop,...she cant sing(if you havent noticed, she sounds like shes singing out her nose...and shes probably not even singing with all the computers and technology that they can do to peoples voices these days, if theyre using computers n' stuff they should at least make it sound half way better)i dont know why i even listened to this in the first place, maybe i just wanted to pick on something, but if you appriciate good music, dont buy this. and if you like to keep money for good things, dont buy this. k? do you get my point?....DONT BUY THIS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No more, please Britney","review":"I don't hate Britney, honestly, but why settle for recycled garbage when there is so much better music out there. It isn't just that her songs are annoying, they lack substance. In essence, they have nothing to say. Why listen to it if you can't gain anything from it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO! Not again...","review":"O.K. for one to produce a sucessful follow-up to their originalalbum, it must come with a new sound that improves upon the original.And Brit, I'm sorry to say that you weren't even remotely close on this one. Normally, I am a big fan of Ms. Spears, and I will continue to be, assuming that she can improve upon this horrendous effort to create an entire C.D. that basically sounds like \\"Crazy\\" but just with different words. Granted, there was the occassional spot of greatness in songs such as \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\" and \\"Stronger\\" all I ask is \\"BRINEY WHY CANT ALL YOUR SONGS BE LIKE THOSE?\\" I mean if she could come up with something original for those two tracks, then why not for the rest of the album, did she run out of ideas? I'm not going to criticize Britney herself, as she is a great talent, with great vocals, but this C.D. seemed more of an attempt to elevate her already astronomical status of teen pop queen. But Brit, it's O.K. everyone makes mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"My young daughter bought this CD with money she got for her birthday. What's with all the cutesy boyfriend talk before half her songs? Her cover of \\"satisfaction\\" is awful, and it sounds like she used the same midi tracks in the instrumental backups to all her songs. In the first few songs I can her the obvious digital enhancement of her voice, too. Is it that easy to get into the pop business? I remember way back when - when musicians had to have *talent* to get in the business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! She blew it again!","review":"I can't even begin to say what this album is. These songs made me sick after hearing them for just a short time. Britney sounds like a chipmunk. In other words, HORRIBLE! I used to be a fan, but this is the worst CD that I own! Don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufactured Pop at its peak.","review":"The current state of music just became worse. I was forced into listening to this album yesterday and I wanted to run screaming. There is no substance behind the lyrics, or the singer. Spears has sex appeal and, well, that's about it. There is no true staying power in this girl. Ten years from now no one will know of her and no one will care either. Save yourself some money and sanity by finding something with some artistic merit. To even call Britney Spears an artist is an insult to all of us who write our own music."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ALBUM - EVER.","review":"Britney Spears has no talent whatsoever - she has other people write songs and choreograph dances for her. Then, she runs her voice through a computer to make it sound better (i.e. the Simpsons episode where they make a boy band and the amp shuts off). I have to admit that I am biased against this type of music, but then again I could take anything else over this, Backstreet Boys, *NSync, 98 Degrees, my sister listens to all of it too loudly and I've experienced the full horror of it all and I can say I hate Britney Spears much more than any other teeny-bopper pop stars. So do the world a favor and go buy an album by one of the following bands, everyone will like one of the following bands/artists: Metallica, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Queen, Frank Sinatra, Led Zeppelin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, or even Beethoven or Mozart. You'll probably be pleasantly surprised, its actually music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a Break","review":"I have something to say about the fellow who thinks that this little fake thing is a \\"voice of our generation\\" give me a break. She can't even write her own songs..what is that saying to our \\"generation\\". Have other people do your work for you? And all she cares about is how she looks why do you think she always changes her look. It's because she has to keep up to date with the latest \\"fashions\\". Now what is that saying to little girls? Be shallow and only care about how you look? If she is the voice of our generation then i say god help us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Gum Flop!","review":"This is a disapointing CD. She has poor vocal skills. The 1st CD was much better. Britney is a not to good singer. The songs are really bad. There are some good songs on here. I would expect better from her. People just buy this CD because she looks good. I don't think she is recongized for her singing or her vocal skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"um....she DIDN'T do it","review":"I have to admit, this CD isn't as good as I thought it would be. It's MUCH better than the other on, ...baby one more time, but some of the songs are just really babyish although she states it's got a mature theme. I don't think so. And she talks in the songs. Most of the songs are talking about how great she is, like Oops I did it again, it sounds like she's really great and so all these guys come after her, and she dumps all of them again and again. All the songs are very concieted and immature. This is just my opinion, and if you think that's great, that's fine. I didn't rate it a 1 stars, because i have to admit the improvement from last time."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, she can dance!...and she has a pretty smile...","review":"...but in the end of it all, that does not lead to good music. what ever happened to the days when the writer/composer of the music was heralded? that is where the talent lies anyways, right? it doesn't matter how well anyone can sing (and britney does not have that good of a voice anyway), but the music itself is what we love to hear. let's get back to the days when we honored those that actually wrote the music and not the performers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops...Please Don't Tell Me She's Done It Again","review":"If you're looking for a CD with musical value, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a glittered up, famous-because-of-her-stomach teen queen, stop right here. In fact, never mind--don't, because there are other doll-faced singers that in fact can sing, such as Christina Aguilera. Britney's songs are simple and sickeningly catchy providing the listener with an unsure and unfulfilled feeling. Her voice is undeveloped and whiny leaving the toleration level at about three songs or less. It's sad that a multi-platinum career can be made from looks and promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listeners of this album have no self worth","review":"OK let me start off by saying this is NOT my brand of music. That being said the only reason that I wrote this review is to prove what a load of garbage this is. Spears doesn't write her own music nor does she play it, SHE HARDLY SINGS IT, the computers do much more than she does...that is all i have to say about this album of \\"music\\"Listeners of music-this is an outcry-please save the music industry by helping out the bands who write their own music, and oh my god, they play it too. A word to the wise lay off this crap and try out some of my favorite band..Pink FloydPS-I feel bad for the rolling stones...their song has been desecrated...Enough said"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! She shoudn't do it again......","review":"I give this CD 1 star, I would have given it a zero if it was possible. This album is was horrible but it was better than the first one which tells you that the first one was worse. The girl just can't sing which goes to show that you don't have to have talent to make it in the music business. She needs to leave the high notes to people like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. The whole CD was a remake of her first one with different words set to the same beat. If Britney wants to be around in the long run like her idol Madonna then she needs to come up with better music otherwise she is going to die fast, and her fan base is going to dwindle because the kids who are buying her music now are going to grow up and their tastes are gonna change. Five years from now we'll all ask the same question, Whatever happened to Britney Spears? I hope she is saving her money for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! What a mistake I made","review":"The entire album sounds exactly the same! BORING! I thought after listening to it a few times I would come to like it. It has only annoyed me. If she doesn't come out with some better material than this her popularity and credibility will certainly die off quick. Britney is definately talented, but this CD is no indication of that talent. Would not recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total masterpiece- I think not...","review":"Wow! I really thought that Britney wouldn't be able to top her first album, but just look at this, she did it! I really just love the way she totally and completely ruined classics like Satisfaction (I can't get no) by surrendering them to the shallow, superficial beat of pop music. And speaking of beats Britney-get some new ones. There are only so many times that u can put different lyrics to the same basic beat. I was given this album as a gift. My poor misguided aunt thought that I might like the \\"rolemodel\\"/sex icon's music. I consider this album to be a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"BRITNEY SPEARS\\" spells \\"marketing\\"","review":"Personally, after watching a concert of hers, I think she's either really bad at lip sync or is a really good ventriliquist. You decide which one. Secondly, she seems to be in it for the money more than anything else. Who cares, though, when listening to her music. None of her songs are remotely original, and I'd think that \\"dear diary\\" would make her biggest fan become her worst enemy.

My fave songs from it are What u see(is what u get), Lucky, and Oops I did it again. Britney sounds soo much older in this cd. if u like britney u need 2 get this cd!

I would give the album at least a 4 for the songs lucky and satifaction. I would suggest buying it. And this is coming from someone who hates britney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"OOPS\\"? Making great pop music is no \\"OOPS\\"!","review":"While the title song left something to be desired, I found this cd to be a good listen. I was totally delighted at the hearing of \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\\" which came off suprisingly well because there was no attempt to try to merely cover this song, but to totally reinterpretate it. The song is totally Britney in this incarnation.While this cd sounds much like it's predessor, that is not a bad thing. For those who could not get enough of Britney the first time around they will find this a welcome arrival, and still this cd has Britney's signature vocal style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theres a reason she named it oops.","review":"This CD is a waste of plastic. A waste of money, and a waste of time. Please do not buy this because it really stinks. just because she is not afraid to wear a bra in a music video and not wear a bra on a kids TV show, she is popular. It's sick she is so untalented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, she DID do it again!","review":"She can dance and perhaps sing, but she's only for serious fans of teen pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS , BRITNEY YOU FLOPPED AGAIN!","review":"A Wasted rehash of Baby one more time, The video is Terrible, Yes Britney is beautiful, but her album is a waste of time & money, if you like Britney Spears, go buy it, but it's pretty lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"If i could rate a zero. I would.","review":"Someone needs to teach Britney how to sing. Her songs are really bubblegum songs for her bubble gum fans. I wouldn't waste a penny on her album even if it was worth that much. It should be worth that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!...","review":"Scary how much the title track sounds like her first album. I'm so tired of hearing love and relationships rationalized into bubblegum melodies (I grew up in the age of New Kids...can't help that). Musically, this album pretty much stinks. Is there anything more to music (esp. pop) that has nothing to do with electronic beats and computerized music? I made the mistake of buying this cd... By the way I'm 22 years old, and not 50, so I know plenty about the bubblegum. Chao!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No brainer","review":"If you are between the ages of 8 and 17, forget reading this, as it will no doubt anger and distress you. My review: This recording is designed simply for record labels to market music to a specific audience. Specifically, those between 8 and 17. But you didn't need me to tell you that, did you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops-Did I Spend Money On This?","review":"Even Britney's weak Baby One More Time CD sounds better than Brittney's sopomore album. I was very, very disappointed with this CD. The songs were weak and lacking in everythimg-vocals, lyrics, rythem...most of them aren't the slightest bit catchy! I bought the CD for the famed \\"Oops I Did It Again\\", and am now heartily sorry I wasted my money. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this real?","review":"I think that Britney is a very fake singer and what is withthat cover. She [is really bad], just face it.I think that they just used her because of her looks. If she could get in to that pop buisness then I bet anyone could. At least Christina is a hack of a lot better. She is actually real unlike Britney. This sucks. The only song on here that makes me happy is Dear Diary because I can relate to some stuff she says but she isn't real. If you like christina don't buy this. She seems like she has the same music for all of her songs and it is all boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROPAGANDA","review":"Britney is the true meaning of propaganda. She is always on TV, radio, and magazines selling the wrong thing. Britney Spears is just as bad as the local drug dealer. Just like the local drug she is pumping truck load of smack into the youth of America. I am also 18 and I can say that I have more on my mind than just boys and needing love from a boy. Come on when are teen performers going to start to helping the youth to over come things like teen pregnancy, killing on school grounds, not getting a education, self esteem, and etc. Not all teens are shallow. And now on the music note the girl can not sing live or studio. I don't care who tells me she can sing, they're lying. The songs on both of her albums are bad and sick. And if people really need some good bad a** pop/r&b/rock/whatever buy Janet Jackson for power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely worthless, but average and sometimes painful","review":"I'll admit, i loathe all that is connected with pop music and teeny boppers. I'll also admit that this isn't the worst thing i've ever heard. Britney is a decent singer and certainly has presence. And she has indeed grown up from her paper-thin facade of a little schoolgirl. But she also sings incredibly predictable mainstream pop that seems recycled through four or five groups/singers like her. The cover of Satisfaction is really hard to listen to and i found myself legitmately angry after hearing it. Overall it is just really average pop garbage and i can only hope music moves away from this lame mediocrity very soon. In five years, we'll look back at this era and laugh at these people like we do now at Samantha Fox or New Kids On The Block. Come on, kids, we can do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops- She Did It Again and you bought it!","review":"This has to be the worst CD I ever listened to! Someone in my family bought this CD and was nice enough to let me take a listen. It hurt my head! Like her first CD, there is too much of something. Unlike her last Cd, which had nothing to make me want to dance, this has too much hard edge! Britney, you may have shot to the top, but try something else! There's more then your soda-pop and rock n' roll image. Belive me, this CD is not a number 1 in my book. Maybe next time, but for now, this is a real OOPS, SHE'S DONE IT AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Waste Your Money!","review":"I bought this CD because I liked Oops I did it agian. I really was ripped-off. The girl can't sing. The only reason she has lasted that long is because of her body. I wasted my money. So take my advice and don't make my same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This CD is possibly one of the worst CDs EVER. At least I can't say It's Britney that's making it awful, because she doesen't write (not surprising, eh?) her own songs. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!Listen to someone like Fefe Dobson, No Doubt or Vitamin C. Much higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This new cd from Britney Spears is absolutely wonderful. Its a perfect sophmore album for an up and coming pop star. Her ballads are wonderful and her upbeat songs just make you want to get up and dance. I admit the little voice overs are a little annoying but nontheless i would reccomend this to anyone who likes to feel good and listen to good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those about to pop, we salute you.","review":"Don't tell anyone, but I have a real soft spot for sugar coated teen pop, so it was with great anticipation that I awaited the second opus from the reigning monarch of melody, Britney Spears. Overcome your musical racism, folks, this is a great album. Her first effort was, singles aside, a bit thin - but second time around Ms. Spears packs many zippy little numbers into her alotted 48 minutes. The first listen is a bit of a strain, but a few spins later and you'll find an armful of winners shining through. The title track rocks (naturally), as does What You See (Is What You Get) and the Backstreet Boys knock-off, Stronger. However, this listener favors Lucky, a perky ditty that guarantees a spot of the old toe-tapping. Well done, Britney."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS I WRECKED KINGDOM HEARTS","review":"THIS ALBUMS GOT SONGS ON A WEIRD VERSION OF KINGDOM HEARTS YOU KNOW THIS POP STYLE IS TOO MUCH FOR MY EARS AND NAINME:I LIKE YOU BUT UR MUSICS AWFUL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Telling Portrait of How Over-Produced Popular Music Is","review":"Britney Spears is not a talented singer. Truth be told, the above album attempts to cover this up with the latest in technology - space-aged technology. But no amount of Pro Tools reverb can cover up this simple fact: talentless dribble will not last the test of time and become part of the next Time-Life music anthology."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS! Britney bombs again","review":"I really don't know where to start. This album is just the pits. Britney epitomises bland commercialism. She has no imput whatsoever into her songs. She is essentially a puppet whose sole purpose is to generate revenue. Her songs all sound the same and display no originality. Indeed, 3 of the songs on this album use the same hook as \\"baby, One More Time\\". Her songs are pervaded with synchronised sounds and meaningless chitchat, adding to the overriding sense of manufactured \\"music\\" that hangs over this record.Undoubtedly, Britney does look good and she CAN dance. However, she is miles away from being classified a true artist. This album, along with its pathetic and meaningless first single \\"OOPS\\", represents music at its most despicable....a money making venture. I'm sorry Britney but your so-called \\"talent\\" is NOT being showcased here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why listen to this garbage?","review":"honestly, all her songs are sexual in some way. the way she poses, moves, dresses is wrong and sends the wrong message across. she is unmodest, makes herself into some sex toy on stage and videos, cant sing to save her life. Rebecca St. James is definetly a good alternative that has enough self-confidence in her looks and voice that she doesnt have to wear a [...] outfit on all her albums or cover-up her voice with a computer. get her Transform album. Great pop/rock/teckno-style music with a good message, better voice, and in my oponion, better looking artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"love with an elevator","review":"Sorry, but it was not possible to give no stars!The most remarkable thing about this musically is, that they don't have to take away the voices before they play it on the elevator or in the supermarkets, it's already shallow enough. Plus the fact that we are doomed to remember this bubblegum-sticky slime just because it is so popular that we will be tortured by it everywhere we go. I am not Madonnas greatest fan, but from the first moment there was the potential of controversy. Britany Spears has only one potential: making money, for a product that is great, for an artist it is not enough. Watch out, this noise is bad for your teeth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..for 12 year olds","review":"Britney can dance, but shes not much at picking out someone to mix her CD's. This new CD is over mixed and all the songs have the EXACT same beat, even the slow songs. The only good songs on the CD have already been released and are all over MTV. She can dance, got to give her that. But next time Britney, have someone else mix the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I knew how to grimace on the Internet...","review":"I used to love Britney Spears. Her songs are, well, were, wholesome, sweet and lighthearted stuff kids could enjoy without having to fight with their parents everytime they put this on. When \\"OOps\\" came out, I was so excited. After I heard the title track, I tried to remain excited, but I was lying to myself. I don't like this CD. Try as I might, Britney Spears will always be nothing more than a product- much like the Pepsi-Cola she's endorsing now to make even more money off of us. (Bob Dole A.K.A. Mr. E.D. at the end is REALLY sickening.) Her only good song \\"Lucky\\" and semi-bearable song \\"What U See\\" are not reason enough to waste money on this. (Money that goes to a person who, by the way, won't even sign autographs for her fans.) After three years of the \\"pop princess\\"'s domain, I think it's time for her to abdicate to someone more deserving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly better than first album","review":"OK, Ms. Spears' sophomore effort is slightly better than her debut album. The lyrics are more mature, yes, but it doesn't change the fact that Britney's horrible voice totally drags down the songs. The listenable ones are #1, 2, 5, 7 and 9. The rest are bad. Period. Ms. Spears also still dresses like a skeezer (this year's VMAs for example), and obviously thinks that she's a sex goddess. She is gorgeous, yes, but she's not a good singer. I still say Christina is far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a CD!","review":"This is a great cd! While her voice isn't like Whitney or Mariah, she can sing, her voice is very sweet and soft. A good departure from a screaming little wanna-be we all know of. I don't see why people say she can't sing, she can, have you seen her sing on Star Search? She actually sings better than Christina when Christina was on star search.. This CD is the one to get.. No doubt about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"She did it again - what more need we say?","review":"Being in the teenaged crowd, I have already heard this album ten times over even though I do not own it myself. It is absolutely nothing new or original, just the same glossed-over pop, plus an insulting rendition of \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction.\\" Britney Spears has done it before, and people have bought it, and now it seems the mindless teen population is falling for it again. If you want to listen to some pop that's actually really good and imaginative, try the lesser known Japanese group's first american album \\"Dreams Come True.\\" Britney's sound is the same old trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"very very dissappointing","review":"I knew that this was going to be a very very bad album from the first moment i heard OOps i did it ageain. The first album was way better but what can i say she is going in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the phrase, \\"negative role model\\" mean anything?","review":"In a world of constantly evolving teens into a more and more sexually active and violent society it seems that Britney has added her own ideal of what the typical teenie bopper should be. Grotesque and ultimately too revealing, her fashion sense gives the American teenager the idea that dressing less is acceptable. I'm not saying that long skirts and long sleeve shirts are correct, but where are the days when not showing skin was MORE provactive? These days nothing is left to the imagination, what a shame since imagination can often be more stimulating. Britney tells the teenage girls of today that sex sells, and boy does she use it to sell her album. Her voice is like a nasal piccolo. The songs have no substance and the believability that Britney has acutally experienced any of the lyrics is laughable. My suggestion, if you have an IQ of 2, buy this album, since you're probably in a vegetative state anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the best","review":"She has really cool music. Almost everyone I know likes it. All the songs are cool. I've been dying to have my own CD because she's got such good music and I love it. But my brothers don't like it as much, so they won't let me listen to it when they're in my room."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's cute but can't sing","review":"I've been reading many of the reviews and I appreciate the difficulty of writing an unbiased one. But I'll try anyway. The fact that Britney does not write her own songs does not bother me as much as her blatant use of sex appeal to gather an audience for her superficial songs. I'm strongly inclined to believe that her music video of Oops...I did it again played a strong role in promoting her newest album. I'm not saying that sex appeal is wrong; on the contrary, many notable artists are able to use it skillfully to add color to their more sensuous song. But seeing someone as young as Britney attempting to reach out to a male audience by using premature sexuality with her tongue and body language is just disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS! More FOrmula","review":"Having Heard this Disc&what not I'm Amazed at Her Popularity.The Music Here is No different than her First Disc.also The Material Her SOunds right along the Lines of N-Sync,Backstreet,Christina etc...The title cut alone is Baby one more time with different words.Only The New Jack Swing of the Rolling Stones Satisfaction captures anything different here.and that unto itself is Suspect cuz DIE-Hard Rolling Stone Fans will Flip their Wigs on that.but had Britney gone that Route instead of The Predictable one on the Other songs She would have had an Interesting Disc.but this Set is pure FORMULA.The Writing,Production&The Sameness of The Vocals.aside from that one song all hype&no Substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"SHE'S JUST ANOTHER POSER, I HATE HER CAUSE HER VOICE IS ELECTRONIC AND VERY FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grumble Grumble","review":"I don't like Britney Spears...I think she sounds like a cross between an electronic chipmunk and a toddler! =P"},{"rating":"1","title":"FROM A 13 YEAR OLD MUSIC FAN.....","review":"Okay , I'll be honest, this cd isn't as bad as her 1st one , but it still has some of the most sillest , most laughable music I have ever heard in all my 13 years of life!!! First of all the song's suck anyway, but adding Britney's very untalented chipmunk voice makes them even worse.... It makes me sick to see all these people buy her cds and give this girl all this money. When she doesn't even do half the work that a hard-working , talent artist would do. She doesn't even write her own songs and has the nerve to call them \\"my music\\". Britney is probley more worried about how she looks when she gets up in the morning , than she is about getting voice lessons (whice she so despretly needs!) or figureing out to be taken more seriously ( sluttey clothes and stupid pop-tart bubblegum music, PLEASE!!) So unless your a fan of crap like this don't buy this cd!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POP TART","review":"Plastic headed Britney is what we call a Pop Tart. She's got looks, but her music is trite and she can't even sing for her supper. I absolutely hate her \\"Baby, One More Time\\" and I haven't heard anything else that I like by her. I'd rather hear bulldozers than Britney. Britney doesn't sound half as good as my friend's basset hound, Dixie. When Dixie throws back her head and bays, she keeps better time and sounds better than Britney ever did. Tell Britney to leave singing to the big girls like Mariah Carey and Selena. They are real talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preety good cd, but not as good as the first one","review":"I have to admit when i heard the cd for the first time it wasnt that great. But when you listen to it more it gets better and better. I really like what you see is wat u get and lucky. The rest of the other songs are preety good too except dear diary. I cant stand that song. Its so annoying. Other then that its a preety good cd and i really recommend you to buy it. People probably give this cd such bad reviews just cause there jealous of her, cuz shes preety, a good singer, and a great dancer. If people say that she cant sing, then how did she even get two cds released. THat has to show talent for singing. I mean she already sold like twenty million copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Audience","review":"Britney Spears is oh so over hyped. Her musical vision for the most part is oh so limited to 10-15 year olds.There are a few creative twists here and there with Britney rapping with her friends. The beat is pretty cool but certainly gets stale after a while. And the lyrics are oh so juvenile. I like the opening track and a few other songs are decent. However, the artifical unoriginal musical arrangment makes the impression tolerable at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!... I Did It Again","review":"1. Oops! I Did It Again 1/52. Stronger 5/53.

Don't even get me started with the Satisfaction song, a disgrace to say the least. More mature? not as much as we had imagined. I will admit the Oops I did it again song is a rather catchy, but thats the only song really worth commending, go find the mp3. At least there is Aguilera, who can actually carry a note. But hey, as long as Spears has her image, she'll sell records, unfortunatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is an idiot cd","review":"whatever she sings.... man! it's idiotic!!! it's obvious that she's just cashing in on her 'popularity' and this is just a bag of s***. the woman can't sing, she just basically sells herself to get album sales and people... it's just the packaging. the song oops i did it again is such an inane piece of drivel that it's sickening that there are people who writes this kind of stuff and call it art!!! i wanted to give this a -20 marks fer it's sheer ridiculousness but they wouldn't let me. the song stronger nearly killed me the 1st time i heard it because at the start she was shouting GREARGHHHHHH... YEEEAAAAAHHH!!!! and i thought that a frog was stuck in her throat! the song is really tasteless coz it's not 'catchy' and the beat is terrible... it just flies everywhere and it sounds worse than any racket that my 1 year old niece can produce. i can't even believe they're selling this vile pile of horrible, horrible art!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!... She did it again","review":"Oops, we all wasted our money and time, hearing this stuff. She couldn't come up with original songs. No originality. Period. She is just a mixture of non-talented song writers who cover-up garbage with Britneys cute little self. Too bad for us, a cd doesn't show pictures of her during the songs. Since, we are reviewing contents, This cd sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops...Another Hit!","review":"Britney's new CD is a great buy. If you liked her first, you'll love her second!

Great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's no \\"Baby One More Time\\"","review":"Britney has grown up, for sure. Her songs are more mature and worldly wise, but the upbeat pop sound is gone. None of the songs ever take off, and her rendition of the Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\" is blasphemy. It's good to hear her again, but don't believe the hype. This is a sophomore slump and she will have to retool for a comeback next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit Us One More Time...","review":"A lot of people compare this CD to Britney Spears' first. I think it's all it's own. Oops...I Did It Again is great, I must've watched the video online about a million times. I love this song. In fact, I'm listening to it right now! The last song, Dear Diary is Brotney's first venture into songwriting. Pretty good for a first try! The only song I had a problem with was I (Can't Get No) Satisfaction, becase the beging is so slow. But overall, this CD is really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney DOES IT AGAIN! :)","review":"Britney Spears new album does show that Yes, she can do it again! Britney works with a lot of big time song writers and producers. Shania Twain writes four songs for Britney Including ''Dont Let Me Be The Last To know'', ''Lucky'', ''Dont Go Knockin On My Door'' and ''Dear Diary''. Britney also co wirtes two songs on this record with ''Dear Diary'' and ''Stronger''. This album is like a mariah carey album..its so personal and it tells a story if you listen closley enough. When you get this album...you will be amazed that there is a secret track after Dear Diary...the song is called ''Sunflower'', this song was writen by Mairah Carey, this song is a cute personal song..its about a girl who begins to bloosom into a star....its a great song. Get this album you wont be mad! Britney sohws us all that she is a STAR....and she will be around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I surprisingly liked this CD. I have to say that Britney has grown as a artist, and this CD, is a lot better than her first one. She has a lot of songs that you can dance too, and some nice ballads as well. The only songs that I didn't like were \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door,\\" and \\"Lucky.\\" Overall I would recommend this CD, to anyone who likes Pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the talent?","review":"Well, gosh, folks, it may be catchy and it may want to you make to dance, but ya know what? It would be twice as good if she could sing. Her inane growl and numerous (to the point of being uncountable) vocal hiccups detract from any appeal the songs may have had. I have nothing against, the girl, I'm sure she's very nice, and of course she's pretty, but that doesn't mean she should be riding to stardom on a FAR below par voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not a disappointment","review":"If you liked Baby One More Time, then you definitely will not be disappointed with this album. Britney returns with her enthusiam and energy in 12 new songs. For once, I finally have found a cd in which I like EVERY song in it. Some of her songs are better than others, but all are fun and/or relaxing to listen to. If there's anything wrong with this cd, its that there's no song that matches my favorite, Sometimes. However, all I think that means is that a song that excellent cannot be topped, thus that should not be held against this album.My favorite songs on this album are tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, and 12. However, the others are also pleasant to listen to, and should not be scorned upon.Overall, if you like Britney Spears, then you should get this album immediately. If not, then you should stop believing all the silly rumors and actually sit down and listen to her songs in their entirety. If you don't then you really don't know what you're missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... An okay sophomore album effort","review":"Im not a big Britney Spears fan but I do like some songs in this album. The one that stands out for me is \\"oops I did it again\\", \\"stronger\\", and \\"can't make you love me\\". Those are the only tracks I think is appealing and danceable to listen to. The rest are pretty annoying and in my opinion will only appeal to younger teens. But i had to give Britney's album a chance cause she's one hot girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"oops, I almost listened to it","review":"What's the difference between Britney Spears and a dog's rubber chew toy? Answer...one of them makes loud annoying squeaky sounds, and the other is a rubber chew toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another horrid album from Britney","review":"Look I dont generally like B. Spears, this album to be honest is not very good. I mean a real artist is someone who writes their songs and the songs mean something. You can tell she didn't write the songs. She does nothing but lip synch and dance half naked to get more attention for herself, because she has low self esteem.Avoid her."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 1 good track","review":"This CD was a waste of money. It only had one good song, \\"Opps...I did it again.\\" She's right, opps, I bought another one of her CDs again. All the songs have that same beat to them. If I knew this, I'd just listen to \\"Baby one more time\\" over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO WORDS- OVER RATED!","review":"i expected soooooo much better! this cd is ok, nothing special. i dont recommend this cd. this cd and her first cd sound the same to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"OKAY","review":"I know,I know. Everyone is whining that she doesn't write her own songs. Neither does Whitney Houston or Celine Dion! The only divas I can think of off hand that do are Mariah Carey and Madonna(and they just co-write.)It's a pop album! Give her break and I must say,it's entertaining. The title track \\"Oops!I Did It Again\\" is probably one of the catchiest songs ever to hit radio and the cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\" could have been a lot worse. So,if you're planning to buy this,you might want to change your mind depending on taste,but I say,go for it. But,if you want a REALLY good pop album that can appeal to all ages,I say the Backstreet Boys' Millenium. In my opinion,Millenium is one of the best pop CDs to hit the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I think this is the best album in the world! Britney's voice is so beautiful. The thing I like a lot on this album (besides the songs, duh!) is that she has little speaking interludes (three of them, i think) it's so cool. I think she's done a great job on this album and I'm glad her next single is gonna be \\"Lucky\\"! It's my favorite song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a better CD than the first one","review":"\\"Oops! I Did It Again\\" is a good CD. The songs are more girl-power oriented than the first CD. The majority of songs is about the girl telling a guy exactly what she is. For example, \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" is telling a guy that she's not going to change for him. There's also the title track, which is more, playful. The girl is kind of playing with the guy's head. Then there's \\"Stronger\\", \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\" and \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\". The first two are about breaking up and not regretting it. \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction) is really good. It's about knowing what you want. However, there are softer songs like \\"Dear Diary\\" which is about seeing a guy and really liking him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney's Masterpiece Of Pop Perfection!","review":"Britney Spears' \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" album may be over one year old, but it is still supplying the world with pop hits. The latest single, \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know,\\" debuted at number one on MTV's Total Request Live. The critically acclaimed ballad shows a much more mature Spears - as does the rest of this excellent album. \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" also supplies the record breaking title track, the TRL and radio smash \\"Lucky\\" and the empowerment anthem \\"Stronger.\\" Among those singles are very strong album tracks including Britney's R&B cover of the Rolling Stone's \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\\" the ode to individuality, \\"What U See (Is What U Get),\\" and the Spears penned \\"Dear Diary.\\" There is not a weak song on this 12 track LP. Look for Britney in her new movie \\"What Friends Are For\\" and her new album, tentatively titled \\"Shock Your Mind\\" due out in November."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, Britney, dance... but please don't sing!!","review":"I think she is a cute girl, but who the hell told her she can sing? When you watch her videos, you rather press the mute button on your remote, and enjoy the only worthy thing about her... ANy way, who cares..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nooooooooooo!","review":"I like Britney Spears but she didn't do it again. The only way this album would be good is if it were emo like Baby One More Time. But it's not. Lucky is not emo in the least, it's pseudo-emo, sort of like Knapsack. There's noooooo emo! Don't buy it! Buy New Found Glory! EMOOOOOOOOOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Auuuuuuuuuggghhhhhh!","review":"Oops, she did it again. She insulted the intelligence of every man, woman, and child on this earth by thinking that this \\"music\\" (which she doesn't even write) is something that we should spend thirteen dollars on. If you are a young male and are attracted to her, by all means, go out and buy posters and save yourself the money on this music. If you're a young woman and like her voice (which would imply to me that you haven't heard the plethora of woman musicians out there) may I suggest something like the Indego Girls, not that I am an Indego girls fanatic, but you would hear a different style (and in my opinion, much deeper development) of the female voice. And if you just like the upbeat and bubble-gum-poppy nature of her songs, well, then God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get no satisfaction with this \\"album\\"","review":"I can't believe that there are some people out there thinking that she wrote the song \\"(I can't get no) Satisfaction\\". This Rolling Stones' masterpiece doesn't deserve this absurd remake. Boring and stupid \\"album\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average album.","review":"This album is better that Spears's debut, but there still is nothing that great about it. The only songs that I listen to are \\"Stronger\\" and \\"(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney Speared","review":"I am not a Brit-Basher, and make no attempts to be. However, this album was pretty weak. Although Britney is the \\"Pop Princess\\" she simply hasn't any substance. Her rendition of \\"Satisfaction\\" is extremely untrue to the original, and a great disappointment. This album lacks in identity. This CD was a fun listen for a week or so, but the novelty of \\"Oops...\\" has worn off, and the CD has sat in the rack ever since. Don't waste your time on something with so little longevity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good to me","review":"The title track is peppy and infectious. Where Are You Now, Stronger, When Your Eye's Say It and Dear Diary are all interesting and easy to listen to. I was disappointed in her version of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is inferior to the other songs on the album and drops my rating to 4 stars. With the exception of that song, I'm glad I bought the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney keeps getting better all the time!","review":"Though I like Britney's first CD, I have to say that it is lacking substance. Songs like \\"E-mail My Heart\\" and \\"Soda Pop\\" are catchy, but pointless! Lets face it. On her new album, the songs have a point! \\"Stronger\\" talks about proving yourself and increasing your self confidence, and \\"Lucky\\" talks about a young celebrity's hardships. Not only do the songs have more substance, but her voice sounds more refined and matured, like she put more effort and time into the recording. There is also more variety. It reminds me a lot of 'N Sync's new CD. I think Britney is maturing and it shows in her music. If she keeps this up, she'll be around for years to come! I just hope she starts writing some of her own material!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn right you did it again, crashed and burned that is","review":"Although i can thankfully say that Britney is not my usuall 'Music' taste, yes music is in commas because im not sure if it is music, i still have to put this CD down as the commercial music industry making billions off a little girls success who should be in school.Dont get me wrong i admire britney for what shes achieved but think this, would she sell millions and millions of records if she looked like Barbara Streisand? I didnt think so, its the millions of men and boys who buy her CD so they can see her on TV, its just her s** appeal that sells.Thats why i give this album 1 star coz she cant even sing, anyone could do what she does, shes just another pretty face, tell me has anyone ever seen her with no make up on? then you'll get a fright!Im sorry if i've offended her true fans, to you guys i give you my applause because you probably like her for her 'music', theres those comma again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brittany Spears is a Bad Role Model","review":"Brittany Spears is a bad role model for children all around the world. She sings through her nose and her songs are nauseating. Her clothes are inappropriate and are degrading to women around the world. She is a sex object. Oops!...I Did It Again is a song about her toying with a man. Children look up to pop stars and try to be like them. You see 4 year olds trying to \\"look like Brittany.\\" She should respect herself enough to dress nicely and be a good role model for children. Boys need to realize all women don't look like Brittany and she doesn't help stress this fact. I think Brittany should either start acting as a better role model because although children shouldn't, they look up to Britanny because they don't know any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a paradox","review":"Yes she's beautiful and I would marry her in a second, but damn. She's not a musician in the most stretched out form of the word, and hardly a good singer. At best she's an entertainer doing other people's work and taking damn near all credit for it. What happened to people writing their own music? What's that--Britney tried to write a song but it didn't turn out too good? Oh darn, let her struggle. And her voice gets annoying if I hear more than one of her songs at a time. Go get an appreciation for good music (i.e. jazz or classical or almost anything before 1980)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually I wanted to give it 6 stars !","review":"It just rules. I love every single song on the album ! What more can I say. My advise ... go and buy this album ! I am more of an Eminem fan myself but if an Eminem fan likes this album then anyone would !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment from first album","review":"I liked the first album alot, and keep in mind I'm a guy who usually listens to only heavy metal. This one however, loses just about all that made the first one good. The sweet, innocent, somewhat submissive Britney is gone, and a cruel, domineering Britney has taken her place. The title track is about a girl who loves to play with a guy's heart, breaking it again and again. It's such an evil song. The only songs I like on it are \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know,\\" \\"What you see (Is what you get),\\" and \\"Lucky.\\" 3 good songs out of 10. \\"Don't let me be the last to know\\" has that sweet soulful sound that she used to possess. I guess \\"Oops\\" has a nice beat, but the lyrics are so cruel that I can't listen to it. Worth about 5 dollars based on those three good songs. Get the first one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not As Good As I Thought","review":"Following her multiplatinum debut, Britney spear's 2nd album is most anticipated by fans. I'm not a fan of hers but i bought the album cause i heard there were songs by Diane Warren and Shania Twain. Sadly, there's little in here that i can praise, it's just that most of the songs are not that memorable. Also some of the songs sound recycled from her first album.But to give credit where credit is due, Britney sounds affecting on the last track, Dear Diary which she co-wrote and that one was touching.Hopefully, a more matured Britney in the future will put out stronger material and hone her voice to greater heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressing","review":"Although some of the songs on her CD are okay...they all sound a lot alike. The tunes are about the same and the lyrics aren't very mature. It really wasn't as good as I thought. If you are a wild Britney Spears fan then go ahead and buy it, but if you're buying it because you like \\"Oops!...I did it again\\" I wouldn't reccommend you buy it 'cause the rest of the songs are a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Britney has matured more since her last album. \\"Oops...\\" has more of a dance flavor than the first album. Most songs sound \\"cookie cutterish\\" though. But for all you Britney Spears fans this album is a MUST buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best","review":"If you are looking for one great album, this is it. Although she is already recording her 3rd album right now, you will have to wait til october to pick it up, so why dont you go buy this one. It's an awesome pop cd. Better than anything anybody has put out before. She changes her style a lot in this cd. in \\"...Baby one more time\\" the lyrics were young in the sense that she depended on a guy all of the time, but now she is \\"stronger\\" and she has grown and learned the ropes of relationships. This whole album tells a story. Her great/ bluesy/pop-tart voice is stunning. All the tracks are guaranteed hits! Go buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Cd I ever bought!!!","review":"From the music to the CD booklet, this Cd is brilliant! The album consists of 13 huge hits, all with its own unique rhythm : From the beautiful ballets of Don't let me be the last to know & Where are you now, to the rock/ hard beat songs Stronger & satisfaction. This is such an improvement on the first album, and there isn't one song i give lower than 9. Each song dosen't drag on either. They all have speech in between them, Britney on the phone etc... to connect the songs. Any fan should have this album, and i think the CD has styles of music for all music lovers! Oh, and the pictures are really hot of britney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney did the same album again!","review":"Britney did the same album again.The sound is absolutely the same of her first album.Only the lyrics are different but the sound is the same.Anyway, i don't like her music very much"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!... She Made a Terrible Album... AGAIN","review":"I'm not a Britney-hater. Honest. I know she's the type of girl people love to hate. I just am being honest when I say she has absolutely no singing talent and all her music is over-manufactured. It is very obvious with every \\"oh baby\\" that this CD was written by a 40-year-old Swedish pop master (i.e. Max Martin.) Every song has a tried and true formula: verse/chorus/verse/chorus/verse/chorus refrain/chorus x2. It gets really dull by the third track, and Ms. Spears's cover of the Rolling Stones \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" is just horrendous. Most of the songs are regurgitated pop dance tunes, but Britney throws in a few sickly ballads that she's notorious for - \\"When Your Eyes Say It,\\" \\"Dear Diary,\\" \\"Don't Let Me be the Last to Know,\\" and \\"Where Are You Now.\\" The only good track is \\"One Kiss From You.\\" That's it. This album is a waste of money and very disappointing.

Seriously, when I heard \\"What You see is What You Get\\" I thought it was Oops I did it Again. And Dear Diary? Lmao...that song is just so funny. I guess she wrote it and the lyrics go as follows:Dear Diary, Today I saw a boy and I wondered if he noticed me he took my breath awayok, you get it. This album is awful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"EW","review":"I feel sorry for all of those who have fallen victim to this record label creation. Britney Spears has no talent, her songs have no meaning, and she does not play any instruments. She defys all regular meanings of the word 'singer' Like all of the bubblegum pop singers before her, including the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Christina Aguilera, and others, her songs are over-played, over-hyped, and totally unintelligible from the rest of the bad music that plagues our air waves. Let's start listening to bands with talent, whose music inspires us or sends a message, and who actually do more than dance as poorly as they sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pity i cant go below one star","review":"i would strongly appeal to people who love good music to stay very far away from this terrible woman and her worthless tuneless albums please.my rating would be half a star only."},{"rating":"1","title":"..........what can I say about this crap?","review":"ok, her first album wasn't that good.

Hot girl, hot CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!.. I Did It Again","review":"I'm confused. Why does she sound like she's singing into a bottle in every other song. If that's what's new and fashionable, then I think popular music is in big trouble. I don't think I like Britney all grown up. I prefer she hits me baby one more time! She won't last if she keps this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus On The Facts!!","review":"While a lot of people feel it's relevant to discuss whether or not Britney has implants or uses her body to further her career, the bottom line is: SHE CAN'T SING! All the twelve-year-olds who feel that everyone who \\"denies Britney's talent\\" is jealous of her looks or fame are obviously just trying to defend their idol, regardless of what kind of music she puts out. Song after song on this album is repetitive and shallow garbage that was masterminded by people who have long left their teen years behind. I won't knock the girl for her sole attempt at writing a song, but how she even got a record contract is beyond me. If you want to hear the horrendous voice for yourself, my suggestion is to download a few songs (from either album, since they both sound the same) for a taste before making up your mind on whether or not you can actually tolerate listening to a full CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, really bad","review":"I have always been a fan of \\"good\\" pop music, but this is so far from good it is not funny. The songs on the CD all sound alike, which makes for very boring listening. Ms. Spears vocals are far from good, she looks like she still belongs on the Mickey Mouse Club when she is compared to Celine Dion, Christina Aguillera, and Jennifer Simpson. If you were a fan of Ms. Spears debut release then you might enjoy this dud, if you are not don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear God","review":"Hopefully Britney Spears and all of the other bubblegum pop acts will disappear in the next few years (how about in the next few days) but that isn't likely to happen (of course my predictions are always wrong). I don't expect an 11-year-old to listen to music with any meaning, so they're off the hook. As for the rest of you, there is no hope if you're spending your days listening to this talentless Madonna wannabe (and it's not like Madonna is a great singer either, but at least and co-writes and co-produces her own material). Oh and I can hardly wait for her acting career. But then again, her music career is already an act."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars if possible!","review":"Thanks to the wonderful sources of the internet, I was able to listen to the whole cd of Britney Spears sohpmore album a month before it's release date, May 16th. All the songs are nothing but artificial fluff and no depth whatsoever. Her debut album is SO much better than this one. Her version of \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\\" is an insult to the Rolling Stones. There isn't anything mature about this album, she's trying to maintain her audience of youngsters to the adolescent years. \\"Dear Diary\\" is just as cheesy as \\"Email My Heart.\\" Her voice sounds EXACTLY the same as the last album, in which she recorded the songs when she was 15/16... we all know it's studio enchanced, her real voice is very raspy and deep. Save some good money and don't buy this album, even if you DO want to look at those eye catching photographs in the cd case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Improvement on Debut","review":"Britney definitley improves on her second effort, more catchy tunes, but over-oooozed with ballads, Very cool though. Songs like \\"Oops!\\",\\"Lucky\\",\\"Dont let me be the...\\",\\"One Kiss From You\\", And \\"STRONGER\\"!! AND \\"Dont go knokin' on my door\\", and \\"[I cant get no] Satisfaction\\" Proves this isnt a cheese-fest! This album rocks and Britney rocks Isnt as good as some of her works down the road but it is definitley a highlight, I mean Who DOSENT know the song \\"Oops! I did It Again!\\" This is a highlight of her career, though I think \\"Toxic\\" Is getting more attention!. I truly think this is a vaaast improvement on her first, filled with cheesy ballads and corny dance tunes. I reccomend this to any Brits fan, though I think its worth 3 and 1/2 stars, 4 is OK though. Peace Out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"listening to this makes me queesy","review":"this cd is not worth you're money. all of the songs sound the same. oops i did it again sounds just like hit me baby, and even songs like bye bye bye.it makes me so furious that people go insane over these bubblegum pop bands.\\"ooh, it must be so hard to be a singer, when all you do is let people write the songs for you, and have pictures taken of you every where you go\\"! i can see that she must work to accomplish so much fame, what, with all the computers enhancing her voice, and traveling around to make videos. and as much as she does herself, which isn't much, other bands are strugling, writing their own, worth listining to, songs, and don't get a penny for it. the only thing you really hear when listening to her, and other bands like her, is, \\"i'm rich, and you're giving you're money to me! and what am i doing? exploiting myself\\". anyway, that's probly what she's thinking as she sings these songs that everyone goes gaga over."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think there probably is some talent there but...........","review":"She has been turned in to the great T/A show.

Sorry, it's all pop trash, just like all the teen trash that dominates US radio all the damn time. And what's the big idea of having a teen like Britney covering a Rolling Stones song like \\"I Can't Get On Satisfaction,\\" huh? It's bad enough 'N Sync attempted \\"That Thing You Do\\" on their second televised concert. I'd rather hear Céline Dion singing Queen's \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" over this pop trash. Real music and people with BETTER voices like my Bocelli and Lauryn Hill can't have publicity at the moment. Or airplay. Don't worry, all you concerned parents. It'll be over soon.

I've heard this CD, some parts are catchy but all in all, you could spend your money on something else and feel more satisfied. I feel in general people are getting somewhat tired of the wining baby vocals that don't \\"cut-it\\" on stage. The first few months of the debut album was interesting but I suggest that Britney look into other avenues of the entertainment industry. She's a terribly good looking girl so may be film... but that's not very imaginative (kinda like this album)??? Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"This is a great cd. It has incredible beats and amazing lyrics. She has definately grown as an artist without straying from her pop beginnings. My personal favorite song is Lucky the story of a famous actress who has everything but love. It does sound cheesy I know but it really shows people that you can have so much money and fame but you can still be lonely. I think Britney is a great influence for girls today because she went for what she wanted but she still stayed close to her family and is a humble small town girl.

Unlike that tonedeaf Alanis Morissette, Britney can actually hit the notes but her voice..well..it's...um... it's just not very good. It's just an ordinary voice singing a bunch of mediocre songs. Just like Morissette, Britney's key to success is her packaging. In the case of Alanis, she's billed as an \\"angry female\\" (it's own tired genre) while Britney's packaging is literally her packaging (something that clearly can't be said about Alanis!). It looks great, but you can easily look at it while listening to something else.I bought this CD for the karaoke tracks because \\"fixing\\" these songs in karaoke is an incredible amount of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops..she did it again...she broke the barriers","review":"I must say, Britney Spears is the world's most eye-on person.

Her first album, \\"Baby on more time...\\" was a smash hit, but was only little leauge compared to her latest album, \\"Oops...I did it again\\" has become the record breaking album of the year. The songs replicate stories and notes from a dairy; \\"Oops...I did it again\\", a story about a boy, thinking she's a nice little girl, but she's not! \\"Stronger\\", a jaming sequel to \\"baby one more time\\" about getting back at her boyfriend. Finally, there's \\"Lucky\\", a sad story about a famous (and snotty) girl who then gets sad and lonely because she has no one to love. The list pretty much goes on with great songs. A definate buy. I love you, Britney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS!..ANOTHER HORRIBLE ALBUM.","review":"When will people realise that this little girl is all image and no substance.Dont get me wrong,she's veru cute but she cant sing for beans.All the lyrics are very cheesy and she probably didnt write any of them.She is just a puppet of the record industry and she lacks any originality.Why would anybody with half a brain purchase a 20 dollar cd thats only really worth 3 dollars.All this girl really cares about is using your money to shop for clothes and to act like a snobby brat.I dont understand why people support her when she clearly could care less about her fans.She needs to grow up because she doesnt know how the world really is.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMMERCIAL PRINCESS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney is an entertainer, not a musician!","review":"I really enjoy this album and cannot wait for her new one to come out.

What a lot of people complain about is the way she dresses and how she doesn't write her own music. Although I don't like the way she dresses and she doesn't write her own music, she is a great entertainer. She is an awesome dancer! You have to take her for what she truly is, not compare her to something she isn't. As for all the other girls in pop (Christina, Jessica, Mandy...etc) I think they are just trying to ride off of Britney's fame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know I won't endear myself to her millions of fans, but...","review":"SHE DID DO IT AGAIN! How she managed to, after the first release is beyond me. \\"Oops!\\" slips with the artist's very limited vocals and extremely weak lyrics. But, I suppose, she is perfect for the little girls who drool at Spear's every \\"note,\\" outfit and dance \\"step.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"I just bought this pitiful imitation of Black music for my niece. What a mistake. I strongly suggest investing in the real deal instead of the fake junk! Britney Spears is by no means Janet Jackson- give it up girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Terrible Teen Trash","review":"This music is so tasteless and bad. The only purpose it serves is to waste your parent's money. She will be a star only until another whiny teen singer comes along to take her place and then millions of teens will waste more of their parent's money. Let's find someone with at least a little talent next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops She Did It Again!","review":"I really am not too sure bout Britney anymore, shes really not that good anymore. Like that song thats called what I call my dog, ya know, Lucky, is totally pointless, why would you sing about that, oh yeah Britney can get so jealouse of those movie stars sometimes! What more does she want! I don't know, I'm just totally annoyed by her now and 4 ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than \\"Baby One More Time!\\"","review":"\\"Oops!... I did it again\\" is a good try by Britney. This is not the best CD in the world but it is Extemely better than the album \\"Baby One More Time.\\" There are many good songs on here Like the title track, \\"What U See Is What U Get\\", \\"Cant Make You Love Me\\", and \\"Stronger\\". There are the annoying songs like the ballads \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know,\\" \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\" and the extremely horrendous \\"One Kiss From You\\" which is what many people call filler space. All together it was a good try by Ms. Spears. So If your a Britney Fan than this CD is For you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would say...","review":"this is definitely a more mature album from she shows off more of her vocal ability on this album. Anyway, my most favorite tracks on this album should be Where Are You Now, Girl In The Mirror (found in Asian version) and When Your Eyes Say It. The only turn-off on this album is Britney overdoing the, \\"uh\\" in I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't she lucky? (not so much but hey)","review":"ok. this cd was surprisingly good..i mean.. maybe i was drunk or my hearing was impaired on the day i listened to the cd. but my reaction was 'interesting!'. i mean it didn't suck. compared to some other pop cds *coughhilaryduffcough*.her lyrical content is getting better compared to the 1st album.Some of the songs actually have a meaning.not to mention the vocals aren't bad.well i don't expect them to be since its computer generated but hey. you know what i mean.so if you are looking for a pop cd that is all perky and kinda meaningful yet touching in a messed up way. this cd is for youif you are looking for a seriously bad pop cd. don't look here.every teenybopper should own this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"I bought this album when it first came out, i thought it was a great cd, stronger being one of my favorite songs, u cant go wrong with buying this album, i trully recomend it, go buy it if you havent its worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no Oops about it","review":"I think that Britney Spears, 'Oops!..I did it again' album was very good. I was reading the other reviews and half of them seemed to intensely dislike it and think Britney was bad at singing, but I think that although some of the songs aren't all that good , the majority are. My fave's are Stronger, Lucky and What You See(Is What U Get). The one I like the least is the Girl in the Mirror. Most of the songs are good to dance to and have a good rhythm, while others are much slower and are good to relax to and sing along. I give my congrats to Britney Spears and I think she made a good choice bringing Lucky out as her next single."},{"rating":"2","title":"half good half bad","review":"Good old Britney is back. Hoo-ray. All I can say is that even though the girl can barely sing she cranked out a pretty darn good disk. If you love extremely catchy and danceable tunes then I would say that this is worth your money. But I have to warn everyone that the ballads are almost painful to listen to especially, Where Are You Now, Dear Diary, When Your Eyes Say It, and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know. They just enhcance her squeaky voice instead of covering it up. Go for, Stronger, What U See (Is What U Get), and the title track instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't have to be a Britney fan","review":"Now, let's get this straight- I am NOT a Britney fan. I like some of her songs, but I don't like her! OK, now that that is said, I thought that this was a good CD. The title song Oops!..I did it again is a good upbeat song that is good to sing to and listen to. But my absolute favorite song on this album is Lucky. which is a slower, more touching song than Oops!. I think that this is a great CD for hanging out, because it has a lot of upbeat, catchy tunes. I would reccommend this to anyone- Britney fan or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah she did it again alright","review":"This album sounds like a copy of the first one. Her first egotistical track sounds like \\"baby one more time\\" ms. Spears' voice annoys me i predict that after awile her fans (mostly male) will get tired of her (just like i have) Eminem was right she can't sing. waste your money if you want but i don't reccomend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry I bought it...","review":"I bought the cd thinking maybe it is more hard hitting because of her song oops I did it again...which I have already grew weary of....It is the same song over and over and over again...Her voice gets aggravating especially on the slow songs in particular 'Don't let me be the last to know' Shania should of recorded that one..Great song wrong voice...I can't believe how much she ruined her remake of the song \\" I can't get no satisfaction\\" Words can't describe my disgust...She did break a record..How? Ask the teenyboppers!LOL She has got them wrapped around her finger...I guess you grab their attention you hit the goldmine, but not with the music only the money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS BAD","review":"well first of all the only good song on the cd is oops which is why i gave the cd the 2 stars all the other songs are just remakes of songs from before and the all have the same beat and tune. another thing miss britney cannot at all sing her voice cannot compare to all the other teen divas mandy moore jessica simpson christina augeilera they put so much more into their songs and they can sing much better her voice is obviously enhanced"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is crud","review":"I don't like this cd because she always puts all the good songs more like one first and all the stupid songs last. If she wanted to keep people listening she might want to put the dumb songs first and the good ones last so people look forward to the end of the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not about the voice but the beat and melody of the music","review":"After listening to the entire album several times, Ifelt that the beautiful talented dancer had completely no talent in singing. I was sucked in by all the hype. But enjoying the album did not have anything to do with her voice. Instead, it is the pop music that counts. I could care less about what she was singing about. To make a long story short, I really enjoyed most of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops...She Didn't Do It Again","review":"I bought this CD in spite of the fact that I don't really like the title track because I liked the first CD and thought that maybe there would be songs on this album that are better that it. That was a huge waste of money. All of the up-beat songs sound exactly like it. Most of the slow songs are boring and monotonous. Even though \\"Where You Are Now\\" is a beautiful song that does not make the album worth buying, but it is the reason I gave this CD 2 stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Good Song","review":"My 5 year old daughter asked me for this so I bought it used. You would think there would be a couple of good tracks besides the title track. Nope - I should have bought the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful AWFUL songs.","review":"So yeah the album is a completely moronic sludgefest. And to think that Britney had the audacity to cover the Rolling Stones classic \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\\" Give me Travis's cover of Britney's own \\"Baby One More Time\\" ANY day. At least that one had a sense of humor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"Shes a VERY good looking girl and thats as far as it goes.No talent on this album at all people! From start to finish the album is trash.Good day! Dont buy this crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep she did it again, shes killing pop","review":"Britney Spears among others is helping destroy pop music as well as the rest of pop culture with no feeling lyrics and songs that all seem to have the same message. The songs all sound flat and Spears's voice could be mistaken for a 30 year old's. Anyone who says that she is a good singer is only kidding themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brits Big Bash","review":"I rated this cd 5 stars because It's a great cd that is enjoyable to children & young adults.It's content can suite anyone from a 4th grader with a crush to a college student in love.If you think about your own personality in the songs each person would have a totally different outlook & new idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I can't imagine anyone but an indiscriminate fan enjoying this CD. Even my little sister, who listens to Britney's songs happily when they come on the radio says \\"There are only a few good songs.\\"Britney Spears sounds like a chipmunk with a bad cold. Her voice sounds fake- it's almost always tinkered with by a computer. The producers tried to hide this with loud, distracting backround music. The songs are like copies of each other, and the one song Britney co-wrote could've been written by an 7-year-old.I'm not gonna say go buy a Nirvana CD instead, cuz if your considering buying this you probably wouldn't be interested. If still want a Pop-y sound, but with better vocals and slightly more meaningful lyrics, pick up Christina Augilera's album- it's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britney sounds the same","review":"Britney sounds the same on every song. The fact that all the songs sound alike doesn't help either. This cd is only meant for people who like different words to the same Oops music with the tiniest tweek in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do You Really Think This Matters","review":"Do you think that Britney Spears really has something to say. Other than make someone elses music, and dance someone elses steps what makes her important. I can understand and appreciate the teen idol image, but what is this saying to impessionable kids. \\"I'm not that innocent\\" indeed. In 5 years no one will care, no one will remember. After she realizes her choreographer rips off everyone from Michael Jackson to Madonna (by the way, who are true artists), and after she sings all the songs probably written by the same guy who does NSYNC and BB (cuz they all sound the same) she'll realize Hey! I have money and don't need this anymore. This whole Boy band, teen idol phase we're going through is nothing more than a special Where Are They Now? episode on VH1 in 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"The atrocities of our time","review":"Its truely amazing the things people would rather have than money. Why in gods name this piece of filth made it into even the top one thousand should be the 8th wonder of the world. I sincerely doubt that even a quarter of the people that bought this did so for any reason other than the slew of pictures that it came with. She's pretty hot, we all know that. But that DOES NOT mean she has an ounce of talent whatsoever. Wynona Rider should release a cd. I'm sure someone would buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some poppy tunes, but I just have to say:","review":"Curses to Spears for destroying the rock n' roll classic of classics, \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction.\\" The terrible remix of this wonderful Stones work just goes to show Britney's lack of respect for music. Still, if you're 14, a girl, and like to dance around the room because you're too young to drive, this one is for you. A personal note: I think it would be funny to give Spears a guitar, a piece of paper, and a pen and ask her to write a song. I bet the response would be, \\"Well, I'll write the song, but first I need a keyboard, a drum machine, and a songwriter.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"So Fake","review":"Well i bought this cd because i thought it was going to be cool. i mean all those people can't be wrong. i liked the first few songs and the others were okay. but the lyrics really don't flow. it sounds like she just through an album together for the sake of having another album under her belt. the songs lyrics may be different but she sings the same in all of her up-tempo songs and all the same in her \\"slow songs. i was cool with it for awhile because i was a britney fan but now i think shes a little over-done. her voice also sounds so \\"studio magic\\" i mean it sounds more like a computer than a person. I just hope she comes together to form a really good third album. i'm not ditching britney but i;m not really gonna support her until she gets something really good out on the market. if you want to enjoy britney and came to your senses and did not buy this cd, may i recommend her first cd: Bay one more time and her book: a mother's gift is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS is right.........","review":"What a pathetic album. This is track after track of pure bubblegum mall diva. The vocals are shallow and the music is more karaokethan instrumental quality.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!...I Faked It Again","review":"This CD is soooooo bad. It sounds exactly like her half-decent debut ...Baby One More Time. Spears again has a fake voice and all this album does for her is to enhance ability to lip-synch more.In the song \\"Stronger\\" she sings \\"my lonliness ain't killin me no more\\" like in ...Baby One More Time she says \\"My lonliness is killin' me\\" This is awful and do not buy it. The one star stands for the one GOOD song written by Shania Twain (If you don't have all 4 of her CD's what are you waiting for- 5 stars to Shania)that is titled Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know which has a synthisisar and technical voice additions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, You Did Make Another Album Of Unoriginal Songs","review":"Why are these teenagers addicted to Britney Spears, 'N Sync, and this other overproduced stuff that has nothing but some other guy's lyrics? Is that what teen society is coming to? I hope not, but so many of them are buying up these CD's of weak beats and childish lyrics that's its getting out of hand. Why don't Britney and the other boy groups write their own stuff for once? They might try singing about something else besides broken hearts and the tired subject of love that their writers and producers keep wanting them to sing about over and over. It's sad that Spears tries a cover of \\"Satisfaction (I Can't Get No)\\" by the Rolling Stones as if she is some type of rock icon. She's nothing and hopefully she will fade soon, maybe go to college, or just hide somewhere. That would be the best thing she could do right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! Britney's made another CD!","review":"Well, I bought this CD for my daughter, and she shares the same thoughts about it that I do. The CD is indeed worse than her debut album. The song Oops I Did It Again was OK the first time I heard it, but radio stations over-play it. I'm getting so tired of hearing it on the radio at home, in the mall, and everywhere else. The spoken messages are very annoying, and I don't see why Britney put them in. The copy of the Rolling Stones song Satisfaction is a very poor reproduction. If you want REAL pop music, buy Christina Aguilera's, Mandy Moore's or Jessica Simpson's album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Why did she have to do it again?","review":"The first one was bad enough! The songs are all, I'm sorry, annoying as well as her voice. This girl cannot sing! She just got lucky and now she's famous? I can't stand to hear her voice! It makes me shudder. Why do people like this stuff? She sounds like she's choking or something! She's so fake! Don't waste your money on this CD unless, of course, you liked 'Lucky' and 'Oops...I Did It Again' because the rest of the songs are just like those two."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think of Britney Spears","review":"Overall, I think Britney's second ablum is pretty good. I really like the formation of the songs. The vocals helped in many of Britney's songs and really gets you going. My favorite songs in that CD are OOps I did it again, Stronger, What u want is what u get, Lucky, Where are you now ( of course), and Can't make you love me. AS i have listed, the one that i admire the most is Where are you now. It is actually a terriffic song, both vocals and lyrics. Britney really showed others that she has the ability to sing well and effectively, unlikethe yelling and screaming (all those nonsense of Christina A.) found in the other female artist. SO this album is really worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok now","review":"OK this girl can dance. But she can't sing but sometimes when she dances she looks like a broken robot. Thats the way it is. Im tired of her whining sometimes she shouldn't dress like she does because she has little fans out there. Ok about this CD its not so good her froggy voice is covered up by all the background music and this CD is like a continuence of her first which isn't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the 1st One.","review":"\\"Oops!...\\", is a much better CD than Britney's first, \\"Baby,One More Time\\", but it is still not good enough to be called a good CD. One reason is because almost all the songs have the same beat. Another is because her love songs are cheesy and dull. Don't waste your money. Just get the singles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of Corny Music","review":"yes that is Britney for ya... this cd is worse than the first...the only good songs are When your eyes say it and One kiss from you....the fast songs sound too manufactured and the slow songs sounds way too bland...and Dear Diary..that song is a joke! this cd is overall really corny...but if you just want some fun pop to sing along to then this is for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Fair","review":"Let's get one thing straight I don't like Britney, but I do like her music. A lot of people [criticize] her voice, and while I'll admit her voice is anyhting but magical I do think she has some talent. Stressing the word some. As far as the CD goes, I love it. There is a great message behind a lot of the lyrics \\"Stronger\\" \\"Lucky\\" \\"Can't make you love me\\" these are all great songs! I would advise someone to buy this CD, but for little kids or even Junior High the videos can create real problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops","review":"I really can't believe I had to pay (dollar amount) for this lemon. I think that if Britney Spears turned to Jazz or traditional R&B, I think that she could sound better."},{"rating":"1","title":"She did it again! The Worst CD of 2000.","review":"This must be the worst CD of 2000. Congratuations, Britney, for producing the worst CDs known to us. She doesn't know how to sing at all and now she says her voice is more mature. Give me a break, her voice is much more disgusting than the last time. I feel like she's screaming everytime I hear her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M SORRY, I HATE IT!","review":"I thought this cd really stunk. I used to be a fan but this cd changed my mind. She's trying to be someone she's obviously not. I dislike her voice, and the fact that she would rather reach the male audience than the 4 yr. olds who horribly, want to grow up to be like her! I'm sorry, but this cd really dissapointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darned awful!","review":"Man, I didn't realize pop music has gotten this bad. This is the worse drivel I've heard in a long time - tacky lyrics and poor singing by Spears mars this release. The production sounds like it was artificially produced. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"....The beat to the songs on \\"Oops! I Did It Again\\" are dreadfully identical to those on her first album �?perhaps because she can only perform one dance and needs the same beat for her videos. There is so much technical audio, no one knows what Spears' voice truly sounds like. And what makes me the sickest is the \\"verbal\\" interruption she adds to her songs that are so fakely outrageous it is just disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puleeze!","review":"Even one star is a lot for this overrated pop artist who would be no where without her looks and sexy wardrobe. I bought this album thinking it would be worthy of my listening. Think Again. Poor Rolling Stones must be falling to their graves kicking themselves for allowing the slaughtering of their song. I'm sorry to all you fans who think this girl can sing, but I'm giving my opinion on this album and for those of you who are uncertain of purchasing it, go to the Christina Aguilera or Celine Dion section. They CAN SING."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an ugly jailbaited mamacita!","review":"Toro: Pancho, I am so sick of this Brittaney Speers mamacita! Pancho: She was one airbrushed teenager who has now turned into a tramp!

Pancho: Her cover of The Rolling Stones' Satisfaction is the musicla equal to someone crashing their car into a tree at 100 miles an hour and dying. Toro: This record sold less than her debut with only 10 million sold in America. Pancho: This gringo's career was starting to slide.

I can, and I think this is just disappointing that CD's and singers like this get made SUPER famous, when they can't even SING!Whats wrong with listening to Anthony Warlow or Linda Edner? They can sing! They can sing and they can grab an audience, unlike little miss teeny boper, I'm a virgin moron. I don't want someone like Brittany putting any sort of impression upon children, and yet she's given that ability. The only thing she does is throw the women back to the stoneage of being a sex object. I'm not a mega super femi person, but GEESH I would like respect!As I said this sucks, and there are FAR better singers, hell my eighty year old half deaf grandmother can carry a better tune then Brittany!Michelle(huggles her grandmother) Gotta love her :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different side of Britney?","review":"I absolutely love this album as a total! There are the two songs I had no interest for though which are Dear Diary and When your eyes say it those songs don't show the musical talent that she has and are too mushy. This album is different from her last album but is still very good. I think if you liked her last album more than likely you will like this.one. My fave songs on it are Lucky and Oops...Lucky has very good lyrics and shows the more grown up Britney while Oops keeps the Britney that we know and have grown to love with her up beat melodies. All and all you should by this album to hear her before you make rude judgements about her or just because."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"I was really looking forward to Britney's new album, because her first one was excellent as far as I was concerned. Her second album just does not hit the mark. The songs from what I could tell were trhown together just to get her second album out while she was still hot. The title song in my opinion \\"Opps I did it again is about the only decent cut out of the whole CD. I just wish I had not wasted my money on the whole CD, and had waited for the title single. Take my word for it this CD is really bad. A former Britney fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"THERE WAS REALLY ONLY 1 GOOD SONG ON HER FIRST ALBUM SO I WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH. SHE SOUNDS VERY CHILDISH.

My roommate purchased the album yesterday and as I was listening I told myself to really give it a shot and to listen with out prejudice. Well the verdict is in and it's not good. Maybe I'm too old (22 yr.old,) to appreciate what Britney brings to the table, musicaly speaking- for that I thank God! For those who are claiming \\"she did it again...\\" what exactly did she do aside from contribute to the world of bad music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh Oh............","review":"This album stinks!There is no denying that!All of her vocals are covered up and made into robotic space-aged sounds.Britney really has talent for singing,but OUCH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, she did it again","review":"Kill me now, this famous Britney Spears decided to re-make a classic. Yes, her sad destruction of Satisfation was horrible. She added another minute to the song with all of her UHS and YEAHS. Her upbeat drums and guitars in the background were superb, especially to cover up her rough vocals. In short by listening to this album, I come to the conclusion that B.Spears, is just a Karaoke Singer who got lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops!... She did it again","review":"When I listened to her unmistakably voice for A ra-ra raunchy beat of Oops! I did it Again, I said, wow,this baby girl never change! She even thrown the a la Titanic's conversation on her new brand hottest song! After she had made it with Baby, One More Time, Britney seemeds had continued the lure of her baby teens voice seriously.

I recommended cause I've already bought one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-UUUUUUUUUUUUUU!","review":"Oh good gracious me, where should I start? This \\"music\\" is downright awful! Bubblegum pop trash with not an ounce of talent whatsoever! Britney can't sing to save her soul. And don't get me started on her version of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction! My advice: Don't buy this ridiculous bubblegum pop trash! Buy some REAL music like Styx, Journey, REO Speedwagon, etc. THOSE bands are capable of putting out REAL music. They write their own songs and play their own instruments.

I can almost guarantee that the number of people that don't like this review will be about twice as big as the people that like, but just listen to the CD. There are 2 types of songs, upbeat and annoying, slow and annoying. This will be just like N'Sync and go strait to the top on MTV. I can't wait till Eminem and Kid Rock come out. At least half the guys in the country don't have a crush on them, I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe she broke a record with this ( )","review":"My little sister bought this album as soon as it came out and I have always tried to give her music a chance but I simply cannot. All her songs are just remakes of baby one more time. Some of these songs sound exactly like Nsync or Backstreet Boys songs. There is not one ounce of originality on this album and the fact that she does not know how to sing does not help a lot. On this album she tries too hard to try to sound like Christina Aguilera. Britney needs to find herself a vocal coach, new songwriter and producer.

So let me start by saying this is the worst CD I've ever heard. I only gave it one star because there's nothing lower than that. Her voice is high and squeaky and sounds like she has something caught in her nose. Let me be frank. I am NOT a Britney Spears fan. But that didn't keep me from having an open mind about this. I listened to it. And only after that did I declare that it was the worst filth I've ever heard. Oops I did it again is one of the most poppy and tacky songs I've ever heard (and what is up with the music video?)Oops I did it again is second only to Lucky, THE worst song I've ever heard. I enjoyed Britney Spears when she first came out with Baby One More Time. But then I watched her true persona get worse and worse. If you're looking for a good CD with excellent vocals STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay this is probably the better of her 3 albums","review":"This album is not great but it does have the most catchy dance songs out of all her albums. I wish she could sing better but her voice is so awful. It's sad because everyone thinks she is so great but all she is, is a Madonna wannabe. SHe will never have the lasting career that Madonna has. Madonna is actually an intelligent, talented woman who has a lot to offer to the music industry. Britney really has nothing great to offer. SHE CANNOT SING!!!! Everything about her is fake. Especially her voice. It sounds so made up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...caught in the middle","review":"This is Britney's 2nd of 3 CDs. In her debut, she was introducing pop, and in the third, she tried (unsuccessfully) to abandon it. This record sounds almost identical to \\"...BOMT\\", but not as good. I didn't like it. If there was one song I do like, it's \\"Stronger\\". Most of the songs on here sound like a mixture of her debut and \\"Britney\\" material. The dialogue at the end of \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\", \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" and ESPECIALLY the dialogue before \\"Dear Diary\\" was extremely annoying and could have done without...I mean, who talks like that? Not horrible, but could have been better. Even the pics weren't all that great...uggh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still My Fave By Her","review":"Britney's latest effort proves to be an overall better album, but \\"Oops\\" will probably always be my all time fave. I remember the summer of 2000 and hearing the title track \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" on the radio almost every time I turned it on. This album holds 3 top 40 US hits for Britney...\\"Oops\\" (#9 on Billboard), \\"Lucky\\" (#23), and \\"Stronger\\" (#11). It also holds the ballad \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know\\" which was also released as a single, but never charted. Overall, good pop album.But just to get th facts straight, to the person that said this is the 3rd fast-selling album in US history, that's false. It's the 4th. Backstreet Boys \\"Black and Blue\\" is the 3rd with 1.6 million."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Music","review":"This is a CD to listen to when you're driving or cleaning- it's got good vacuuming beats. Even the 'sadder' songs make you feel chirpy, and however darn hard you try not to join in at least some part of your anatomy will feel a need to tap or nod along. I've tested this theory on a 'serious muso' who despises pop, and even he couldn't resist the need to nod along.'Lucky' is the best track, nice beat, good happy pop that doesn't require immense concentration to understand. Good Stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"OPPS","review":"Britneys Opps I Did it Again is a major OPPS. It is a waste of your money!! Do not buy it!!! You will be so sorry. She can not sing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, not much happened","review":"People, this is insane, this album was ranked #1 selling on amazon BEFORE it came out! How much can you base an album on a single song! On the otherhand, Britneys success has alot to do with marketing, her pop image, and some good tunes - overall very well packaged.To be honest, there are a few good songs on this new album(eg. \\"Where are You Now\\", \\"Stronger\\"), but gives a similar feeling in tunes and lyrics as her first album, as if both album were done right after one another.Alot of comparison has been drawn between Britney Spears, and Mandy Moore; To be fair I gave both their second album a listen, and Mandy's album definitely shows more growth and maturity in style and content.I like both Britney and Mandy, but the best bang for the buck belongs to Mandys \\"I wanna be with you\\". Keep a open mind, give it a try, and you will probably like Mandys new album.But if you are a Britneys fan to start with, you will still enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney is so cool","review":"I haven't got this cd yet, but I heard all the songs on the net. I think this album is so good. I esp love 'Oops I Did It Again'! Keep up with the good work Brits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops.. She's Done It Again","review":"She's done it twice she's hit the shelves(again). She's made another great hit that went to #1 (of course). She's made another great hit she's done it twice she's working on her next hit it's going to be a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable","review":"It's amazing to me how many people wrote good reviews on this no-talent girl. Most of the songs on this cd sound EXACTLY THE SAME. Plus, they're not even that good. The re-make of \\"I Can't Get No Satisfaction\\" is horrible. Devo did a better job covering that song. She CANNOT sing! There are much better pop cds out there to invest in. Why waste time with Britney Spears when she has no talent and she'll disappear in another year anyway? Just like Hanson and the Spice Girls, three years from now we'll read about Britney Spears in the \\"Where Are They Now?\\" section of People Magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!..Unfortunately she did it again","review":"Never a truer word was spoken. She sure did do it again and make an insipid manufactured piece of rubbish. This album and it's 'songs' are the saddest thing I have never heard especially the title song 'Oops..I did it again' I just wanted to cringe at that stupid dialogue about the necklace from Titanic. It's a pity the 'old lady' didn't throw this album and everybody associated with it into the ocean as well. The whole 'I'm so innocent and sweet(or am I?) thing is getting really old. Whatever you do don't give this completely talentless girl more money by buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its amazing......","review":"....how many people will listen to this ... just beacuse she looks good!, fine she's cute, but this music stinks. repetative. Prerecorded sound tracks, she doesnt even play an instrument ladies and gentleman! neither does her band (if that what you call it - i call it a 4 track record with music on it)"},{"rating":"2","title":"She has done it again!","review":"This album is better than britney's former one. I don't think you will be disappointed if you are a Britney fan. OK, she does not have the most powerful voice out there, but this album has a really nice beat to it. It has more of a rought edge than the other one. it reminds me a little of what Janet jackson did on her CD \\"The Velvet Rope\\". The cover version of the Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\" is quite well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney is Hot","review":"yep, Britney is hot. Thas about it. Her music is really catchy too. I heard her Oops song at Prom last weekend. Its a good song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"I dislike contemporary pop music, boy groups and teen queens in particular, but I have to say that this CD was not what I expected. I bought it because my 16-month old daughter loves to dance to \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\" over and over (and over). When she was done listening to this song for an hour I played the whole disc through and have to say, guiltily, that I like it. Though the production is a bit too smooth, her voice is strong and the songs keep you moving. The remake of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" is terrific, and the rest of the CD, if not exactly memorable is listenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Britney did a really good job this time with \\"Oops I did it again\\". The only thing is that some of the songs get a little overmixed. The best 3 songs are oops I did it again, stronger, and lucky. The only reason I took a star off was because of the 1 or 2 songs that I always skip over because they're way annoying. The songs that I do like, however, I like A LOT. I reccommend making it a part of your CD collection even if you're not a full blown out pop fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but too much of the same stuff.","review":"I liked this cd, but some of the songs have the same beat. When I first listened to it I thought Britney messed up and copied Oops! I did it again twice when I listened to What U See (Is What U get).Some of the songs sounded sort of like her first cd Baby One More time."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked it a lot","review":"I liked her CD more than her first one (but her first one was still good!) oops!... i did it again is a upbeat song that makes me want to dance... my other favorite's are Lucky, and One kiss from you. both of these were good songs and i think she did a good job... i liked this a lot and i think everyone should listen to Britney."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was pretty good.","review":"I liked most of the songs on the album. My favorite's were \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Lucky\\". Most of the people that gave this album one star can't even spell, so maybe you should study instead of thinking of what mean to write as a review. And not everyon who likes pop music is girly because most of them like rock and rap too. And it's really stupid to do that Oops!...somethingthing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ops is right","review":"Ok, this CD (for most part) is like having your computer sing to you. There are soo much synthesizer and sound effects in lots of the songs. The lyrics are good for most part, that's where the two stars came from. One Ops was ok, but making the fast track songs similar to Ops or Baby One More Time is just too much. In regards to Britney CO-WRITING one song, that's nice but it does not make her the most talented person in the music industry. I would say Mariah Carey, the Jackson's, Madonna, even the new group M2M has more talent in that department than Britney. She's co-writing, not writing and arranging the music. Christina Aguilera, who also co-wrote or wrote one song, is more talented in regards to voice quality. Even if Christina didn't write a single song, she sounds great with just a piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! I have little real talent and I am short.","review":"No, Britney is not a bad person or anything. But, heck, all her weaknesses are exposed here: thin voice, lack of emotive strength, and any real committment to music.I like party sounds as much as anyone, but this stuff is like cotten candy that you can't stop eating."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS, is an oops!","review":"The lyrics are good, the music is catchy, but the girl has no talent. She's managed to ruin some potentially good songs! Do us a favor... give the music to someone who will do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"oops!...not what I was expecting","review":"I admire Britney for what she has accomplised, althout this album needed to be a little better. There are some good tracks but there are a lot of tacky, shallow songs. I think she needs to work with a writer that will compliment her excellent voice. I thought Babyface was going to work on this album and when I picked it up and saw that he didn't I was spewing. Don't get me wrong, it's a good efort just not good enough for what she is capable of doing. Infact I like her first album a little better because of the fact that it contained outstanding tracks. Overall a dissapointing efort and I think Britney would agree. Songs like \\"Don't go knocking on my door\\", \\"lucky\\", \\"One kiss from you\\", \\"where are you Now\\" and \\"Dear Dairy\\" should not even be on this cd. I like \\"Don't let me be the last to know\\" - catchy courus although it's sounds familiar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I received this CD today. It was very good but I think the first one was better. I still give it 4 stars though! Keep up the good work Britney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She has did it again yet better this time round","review":"too all who are considering buying britney spears follow up to last years hit \\"baby...one more time', well your in luck. not only is \\"Oops!...i did it again\\" a great follow up album it contains alot more dance/pop tracks and show cases britney's maturity as an artist. her cover of the rolling stones classic \\"(can't get no) satisifaction\\", is successful mastered, as well as the title track and the shania twain produced \\"Don't let me be the last to know\\". Scoring this album a five is only due to the fact that this album is a great improvement on the debut, and if britney continues delivering effects like this we will being seening a hell of alot of her in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmitigated garbage","review":"If you're pretty you can do anything with the right marketing. As George Carlin so rightly said, \\"If you take two pieces of wood and nail them together in a way no one has done before, some schmuck will buy it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"gimme a brake","review":"this proves that once again that STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE does not make a masterpiece.I never liked Britney or any of those boy bands or girl singers. And I'm 19yrs old. I like real, deep singers like Janet and the avant garde Madonna.She could've used this album as an opportunity to change her music style rather than go with the same bubblegum crap that was her first album. But no, much like the Backstreet Boys and NSuck, she capitalizes on this unfortunately successful album buy replicating the immature lyrics (that she didn't write or produce) and music that made the first album a success. What's sadder is that if you listen closely to \\"Oops..\\" and \\"Stronger\\", the music beats sound the same as \\"Hit Me Baby\\" and \\"Crazy\\" from her last album, just arranged differently.Too bad, it's no longer about making memorable and insightful music; it's all about who can sell the most records. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"This year's guilty pleasure","review":"Yeah, you probably think you're too cool to listen to this CD. So did I. But the problem is that a lot of the songs are so addictive that you can't get them out of your head. Sure, the ballads suck, but then again the upbeat pop numbers will stick to your brain and never ever leave. Just accept this as your guilty pleasure of the year, grit your teeth, and buy it. And if you're one of those \\"alternative\\" kids who hates Britney on principle, here's my advice: cheer up, get a sense of humor, make friends, lose the Dave Matthews, and buy this CD. You won't be alone: I've seen this CD in between Slayer and Pantera, and stashed in plenty of punk rockers' cars. So just lighten up and buy it. It'll be right there next to Social Distortion and Sasha in my CD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it 1 star 'cause I couldn't give it anything lower!","review":"Well, the most phoney \\"artist\\" in overly phoney pop music business has managed to prove to the world how little talent she has. Her voice sounds like a cat with a shard of glass in it's apendix. The lyrics are lame to a degree not seen since... well, scince her last album - not that that's her fault because she's not talented enough to write her own songs. I give credit to the editors and mixers for trying to cover up her voice with electronic effects, but it's not enough. I could tell you not to waste your money on this, but you will anyway. It'll go multi-platinum. Go ahead PROOVE ME WRONG - I dare you. Buy \\"The Battle for Las Angelas\\" by Rage Against the Machine, or Hello Rockview\\" by Less Than Jake, or any albulm by any artist or band that writes their own lyrics, plays their own instruments, and have an IQ greater than an orange. I dare you."},{"rating":"1","title":"oops... too bad you can't give a 0 star!","review":"Talk about a lack of girl power. she is so lame. And her new video really stinks. please don't waste time and money buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are we all thinking?","review":"How can anyone in there right mind listen to this without have to scream from the insanity? First of all, all of Spears' songs sound the same. They all have the same beat, just with different meaningless words attached. Spears' influences all the these young girls, and she's sending the wrong message to them, even if she isn't trying to. I find it sad that people can listen to this and think that this is how things are supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another blond.","review":"Ok, her songs are catchy, I admit it. But are radio stations DJ Adam Smasher is a mastermind. She seems to set herself up for his parodies. (Checkout the 104KRBE website) her voice is flat, and her songs bore me. Her voice is obviously electronicly enhanced, and you can tell. I'd give it a one but oops is an DECENT song. Basicly this album shows her no talent, and it sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops! She's Done It Again!","review":"Britney Spears has paid her dues and her brilliance shines thru on \\"Oops.\\" Though still young, Britney's experience as a true show business vet have brought her music to the peak of perfection with this CD. Listen closely and you'll hear echoes of not only her days as a Mouseketeer, but also her early experience as one-third of \\"The New Shaggs,\\" the legendary Girl Tribute Group. Reflected in \\"Oops!\\" is everything she learned as a back-up singer (for artists from Jandek to B.J. Snowden) when she sharpened her vocal chops before teaming (for one never-released CD) with Lucia Pamela... all of which prepared Britney... and her listeners... for this latest pure pop masterpiece. Bravo, Britney! You did it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"she did it again one more time","review":"this is much better than her i want u back style in baby one more time. britney is starting to show more personality and she said she relates to this album more. a must have. keep up the good work brits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Stop Listening To It!","review":"Britney's new album, \\"Oops! I DId It Again,\\" is a great pop album. Britney's album actually sounds a little like the Backstreet Boy's album, which is probably because they share some of the same songwriters. All of her songs are very good, and they're much more mature than those on her first album, \\"Baby One More Time.\\" (There is even a song that Britney wrote herself, and another song that has an R&B type of feel) Britney also has better ballads on her second album, and shows more vocal range. My favorite songs on the album would have to be \\"Lucky,\\" (very original song), \\"Can't Make You Love Me,\\" \\"Stronger,\\" and \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\\" This album will be great for those who love pop music, and tops her first ablum by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"please...","review":"the only reason this album is more \\"mature\\" is because her songwriters knew that's what the teenyboppers who bought this want to hear. of course she'll talk about not feeling lonely because that's what people are expecting.the thing that annoys me most about her is that she can't sing. she can carry a tune, but she doesn't have a strong voice at all. who cares if she can dance? if you're going to be a pop star, at least have a decent voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"THIS CD HAS NO GOOD SONGS ON IT AND EVERYONE WHO LIKES THIS \\"STUFF\\" SHOULD STOP HAVING MTV RUNNING THEIR LIVES AND SHOULD START THINKING FOR THEMSELFS."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS.","review":"Ooops... I did it Again is the perfect name for this album. I can completely agree with that feeling- making this CD was definetely an Ooops.I hated this CD because1. It's bubblegummy pop, sweet like candy music.2. It's a repeat of the songs from Baby on More Time.3. She has no vocal talent.4. She has no lyrical talent either, she has a songwriter.So, what did we learn from this?That Britney is a tall, blonde, dummy with no imagination, or, that we should all respect each other's opinions (including mine).

So that's where the smell is coming from; hope it didn\`t get on your shoe. What you get here is indistinguishable dance pop, one of the worst covers of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" imaginable, and a Shania Twain-penned song to boot (\\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\") -- there's not this much cheese in Wisconsin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! I threw you away!","review":"I can understand her feelings and thoughts on her 1999 album, but this album is totally trash. Her songs are really short, and most songs have talking in it which isn't called music. And her CD doesn't look like good music, but it looks like she is using her appearance to sell it. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! She did it again!","review":"In the last few months Britney as gone from the who cares to the who wants to know person in the music biz. Her newly founded sex show of a CD has me thinking, \\"is she just in it for the money?\\" Well, to what I think of the CD... it seems like the 7 years old focus is making her rich but thats about it. I really think she will be gone in a few short lived months, or I really hope! The CD is over rated and not all that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Spears selling something?","review":"Britney Spears is the ultimate example of image-over-content. The title track is the only even remotely good song on the whole alblum, the rest of it is so cheesy it gives me a headache. And being a huge Rolling Stones fan, you probably know what I think of her cover of Satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album from Britney so far","review":"Surprisingly, this is one of the best of the pop albums that came from the batch of pop singers in that year (NSync, Backstreet Boys, Jessica Simpson, ext). The chorus are pretty catchy. The only bad songs here are: Dear Diary,When Your Eyes Say It, and Don't Go knockin on my door. I know her voice isn't great, but in here she shines. The other albums (Baby One More Time and Britney) never quite match up to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay, I guess...","review":"I'm not a really fan of Britney, but I like her music. It is okay! A friend of mine bougth this CD for me, it has an Extra Track called \\"Girl In THe Mirror!\\" That song is not very good, but it's okay. The other song I don't like is the title track, and I also don't like Dear Diary. Britney (Of Course!) wrote this song, it says so in her booklet. All of the other songs are good, but When Your Eyes Say It , doesn't make sence. I used to not like that song but now I do even tho the title doesn't make sence. The reason why I gave off 3 Stars is because of the songs Girl In The Mirror (On The European Versionz, which I have!), Title Track and Dear Diary. That is why I gave off 3 stars... other than that Britney did a great job on this album.My favorite songs are, Stronger, Lucky, and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know*Good luck, Britney!*!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Diary\\" BEST tune on \\"Oops!\\"","review":"I LOVE EVERY INDIVIDUAL SONG ON THIS ENTIRE CD, but my all-time favorite tune on this CD was written by Britney herself. No other song on this CD (despite every song's brilliance) can compare to \\"Dear Diary.\\" Written by Britney Spears, Jason Blume, and Eugene Wilde, \\"Diary\\" wasn't Britney's only stab at songwriting; she wrote five songs on her latest CD, \\"Britney.\\" This is like when you listen to Iron Butterfly's \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" album, EVERY song is brilliant but can't compare to the last song on the album. \\"Oops!\\" is the same way. IF IT'S THE LAST THING YOU DO, BUY THIS CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops..she didn't do anything","review":"This is an album that has many catchy tunes with a good beat but I don't think Britney \\"did it again\\". The credit for both of her albums popularity should go to the people whowrote the songs and music. It seems to me that she is just a tool used to sell the albums by selling her sexuality. Her singing is mediocre and very much drowned out by the backup music. I've personally heard better karaoke. I did not write this to bash Britney after all I have never met the girl;however as an avid music lover I would not recommend this album to those who,like myself, would rather listen to music whos popularity comes from the talent of a hard working band, or the depth of lyrics written by the performer and not music that is more of a fasion show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! She did it again, but I'm not impressed","review":"I was not particularly impressed with Britney Spears latest offering. The title track \\"Oops! I did it again\\" is an almost exact replica of \\"Baby one more time\\". In fact, you can substitute the line \\"I'm not that innocent\\" with \\"Hit me baby one more time!\\" without missing a beat! It lacks originality and seems to be copying the style of the first album in order to rack up sales. However, applause must be given for Ms Spears's attempt to have a more mature sound on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops..I dropped this CD in the used bin!","review":"Yes, she did it again. She duplicated the sound of her first album almost to a tee. For that, she gets an A. But this album just further proves that she will not be around for long. She shows no growth and has the same teeny bop voice that she has always had. Her rendition of \\"Satisfaction\\" is a complete disgrace to the song and the Rolling Stones. Another flash in the pan, another teenage media-made pinup. Her best performance does not even come close to Christina Aguilera's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some observations","review":"Miss Spear's latest offering is rather like that rash you caught last time you visited a cathouse: unsightly; irritating; disturbingly contagious; difficult to get rid of; guiltily acquired when the wife's back was turned; worryingly familiar. The public should be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Quite possibly the worst cd ever made. Terrible songs, Terriblevoice, ad infinitum..... This cd is the equivalant of plastic. Fake,synthetic, heartless, corny, & insulting. The sad thing is that it will sell millions of copies. People need to wake up. This type of music is what will sow the seeds of destruction & downfall for mankind.I'm very sad right now. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!...I Wrote the Same Record Again.","review":"If you're looking for a more mature, emotionally involved set from Spears, you won't find it here. Sadly, Oops!...I Did It Again is merely an extension of her debut CD ...Baby One More Time. Trading up \\"Hit me baby one more time\\" for \\"I'm not that innocent\\" is really the only difference between the two. All of the songs on the new CD sound alike, as if a drum machine was left on throughout the entire recording and Spears just laid down tracks to it. Her cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\" is horrific. Her vocals ping-pong from orgasmic to constipated and the result is a breathy, overly synthesized song with little substance, but will make Mick Jagger richer. Overall, this sophomore set is utterly sophomoric, and guaranteed to sell at least 8 million copies. In the end, Spears will retain her Teen Queen title, which is a shame, because there are more deserving artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"More mature lyrics, yes, but the voice is bad.","review":"I agree that this album is much more maturely written than her debut album. Songs like \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Lucky\\" reflect that. However, there is one thing that makes this album bad: Britney Spears' voice. For God's Sakes, she sounds like a chipmunk on these songs. There are only, in my opinion, two good songs: #7 and #9. Britney may look good, yes, but that's about it. That trashy VMA awards performance turned me right off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, she sounds bad again","review":"Move over Hoku!

A girl who got silicone breast implants\\" Britney, we all know it wasn't the silicone that screwed you up, your mom dropped you on your head as a baby. Poor Britney.

WRONG! So she's hot, big deal! She has a voice unlike any other except for Jessica Simpson among teen pop queens. All the songs are quality written, except for Dear Diary. Let's just say Britney should stick to the singing. Max Martin is an incredible songwriter and Britney sings the songs amazingly well. From the fast tempo songs- \\"Oops!\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"Lucky\\", and \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\"- to the slower songs- \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\", \\"Where Are You Now\\", and \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\"- Britney handles the lyrics very well. If you're looking for a quality CD with songs that could all be singles, listen to this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait till it goes on sale..","review":"This CD isn't the best.The songs that are good are \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" (sounds like a guy is in love with her but she isnt in love with him). \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" (her refusing to change the way she presents herself in public), \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Lucky\\". I like these songs because she was being honest.The songs \\"One Kiss From You\\", \\"Where Are You Now\\", \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\", \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\", Dear Diary\\", \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\" and \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" should not have been on the disc. And the bonus songs are no good either. They aren't good as far as lyrics, vocals and music.Overall, this disc is about personal preference. I am not a child so I am going to expect more from my music. And she just didn't give me much to work with on this CD. I was really dissapointed. I thought she would have grown from the first cdas far as quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust Yourself Off and Try Again, Britney.","review":"Is Britney's second record better than I expected? Yes. Would I recommend it? Not if you're over twelve. The title track and \\"Lucky\\" are such well-crafted slices of pure pop courtesy of Max Martin. These songs go down easy, and you'll be humming to their choruses long after they're finished. Spears even gives us a some country flavor on the Mutt Lange/Shania Twain-penned \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know.\\" But elsewhere, the record takes a nosedive--and fast. The cringe-inducing \\"Dear Diary\\" sounds so girlish from a college-age woman. She desecrates the Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction,\\" quite possibly the greatest rock and roll song ever. And there are a bunch of other songs that are similarly disastrous. Back in her day, Kylie Minogue sang songs that were just as formulaic as Britney's, but at least she evolved from that stage and matured as a performer. With Britney, I'm not so sure. While this record isn't a bust, her fans deserve much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh yeah, a grown woman's life consists of nothing but puppy love and \\"playing with guy's hearts\\" Her cover of \\"Satisfaction\\" is shameful...I dont even know Britney and I feel bad for her....she ruined the song.

However, unfortunately, said deathgrip was not enough to mean that she could make good music. \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" features ambigouous lyrics obviously not crafted by Mrs. Spears and no attempt for any material of note.

For example, very little mathematics is used (even though there are topics in the book which would have been better served by a more mathematical treatment), while on the other hand many terms are used as though the reader should be familiar with them already.I found the lack of a glossary frustrating, as was Mr. Smith's habit of using concepts chapters ahead of their defintion. The difficult subject matter was further obscured by numerous errors in the figures and text (such as refering to velocity as the second integral of acceleration.)In the end, the book did give me a good qualitative feel for the issues germane to geodesy, but I had to work very hard to extract that information and found myself immediately looking for a more perspicuous text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good background for people interested in GIS and cartography","review":"I bought this book to fill in knowledge gaps, not to learn geodesy as an expert. It answered lots of questions I had had about measurements, how surveys are performed, geodetic systems (datums and so on), the WGS, and the use of gravity. The details are all there, within about 100 pages in the middle of the book. Not bad at all.This subject by its nature requires a mathematical treatment, so although the book does not go deeply into the math, it's sometimes heavy reading. Many of the illustrations deserve careful study, too. It's not light bedtime reading. I carried this book around for several days during and after a large GIS conference and periodically dipped into it. It works well in small doses."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a very overpriced general introduction book..","review":"I put this book in the same catgory as the ebay ripoff books, It's a very thin book with one page discussions on various topics, and simple cave man style geometry drawings.So if you don't need it as a college text book, then please get a better book, as this one is nearly useless to understand how anything works in any concrete manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I prefer the T.

Mac Hammond is a preacher in my state. His church has nearly lost its non-profit status several times as a result of his corrupt teachings and constantly pushing his political agenda.

I like the combination of Collins' voice and his guitarplaying. His guitartuning makes it very hard for a regular guitarplayer to copie his style. There are just a few other bluesguitarists that I rank higher then Albert Collins. Collins may not be as heavy as Stevie Ray Vaughan but in a much easier way he plays simular music that can't bore me. Songs like \\"Honey, Hush\\", \\"Conversation With Collins\\" and \\"Avalanche\\" make this a very good record that is absolutely not the best but indeed one of the best Texas-bluesalbums I own. I recommend it to you all and although this is the only Albert Collins-album I listened to, I think his other albums are very good to."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very poor...","review":"Well, I bought this hoping it would be somewhat fun like EA Sports Deer Hunt Challenge, but sadly this isn't worth the 20 bucks I paid for it. The manual for the game is the first problem, as it lacks organization and is bare compared to DHC. The graphics in this are bad too, not so bad that you don't know what you are doing, but, are blocky and pixelated. The gameplay in this a mighty bad as well. It's somewhat fun to drive the vehicles but it quickly wears thin due to poor control. Sad thing about this is that driving the vehicles is the only fun thing to do! Hunting the deer gets very boring very fast. Multiplayer may add a little life but I only played multiplayer twice and both times it was buggy and laggy.

From what I have seen so far, the actual text part of the book is the same, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a second book","review":"This book gets more infuriating with each chapter. It starts off explaining things well enough, then it leaves you behind as it obviously thinks things are clear when they're not. This just piles up as you go along and by the middle of the book, this thing starts becoming a detriment to learning rather than an aide. An example - the book makes a point, then adds to the point, then brings it all together... not by explaining it, but by asking you \\"why?.\\" Why?? Here's a great point to be made and you don't explain it, you just ask the reader to figure it out on their own? Why??? And Poole averages one why a page, no joke. For someone who thinks the material is dead simple, that's just a nuisance. For the rest of us, its no help at all. Lazy even. Given the price, this is not a book I'd recommend for anyone, not even as a reference. If you've been assigned this book for a class, ask around for a good backup. Texts shouldn't be a drag on learning, this one is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good for LinAl","review":"The true test of a math book is whether or not you keep it around for future reference, and this has been on my bookshelf for the last two years.Unlike some other math books (and, heaven forbid, higher level physics books) that I have had the dubious pleasure of slogging through during my time at a math and science college, you actually know where the problems are coming from in this LinAl book. They provide copious examples, examples upon examples, and the problems in each chapter are drawn from them, mostly verbatim, with a few numbers changed. A few might find this tedious, but I was so goddam happy to finally know where to find the information that would help me learn the material and finish my homework that I didn't care.Pros: Lots of examples, LinAl is taught competently, if not excitingly.Cons: Price. This book was assigned the year it was published, so no used copies existed. I think the college system and the book publishing industry are in cahoots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Textbook","review":"This textbook has very clear explanations as well as plenty of examples to help the reader learn linear algebra. I actually taught myself linear algebra using this textbook. The explanations in the book were much more helpful than my professor's lectures. Unlike most other math textbooks, this one includes plenty of applications and modern applications of linear algebra. That and the interesting and problems (of varying difficulties) in the textbook kept me interested in the subject. The problems are actually very instructive and helpful to my understanding. Whether you are buying this textbook to teach yourself linear algebra, or for a class, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numerous errors","review":"Besides copious amounts of unnecessary jargon and run-on sentences, the listed solutions (both in the appendix and separate [$$$] solutions manual) for problems in this book are frequently incorrect. BIG INCONVENIENCE AND WHOLLY UNACCEPTABLE; given that few problems in linear algebra are quickly processed by hand. If you use this text, expect to spend an hour on one problem attempting to find errors in your approach when in fact there are none, and the listed solution was just wrong.Instructors and students agree that the frequency of incorrect answers is the biggest problem with this text.Thou art warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Wait to check out the paperback from the library. Ed Morales' best writing was at the beginning of his career in the Village Voice, where he displayed a passion for writing.

The ability to clap your hands to get the thermostat to respond to voice commands is really cool. No problems with installation, the instructions are clear. There is a bit of a learning curve, however, in programming the thermostat. You will probably be referring back to the instruction manual a few times to learn how to program it, but all and all, once you get used to it, this thing is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Was expecting a lot more from brand name items.

(\\"Neurotypical\\" simply applies to all who do not have autism.) There are a couple of hilarious online parodies penned by people on the spectrum about \\"Neurotypical Syndrome\\" and unfortunately, this book's author or someone else included it in the list. Sadly, the fact that the author and publisher would use Internet material without a factcheck means all the book's info must be viewed as suspect. Don't know about you, but I do not have time to perform a line by line fact-check... a job, BTW, the publisher's editorial department should have performed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a ski rack","review":"I bought this to help keep my family's skis organized.

An miraculous ballad full of emotion and pain, Rain trully has been considered by music critics as the highlight from an already brilliant album. But Rain goes deeper than that, after one listen, you'll want to hear it again and again, to listen to Shepp Pettibone's meticulous production, and also to some of the best harmonizing ever heard on a Madonna song. Rain is what the thunder brings, and it will bring you to tears...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Exploited album. . .in the top 5 punk albums ever.","review":"Thank god fr the Exploited! In a time where punk has become exactley the opposite of what it once was, I can always listen to the old Exploited stuff. This record is just incredible. It's as raw and beligerent(sp?) as can be and has a great production, considering punk records were recorded in basements and attics back then.Very few bands exist like them today i.e. Violent Society, The Unseen, Virus.

Soon Orelia finds herself on the way to London as a companion to her cousin until the wedding. Upon arriving at the home of the marquis, she is startled to find that her cousin is to marry the very stranger that had rescued her!

If you are new to working out, this would be great for you, but it's definitely not for the person who has been working out for years. The best workout thus far is Jillian's 30-Day Shred. I got lean from that workout and it takes only 20 minutes. This Dancing with the Stars video is only a diversion, and I might do it once a week. Whereas I will stick with Jillian for 3 times a week with yoga in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"This program will provide a moderate workout. However... The ad says it's perfect for beginners, but that's simply not true. The dance steps are done way too quickly and without full explanations for a beginner to catch on.

I just did the workout and would agree it's ok for cardio and has good instruction. But I expected DWTS would have decent music! I was disappointed to hear monotonous instrumentals. They didn't spring for anything that made you want to dance so I will not be buying DWTS exercise routines again. The music reminded me of bad VHS workout tapes--so boring I wanted to go to sleep, not dance. My recommendation is buy something with better tunes!

A GREAT album, one of the NWOBHM classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I purchased this CD thinking I'd hear a raw, rough Bruce Dickinson. I got that. However, the musicianship and sound quality on this CD are just terrible. I love the sound of an SG, but it even sounds out of tune here. The juvenile chord progressions are weak. This is a very poor CD, except for the vocals. Bruce sounds good. Want a good taste of Bruce with a killer band? Buy Maiden's \\"The Number of the Beast.\\" Excellent from the first song to the last.

The price was great and there was no core charge. When I received the the steering pump it looked great but was slightly different than the original. I double checked the part number on Amazon and it still said it fits my car. I went to rockauto.com and acdelco.com and they both said it does NOT fit my car!!!! I realized this after the 30 days and there was nothing I could do about it. I am still amazed that Amazon still shows this part fits my car. I can't figure out how to contact them and let them know. Every part you order here should be cross checked with at least another reputible site.

Best price in Amazon, which makes up for the shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"KJV, drawings seem feminine","review":"I like the one-page story summaries, but most people who buy this book probably have something similar in a children's Bible. The drawings include a verse in King James, which is not what I use with my children so it really just confuses them. The drawings themselves are elaborately detailed, which is fine, maybe better for older children. The style seems somehow romanticized or feminine to me; the men all have long curly, flowy \\"locks\\" of hair, drapey robes, etc. Somehow it just feels girly to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information but some bad theories","review":"The author does provide good information on the status of women in the ancient world, but has some completely baseless theories. She tries to juxtapose the masculine Persian god Mithras with the feminine god Isis, claiming Isis was supressed and Mithras welcomed. The problem is, Mithrism, after Christianity and Judaism, was persecuted heaviest because it was though to indicate loyalty to Persia, Rome's enemy. Isis, on the other hand, after some early initial efforts to ban all foreign religions, was fully tolerated. It saw nothing like the persecution the other three religions saw. Also, she overstates Isis as a feminist figure. Most papyrus quotes from ancient Egypt have her worshiped as a traditional wife and mother goddess. All she has as proof of her contention that wasn't so is one Oxyrhyncus papyrus quote and a quote from the always unreliable Diodorus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative use of evidence?","review":"I chose to study the lives of Classical Women as part of my Ancient History degree.

Several parents tried to explain the lightning fast play but I was lost...always. What a difference it would have made if I had had in hand the SportSpectator Guide to Men's Lacrosse. The guide explains completely and concisely the object of the game, play strategies, position and purpose of players and the scoring of points. I particularly like the Lacrosse Field Diagram which graphically shows all the player positions and names the parts of the field according what type of play occurs in which parts of the field. The guide explains the rough physical contact of \\"stick checking\\" and \\"body checking\\" during defensive play and as a parent, it would have been helpful to have understood the importance of and guidelines around these maneuvers. The guide is very accessible, easy to carry in a purse or pocket, and laminated so it holds up throughout the season.

He steals her money and threatens her by telling her that he could tell her parents and stuff that there was only one bed in the inn (a total lie!). Therefore Katie has to keep quiet about him and get a job as a maid of a congressman's family. A beautiful romance nicely told. I love the scene where Katie gives cotten a swedish massage!

Movie was worse than the quality of the movie print. I would not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embrace the horror of this movie's bad-ness","review":"20-words:Bad story.Bad production.Bad acting.Bad effects.Bad sound.If you have a headache, this movie will make it worse.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Movie","review":"This movie was good in its day. But this copy was of poor quality the movie was hard to see as if it was a very low quality copy. Save your money it was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangar 18","review":"The picture and sound quality of this dvd was terrible. It appeared to be a dvd copy made from an old VHS tape. I would never have orderd this item had I known what poor quality it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie Lousy DVD and Digital Copy","review":"I Loved this movie when it came out. Not a block buster but a fun movie. The Conversion to DVD looks like they found an old copy that was lying around in box of old video tapes, and converted to DVD format. The DVD and Digital versions are the same quality, lousy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable","review":"I enjoyed (JERSALEM'S HOPE)but I would like to continue on with the original story. The story was so predictable that I knew what was going to happen before it did but I still continued to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as intriguing as the preceding books","review":"In just a few words, I can honestly say I agree with John Mort from Booklist. Read his review of this book and you will find my thoughts. I was disappointed.I had a difficult time finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme the rest of these books!","review":"This was the first book I read by these authors and I have now read 4-5 and still going! If you don't have a prayer life you will when you begin to see \\"Thy kingdom come...\\" as it comes ALIVE in these series! All the bible stories become personal as the authors Brock and Bodie Thoene develope rich and vibrant characters layer upon layer as the story builds and you simply cannot put down your book! The characters do carry from one book to the next and then you must begin reading the A.D. Chronicles to find out what happens to them. I have a much deeper understanding of the old testament and how every word, every act, every letter and every number pointed to the coming Messiah! Nothing ever happens by accident! God's will does come about even if we are disobedient or we loose faith! Don't think for a moment that he doesn't KNOW YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Authors","review":"These are 2 of my favorite authors. I have read several of their novels. I loved everyone of them. They are great reading for anyone interested in Jewish History and the life and death of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-read!","review":"This book and all the other books that are in the series is fantastic. The Thoene's writing is realistic, factual when necessary and I am trying to catch up on all their books. I would recommend this entire series for anyone who does not know much about what happened to Israel before and after they became a nation. Make sure you start with the first book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Received","review":"My son fell in love with this color, not having it in his closet. Pick up a silver tie to wear with it! The professional will love to wear it to work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A prophecy that has already occured.","review":"The Glass Bees is a short novel about power, technology and nature. It's also the story of a life; the life of a veteran german captain that has lived in two very different worlds: the \\"old\\" world where words like \\"courage\\" or \\"pride\\" still meant something and a \\"new\\" world where the words have lost their meaning, where the power of the State has almost been surrended to huge high-tech transnational firms and where efficency criteria leads the behaviour of most of the peolple. The story tells the way in which the old world's man tries (unsuccsesfully most of the times)to fit himself in the new world.In my opinion The Glass Bees is an outstanding novel althoug -I have to say it- not one of the 10 best books I have ever read as another reviewer says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This plane doesn't fly.

The plane is made of styrofoam and the wing broke in two when the plane fell to the ground. The nose popped off too. This product was a complete disappointment for me and for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Upset","review":"I am totally upset with this product. First off the description on Amazon, does not even mention that this thing is made of Styrofoam ($40 for a Styrofoam plane). R we serious? This is a plane, exactly how does making it Styrofoam make it durable in any way. 2. none of the parts stay on the darn thing. 3. After a short 20 minute charge you will be lucky to get exactly 1 minute of flying time out of this things. Its garbage, and i wouldn't waste my money on it again. The kids were very disappointed which just made me even more upset that i bought it. I don't mean to knock it down so hard, but i guess it was such a disappointment to us, i just can't see myself recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"remotecontrol broncoRCelectricRTF2CHreadytoflyradiocontrol","review":"this plane flys very well but the directions stink and the plane is very hard to build"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dooley on Please","review":"My 2 year old daughter loves Dooley. We travel to visit family ever other month (6 hour trip) and we entertain her with a DVD player and her favorite shows and sometimes she asks \\"Dooley on, Please\\". I didn't have the DVD until recently. I was looking on the internet for Dooley DVDs and found that they are out of print. I found them on ebay but the bids were up to 100 bucks. I'm thankful to have found them on Amazon at a resonable price. Now when she asks for Dooley, I can put a smile on her little face. Thanks. DVD arrived in perfect condition and played well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a Great Book for Trained your Ministerial Staff, I think every Pastor or Church Leader Buy this Book for your staff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real VDO fan.","review":"Although product is advertised as VDO, and has a VDO sticker on the box, it is just a repackaged Chinese brand fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rape and and more rape","review":"I read the book. After reading less than 50% of it I got sick of the repeated descriptions of rape incidents. If it is not rape then it is killing or at times both. All of this took place in the backyard of civilized Eroupe ! and for many months.I did like the historical capture of the Bulkans going back to Roman Empire on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't live without them.","review":"For clean, clear skin in a few seconds when you're too tired to go into the bathroom and wash your face with soap and water and a washcloth and a towel all that jazz (nice when you have roommates and don't want to have to put on something \\"decent\\" to go down the hall to do this, too). Saved me a million! times from going to bed without makeup on or a as a quick fix to help me get out the door quickly. Natural, gentle. They get my combination skin (sensitive too) clean fast and have never, ever, ever, ever irritated my skin or caused a problem. When I'm richer someday, I'll buy stock. I even used these while taking a variety of medications that make skin more sensitive. Also, they moisturize but are totally non-oily and non-comedogenic.This is not a fixed review. I'm just a girl who loves this product. FYI."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!!","review":"I had trouble with one of the products I bought from this seller, but I never got a reply to my email.

Not so...within an hour, two of my students and i each broke a pick. I thought that the first was a fluke, but when a second student broke hers, I knew that something was up. Then when I broke one, I knew that I'll be going back to Dunlop Nylons, which I've never broken. And I was teaching them simple strum patterns on acoustic guitars. Nothing crazy. But I guess it is cheap plastic.I had given out all my other thin nylon picks to various students/friend when I stumbled upon these on Amazon. The price point was perfect, and the reviews were glowing. Unfortunately, I still have 21 of these guys to blow through, but if they're anything like their predecessors, it shouldn't take that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks Easily and Often","review":"These picks are fragile to say the least. They break quickly and without much effort. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Picks","review":"Great picks! I actually think they sound better than the Gibson picks I buy at guitar center. The shipment was fast and the price can't be beat. For those reviews that say they break easy... they are thin picks, there not meant for heavy metal. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The picks themselves are good. The advertising is false.","review":"The picture shows several different colors, but my package only came with the black and yellow marble, black, and white. That was annoying, but not the end of the world. Still a good price for 24 decent picks. They are thin and flexible, but don't feel cheap like they'll break if you breathe wrong. They sound great for picking strings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag of wind","review":"Do this before you follow Jim's advice make a list of his recommendations and at the beginng of each month put what the stock is doing.
