What a disappointment! After spending three days trying to adjust the numerous straps and clips, I simply could not find a comfortable setting. It was just too cumbersome! The Cross Country is lighter, much easier to adjust, with a sleeker design that makes it better for travel and storage. We use a backpack often...just around the house and for travel...and this is a great choice. My daughter sits very comfortably in it,is able to see everything around her, and is able to interact with me without straining to peer over my shoulder like in the Trailblazer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic of believing","review":"I purchased this book because I own an old hard copy which I found inspiring many years ago,.

Listen to it over and over until the messages sink into your subsconscious mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a believer","review":"This is an excerpt of the salient points from the book, about an hour long. It's a good introduction to the book -- buy the CD and then you'll either want the book so you can learn more, or you'll decide you're not interested. The book from which it's excerpted is excellent, and highly recommended. The gentleman who wrote it died back in 1951, but the subject matter is just as pertinent today as it was in 1948 when he wrote it. I give the CD 4 stars and the book 5 -- you'll want to read it more than once and listen to the CD more than once to really get everything from it. It's a little vague in some ways, and sometimes you may think \\"come on, just spit it out already!\\" but if you pay attention, it's worth a whole lot more than you'll pay for it. It really *can* help you change your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for the font ...","review":"This mass produced paperback is very difficult to read.

Even the power of a positive outlook can't make this print any bigger. The Magic of Believing should be subtitled, Read The Fine Print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"A good book. I believe this book was originally written in the late 1940's. Since then a lot of other books have come into being, books by Ernest Holmes, Joseph Murphy and U.S. Andersen which explained why there is magic in believing. For the layman, this is very good indeed.Mr Bristol, however, still has not completely shaken himself off from traditional beliefs. He advised readers not to us this power for evil purposes. This is a dubious thing. How do you define 'evil purposes' ? If, in using this power of believing, a person gets what he wants and triumphs over other people, it can be construed that he uses it for an evil purpose.The other thing that he mentioned is 'don't try to use it for betting and gambling'. If the power is available and a person uses it in gambling and betting with complete faith and singleness of purpose and succeeds, what is really wrong ? This brings him back to the traditional belief that hard work must be involved in any undertaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read to reinforce your belief system!","review":"If you love Think and Grow Rich, Believe and Achieve by Samuel Cypert and Og Mandino's books, then you're going to like this book.

Ironically, a six figure education is not likely to have given you the real knowledge of self outlined in this and similar books.I recommend reading and applying the principles in this book with the short book \\"It Works\\" by RJH and \\"Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" by Joseph Murphy.

It seems to be more of a collection of essays on the power of belief, rather that a practical how-to-do book. It also does seem quite repetitive in its message and approach.Personally I found TNT - THE POWER WITHIN YOU to be a much more exciting and dynamic book. It has an abundance of varied information and advice, and also benefits massively from the writing style of co-author Harold Sherman.My suggestion is don't bother with THE MAGIC OF BELIEVING. Go straight from TNT - THE POWER WITHIN YOU. This book covers everything that is in the first, but also a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic of Believing Review","review":"Excellent book.

It's interactive for kids because they have to turn the light \\"on and off\\" and find Blue in the dark and figure out which toy has been put away in the toy box. It helps kids find the missing toys as well as learn how to put away toys. Tanner usually asks to read it once a day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit!","review":"I have a 20 month old who absolutley loves this book! She discoved the light switches some time ago and so she loves to see the effects in the book that back up her experiences! Of course, at her age we are using the book as a tool to increase her language by naming objects and colors. I also only ask her to find Blue hiding in the dark and not the missing toy as asked for in the narrative. This is what I love about these books - they capture her attention immediately with the characters and colors and they can \\"grow\\" with her. As she develops more sophisticated problem solving skills I can then start asking her to find the missing toy. If your child likes brightly colored pictures or the show itself, then put this on your book-buying list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little book!","review":"We own a few of these Blue's Clues books and my toddler loves them! He has one that's been worn ragged because it went everywhere with him and took a lot of abuse, that considered they hold up very well!

I do recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Babies","review":"My 11-month-old son loses patience with this book. He's not really old enough to figure out which toy Blue has put away from page to page, so he usually loses interest after about 4 pages, because the pictures are kind of repetitive. This might be better for an older toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough already","review":"Ok, we all know toddlers just love blue. But this book isn't well written. My two yr old tires of them easily, and she loves books. So, its says alot when she is sick of something, as well as myself. Don't get me wrong, if it takes a favorite character as an incentive to read, buy this book. If you want a book to enjoy for years to come, a book that will last in memory, buy another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good point, bad points","review":"Maybe my son is just too young to understand the book, but the only thing he likes about the book is that when he touches the light switch the pages turn. As for naming the toys and noticing where they are, he has no interest. Of course, he is only 18 months old. I think that part of the problem is that every page looks alike, with only one toy out of place. The changes are not really obvious, so to him the book is boring. Blue is his favorite character and I am sure he will continue to look at the book. It's just not one of his favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"good nostalgic fun","review":"This album does contain a couple of 70's pop classics such as Mungo Jerry's 'In the Summer Time' and Greenbaum's 'Spirit in the Sky' but steer clear if you are a musical snob.For the most part this album is comprised of those bouncy cheesy numbers that everyone of a certain age group will remember from disco's. They are the songs that you still know the lyrics to and that your foot taps to but you wouldn't openly admit to liking. Do you remember 'Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep' or Sweet's 'Little Willy'? These are just two of a plethora af similar titles.Highbrow is something that this CD could never be called but for a trip down memory lane it is well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop-up Play Tent","review":"This is a very handy play tent.

I go against the popular opinion here, but I don't think a woman with this talent has to fake orgasms endlessly onstage to get the attention she deserves. I saw Janis in her prime and she sure as hell didn't do this. Beth Hart is an enormous natural talent. Whoever is advising her about her stage persona should be fired. One problem is that she makes even the best musicians behind her look frail no matter how high their guitars are amped. I would like to see more of her with Bonamassa if she can keep her clothes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality","review":"I am a music guy, so I bought the dvd based on Beth's contribution to the last Les Paul cd and reviews of her work.What a disappointment!

You MUST listen to her music.All three CD's are incredible and the DVD is a must for anyone who has never seen her live!And it's a definite must for all Beth Hart fans!!Incredibly talented with a voice like I have never heard.

If you are a fan then it is a must have. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Beck's Singer? Much, much more!!!","review":"Jeff Beck just appeared in San Francisco last week (April 2006) and his vocalist was Beth Hart. Beth breathed new life into several old Rod Stewart songs like \\"Ain't Superstitious\\", \\"Morning Dew\\", etc. She was truly a breath of fresh air in interpreting those songs. I was impressed enough to get this DVD and her performances are way beyond what she did in SF. She plays a credible piano, guitar and sings her heart out. This is the real deal!!! Forget those folks on \\"American Idol\\" who wanna be what Beth is already."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've never seen Beth...SEE her!","review":"If you have never experienced Beth Hart, this is your best initiation! She is \\"real\\" and \\"raw\\" in recordings but live you can see just HOW real and raw she is. It's almost a little too raw to watch sometimes as she talks about her battles with drugs and alcohol but that's what makes her so hard to take your eyes off of. With all the no talent, \\"studio sound\\" bimbos on the pop scene now (pick 'em, Brittney, Jessica, Ashlee, etc.), it is a true shame that Beth Hart hasn't gotten more acclaim but in seeing her behind the scenes it is pretty clear that it's not what's most important to her anyway.

But his rival Big D will stop at nothing to change this, including going against hundreds of years of Triad tradition and influencing the vote with money and violence.When Wo Shing's ancient symbol of leadership, the Dragon's Head Baton, goes missing, a ruthless struggle for power erupts and the race to retrieve the Baton threatens to tear Won Shing in two.Can Wo Shing balance their traditional brotherhood ways with the cut-throat modern world of 21st century business?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just want to purchase this book.

This however is boring, uninteresting, banal, whatever you can think of to say it didn't entertain me. I could listen to this until my ears bled and not feel a tenth of the emotion expressed by truly great bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate and Death Cab for Cutie. For some real music, check out Modest Mouse's albums (all of them), The Killers, Simon and Garfunkel, the above mentioned Sunny Day Real Estate and Death Cab for Cutie, The Clash, Operation Ivy, and Neutral Milk Hotel are all great for real music lovers, not lovers of comatose inducing slop passing as music like this.Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Great Song Does Not a Classic Make","review":"Other than Heavy Metal Drummer, this album is totally mediocre. This album is perhaps the most overated, overhyped alternative album of all time. I do not see what all the fuss was about. I guess that sums up Wilco for me in general. I could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering. Download Heavy Metal Drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My Mind","review":"I wrote here on Dec25 that I was disappointed when I first heard this CD. I will be humble enough to confess to you that I was wrong. After two more careful listens, it has grown on me... I now depend on this darn thing to feel good... CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?There are a few songs on here that will just make me feel a bit more positive about whatever it is I am doing. Suddenly the noise does not sound like noise anymore, but more like carefully chosen bits of sounds that togeteher compose lovely harmonies.I could not have been more wrong, so I apologize, this is a GREAT album! But this goes to show that it may not seem like such at first glance, it takes a while for one to learn to appreciate this material. It is a sophisticated album, not intended to entertain the easily entertained, no doubt about that.Hope this has been useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful alternative pop album with folk and country tinges. It does not contain many straightforwardly appealing songs but as a coherant whole it becomes a thing of shimmering beauty. Not a single track is a dud, from the mid-Western love ballad 'Jesus etc' to the downbeat dark builder 'Radio Cure', the sparse 'Ashes of American Flags' and the more straightforward pop of 'War on War' and 'Heavy Metal Drummer'. Tweedy's voice is a thing of beauty, and it is accompanied with twanging acoustic guitars, violins and all kinds of weird, wonderful, yet subtle synths. Closer 'Reservations' is especially lovely and heart-stirringly touching. A wonderful 21st century album rooted in the past with a twist for the future. Almost essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Was I Thinking","review":"In an earlier review of YHF, I trashed it, giving it one star. What was I thinking? I was about to sell it used and decided to listen to it a second time. I've been listening to various songs on it now for three weeks straight. I can't get over it how great this is, right up there with \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and \\"The White Album.\\" It's that good. I then picked up \\"Summerteeth\\" and \\"Being There.\\" Equally great, particularly \\"Summerteeth.\\" These guys draw on so many diverse elements and put it together...forget about it...words aren't enough to describe the pure joy of listening to Wilco.

Finally, an album that captures and defines the \\"sound\\" of post-modernism! Tweedy and crew have created an original, and totally fresh, \\"american\\" classic. It should be an essential part of any serious music-lover's library. It's also a recording that demands repeated listenings!...pure poetry! By mixing the roots of Americana, with the \\"sound\\"-of-today, the band succeeds in creating an album that's complex, and unusually rich in atmosphere. To listen to this album is to take a journery through a chosen soundscape. One where Jeff's melancholic-grace, and desperately heartfelt-vocals, is backed by an ever-changing, and always-evolving, musical landscape. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot roars out of the subway like a strangely beautiful piece of post-modern art.

I had heard of them before, and as soon as I heard \\"Jesus Etc.\\" playing in the record store, I knew that I had to at least give it a chance. The rhythms are great, the lyrics are great (for the most part), and I only really have one gripe: the random, loud, radio static-like sounds that seem to find their way into just about every song. I can see how this might be an interesting way to introduce or trail a song. Once. But 4 and 5 times is really overdoing it.All-in-all, a great album, with some great influences, including the Beatles, and I DO believe I hear a hint of Bowie in the lyrics of \\"i'm the man that loves you\\". First time Wilco listers out there: THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP. Maybe after you put this one through the paces, you go out a buy Being There, huh? Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cure for radio.","review":"I don't know if I can call this the masterpiece of 2002 that others have, but it is extremely good. It does take a few listens to really appreciate though. All the songs I like, but my favorites are \\"Kamera\\", \\"War on War\\", \\"Jesus, etc.\\", and of course \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\". I can relate to that song, because I've seen a few bands on the riverfront in St. Louis myself. This doesn't sound too much like the \\"Jeff Tweedy\\" we knew from \\"Uncle Tupelo\\", but it will go great with the recent \\"Beck\\" and \\"Flaming Lips\\" albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must, sort of","review":"If you have the $ or are in Australia get, this one w/ the extra disc. V good. The extra disc is a great idea too. I'm not a big fan of \\"extra hidden track\\" tracks. If put on a bonus disc then it doesn't screw w/ the original; it becomes an addition and you can take it or leave it. When the e.p. came out one could download it. I was technically not capable of doing so but fortunately my brother-in-law just moved to Australia so he picked me up a copy. Cool. Getting this one instead of the original configuration of YHF is not a must. It's only a must if you happen upon a copy in yr travels. You could then trade in yr original copy or give it to a friend to spread the love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about overrated! Music is terrible!","review":"I purchased this CD solely on the strength of reviews here, and actually listened to it twice. Like some previous reviewers here, I must say I just don't get it either! How many seem think this band is a modern day musical marvel is beyond me! The songs are too plain, uninspired, and most certainly not well written. In fact, they are downright boring and un-memorable. But, considering how today's youth arguably has [worse] music to listen to than previous generations, it doesn't surprise me that they would like this Wilco release. Music is getting worse and worse these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth 10 dollars","review":"I've given this cd many listens, but I just don't like it.

I do not approve."},{"rating":"1","title":"What album did you listen to? Best of the year? NOT.","review":"Pay no attention to the average 4 star rating of this CD. It's terrible. It's overproduced tripe. There is no \\"Trace\\" of the band that gave us A.M. left on this album. It sounds like a half-hearted Beck tribute band. \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\"? It's almost unlistenable, no check that. It IS unlistenable, just like the rest of this inexplicably well-reviewed mish-mash. At least listen to the samples provided above before wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I bought this CD based on several 5 star reviews by other listeners. I'm sorry, but I don't get it. Or maybe I'm just dropping the wrong kind of acid.

I like Son Volt.I just don't like this album. People have said that you need several listens to unravel the mysteries of the album to truly appreciate it - and maybe that is true. I just can't get through the requisite four or five listens - this music is just horribly unenjoyable. There is nothing fun or catchy here. Other \\"complicated\\" albums gave me reasons to return to them, gave me reasons to listen repeatedly as the album grew on me- like the electronic/Marching Band sound of the title track on \\"Kid A\\". YHFT doesn't - nothing here is anything I would like to revisit. Music is supposed to be fun, and this just isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot - a phenomenom","review":"YHF blends the traditional Wilco countty feel with soft rock to create a never-before heard sound. It is unique and highly enticing. \\"Jesus, etc\\" is one of the most underated songs of our time. The violin opening brings a new level to Wilco's music. Combined with the slow and gentle rhythm and perfect lyrics.Whereas \\"Poor Places\\" builds up for a minute and a half and then explodes gently into musical enchantment. This contrasts pleasently with the raring intro to \\"I'm The Man That Loves You\\".Once you have listen to this once, you will be listening to it for the rest of your life. The most intricate album of the past decade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold","review":"Im going to start off saying that this is the first Wilco album i have owned/heard, and that its good, i mean real good. I must admit that there are certain tracks that have taken some warming up to, but this is a beautiful album. Jeff Tweedy's vocals are so unpolished yet there is something smooth about them at the same time (if that makes any sense). The music itself is fairly minimal, except for the distorted noise at the ends of various tracks, and makes for beautiful yet fairly sad songs, yet many are upbeat. In my opinion the best tracks are \\"Jesus Etc.\\", \\"Ashes of American Flags\\", and \\"Reservations\\". I have heard many negative things about the silly \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\", but i think that its great, catchy and rather poppy, but none the less a fun song that i can never skip.This is a truely great album that i would recommend to almost anybody, so check it out, but i dont think the 30 sec. clips do it justice, and give it a thurough listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"Great stuff. They are breaking away from the alt country thing and it works. Go buy it and go see them live. Great show!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilco's best album and their most accessible - this is a winner!","review":"Wilco has made many good albums before \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", but this one is truly their breakthrough. The majority of songs here are catchy, memorable, and musically/lyrically interesting which is a very hard thing to achieve. Singer Jeff Tweedy is definitely on his game here, and a lot of the pieces seem pretty original. It's mostly a very soothing and mellow album. The lyrics, especially, are pretty good. If you weren't a fan because of Wilco's previous albums I think this'll make you one. As for its sound, it tends to vary - it can be fast at times but it's mostly slow and emotional. A very satisfying album for Wilco fans and I think a great new direction for the band. Most people should love it. Highly recommended!Highlights include:\\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\"\\"Kamera\\"\\"Radio Cure\\"\\"War On War\\"\\"Jesus, Etc.\\"\\"Ashes Of American Flags\\"\\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\"\\"Pot Kettle Black\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album.","review":"I've been listening to music for 40 years, and it's rare for me to write fan mail. However, I can't think of any other group that does to me today what the Beatles did 40 years ago--Wilco makes me wish I could walk up and shake their hands and say \\"Thank you\\". That's how much I like this album. It's innovative, beautiful music that doesn't have a bit of extra crap thrown in. Unlike some bands, Wilco even makes \\"noise\\" sound like an essential part of the music--it isn't artsy-fartsy at all. Anyway, you get the point--buy this album, listen to it 5 or 6 times, and you'll want more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amen, Brad!","review":"Someone else just as disappointed as I was for this disc...I bought it the first day, anticipating it like no other album this year.

I, for one, am not surprised! Summerteeth is the one worthwhile record this band has produced, with sounds from eno, lennon, brian wilson and others blended together in an off-kilter formalism of subverted swagger. But this record? Please! If your in love with the idea of loving Wilco than love this too! Otherwise, steer clear of the pretension and the passionless pedantry.

It has been in the cd player of my car for the past week and,well,uhI dunno...I just don't get it.

Of course, taste is subjective but this thing just bores me to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"most over-rated album of the 21st Century!","review":"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible album, but as a professional musician and songwriter, I don't hear the \\"greatness\\" in this album, that so many people seem to proclaim. It's interesting and has some innovative approaches to some of the songs, but overall it doesn't hold up. You can definitely hear the Jay Bennett influence versus the Jeff Tweedy sections. I have to agree with the Warner execs who said that the album wasn't commercial,but I'll go further and say it isn't particularly good. In a year or two this copies of this album will infest the used CD bins, and in five years the few people who remember this album, will wonder what the big fuss was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"I bought this CD after reading all the great reviews and hearing all the hype about it.

In an era of younger music fans who are constantly force-fed corporate-bred McMusic, it's no wonder that so many listeners simply accept something different as their gold. The music and vocals on this album are sub-par. If you want to hear a good \\"alt-country-rock album,\\" try Crosby Stills Nash and Young's \\"Deja Vu.\\" Save your money on this garbage.

I listened over and over, trying to reconcile my discomfort with the critical accolades. Couldn't do it. In fact, this album turned me off to the band for a long time.Flash forward. Wilco is now easily one of my Top 10 favorite bands of all time. I adore the late (The Whole Love) and the early (Being There) and frequently listen to everything in between. But YHF? Still no. My least favorite in their catalog.I still try every few months, as some of the songs have a lot of promise. But they remind me of Altman's film \\"Popeye\\" - songs start off well enough, then sink down a druggy, self-absorbed hole. Thumbs down.Can't understand the enduring raves. Listen to Wilco, if you haven't. Start anywhere but here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"I am somewhat of a new Wilco fan. This is the first album I heard from Wilco and it took 5 listens to really apreciate it. I watched a movie about the making of this album and I fell in love with Jeff Tweeny. His voice is truley unique. Some songs that really got to me on this album were Radio Cure and Reservations. I think 'reservations' is one of the best closers of an album I have heard in a very long time. The reason I did not give this album 5 stars was because not all the songs were brilliant. 'War on War' has some cheesy lyrics and is probly a political song and same with 'Ashes of American Flags.' Some of Tweenys lyrics though are amazing and I really enjoy his work. Overall this was a great album and it's a must have for any Wilco fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding effort","review":"This is an ambitious record that deserves all the hype it got when it came out. I wasn't too sure the first couple times I listened, but I distinctly remember the third time I listened. It was quite an experience. I just sat there mesmerized by the sounds and beauty. The lyrics are strong and the vocal-stylings of Jeff Tweedy are great and original. This is a challenging record, causing one to delve deeper beyond the surface. If you can do it, you will be rewarded by a very enjoyable, smart record. \\"A Ghost is Born\\" is also a wonderful release, and you should like it if you like YHF.

Yoko Ono, Radiohead, Bjork, King Crimson and many others are innovative.

The arrengement of synth and keyboard have quite badinfluence on the songs. I was about to throw away when I startedto listen. Moreover the melody has no impression. I could standex. record \\"Summerteeth\\" ; however , I get angry with thisbetray. That is the worst album in this year , I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, Ok","review":"AM - Wilco tries to be the Stones. They're not the stones, they're not Gram Parsons, but so what I've heard all the stones songs and all the Gram Parsons songs a million times. I wanna hear something slightly different, but the same if ya know what I mean. Good, but to play when I'm so sick of the originals.Being There - Same as AM review, but slightly more experimental. It could have been interesting, but its not. Some more killer stonesy songs however.Summertime - Abandoned the stones/Gram for the Beatles/Brian Wilson sound. I actually like it better. It's no less derivative, but I do like it better than their stones rip-offs.YHF - White Album??????? I like it, but then my wife started to like it too and I started to get really sick of it. Definately a beatles rip-off. The more experimental stuff doesn't quite work cause Tweedy isn't really a musician. He can't pull off like the Beatles/George Martin/Brian Wilson/etc. Its enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fans of ROCK","review":"Well I heard these guys were influenced by country music so it was a relief to hear this album and find no fiddles or banjos but I've still gotta give it only one star because there's still no ROCK on it. There's some electronic bleeps for a while and it sounds like the rock may come but it rarley does. When it does it stops just as suddenly. When finally HEAVY METAL DRUMMER roles around its not heavy at all :( Instead it sounds like pop. Plus the solos are out of tune when they crop up at all. As a fan of rock music like Poison, Ratt or Cinderella I was very dissappointed with this release and do not recommend it to rock fans at all. Buy only if you want an album to put you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype...More overproduced crap","review":"I got suckered into buying another Wilco album. I thought I had bailed for good after 'being there'. But all the critics were saying this was Tweedy's return to Tupelo style, so I bought it. Wrong again. This is more overproduced [junk] from Tweedy & co. Why Tweedy wants to be Sgt. Pepper/Brian Wilson is beyond me. Or is it that...band that keeps putting that spin on Tweedy's music?

And a warning to everyone out there, there are references to drinking and drugs, for shame Mr. Tweedy. Why do critics continue to give credit for inventiveness. Give me the same beat in every song and lyrics about how to move my body. Wilco should get together with Brittany's producer and make a real album.

They combine a reverence for history with punk initiative better than any band in America today. Therefore, it was with eager anticipation that I tore off the shrink wrap to get my Wilco fix. And lo and behold, at the end I went...wha? So, I listened again...and again...and again. It's that kind of record. An album that requires a real committment from the listener. There are poignant lyrics and stories and this is the stuff Tweedy and Co. are made of. But Radio Head, Latin Playboys, Mitchell Froome and Tchad Blake do the production better than these guys did , this time. And that, my friend is the point. I felt that Wilco made me work to hear this record. I had to prove my love to hear this. This will be a critical darling, the reviews are glowing. But for those of us with nothing to prove, just our love of Wilco, it's a 4 star record and that's only because we were fond of 'em in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two cents worth","review":"Tweedy and Co. have been messing with styles for some time. YFH must stand as a benchmark, not only for its choice of production values, but also for a cogent mix of the personal and political, the yin and yang of double-ought America.Think OK Computer filtered through Dwight Twilley, or Pink Floyd as a product of southern Illinois, and you've got a pretty good idea of what this is all about.If you approach this with a pre-conceived notion of alt-country (read: Uncle Tupelo, Jayhawks, Son Volt and the like) you will be sorely disappointed.If, however, you enjoy literate music that fits in no category other than \\"good,\\" this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, and genuine!","review":"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is an album worth spending some time with. Its songs are original, varied, genuine, emotional, fun, elegent, prolific and they prove that you can be all these things without loosing your pop sensibility. For me it was the lyric writing itself that was the real gem of this album. His literary voice is so fresh, these guys are real artists, yet they don't come off that way. And that's the beauty of this album for me. Its thoughtful and breaks ground, but won't alienate the audience like Radiohead's latter records. This is a very tasteful pop album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Legend is more impressive than the actual album","review":"I can't think of a single soul who wasn't on the edge of their seat waiting for YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT. The news of a band defying their record label, releasing the album for free on the internet just for spite, then.... going to another subsidiary of the same label... anyway... at first listen, it was like smoking a Cuban cigar... forbidden in this country. Once the initial joy wore off of listening to this album that defied executives, the real critical ear went to work. The album is dry. The songs tend to run too long and there is a bit too much noise. They can be borderline irritating, and this comes from a listener who tends to like more experimental sounds and artists that have an acquired taste. This album is a must-have simply for the story, but for the music, it's best to stop with \\"Summer Teeth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country's Ok Computer","review":"YHF may be slightly excessive in its sonic texturing, leading to a few pockets of dead noise here and there, but most often compresses and contorts into fascinating shapes instead. The disc still sounds about as superb an example at the expansive direction Wilco was taking their once traditional sound with hardly any residual pretension."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was my first experience with Wilco, after much advisement from a friend. I have to say, I was not disappointed. My expectations were not only met, but far surpassed. This is a truly amazing album. Right from the first two songs, I was hooked and the rest of the album was just as entertaining. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot really flows in a way few albums do. Wilco managed to put together a dozen songs that, while all maintaining a similar feel, are entirely unique to each other and enjoyable for completely different reasons. Every song by itself is a reason to own this album, luckily for us they're all on one CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year...Twice!","review":"Delighted to see YHF as Amazon's number 1 album on the first day of its official release, since everyone who likes Wilco has had the album for months via download. There is certainly a lesson there for the RIAA. And if you have the download and haven't bought the album...do the right thing and buy it now. An album this good deserves much reward. It was the best album of 2001, AND it is the best album of 2002. Fantastic from the first note to the last. \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\" is one of the great opening cuts ever to be put on record with its lyric weaving back and forth between insanity and despair and ultimately to cruelty. It may not be radio-friendly, but it's fabulous! The downloaded album could not be unseated from my CD-changer for 6 months until now that the real thing can take its place. YHF beat the longest prior run, \\"OK Computer.\\" YHF is great.

I experienced new levels of tolerance, while attempting to listen to the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"The media line was that Wilco's old record company refused to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot because they just didn't understand the art to it. After one listen, I realized they didn't release it because it is so bad. I loved Son Volt and Wilco's first CD. Tweedy has degraded into something that doesn't even sound good. For the most part the songs all sound alike. Tweedy's lyrics are delivered in a subdued monotone with random electronic noises thrown in. What happened to the enthusiasm this guy used to have?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reprise had it right! This is pretty bad!","review":"I thought I would hold out until I went to the concert to do this review, and after seeing Wilco here in Chicago last week, I can truthfully post this. It was without a doubt the WORST concert I have every seen, and this CD may be the worst in my collection. Except for 'Heavy Metal Drummer', this CD drones on and on in a single chord monotone that has me reaching for the razor blades. Skip this one at all costs.The only decent CD Wilco has put out in 'AM', so if you really want something from this band, get that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathological offkey wanking","review":"I really wanted to like this album. Being an audiophile wannabe, I read all the critics' reviews and really expected a treat. I like straight-on songs without meandering meaningless intros. YHF does not fulfill on this criterion. I'm not sure what the long, boring 1 minute plus intros seek to achieve - other than provide a contrast for the approximately 4 songs that are catchy and listenable on this album. It seems like we are being set-up for audio torture for the bulk of this album and the few redeeming songs provide such relief that we are fooled into thinking this is really a work of \\"genius\\". Maybe Tweedy should have fired himself as a singer and hired someone who has a decent voice. Get someone to burn cuts 3,7,8 and 9 and trash the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throwing it all away... wasted genius, etc.","review":"Take one of the great human voices (Tweedy) and bury it in the mix, slather digital effects and artsy EQ all over it. Take one of the great songwriters of the last ten years & let him write lyrics that are strings of nonsensical \\"associations\\". Take a great band & break it apart. Fire it's soul. You get this self indulgent, largely unlistenable album. Hey, I love this band & I'll stick with them through almost anything, but this finds them seeking a cool factor... critical acclaim going to their heads.I love it when bands take chances, try new directions, and I give them credit for that, but this album is just not very good. I want to hear Jeff sing, I want to hear harmonies, I want to hear great musicianship and brilliant lyrics. The noise is interesting & cool, but without the rest it will just sit on the shelf instead of in the CD player.Nothing lasts forever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I have heard nothing but rave reviews of this CD-and as an open-minded music fan I decided to give it a shot. I listened to the entire CD, waiting and waiting for it to start to be wonderful, and that time just never came. Maybe this is one of those CDs that needs a few listens, but the fact is there are way too many other CDs I would rather listen to than this one, so I may never know. As for (seemingly) everyone else in the world who loves this CD and can't get over its brilliance and greatness, I'm happy for you, but I honestly can't see the merits of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to have a Bad Trip by...","review":"I really enjoyed Wilco's recordings with Billy Bragg and \\"AM\\" but this one is way undercooked for songs with meaning and musicians that can play, and overcooked with effects and garbled \\"I always wanted to be a Beatle\\" type retro wanking. Did I buy this to hear a drummer try his best to sound like Ringo Starr (listen to track one to see what I mean)? Tweedy's vocals are dull and the words he sings are just as uninspiring. Skip this one unless you like throwing away money. I made better music in elementary band class then is on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch paint dry and grass grow","review":"I read the hype, I read the New York Times review, I read Rolling Stone magazine article but where did they go wrong... the first listen is like pulling teeth, I have given it time to grow on me but now I am embarrassed to use it as a coaster on my coffee table. Sometimes the record companies are right, this should have stayed in the can"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I just finished by first (and probably last) listen to this CD. I am not a musician. I don't care about technique or \\"sonic adventurism\\" or experimentalism etc. The \\"sonic bleed of competing signals\\", the \\"cathartic squall of distortion\\" don't do anything for me, mainly because they sound like they've just be added in order to make the songs more interesting given the lead sings hushed bland delivery. Although the songs without all the sonic garnish added a somewhat more listenable, they still put me to sleep. This album might \\"demand, and reward, repeated listens\\", but if there's nothing in the first listen to make you want to hear it again, why should I force myself to endure it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilco emperor clothes","review":"Am i missing something here? All i'm hearing is a bunch of bland country pop songs with a peppering of ambient electronica over the top.

I could just imagine how unbeleivably dull Wilco would be live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Best album of 2002?? Yawn, this is awful. Boring, trite, and well yes again, boring.

I was expecting somewhat better than Summer Teeth, which I thought deserved one of the best albums of 1999. I kept anticipating a song that had some melody, words that meant something. Instead I got cutsy noises and totally \\"me\\" lyrics, most of the time making no sense whatsoever. Oh, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beck lite","review":"For all the ink spilled by critics in praise of this album, it's no better than mediocre. The album has a few mildly catchy tunes -- \\"Poor Places\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" come to mind -- but is a pale imitation of more inventive artists like Beck and Yo La Tengo. \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is like the shadow cast on the cave wall by Beck's \\"Odelay!\\" or YLT's \\"Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out.\\" Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought my headphones were broken!","review":"Okay, I get what's going on here, the static and other annoying sounds are supposed to simulate a radio broadcast. Big deal! Taking average songs and adding annoying sounds to each track doesn't make them extraordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"How about some decent lyrics...consistantly? Also the melody lines sound like what you would sing when you've got a few chords down and are first making up a verse or chorus, not a final product. A bunch of weird noises + dumb lyrics + singing like your hungover laying in bed = great music for some I guess. There are a few decent moments, but nothing a million garage bands couldn't duplicate in 5 minutes. Maybe my perspective is different than most because I record bands all the time and have done a few albums myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to listen to...","review":"I can not for the life of me figure out what attracts some people to this album. It is absolutely horrendous. I (thankfully) borrowed it from my brother-in-law to listen to before I bought it. That move saved me big time. Just plain horrible. I can't put into words my displeasure listening to this. I tried to sit and focus on the music. I tried playing it in the background while doing something else. I put my CD player on random to mix it up with other albums. Nothing helped. There are two half decent tracks on this album, with Kamera being one of them. The rest is half-hearted, thrown together, stumbling annoyance. Critics jumped on this with good reviews due to it's \\"eccentric nature\\", short-wave radio theme, and the band's trouble getting this album released. Don't be fooled by them, and avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"How someone can give this 5 stars.......","review":"....is beyond me. Now I like Wilco. Summerteeth is a great album, basically everything up until this terrible album was very good. Maybe this album wouldn't be so terrible if the horrible song \\"heavy metal drummer\\", was not on here. In fact, that song is so terrible it should not have been made. I am sorry to those who love this album, but I just can't get into it. There are a few scattered tracks on here that keep me from giving it a worse rating than 2 stars. Maybe this album would be good if you were used to listening to really crappy music for an exstensive period of time and than discovered that coldplay is a really sad excuse of a band, and you put away your interpol cd's because you finally realized that they are a joy division ripoff but way worse. Than maybe YHFT would be a good album to you, but Wilco could, and has done alot better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger Wilco","review":"I greatly anticipated the release of this album. I totally fell in love with Summerteeth. It seemed Jeff Tweedy was on the top of his game. But with this outing, it seems Tweedy has forsaken listenabilty in favor of distorted guitar feedback,white noise, and studio loops, etc... I feel it was overdone, and it took away from what could have been there best album yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissenting Opinion","review":"I read all the great reviews. I've had a copy Wilco's \\"Being There\\" for years and still play it. So I was really surprised at how little I enjoyed \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\". To me, it just \\"missed\\". I don't really know how else to describe it. A lot of the songs seemed to have promise, but none of them seemed to fulfill it. I tried replaying it many times, over a period of months, but just couldn't find any reason to keep it in my player - I didn't like it at all. Finally had to sell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not an alt-country fan","review":"I'm not at all a fan of whatever genre Wilco were before this album. I've never heard any Uncle Tupelo, and I don't own any other Wilco alubms.Which is to let you know that coming to this album completely out of the blue, on the basis of great reviews, hype and friends who are fans, I'd have to say this album is pure genius.If they ever were country, or anything like what passes for country these days, this album is a miracle. It is intelligent and innovative (everything most country is not) and yet, somehow the songs are all simple and catchy as possible.A beatiful mix of songwriting, experimentation and whatever additional genius went into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD - Give It a Chance","review":"After reading many of the reviews of this album (good and bad), I decided to give it a chance. In short, I'm glad I did. It's definitely one of those albums that it best absorbed in one complete listening, not in pieces. It will never beat A.M. in my opinion, but it's a great addition to my collection. Here's the skinny:1) 4-star album2) Not a radical departure as some have suggested. In my mind it's really a stripped-down acoustic record with some well-timed noises3) I like placement of the noises and effects, but don't always like the sound of the noises chosen. Does this make sense?4) As mentioned, best digested in one sittingEnjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!","review":"My expectations for the new Wilco album were through the roof before it even came out, and when I finally heard it all of my expectations were completely blown away. Jeff Tweedy and Co. have outdone themselves. If you're a Wilco fan, this album is a must have. If you are not a Wilco fan, one listen and you will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those who believe they are music snobs","review":"I have always like this band......Jeff Tweedy's band following the break-up of Uncle Tupelo. However, it amazes me that anyone who listens to this CD can give it 5 stars. It is an amalgamation of incoherent, irritating and unlistenable noise.Those who grade this with more than one star are either band members, close friends of the band or those who think of themselves as music afficionado's who know more about music than you do (similar to liberal Democrats who believe they know how to spend your money better than yourself). They can say to there snobby afficionado friends that they \\"get\\" this CD. Other, \\"less intelligent listeners\\", do not understand the depth of this music.

Summer Teeth was a good album it mixed old with new, this..this album made me sad. At first i thought i put in my Better Than Ezra disc by mistake. But BTE pulled of weirdness and it sounded good, this album just sounds like junk junk and confused junk. This album just seems not to be worth the money. Go buy Chelsea Walls the remake of The Lonely One is beautiful. I dont agree with dling music from the net but save your money and dk YHF"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Wilco Fan","review":"Yes, it is Beatlesesque. It seems contrived. It's Wilco's techno dance album. There was a double masterpiece called Being there, where there was great american songs, humable tunes you can't get out of your head, and beautiful guitar work. feedback and studio tricks cover up uncreative progressions in YHF. I admit I like war on war, for some reason its grown on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn great, despite the hype","review":"Engaging and enjoyable collection of guitar pop that has its exuberant and pensive moments. The Conet-infused flurry of white noise at the end of \\"Poor Places\\" is my personal favorite moment, although \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" is another high point in my book. For someone who's never been into the \\"Americana\\" thing (I own a copy of Uncle Tupelo's genre-spawning debut, and that's it), I can't attest to the \\"no depression\\" factor (or lack thereof) of this album, but I do like it for what it is. That said, I had no idea just how much Jeff Tweedy sounds like Jerry Garcia (or even Stephen Malkmus) at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Release this Year","review":"This is a C.D. that can be played over and over again. From start to finish there is so much going on in this album, it's simply amazing. I've been a Wilco fan for several years now and I think the band is growing into something spectacular. This album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilco redeemed","review":"There are few American musicians these days who are constantly willing to put their reputation on the line by creating adventurous and challenging music. Jeff Tweedy and his mates from Wilco are the exception.For all the detractors in the recording industry, Wilco has created a wonderful piece of post-modern Americana.Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is one of those albums where every listening produces new feelings and nuances for the listener. Kamera, Pot Kettle Black, Jesus,etc. Heavy Metal Drummer are enjoyable tunes with engaging rhythms that won't disappoint. But the tone of the album is best epitomized by the signature song of the album. Ashes of American Flags is a haunting lyric and melody in the spirit of Woody Guthrie. Although recorded a year ago, the song portrays a sentiment that many will relate to today.I say, show the recording execs at Reprise they were wrong about Wilco and buy this record. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, okay...","review":"Wilco was on its way (after A.M. and Being There) to becoming one of the best rock/roots rock bands in the world. They took a diversion with Billy Bragg down Mermaid Ave. to do justice to many pieces of Guthrie poetry by setting them to music...fine. They made a pretty pop record (Summerteeth)...okay. But this...well, the album itself is not without merit, but Tweedy and co. have gotten to the point where they're quirky for the sake of being quirky. Many of these tunes have potential, but get too caught up in being cute, and \\"experimental,\\" and...whatever. There's nothing, musically, on this disc that hasn't been done before. It all comes off as trite, self-aggrandizing, avant-look-at-me, condescending rubbish. Wilco's considerable talents would be best spent elsewhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"why all the hype?","review":"Tweedy and Farrar have been making great music for years. It appears as if they were better off together than apart. Each seems to be missing what the other has in abundance. This is a very uneven album - too few fantastic songs surrounded by overproduced guitar trackes with too much random noise. I find it jarring to listen to either through headphones or speakers. Seems as if every new noise/guitar trick that Wilco learned was included. I would have expected that on an early album. Here it just ruins good pop songs. The label story makes for great hype, but this disc didn't last long in the CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best band in America","review":"Tweedy and company have created another artistic masterpiece. An unusual album in that every song fits together as a whole. From the first song \\"I am trying to break your heart\\" thru \\"Reservations\\" Wilco get's it. They know what the head and heart want to hear. Buy it now. Make your kids listen. Give it to your Grandpa. spin it with your wife. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"Yet another nearly perfect record for Wilco. The label that dropped the ball on this record really lost out, it's an amazing accomplishment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE all but one thing","review":"I love everything about this album- the experimentation, the odd sounds, the mixing of poppy and artsy, the fight with the record company, the instrumentation, the deconstruction and reconstruction of the songs, the album cover, the vocals and the lyrics. HOWEVER, what is up with the line 'take off your band-aid 'cause I don't believe in touchdowns?' It's been ten years. I don't get it or like it. Still...this album is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilco, the best band you've never heard of","review":"Pure musical genius, but that's what we've come to expect from Tweedy and company."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOMEDAY SOON","review":"When will the rest of the world catch on to the best rock and roll band making music today? I've been predicting it since 1995, believing A.M. was a stepping stone to a wider audience. I hope this is it. Hopefully Wilco can prove, like the Beatles and Nirvana before them, that guitar bands are still in style.These songs are denser and more textured than their previous efforts. Production plays a bigger role than ever, but never makes the music sound artificial. The melodies are quite accessible. To put it in popular terms, if Radiohead's most recent work was cohesive, created with an American point of view and not mired in self-absorbed misery, it might sound something like this. Maybe.This album is vindication for everyone, like myself, who has touted Wilco as being the best rock and roll band in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been in the trenches for Jeff Tweedy","review":"I love this record. Especially turned up loud. Then you get to hear all the backround noises going on. You hear little clips of songs coming up. Little clips of what it sounds like a radio. It's beautiful. And yes Jeff is getting a little out there with his lyrics. But after listening to it again, and getting to read the lyrics, it kind of all makes sense. It's personal this time. Really personal. I love the flow, the sounds, his voice especially. His voice is really subtle and lovely. Buy it. Oh.. I was also a pirate of the recording and bought the real deal because Wilco deserves everything. Wilco without a doubt is the best band because of how diverse they can be and still be proud of each record--which is so different from the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know Wilco paid for shills.","review":"After reading such rave reviews by fellow amazonians i went out and bought Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Now i just wish the store would take it back. Apparently the cd i listened to (3 times thru) is not the same one everyone else did. I thought most of the songs sounded like a tabby cat being swung around by its tail. Tracks 4 and 5 were tolerable, but the rest were pretty [junky]. Of course this is just my opinion. But i suggest if you're a Wilco fan that you find another Wilco fan who already made the mistake of buying the cd and give it a listen first. I'd give you my copy, but i threw it out already."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good effort for a stylistically lacking band","review":"I was not very familiar with the band Wilco (aside from some of their singles) before I bought \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\". I decided to jump in after reading rave reviews for YHF. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. If you can get over the fact that this album sounds like \\"Pavement Does Space Rock Volume 1\\", (with special guests Urge Overkill on \\"Kamera\\", \\"War on War\\", \\"Tea Kettle Black\\" and Bob Dylan on \\"Jesus, Etc.\\") *apologies if I just ruined those songs for you* - then it's palatable. Surely, \\"Wilco's best album\\" is probably fairly accurate. However, much of Wilco's fanbase are simply being introduced to new musical styles that they are not familiar with. For those who do not find Wilco's sound on YHF fresh and innovative, it is a simply mediocre album, not worth listening to more than a couple of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Don't let these others hacks talk you into wasting money on this album. Its boring. There's no intricate sounds, amazing lyrics, etc... Its just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts my dog's ears too............","review":"This cd is a disappointment at best. I don't like all that \\"metalic noise\\" which some believe is actually music... I heard them on a Late Show and thought they sounded nice. Obviouslly, they were playing the only song on the cd that has any redeeming qualities. I don't like most of the music, it hurts my ears. If you like nice melody, harmony and rhythm this IS NOT the cd for you. I think if a cd is terrible, we should be able to return it for a full refund. That way, these so called \\"Artists\\" will know how we feel...Perhaps then, they would try harder. I gave them one star because they can play an instrument. (although that is questionable as well)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"Yuck. There's no other way to describe this pile of garbage. If this is what I have to look forward to from Wilco from now on they might as well throw in the towel now while they still have some dignity left and leave us with the other outstanding albums they've done like Being There."},{"rating":"1","title":"wusses with keyboard noises","review":"the overall weakness of this album cannot be overstated. it is a lightweight and farcical little journey around Tweedys mind. if you want alt-country, check out Lucinda Williams, who really rocks. trite songwriting and noises abound on this disc, and though there are some strangely beautiful moments on a few songs, they don't last and don't boost up the songs that well. This is one of those albums that is ushering the now popular indie rock scene, which is very focused on looking cool, but not actually playing any good music and \\"singing\\" out of tune (or just babbling randomly). Thats all the lyrics are on this cd: babbleI would recommend just avoiding music like this. I would check out instead the Postal Service, Modest Mouse, and Death Cab For Cutie. At least they make more consistent effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Sigh","review":"Oh, well- Call me unhip, call me hypnotized with Top 40 playlists- Call me oh-so-un-alternative-But call me someone who needs a melody to connect with a song.Wilco - Tweedy - whatever - seems to have abandoned the need for connection and is railing against all things \\"establishment\\" to a point where he's one step from being another basement-pirate artist that cranks out navel-gazing noise that he, himself, finds oh-so-interesting in a 4am daze with incense burning, coffee pumping through his blood matched only by the nic-fit that his crumpled box of Marlboro's delivers.I've been to the mountain-top, seen Wilco live, bought the last record, which still clung to some need to make accessible songs, and I felt my blood boil when Wilco's old label said \\"Yankee\\" was a \\"career-killer\\".It is...but the REM potential of this singer / songwriter needs a serious lightning bolt to keep me interested.Resist the pull of the basement-pirates, Tweedy.

Forget about the drama with their record labels, forget about Jay Bennett leaving the band, forget about Wilco's unknown status (broken up?/together?)......just listen. If you hear what I heard, you'll hear a highly mediocre album that, at best, has a couple of good songs on it.I really like Wilco. I almost certainly will continue to like them. However, I think that those who are calling \\"YHF\\" things like \\"The Best of 2002\\" and \\"Pure Genius\\" are WAY off base - focussing more on the drama than the music. My vote?? I consider \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" one of the most disappointing albums of 2002. If you don't believe me, try the following. After you're done listening to \\"YHF\\", pop in \\"AM\\", \\"Being There\\", or \\"Summerteeth\\" and see what your ears and heart tell you.

After \\"Being There\\", I found it difficult to get excited about anything Tweedy did. Based on all these so called reviews, you'd think Wilco was the second coming of the Beatles. This CD embodies everything that drove me away from mainstream music towards roots, alt country, or whatever you want to call it. All this synthesized stuff bites it. This isn't a guitar band anymore. This music has no soul or passion. The only thing it might be good for is insomnia. I'll stick with old Tupelo, Jayhawks, and Jay Farrar. If you really want to hear a new CD that rocks, check out Bottle Rockets \\"Songs of Sahm\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't like it.","review":"I bought this album based on the fine reviews it had recieved.

I would not categorize Kathleen Edwards as \\"country\\" or even \\"alt.country\\" - Failer is definitely rock and roll (in particular, \\"12 Bellevue\\" and \\"Maria\\" rock hard), which is a good thing in my mind. Good hooks abound, and the addition of banjo, organ, horns, and violin make for consistently interesting music. While not perfect, this recording is a very impressive first outing for Ms. Edwards, and I look forward to her development as an artist. I highly recommend Failer."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice debut, hope to hear more","review":"I heard \\"Hockey Skates\\" on the radio and knew that any songwriter who worked hockey metaphors into songs was one I'd like. Enjoyed the whole album - the Lucinda and Emmylou comparisons work well enough, but I'd say Kathleen Edwards is more like Garrison Starr at this point - solid, rocking individual songs but not quite a full-album's worth of songs that work as a unified whole...but we can add yet, b/c she (like G-Starr) is still young and will get there - hopefully with the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different tastes","review":"Wow - I found out about Kathleen Edwards late in the game, when the Voyageur CD received so much praise. I am hooked on the Voyageur tracks, so purchased her other offerings expecting the same. Wrong! No wonder those liking her as an artist and her first three CDs are shocked by Voyageur - it's like two different singers. But, this is a review of Failer...and it fails to impress me. Very slow, very sad presentations. I really wanted to like the songs, but after listening to them I just cannot connect. That does not mean others won't, but had I heard this CD first, I would have written off Kathleen Edwards long ago. If you don't like this CD, then give Voyageur a try, I think you will like it. As for me I have kept only one track from the other CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy Kat(hleen)","review":"This cd is a blatant copy of Lucinda Williams' work. I noticed that the guitars have been tuned to duplicate Ms. Williams' sound. Also the way she phrases her lyrics and even her voice itself is attempting to sound like Lucinda Williams. Tracks 1 and 2 are almost identical to songs on Lucinda's cd \\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\\" Despite the fact that she copied another artist, I still gave her two stars because she did such a good job of it. I look forward to Lucinda's new album this year. I've never seen someone be this influenced by another's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DEBUT","review":"A close friend told me \\"get this cd and if you don't like it I'll refund your money. Well, with hype like that you're bound to be a little dissapointed. I did get through the entire cd first listen, and I heard the resemblance to Lucinda. But my first impression was \\" This gal ain't got the songs Lucinda has.\\" After repeated listenings however, these songs are growing on me quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with \\"Failer\\"","review":"I was disappointed with this CD, especially after reading several positive reviews. I will admit to liking the music very much-the instrumentation, arrangements and melodies, and the song lyrics and messages. What I did not care for was the singer's voice. While the artist's voice has been described as \\"breathy,\\" I would be more inclined to say \\"atonal.\\" It was an uncomfortable voice to listen to and, unfortunately for me, the really good music did not counteract the vocals. I think that Edwards would make a terrific song writer, but I would prefer it if someone else sang her songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathe and Falter","review":"It takes about fifteen listens to have this album sit where you want it to. For the time being, maybe in the car or maybe in the multi-cd player. It's soon to be sitting on the shelf after you get tired of listening to the breathy voice and help-on-the-writing lyrics.The credits on this album read like a whose who in Canadian rock and pop history. For a girl that got a kick-start from being the 'opening act' to having some fantastic musicians as her original back-up band (Peter Von Alten, Dave Draves & Jim Bryson to name but a few) she certainly hasn't kept her end of the bargain by bringing some of these fantstic musicians on tour with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artists to Watch?","review":"I bought this album on the strength of a Rolling Stones so-called \\"10 Artists to Watch\\" blurb which made its way to the packaging of this album. The songs are good, the voice is nice, BUT and this is the problem- after listening to the album I wonder if Rolling Stone meant \\"watch to see if she can actually sing an entire phrase on key.\\" Sorry to be so critical, but my ears were not able to give her a 2nd chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, brilliant, and breathtaking.","review":"A little folk/ country/ rock. This cd makes me want to go on a road trip. I will definitely will be listening to failer on my way to the Sasquatch Festival at the Gorge Amphitheater, where Kathleen Edwards will be performing this May. I highly recommended for a road trip, or some down-time music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing, but good","review":"I got this on a whim, and have been really satisfied. I think my favorite song was \\"Hockey Skates\\". Some of the songs are a bit simplistic, but overall, a wonderful first album. I look forward to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative lyrics","review":"Great Debut, from a somewhat new canadian singer-songwriter. Great roots rock with a bit of Ani Difranco thrown in for extra spice. The band on this CD is great also. Kathleen Edwards writes some deeply moving and evocative lyrics with a sophistication that goes far beyond her age. She seems to get compared to almost every other female singer in this genre, but she has her own sound and style for sure. Did I mention her beautiful but tough voice? She is one great storyteller, and I think a bright future awaits her. The best songs on this album are: \\"Six Ock News\\", \\"The Lone Wolf\\", \\"Mercury\\" and \\"Maria\\". I am looking forward to seeing and hearing more from here in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody and modern","review":"Yes - it is very good. This is the soundtrak to the movie based on my life. Doesn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dining Rooms - \\"Tre\\" - 2003","review":"To me \\"Tre\\" is beautiful and intriguing, from the first track through the last. Although I have listened to this album dozens of times there is still still something about it which continues to appeal to me. \\"Tre\\" has a timeless quality and the more I have listened to it the more I've grown to enjoy it. Stefano Ghittoni and Cesare Malfatti are without a doubt masters or their craft and have produced an album worth listening to time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dining Rooms, The - Tre","review":"The Dining Rooms' third album, Tre, follows closely in the footsteps for their other two: trip-hop rhythms, cinematic soundscapes, and moody melodies. But, the rhythms are a bit livelier (check out the near-house of \\"Fluxus\\" or the full-on house of \\"Prigionieri Del Deserto\\"), and there's more emphasis on vocals (the plaintative male on \\"Fightin' 4 Rebirth\\" or the dreamy female on \\"Astro Black\\") and jazziness (\\"Existentialism (Milano Dub Mix)\\"). But the real reason to listen comes on the very first track: \\"Tunnel\\" is a tremendously beautiful track, full of longing and want and pain. It's what heartbreak sounds like, and it stands head-and-shoulders above ever other track. It alone is worth the price of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"xanax without the fun part","review":"I am late to the Dining Rooms party, and apparently haven't been missing much despite the 5-star reviews on Amazon. There is a difference between chilled (which I love) and comatose, which except for a couple of tracks toward the end of this disc would certainly be an apt description. There is no there there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing and funky","review":"Look, the same person wrote all of the reviews above this one. Believe me - it's worth having, but don't scream and shout like it's the end of history. Pleasing and funky and maybe good for sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners Only","review":"This book is a big disappointment. It misses everything on the basics of OOP. It won't explain anything about classes, methods or even variables. Big thumbs down ! BTW : if you are interested in multimedia, there are 3 chapters devoted to it. However, I would prefer them in a separate book than sacrifice on the essentials of OOP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for understanding windows dBase programmi","review":"I had programed in dBase for DOS many years back but knew nothing of the windows environment. I looked at many of the books related to Visual dBase 5.5. They delved into creating tables, etc. that I already knew. This book got right down to basics. I loved it. I had spent months digging through other dBase books and found less than I did in this books first week's lessons. Now I'd like an encore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginner Trap","review":"How any of the other reviewers can say this book is any good is beyond me. I can only assume they are beginners who lack any experience at all using visual dbase. Visual dbase uses OOP. A point completely lost on the author of this book and I assume the other reviewers. It is the one of the worst books I've seen on visual dbase. No I'll revise that: It is the worst book I've seen on visual dbase."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless book on vdbase","review":"This book keeps telling the reader to use command line entry. To set up a form takes 3-4 pages when OOP does it in about 2 seconds. There is no real information in this book. You could learn more abour dbase from a book on cookery. It is useless. An expensive waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egghead.","review":"I had heard this album was the beginning of the end more than once, but I saw it cheap and picked it up. I might want my three dollars back. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, and some tracks I may even like, but overall it just doesn't pack a punch. Even the remix of \\"Family Man\\" is just ok, and the cover art is also ugly. I hate to hate, but stick with the far superior \\"That Total Age\\" album, or anything pre-\\"Ebbhead\\". This is just industrial-lite."},{"rating":"1","title":"NE starts to lose it","review":"I was so excited to get this CD when it first came out and I was so disappointed. Nitzer Ebb has never been a deep & thoughtful band (guns, guns, guns) however you could always count on Nitzer ebb to do great on the dance floor. \\"I give to you\\" and \\"Family Man\\" were the only two decent songs on the whole disc and they are not that great. If you want to check out some great Nitzer Ebb I recommend you check out \\"Belief\\" and \\"That Total Age\\".As a DJ this CD is worthless, I have never once had one song off this disc requested, nor would I play anything off it on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Gem","review":"This is an excellent collection of tunes from the \\"Otis Redding of Jamaica.\\" We are so lucky that this soulful singer was born in Jamaica and has pure reggae sensibility. I believe that this music can never be made again. It is a collection of early rocksteady tunes which are interesting, but do not add anything spectacular to the genre. Where Ken Boothe shines is in the cover versions of soul music. The difference is that he takes songs that are excellent in their own right (\\"Everything I Own,\\" \\"Love Don't Love Nobody,\\" \\"That's the Way Nature Planned It\\") and lays them down in smooth reggae style. He is not derivative and trying hard to twist the song to fit into his style. He is simply interpreting the songs in his own way, straight from the heart. And the production is excellent, from instrumentation to perfectly mixed harmonizing backing vocals.Any fan of soul music or 70's reggae needs to hear this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have had the same issues with the unit freezing up, and this time it will not unfreeze.

I brought it in for repair under warranty to an authorized serivce center. The shop kept it for 2 months, returned it to me in worse condition than before.

Everytime it freezes, I have to unplug and reset the unit. It happens at least 3 times a week. I was deciding between this and the Bose 3.2.1 system before my purchase. I pick this due to the cheaper price and 1080p upconversion for DVD thru HDMI. However, I regret my decision every time I have to get up from my sofa to unplug the unit due to the freezing issue.

This fits on the back of the toilet perfectly. It's great for getting rid of the humidity and moisture on the mirrors and windows after showers. It's also perfect for those of us who have an occasional hot flash! Just one thing: circulating is not the same as oscillating. Some might misinterpret the title (as I did). As far as I know, all fans circulate air. If you want an oscillating fan, this isn't what you're looking for.

One negligable drawback is that it takes two hands to turn it on and off; the unit could use a push-button switch. Over all a very good deal for the comfort it provides.

But don't be fooled: Elvis never recorded that song -- yes, there IS a song called that, and it's not here. I wouldn't even tape a lump of coal to this to give someone I despise. Even people we don't like deserve a decent CD of Elvis at Christmas.Sure, this is a CD re-issue of the 1970 reissue of the 1957 Elvis Christmas classic. The 1970 re-issue had a different cover (what was wrong with the old one?), different from the other Pickwick and RCA Special Edition LP covers, and this is an even more different one. Just because it comes in a tin box isn't a good reason to buy this. As usual, RCA is master of the crass posthumus re-packaging/re-issue, feeding off Elvis' dead flesh. Capitol is a close second, committing the same sacrilege with the Beach Boys' awesome catalogue.The bottom line is, skip this and get the \\"If Every Day Was Like Christmas\\" compilation instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undergradutes and Beginners: Avoid At All Cost","review":"This book a great review of linear algebra once you've understood all the concepts and just want to briefly see the theorems, props, and corollaries. There are minimal examples, hardly any computation (since the author is so lazy and tells the reader to prove the examples for him/herself), and very brief readings on each chapter. I HATE this book, to say the least. I have to look for other books to learn linear algebra from, as this is my first time taking an upper div. course in linear algebra at Cal. Graduate students love this book since they've had prior exposure to the material. As for me, this is definitely not a good place to start if you're beginning to learn linear algebra; no surprise in the few number of pages in this book. How do you really expect to learn from a book with completely vague questions and no solutions? This student is very frustrated and disgruntled by Axler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done Right != Taught Right","review":"One might guess a title claiming \\"Linear Algebra Done Right\\" would have aimed for maximum clarity, insight, and applicability, and for minimum gratuitous proof, abstract language, or wasted verbiage. Well,... About the M-th time the book proves that some new operator applied to nothing still yields nothing, and the K-th time it makes an unmotived leap that vectors and polynomials are alike, you give up hope. A lot of people gave this book 4 or 5 stars, suggesting an approachable, inspiring read. Didn't realize the 'in' joke was the rating was a linear transform: y = 6 - x."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality printing","review":"I have nothing to say about the content of the book itself; it seems to be an excellent book. However, one major problem (that Amazon apparently tries to hide) is that the softcover edition is a print-on-demand book. This wouldn't really be a problem, if the printing quality was anywhere close to that of a normal book. Unfortunately, it isn't. The entire book looks like it was run through a cheap fax machine. There is noticeable fuzziness and pixelation; it is highly annoying, looks terrible, and makes the book hard to read. I cannot believe Springer would produce something of such low quality. I plan to return this book and get a used hardcover copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"The author would be much more effective if he spent less time pontificating and patting himself on the back for not using determinants and more time giving decent arguments. Interestingly enough, even though the book champions the credo \\"no determinants are necessary\\" (a ludicrous idea to start with), he DOES grudgingly include a section on determinants and traces at the end of the book because by his own admission, they come in handy. The audacity of the title is a trend reflected throughout the book, punctuated by his neurotic insistance that this is the way things ought to be. It's a very odd book and frankly, not that instructive. I found it more difficult than you would expect at first glance since he gives the impression of an easy read. It develops most of the useful material you'd expect in a junior level course but not a lot of insight. It's probably harder than it need to be and the sections on Jordan form are truly aggravating. The book was a bummer, a total bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hype is Not Justified - The Title Pompous","review":"There are a lot better linear algebra books out there - Larson, Poole, etc. Whomever is raving about this is not a student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few things more useless than a math book without answers","review":"I purchased this book with the intent on brushing up and improving my linear algebra which has become a little rusty over the past ten years.

Well, I guess I was wrong. This book is extremely vague and tricky. Wait... That will help you learn?? NOT TRUE! What I understood about eigenvalues/vectors/spaces is complete garbage (according to Axler). Why should I be interested in determinate free proofs? Frankly, I don't know!!! Apparently the author is too lazy to dole out the work it requires to teach his class about determinants. How has this become my problem? Ask my professor for this semester. I see no point in re-hashing all of the perfectly good material I learned in the other 2 courses I have had.

It does what it says it would do, in fact it went beyond my expectations for the price. I highly recommend this headset. I am currently using it with my Blackberry 8700g and just the fact that I have no more greasy screens was enough for me. With the use of caller name ringtones I no longer have to look at my phone when answering a call while driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy outside a totally quiet area","review":"This earpiece does not live up to its expectations. As another reviewer has stated you have to hold it to your ear to hear. If you are in a totally quiet area it is fine. But once you get in your car, or are outside you cannot hear the person talking.Also, it does have a feedback loop where the person you are talking to can hear themself speak.Suggest looking for something else, not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"There is a definite trade-off between your own volume and the echo heard on the other side of the call. There are about 6 volume settings. Four out of those six settings causes an annoying echo for whoever you are speaking with. If you turn the volume lower to get rid of the echo, then you can barely hear the conversation on your end. I'd have to say I'm disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked fine for me","review":"I also bought this with a 7130e, and it worked fine for me.

Other than that, it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"I bought four, tried two out, and neither work with my VX8300 (bluetooth enabled)although they are supposed to. In fact, on a normal day I can pick up 4 other wireless headsets from the train passengers around me but no matter how hard I try to smash this crappy thing into the side of the phone, my phone can't pick it up.The manual says hold down the button and a solid blue light will come on, notifying you of 'discovery mode' Well then. All of mine seem to blink like idiots and do none of the above.

I have to press it into my ear and cup my other hand around the mic. It would be okay for a sedentary employee working alone in a quiet office. Another problem is that if I turn my head at all while working or driving, it feels like it's going to fall off, which it has on many occasions. I like the other reviewer's comment about the distracting blue strobe reflection while driving at night (I've felt your pain, brother). It's the perfect re-gift for someone who has never used a Bluetooth;-) Today I'm buying the Plantronics Voyager 510, which has better reviews. Stay tuned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Terrible for the Cost","review":"I tried this headset with the package from my phone. Well the reception was awful. The person on the other end heard themself echo no matter how low the earpiece volume was and it sounded to them that I was talking through a glass of water in a stainless steel bathroom. This type of headset needs vast improvement, and to me it shouldn't cost so much and suck so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not User Friendly","review":"I bought this headset when I got my Blackberry 7130e in January. The problem with this headset is that everything happens through the multifunction button - almost everytime I tried to pair this device with my phone it would call the last person I called...I was repeatedly calling people I didn't want to or hanging up on them. The unit also was not reliable and sometimes would just not pair with the phone and had to be reinstalled a number of times. Finally I got tired of it and bought a Motoroal HS850 which I love. I highly recommend the Motorola over the Jabra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jabra BT350 a Disappointment.","review":"This headset seemed great at first. Now, people can't hear me when I use it. They say I'm breaking up. Adjusting the volume doesn't help. Finally, when I disconnect the BT350, my call becomes crystal clear. Also, this headset always turns itself on when it's in my purse and then dials people. That is a problem of draining the battery and of nusance calls. Unfortunately, I've had just past the 1 year warranty period so I'll probably have to buy a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Bluetooth>>>if it worked","review":"This bluetooth is the best I have ever owned, but Jabra bluetooths are notorious for having internal battery failures and they are not fixable.

One that came in, did actually appear to be new, but did not function. The other definitely was not new, and also did not function. The seller initially told me they were going to send me an RMA while they found two new Jabra BT350's to replace the two that don't work. I was thrilled with that because I really wanted the BT350's as they are no longer being produced. Unfortunately, the RMA NEVER came. People at APEX seemed very nice, but I think maybe they are scammers. Otherwise, why not send the RMA, refund my account for the $100 and then inform me if and when they found the other BT350's.

Very disappointing experience; with, I think, dishonest sellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent low cost product","review":"I've owned this product going on 3 years and it still works like I just bought it.

I've gone through 3 phones with this thing (Motorola SLVR L9, Nokia E72, iPhone 3GS), all of the phones successfully connected to the headset and worked without problems. If your looking for a reliable blue tooth headset for a good price then this thing is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked - waste of money","review":"The product never worked, so I cannot rate it for quality. I could not get it to connect with any of several phones. Even turning it on and off was a problem. At first, I thought I was doing something wrong, but how can one mess up pushing the on button. I found from trial-and-error that the on-off button worked about 1/3 of the time. That problem has an easy solution - if the unit does not turn on or off on the first attempt - try again until it does. Based on my experience with one unit, I judge this device to be an inferior product and a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Affordable Quality FIlter","review":"We've been using this filter in our Mr. Coffee ECM21 combination espresso n' coffee machine and have had no problems whatsoever in all this time.

It was a fast read, and I am interested in anything that has to do with King Arthur. This story focuses mostly around the boy Galwyn and his love for horses. He eventually is able to help King Arthur, or Artos, with his knowledge of both horses and languages. I think all young adults will enjoy this story, and it is good for adults looking for a quick read. If you like horses, or stories related to King Arthur, check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Awesome McCaffrey Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. So much I have read it twice. It is great for the horse lover because it tells about where farriring may have begun. I really like the characters and it gave me another point of view of King Arthur!

A great book for kids from about 12 to adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this is a great book!","review":"This book is about King Arthur needing horses strong enough to fit his knights.

I am also a great fan of Arthurian stories (my favorites being T.H. White \\"The Once and Future King\\" and Mary Stewart's \\"Crystal Cave\\" and \\"Hollow Hills\\") so I eagerly picked up this book. I found the characters flat and the story was not compelling (and horses play a big part in my life). Since \\"Nerilka's Story\\" was my least favorite Pern novel, I wonder whether McCaffrey has a harder time with 1st person singular narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Horse Lover","review":"This book would make an excellent gift for a horseman (or woman) that you know. It is an incredible historical fiction about the development of farriership (blacksmithing) in the world. The characters and plot are well thought out and balance the technical aspect of the book. Even a person with no knowledge of horses would find this to be an interesting novel. The hero is both relatable and human; he makes mistakes but learns from his experiences working with the horses. Arthur, the future King Arthur and a supporting character in this book, has never been characterized in such a realistic way; the character seems to come alive in the pages of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the best book I have ever read.

I had so much history in it and also a lot of parts that wanted you to know what happened next. I never put the book down until I finished it.

This has a rzor-sharp production and dynamic to it, with searing thrash guitars, and while the songs tend to be a bit similar to one another, and nothing stands out, the album as a whole sizzles. I can agree with the critical review that it doesn't really do anything new within a saturated genre--true--BUT, at a gut level, this is effective, and there aren't THAT many bands doing this slightly deathish thrash thing (compared to the glut of straight on death metal, or even classic thrash). Nothing monumental, but it kicks. BTW, it has religion-friendly lyrics as well, if anyone cares (not a Christian band per se, but those looking for that kind of thing would not mind this lyrically)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upsetting debut","review":"\\"Discerning Forces\\" is not necessarily a debut album, as the group has releases under their original name Incubus, but I list it as such because this is the first album under the moniker Opprobrium. The songs within are fairly average to sub-par mid-paced death/thrash with less layering than usual. The end result is a fairly one-deminsional album with lots of potential but no spark. Perhaps the greatest fault lies within a fairly flat production, though a definite fault lies within their inability to utilize any atypical styles or approaches to the already saturated genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but disappointing","review":"On balance, I'm unhappy with this product.I used it solely for bedtime reading with my wife asleep next to me.Pros:* Much dimmer light than incandescent, easier on the partner* bulb never needs replacingCons:* Batteries could never get inserted quite right. This meant the light could rarely be turned on without first jostling the batteries.* Drains batteries pretty quickly, even when not used. Better get rechargeables.* Dimmer light than incandescent, harder on you!* Needs a hardback book to really work. It's too heavy for paperbacks.* Particularly for bigger books, the light head doesn't fold enough to cover all parts of the page. So you will likely be reading parts of the page in dim light, and parts in bright.As I said, on balance, this product needs work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zelco Fluorescent Booklight","review":"I have bought 2 Zelco Fluorescent booklights and had bothfail after several months usage. The product is unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good light, problems turning on","review":"This light is very good once it goes on. I've used a few book lights so have a basis for comparison:Pros:- Brighter than most, fine for reading in dark space- Well directed light, so won't wake someone else in bedCon (and its a big one):- It doesn't turn on consistently. Once its on, it stays on and is great. But fluorescent bulb technology has a high start-up power need, then it runs on low power very well -- creates low heat too, very efficient. They just spec'd the thing wrong in its battery power. So it irritatingly won't turn on. Sometimes I just leave the switch on and a few minutes later it comes on. Other time jiggling. Has nothing to do with fresh batteries.Note that the most positive review comes from someone who also recommended the AC adapter, which I suppose overcomes the problem.Overall, take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Have tried to puchase both the fluorescent and the incandescent light and they both fail after about 8 weeks. The fluorescent's batteries get sucked up in a matter of days when they should last for a month. The light NEVER turns on the first time you always have to shake the casing to re-align the Batt's. The reason for the light in the first place is to not disturb your parter whilst they sleep. The incandescent one was even worse with all of the above mentioned problems with an electrical danger as well. The transformer in the wall adapter actually melted and it was plugged into a properly working Kingston surge protector. The light will not even turn on as the contacts wore out in just 7 weeks. Seriously, go with a normal flashlight and save yourself the money. These unweildy, unreliable, overpriced dangers should not be allowed to be sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"True, this light is nice and bright....once you actually get it to turn on! Sometimes it will only take 2 minutes; other times a full half hour before it lights up. I can't tell you how many times I've started to throw it in the trash. Don't waste your money on this one. Buy a cheap book light, even if you have to replace it more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes forever to turn on","review":"The people who commented about how long this light takes to turn on are absolutely right. It got so bad that I started timing it. It takes a minimum of two minutes to turn on and I have timed it at as long as six minutes. So when you just want a cosy read before bed, FIRST turn on the light, then go brush your teeth. By the time you get back, it might even be on.In all fairness, the light, when it finally does go on, is a nice bright white. I generally always use book lights with their AC adaptors, because I use them too much to bother with batteries. But you have to buy the AC adaptor separately.Even though the light is lovely, nothing this expensive should work so badly. But then, in my life, the search for the perfect book light is right up there with the search for the perfect hair dryer.

This book is written with much sensitivity and consideration. The author has taken an exhaustive approach in combining both the personal life and career of Ramon Novarro. This book is totally engrossing, from beginning to end. The author describes in detail how Mr. Novarro fled his native country of Mexico during the Huerta revolution in 1915 to journey to Los Angeles, and of his meteoric rise to stardom in the American silent film. Much attention is focused on his great years in MGM, the greatest of all movie studios. Mr. Novarro was plagued with many personal problems and unfortunately his life had a tragic ending.

I have a feeling that this book would not give much information on Newton, undisputably the greatest scientist and mathematician of all time!! ( Don't compare him with Einstein, the later can only be described as a great theoretical physicist !) Considering Newton's achievement and his complicated life, a book ten times the content of this one even may not be enough!After reading the whole book, I was even more disappointed!! As the description of Newton's life is even less than any book on History of Mathematics!! Coupled with the expensiveness of this book.

I really didn't like this book, though. It is a true postmodern novel focusing solely on characters to the exclusion of any plot. In other words, almost nothing happens in the book. There is no real beginning or ending to it. The characters don't change much, there is no interesting conflict, and they will have virtually no effect on the environment.Some readers seem to mistake this for shoddy writing, but in fact it is almost certainly intentional. Hand is breaking all the rules that crappy writing texts give you. Unfortunately, that doesn't make it readable. If you are an English graduate student interested in style you might like this book. Otherwise, there is plenty of other stuff out there (including more enjoyable Elizabeth Hand work) that you can read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I read this book around 2 years ago - having been a fan of previous books.

One doesn't know where they are going to go either. Comparing a book with music! What the hell! They are different but connected arts.

I should have given up after 100 pages or so and gone on to a novel where something happens. Bad enough to have a book without a single character I can care about, but then to have them go long stretches without any action - that's unbearable. The one character who might have been the hero, the Christian rock star, soon starts acting as if he's mentally retarded. Doesn't much matter, since the author gives away his small part of the \\"plot\\" early on in the book. About the only parts of the book that aren't boring are the revoltingly graphic, mostly homosexual, sex scenes. I suppose there must be an audience for this modern plot-free writing - judging from the critical praise. But I think most people would rather have an old-fashioned book with characters you can root for, and where something actually happens once in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quit after a few dozen pages","review":"I enjoy books about the end of the world. I always have. When I stumbled across Hand's book I was pleased. Her book was one I had not yet read...and I won't be finishing it. I have only read several dozen pages so I freely admit my view of the book is limited. The characters are all unlikeable. Things that should have been explained never were. Christians are routinely called \\"Xians\\". What? Apparently hip Christians are called Xians. O...kay. I finally tossed in the towel when a character - the only interesting one by the way - starts having sex with a Xian rock star in a planetarium. Yeah, sure. That was annoying enough, but previously she had been described as being perhaps 14 years old. Yep, that was it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down even if you haven't read her other books","review":"This book started out pretty good. It had a cool framing tale, even believable, and the characters seem to be pretty well-developed, if not very deep.But let's face it: it didn't relate to a large group of people. I'm a guy, and I relate to guy books. No, it doesn't have to be all about explosions and wars (but that helps). I just like the book to mean something to me, and I guess I don't relate to Elizabeth Hand. I don't relate to the characters, and therefore I thought this book wasn't worth my time.But maybe you'd like to pick it up and try it, I don't know. I don't recommend it. I didn't feel that sense of awe...you know, when you finish something that was really great and you have to reflect on it...that was missing. And I didn't really find it entertaining, either. I just didn't like it.

Glimmering, however, took me two weeks due to my general impatience with the book and its plot (or lack thereof). There were a few character I had taken a liking to, but unfortunately, they fell prey to uncharacteristic behavior, the wallflower syndrome, of generally being too tortured to actually DO anything. Hand's prose, flowing and elegant, is still top notch, though her work here has many faults."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been better","review":"I'm a fan of Hand's writing, and when I found this book I was terribly excited. The plot looked great, and the reviews were good. But it was really a let-down. The characters were of the type that could have been very intriguing, but not enough was revealed about them to make them so. Otherwise it was interesting, but it seemed like it had been written aiming at the cheap-thrills mainstream rather than as a true literary effort like \\"Waking the Moon\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Based on the praise in the media for this novel, I was practically salivating when I finally sat down to being the novel. I was particularly interested in how Hand saw trends in the environment, in sociology and in art playing themselves out. While she met my expectations in this area, offering the reader a well developed view of the future, there was no real story for these ideas to be set in. Every time I found myself settling into a story line, I was ripped away and transplanted somewhere else. There was no clear beginning, middle or end and while I usually buy into the idea that the writer uses tchniques like that to ilicit an emotion from the reader, I think that in this case, it was a result of poor planning or writing. In general, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by - or for - the MTV Generation","review":"Eliabeth Hand has a way with words, but she's terrible with sustaining a narrative. Plot threads are introduced, only to unravel later as she gets distracted and pursues another tangent. Her characters are all outward-flung, fascinated by stimuli they can't process for lack of mental or spiritual resources. In the hands of someone who knows something about character development, plot structure, and compelling narrative, this would be a hard-hitting and eerily prescient novel. Ms. Hands has given us instead a series of vignettes, interrupted shortly before denoument."},{"rating":"2","title":"A roller coaster ride from today to the end!!","review":"As a librarian, I have thousands of books at my fingertips everyday, but I chose to read Hand's novel. First of all, the millenium will be a hot topic for some time to come and hopefully even after that! I felt like I was in the room with her characters, peeping in on the taping of a movie or something. Her words are so vivid with color and reality. I liked how she hopped from reality to fantasy or was it the other way around? What is reality anyway? I would say it's how you see things. Hand has done a great job showing us how she sees things! Can't wait to read her next book.I would also like to comment on the cover. As a librarian, I've seen people drawn to the book by it's cover only. As for Hand's cover, I give 5 stars to Hasselberger for the design and either Eguchi or Mydlowski for the actual photograph. I would love to know where this gargoyle exists if at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its just the end of the world....get a grip","review":"I found the scenario at first fascinating then started to get a little tired of everyone kinda losing it all the time.

Its not that bad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing view of sexuality","review":"You may be entranced by the author's language. You may be fascinated by her view of the \\"future\\" (1999). You may enjoy her characters. But if you're like me at all, you'll also be deeply depressed about her portrayal of human sexuality. Whether describing gay or straight \\"lovemaking\\" in every case there is sadness, guilt and discomfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science","review":"I know it's fiction, but it is supposed to be SCIENCE fiction.

The Panasonic unit seemed to be the answer. My wife and I could enjoy DVDs, while our son could still enjoy all of his old tapes.Unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to expectations. The DVD player broke while under warranty and was repaired by Panasonic. Although it took longer than I would have liked, they took care of it without any problems. Then the VCR simply stopped working, and now the DVD player is starting to have problems again, and it is only 1 1/2 years old.At this point I don't know whether we'll get it repaired or simply junk it, but I'm not at all happy with the reliability. Unfortunately, none of the other combo units I've researched seem to do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - No Auto Tracking for VCR Player","review":"Very disappointed with the VCR portion of the PV-D4762. The VCR player does not have autotracking and even new tapes played have lines across the screen. I've tried manual tracking and still I am not impressed by the quality of the VCR playback. The DVD portion of the player works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call it unreliable","review":"I putchased a PV-D4762 DVD/VCR deck in June/03. Initially I found the instruction booklet very irritating and difficult to sort out - the layout is very poor, and not well organised at all. The remote is rather unwieldy with alot of buttons - more than necessary. However, it performed the tasks at hand, and as a pioneer in the field of combos it seemed satisfactory. Last week, after owning the machine for 7 months, the DVD player starts giving the message \\"Please check the Disc, and for stains or scratches on Disc\\", when it refuses to play. This message made no sense as the disc was brand new. Despite using a \\"disc cleaner\\", the problem didnot go away, so the machine is now being looked at with an \\"authorised dealer\\". I expected better performance from a machine I paid $279.99 for - certainly more than the limited amount of service I have experienced. Therefore, I cannot recommend this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought this in March 2003. In Sept the DVD quit working. I called Panasonic about it and they wanted me to drive 60 miles to the closest authorized repair facility. Found out the DVD card was broken on it. They would not cover the parts even though it was still under parts warranty. The part was over $200 and that is what I paid for the machine. Panasonic sure is a bunch of junk if things are breaking within six months. I used to buy a lot of Panasonic electronics, but never again.DO NOT BUY this. You will just have all kinds of problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORKED WELL FOR 10 MONTHS","review":"I paid $300 this model last year. Within 10 months it stopped working properly. The DVD would play some discs but not others and gave me an error message that made no sense \\"Check disk to see if dirty.\\" Some of the disks that got this message were right out of the manufacturer's box!! Some disks worked fine, so I thought it must be reacting to an anti-copying coding, or something. Then a few months later, the VCR started to chew up my tapes. I decided to throw the whole unit out. I would not recommend this model. I do not know what is going wrong with Panasonic. Quality control has gone downhill, judging by this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Too Clever by Half","review":"This device is infuriating. I want to be able to change channels while continuing to record (whatever new channel I change to). It is impossible to do in any practical way. It forces you to quit recording if you want to change channels, overly protecting you from yourself. At the same time, if you run out of tape while recording, it disables numerous functions on the VCR and never gives you any clue as to why. You can't even then display the tape position or counter. You will think your equipment is broken. Finally, it integrates very poorly with the same manufacturer's TV. I would love to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"LA MUERTE DEL OYENTE","review":"El tema \\" Como te voy a olvidar \\" fue galardonado como el mejor representante de la pobreza de inspiracion , los mismos compases de repiten indifinidamente haciendo caer al oyente en un sopor indescriptible .

It doesn't depress and doesn't work! The unit came on as soon as I plugged it in. Trying hitting the ON button to shut it off and it still doesn't work. Better have that cup under the unit before plugging it in. Second, I know that it is a compact unit, but it is SLOW. I can only imagine how it pumps once it is also going through coffee grounds.

Now the first cup is a bit slow (the 2nd was as fast as I'm used to from in room coffee makers). Clean up isn't super easy in a hotel room (dump the grounds in the trash, not the sink) but overall, this little guy makes a very tasty cup of coffee. I may need to experiment with how fine I grind the coffee; I'm usually a whole bean guy. The unit is easy to use and packs up nicely. The included cup seems too small but it's not.

Their rates are much higher than other insurance companies. If you try to modify your insurance they will find any reason to screw you. For example, I reported a hit and run but canceled the claim since it only resulted in a dent to my car and the accident happened while my car was parked. However, because I reported that, the insurance company I used for 18 years decided it was a reason to raise my rates when I tried to change my policy, even though I received no money from Allstate.If I had read this book earlier I would have never bothered with the claim and would have just found a better agent and a better insurance company.

His envoi to the past decade ('weren't the 90s great?' he asks) teeters on the verge not just of self parody but of self importance. Tracks like The Rubettes and Some Changes make it very hard to know whether his nostalgia is felt, or just another swipe at his more successful coevals.

I really don't think the inventors ever tried using the product before pawning it off on the public! It looked promising for about the first 5 minutes of use. After that the design flaws made any further use a joke. When it was initially loaded with ice and 5 cans of drinks it floated relatively well. Then we opened it for the first time to discover that if you don't hold the bottom when you open it the lid forces the hinge down into the water allowing lake or pool water into the bottom. Once water enters or the ice melts and the weight of the contents shifts the Bobber no longer floats level. After 15 minutes on it's trial run it was floating sideways making not only look ridiculous but totally impractical to use.

Well made. One caveat is that it doesn't hold much more than a six-pack, and if you try to over-fill it, it becomes top-heavy and doesn't float right. It takes two hands to open it, or one hand at a time to slide back left and right latches, so it doesn't have the 'cool factor' of a one handed latch.

Remember Jeff Lynne was always a driving force behind ELO title. Or, at least, since mid 70s. Does it matter much how many people actually play if result sounds exactly like ELO? I feel this recording differs from Jeff's solo album recorded in 1990 and inherits all the best from latter recordings of ELO. I believe Jeff intentionally made it sound like ELO record. And the name is an integral part of a concept, which is a successful one, in my opinion. It sounds like a follow-up to the previous ELO records.Well done, Mr. Lynne!

Not that ELO was anything more than Jeff Lynne, you are lead to belive that some of the original members of the band will appear which they don't. With that said, I think this release is a solid, good listen, pop cd. The first track that jumped out at me was \\"State of Mind\\". A very cool riff starts this tune out that reminded me of something that Badfinger might have done. This album will definitely grow on you with each listen.

There may not be as much string treatment but the sound still sounds like an \\"orchestra\\" with the intertwining instruments and the background harmonies flowing along with it. The lyrics have a real world quality to them as opposed to the surreal dreaminess of ELO in the past. I attribute this to collaborations Lynne has had with the Travelling Wilbury's, Randy Newman, and the plethora of other musicians. If you're an ELO/Jeff Lynne fan, by all means, buy this CD.

I listened this disc five times, waiting to discover some 'magic' in it, but at the end I was frustrated. This record is boring and the songs very predictable from beginning to end; 'Moment in paradise',maybe, the only exception.This record was really a Electric Light record (no orchestra). I hope the next one go back to the basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELO is back","review":"Not as good as \\"Secret Messages\\" but far superior to \\"Balance of Power\\" Jeff Lynn recreates the magic with this well crafted ELO album. Some songs on this album are prototypical ELO, others sound similar to Jeff Lynn's solo effort \\"Arm Chair Theatre.\\" They're all fun and easy to listen to.

The music reminds me of the ELO I used to listen to on vinyl before the advent of CD and such. I disagree with the people that liken this to 'Armchair Theater' (which I bought hoping for ELO like music and was left wanting) and don't even get me started on the 'TW'. Mr. Lyne is (now) a much older and experienced writer/musician/singer, so yes some influences have come through. But in the most basic terms this is an ELO record, a much older ELO yes but still ELO. Buy it you'll like, I know I am"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not actually ELO - a rip off!","review":"As an ELO fan I feel ripped off. This album is missing all the real ELO band members other than Jeff Lynne. It is a SOLO ALBUM like Jeff Lynne's previous SOLO ALBUM Armchair Theatre. Had it been released honestly as a Jeff Lynne solo album, I would have given it maybe 3 stars. Trying to pass this off as an ELO album is a pretty dirty trick on behalf of the record company. As a solo album, it is OK, but Armchair Theatre is a lot better, and it certainly pales in comparison to all of the original ELO albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME!!!!!!!!!","review":"A great comeback after 15years!!!

I find this unacceptable since this is supposed to be a \\"safety seat\\" vest. What if we were in a car accident with much greater impact? The previous one I bought had lasted several years, which is why I ordered another one, but it seems like the quality of this harness has gone down in recent years.

Which is what the characters did, and what the author felt the need to portray in excrutiating detail. I'm sorry, but there's nothing about working on a riverboat, even as a \\"cub\\" to the captain, that is the slightest bit interesting, especially in what's supposed to be a romance novel! I have no idea why the author felt this aspect of the story would be compelling.I agree with other reviewers that, although this is erotica and therefore expected to be fantasy based, the heroine's lax sexual mores were completely unbelievable for the times. The sex scenes were repetitive and uninventive. The hero was emotionally uncompelling.In short, this book was a definite letdown after Irish Devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"This was awful. Yes, like everyone mentioned there are a lot of \\"hot\\" sex scenes, but that's it and even that seemed pointless. These characters had absolutely no personality.

I may as well go buy a copy of Hustler if I want to read erotic stories with THAT kind of language.I got this in a group of trade books and this will be my last time to read anything by this author.

This book clearly explains the way Mr. Buffett conducts business and how is it so different from the conventional wisdom, yet so sensible and logical that the investing records of Buffett have been exceptional. I totally recommend this book as the author did a really good job in describling Mr. Buffett's history in investing, as well as his private life.

The Buffett-way of investing is not merely presented as a series of successful buy/hold/sell actions but is rather linked to his extraordinary personality and syllogistic, thus providing not only a very good methodology on stock market investments but also a character-shaping manual.

I know some people who read just these technical books but unfortunately, fail to produce satisfactory return on their investments. Remember, there are many ways to MAKE 'and' LOSE money on Wall St.Even if you don't turn to investing after reading this book, don't worry, there's plenty to learn from Buffett especially about trust, being patient, and rational when it comes to handling money.To those who aspire to become a superinvestor, my suggestion would be to get Mary Buffett's Buffettology after reading this book. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffet","review":"Although i haven't read the whole book yet, it came quickly, and was in excellent shape when i received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"more romance than investment lessons","review":"If you are looking for a romantic story about Warren Buffet's life, this is the right book for you.

From early childhood, Warren learned the value of a dollar by working hard at numerous jobs. He was never a spendthrift, but instead saved as much as possible so that he could invest it long-term. His determination and focus made him what he is today.Warren Buffett's investment philosophy is just so simple. Just buy excellent companies at reasonable prices and hold them long-term.

As with 'When Genius Failed', Lowenstein writes an engaging portrayal of his subject, who built a great fortune by watching carefully. Here, it's obvious that he respects and appreciates Warren Buffett, but he also does not whitewash the man, for example, revealing and discussing the frustrations those close to him have felt.Buffett is a storyteller, and so is Lowenstein.

I read it before the \\"Snowball\\" book came out. It appears that the main advantage Snowball has is the input of Buffett. This is important in one aspect, the relationship with Kay Graham. Lowenstein gives arguments for both views, platonic or not, and sides with the platonic view.

Stand-out tracks are \\"I Lie in the Bed I Make\\", \\"Wishpool\\", and \\"I Look for Something More\\". While good, their are a few songs that just seem to rub me the wrong way, \\"The Crow Flies\\" and especially \\"Come Alive Again\\".

This is still one of the best rock albums around, but it just doesn't hit you with the same power the their first two records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Damon Johnson is an excellent singer and his band mates are just as good. Wishpool is an obvious showcase of their talent. I did not feel that this CD was as strong of a release as Seeds. There isn't a track that stands out like \\"And Fools Shine On\\" or \\"Got No Shame\\" from their debut release. That doesn't make this a bad CD though. The music is above and beyond most of those Rock CD's that you hear these days. My personal favorite is \\"I Lie in the Bed I make\\", but there isn't a bad cut on the whole CD. For Brother Cane fans, this is a must own. For all others...you owe it to yourself to check this CD out."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Surrender\\" to Wishpool","review":"The best rock I've heard in years! After listening repeatedly to this CD, I quickly got hold of \\"Seeds\\" and their debut. All 3 are great. But let's get back to Wishpool. The CD opens with the title track, a grab-you-by-the-throat rocker, and ends with \\"Human After All\\" , a killer rock ballad. The CD is filled with great songs. Machete, The Crow Flies, and Come Alive Again show Brother Cane's power. The best song, for me, is \\"I Surrender\\", great vocals, great guitar work. You may hear some influence: Aerosmith comes to mind on occasion, which is actually quite fitting, since this album \\"Rocks\\". I owe a debt of gratitiude to a friend who answered my \\"who's Brother Cane\\" remark by lending me \\"Wishpool\\". I heard the band may be on some sort of hiatus. As rock and rock fans, let's hope not. Great CD !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Yourself A Favor And Get This","review":"Damon Johnson where have you gone? If only more people were asking this question then maybe Bro' Cane, as they are known by their fans, wouldn't have faded away so easily. It's shame they did because this album rocks in a timeless sort of way that would sound fresh in any era, regarless of what's popular at the moment. Johnson and producer Kelly Gray polish up 12 arena rock gems that run the gamut; from recollections of hard times, \\"I Lie In The Bed I Make,\\" to the bluesy intro of \\"Where Was I To Know.\\" Even the most commercial song on here, an almost Aerosmith-like ballad \\"The Truth\\" refuses to sound as hokey or forced as that band's latter work. This revealing honesty is partly becuase of Johnson's deep vocals and is also due to the fact he underwent a divorce during the making the record. On the album's closer \\"Human After All,\\" when he sings \\"blue sky ends...rain it clouds my life again,\\" it's not a cliche. He feels it and beleives every word - and so will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Fernande","review":"Don't buy it, it only contains 31 photos and they are not good quality due to the type of printing.It contains a screen play that is not interesting which takes up too much of the book.I have over 200 photos of her that are better quality which I obtained from the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Surprise!","review":"I've been a fan of Fernande for many years and have several of her postcards in my collection. Like the author, I purchased my first Fernande postcard in a curio shop. I was surprised to stumble upon this book since there is virtually nothing written on Fernande and her photographer, JA. The book turned out to be a delightful surprise. I enjoyed seeing these historic characters interacting with each other, including Mr. Ferrucio. I don't have Ferrucio's book, Venus Unveiled, but like most Fernande fans, I know the interesting tale it relates. I was happy to see this included as a frame for Fernande's story. The book includes enlarged shots of many Fernande postcards. This is a wonderful value since the actual postcards are very pricey. I wish the printing was a bit better but it may be just my copy. In any event, it was well worth the money. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Empowerment","review":"Glenn's books are an awsome way for a manager to improve his skills.

I bought this book expecting useful information on travel between the three Baltic Republics but found virtually nothing of value. The book does devote a half page to Trans-Siberian train travel with mention of side trips to Lake Baykal and Mongolia. Figure that one out. Most of the \\"Getting There and Away\\" has to do with getting to the individual Republics from Europe and other parts of the world and even a lot of this is out dated. It seems that much of the book is cut and paste and lacks continuity between the various pieces. This book is need of a complete overhaul. Sorry to say, it's better than nothing, but not by a significant margin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as is all of LP in Eastern Europe","review":"As with all of Lonely Planet in Eastern Europe, this book is excellent.

It is the perfect balance or price, size,picture, and life span (of course, anticipating a lamp change). When I purchased it in June of 2006, the price was still $1499 at most places. A couple of points:1. Great picture IF you use HD cables. I've gotten great performance out of three video game systems (PS2, Wii, 360) and an upconverting dvd player.2. Buy an upconverting DVD player. It is so worth it. And use an HDMI cable with it.3. The picture might take a little adjusting, but once you get it right, I think it offers more cinematic visuals than anything I've seen.4. The sound quality is surprisingly good.5. I haven't had any problems with the tv (although, I must say that mine is not hooked up to any tv signal and I only use it an average of 2 hours a day for movies and games). My understanding is that a lamp change is likely, but that overall, DLP has a longer life than any other HD format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good TV... at first...","review":"I purchased this particular TV in March of 2007. It had a great picture - especially with HD channels. I have noticed a small white spot on the display. I did a little looking around on the internet to see if anyone else had this problem. I found numerous people who have the same issue with their Samsung. Several people have posted videos of their TVs - with hundreds of white spots. Some of the people have claimed that the cause can be anything from dust to a faulty motherboard to the mirrors locking up. Apparently Samsung is aware of this problem, but has yet to issue a recall or offer to fix any of the TVs that are \\"infected.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Service after Sale","review":"I bought this TV shortly before Christmas 2006 and it failed 2 months later. It's been 6 weeks and we cannot get a straight answer from Samsung. They no longer make this TV, so they can't give us a new or refurbished one. They say the will give us a refund, but in several more weeks. No one on the phone ever knows anything and has no authority to speed up the process. We've been lied to, we've been told someone will CALL US, but no one ever does, we've been given the run around over and over again. It will probably be 3 months before anything happens (from the time we first called them). I don't know if I just got a bad unit or what, but regardless, their service is lousy and I suspect this design is a bad one that gives them lots of problems. I would not buy this model again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Value for LCD-like Quality","review":"Coming off a 27\\" LCD, I researched the market incessantly.

Loudon Wainwright is the most honest songwriter I've heard. He has the depth to switch from romping fun songs as in Breakfast in Bed (about staying in bed all day making love) to the heart-on-the- sleeve ballads like OGM -- the most honest song written by a man since Jackson Browne's Rosie. Loudon Wainwright is sincere and calls it like he sees it without a hint of pretension. Little Ship is my favorite recording by which to redecorate my kitchen. It is simply an excellent output."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I've heard in a long time.","review":"The fact that Loudon Wainwright is a dead ringer for my father in law did not stop me from buying this album on a whim.

From the first song to the last I fell in love with this album and have yet to stop playing it - I bought it two weeks ago and I play it nearly every day.Because I am typically pretty critical of the music I listen to, I feel that me taking time out to write this down is an indication of how truly good this album is.

If the Narrator on this disc was at sound volume level of lets say 10 ( just picking a number for comparisons sake), then the people talking in this disc are at sound level 5. What I'm trying to say is when listening to this disc the narration is about 50% louder than when a person in this disc is telling you something about Yellowstone.

Video games also have soundtracks these days and the one by Robyn Miller for the game 'Riven' got me hooked non-stop ever since I first overheard it streaming from a colleague's cubicle at work.It provides you with a dark, epic atmosphere that never really gets loud, so it also carries a bit of an ambient (almost new age) flavor to it. Perfect not just to go with the game (I have to assume, since I am not a gamer myself), but to work, read or write. It's mellow, but it doesn't sound common or simple. It is one of those albums you wish you could get more of, so I end up playing it once and again.

When I saw this, I thought, great, a soundtrack to one of the best games I've played but when I started listning to it, I almost fell asleep. Without the game, the music was (there's no nice way to say it) boring. I slowly got to like the music a lot better but this is definately not listning music. It makes wonderful backround music but many of the tracks are very similar and this album will not keep you interested long unless your using it as backround music.

This recurring theme became as tedious as the rest of the narrative. I found myself losing track of characters and having to constantly search for earlier references to try to figure out who they were. Perhaps the rather pedantic writing of the narrator was a deliberate literary device. The book has a lot of archaic-sounding phrases and reads like it was translated from another language...all of which was probably intentional.

To my dismay, I find no Parashat-Named Headings,none; merely Chapter Headings,and Bk Chapt.#s at the top of each page. I sought refuge in the index. There is no index! I have read many reviews and comments of this work and none, not one, mentioned this glaring omission. For a layman as myself I find this book too tedius to bother with,other than when I go to another version for the missing information. It is beyond my comprehension how this highly praised book by a masterful author could be published without the norms I have mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and detailed commentary on the most valued book","review":"In this commentary the author has devoted significant effort to the faithful translation of the original Hebrew language and presented the first five books of the Bible with as much detail and presentation as I have seen. The sources are fairly comprehensive and well presented.While there are a few sections that may raise some scholarly disagreement, especially as Genesis is presented, I think the overall process was to be faithful to the historical and spiritual text, as it has been understood for centuries.A good book to have on hand, as the these are some of the most important literature ever written, and form the backbone for most of the world's belief systems.

From the beginning of my interest I have carried on delving into the background of the Scriptures both from the texts, English, Latin and Greek, and also their historical background.All the commentaries I have studied were written by Christian authors.Finding the \\"Five Books of Moses\\" by Robert Alter, a Jewish Scholar, has quite opened my eyes to aspects of the Scriptures I had never encountered before. As it is over 1,000 pages long I use it for cross references and find it very illuminating and certainly don't see myself reading it from cover to cover!

So, I decided to buy this but to my surp this filter is really bad. Poor quality, it may somewhat give you a little privacy from people next to you but they can still see it. The main issue with this privacy filter is that it really messes up the screen brightness and quality. I do not know how to describe but its like very tiny nets all over the screen. if you don't believe me buy it and find out yourself.Edit: The filter is larger than PSP-Slim screen!

The harness wiggles loose and I have to continually tighten it and readjust the snap. Fortunately she's a good dog and will stop and let me adjust it, but within two minutes, it's worked loose again and I have to again tighten it. She's a lab-boxer mix, so she has a strong chest and she just ignores the pulling under her front legs. When she saw a squirrel at the end of the walk, she maneuvered her head out of the harness, and it was only my voice command that kept her from running after it.

The sound is fantastic 5.1 Surround Sound Dolby and, on my Bose system, it's wonderful. Bette's \\"I'll Put A Spell On You\\" and \\"Sarah's Theme\\" are so much more enhanced to hear. Also, Binx's shadow is the pointer to the menu. If you move Binx to the chapters, they are displayed on tombstones. It's about time we got it on dvd even if Disney didn't enhance it with Entertainment Tonight's Making of Hocus Pocus, that I saw just before the film came out, deleted scenes or even a trailer. The film is definitly 5 stars. Due to Disney's lack of support with any extras, Disney gets a 1 star for insensitivity to the fans.

The \\"Divine Miss M\\" was attempting to switch from her Gay following to her Disney following which left both group's lost. SJP had not yet developed her S&TC; following so she she thumped about 'smelling children'. And the last member (KN) which I guess was the \\"funny one\\" of the troop always got left out: i.e. having to ride a vacuum instead of a broom - ha, ha the first time. I felt like I was watching a remake of the 3 stooges.

I can't imagine making the Salem Witch trials an object of fun. If you want something good to watch buy the British/ Canadian series called the \\"Worst Witch\\" or watch Harry Potter again. This is just another Disney demonizing of witches and /or pagan. It's no wonder they had a lot of problems on set filming this movie or that at the time it came out the pagans in Los Angeles held major protests. Avoid this movie its not fun in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Films Ever Made!","review":"This movie is terrible. There's really no other way to say it.

If I just saw it now, I probably wouldn't give it four stars because it's not actually that great, but for old times sake, I couldn't resist. I like it a lot because it brings back a lot of memories. It's not that funny, but it's okay. I like the whole colonial theme at the begining, that's pretty interesting, to compare cultures. Anyway, it's not the best movie, but it's not the worst either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie","review":"Hocus Pocus is a great family movie.

Does anyone know out there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids movie, brings back memories - however, NOT ANAMORPHIC","review":"This is a really nice kids movie, and I loved it as a kid. You won't regret giving it a spin. However, as a purchase be forewarned - if you have a widescreen TV this will not conform to the shape, as it is NOT ANAMORPHIC. It will show up as a box inside a box. So if you plan on only viewing on a widescreen TV, I can't recommend it. You can zoom, but the picure quality suffers.

There are a few scenes that are a bit suggestive, but overall you shouldn't have any awkward moments with the young ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween Fun","review":"Thsi movie seemed to get a bad rap at the time of its release. I remember numerous people commenting on how stupid it is. However, I think that's unjust. The cast is a riot namely the three witches perfectly played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy. The plot revolves around these three witches coming back to life 300 years after being hanged. they then set off to take the lives of every child in Salem so they can live forever. As ludicrous as the plot seems, the three bumbling, wise-cracking and sometimes pitifully stupid witches are so fun on screen, that the plot isn't even really anything to focus on. And of course, Bette gets her chance to sing at an adult Haloween party, when at the same time she's cursing all of them to \\"dance until they die.\\" I always oddly find myself singing along. This movie is great fun not only on Halloween but year round."},{"rating":"2","title":"I rather like this movie","review":"I know some parts of this movie are silly, that is why I will not rate this movie a five, but some parts of this movie I liked and I wanted this movie in my movie collection. The only thing is I believe it portrays what a Witch really is. However, I still like this movie, but some real Witches might not, unless they can except that there is really a darker side to Witches'. Witches' really are not into harming people like this movie would try to make one believe. I still give this movie a good rating. I have a friend who watched this movie and did not like it. However, it is like a kid movie, sort of like the Wizard of Oz is how I see this movie. I would put it in that category."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was great for all ages","review":"I first saw this movie with my children back when it was first released in 1993. I remember my daughter made her Mom take her out of the movie...i stayed and watched the end. It was great for Halloween. Now this week we watched it again...and my daughter sat through it all and thought it was cool. We just bought it and it will likely become a Halloween tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE LOVE IT!!","review":"We have rented this movie about 1000 times. This is the movie my 3 year old wants to rent everytime we go to the movie rental store. It is a funny movie with lots of neat special effects that kids of all ages enjoy. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the word \\"virgin\\" is used several times in the movie. When my 9 year old asked me what that word meant, I had a hard time answering her. Other than that, I really like the movie alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The critics were definitely wrong!","review":"I have never been able to understand why this movie did so badly at the box office. Not only does it have a rather original plot, but the ambience is terrific! Great photography and Halloween atmosphere. But it has two other things going for it that I especially found refreshing. The young boy who brings the witches back can only do so because it takes a virgin to light the black flame candle. It was so lovely to see a movie celebrating male virginity without snickering. The other plus is the fact that despite his considering his little sister a nuisance in the beginning, he later risks his life to save her. The sibling tie was very strong and I found this a positive role model for all kids to see. The three witches are wonderful. Yes, it's a little gory for young kids, but it's fantasy after all. As an adult, I loved it and watch it every Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands-down Halloween Classic!","review":"A teenager (Omri Katz who plays MAX) tries to impress a possible love interest and lights the famed black-flame candle.

All they need to remain alive forever is a little girl (Thora Birch DANI) - - on toast! Great fun, laughs and with Bette Midler--sensational song. Though this is not a muscial per se.

In the 1600s the witches are hanged, but not before Winifred could cast a spell which would bring them back when a virgin lights the Blackflame candle. Flash to 1993 and a virgin, Max, lights the candle to impress a girl he likes, Alison, and brings to witches back to life.

(I can't believe they couldn't even include the Movie Trailer!) Common Disney, re-release this DVD again and include the Numorous Deleted scenes, like The Supermarket Sequence, The Swimming Pool Sequence, ect ect., and how about including the Documentary of the Making of the special effects of Hocus Pocus that was shown on the Dicovery Channel back in 1994?

And a extra copy of the DVD released back in the early 2000's. The transfer of the movie to blu-ray looks nice, clean and a little more colorful. But barely. I was really hoping for deleted scenes(which there are plenty), behind the scenes and maybe some interviews. But Disney completely dropped the ball.

A long time ago in Salem, Massachusets, 3 witches would suck lives out of little children to make themselves younger. But when Thackery Binks stumbles on to their secret while they steal his sisters soul, they turn him into a cat that will live forever. When the townspeople find out, they get really mad and hang the witches, but if a virgin lights the black flamed candle on Hallween night, the 3 witches will come back. Now it's 1993. A boy lights the candle to impress a girl and the witches come back to reek havic. They must suck lives out of alot of children before the full moon, or they will vanish forever. The only problem is the kids have the book. You don't want to miss this. Your family will watch it for years to come.

It will now be on our family's Halloween movie list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's be honest...","review":"Hocus Pocus is not the best film ever made, by far. The teen actors (except for Vinessa Shaw as Allison) give overblown performances. The contemporary part is nearly embarrassing. BUT, when the Sanderson Sisters are reawakened, this film turns into a guilty pleasure. Bette Midler, especially, but Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker as well, play the sisters to the hilt, and it's fun to ride along and see how they cope with modern life.

As soon as I opened it, I discovered it was useless -- it is written for the Greek teacher and the student in class who is having the essentials explained by the teacher. There are so many assumptions made in the first chapters alone that an independent learner who does not have a Greek teacher has to give up immediately, and seek another method of learning Greek instead. Advice - don't buy this book if learning on your own. However, as a text used in class in which the teacher provides the context, it may be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayan??","review":"I didn't bother watching the movie, as the title left me dubious about the quality of it.

I will state the positive aspects: the Grill Floss is of high quality and of good length. That being said, the $5.45 brush I bought along with this item does a better job. This Grillfloss did not a)do a better job than the bristle brush b)was tedious and far more time consuming c)you can get around \\"most\\" of each grill rail but not the entire 360 with the way it is assembled. I have a built in Charm Glow stainless steel BBQ, for this type of BBQ this product is a no go. Both sides of the bristle brush have 180 rail cleaner that worked as good. Use a good brush with a rail (edge scraper)cleaner and /or hand wash if your grills are removable. Far more efficient and less costly. Don't waste your time on Grillfloss, it's a dud. Product returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grill floss tool doesn't fit most grates","review":"I have tried to use the grill floss on two different BBQ's already and both times the grates were either to big or shaped funny for the tool to be useful.

Loved the geocaching parts as well it tied everything together nicely and taught me a little about something i didn't even know existed. This will have you laughing til the end. You may even be like my husband and use some of the funny lines and try to do some of the funny stunts that they did as well. Although this isn't recommended. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST SEE SPLINTERHEADS!","review":"Wow, this movie is definitely one of the funniest I have seen in a while! The amusement park setting is perfect for this quirky comedy, a fun backdrop for the wild storyline. Thomas Middleditch, a newcomer to the scene, really shines in this plot as an unmotivated town native who falls for a cool, geocaching splinterhead (NOT A CARNIE, there is a difference people!) named Galaxy. The relationship that develops between the two, though odd and seemingly unlikely, is well formed. I was happy to see Christopher McDonald and Lea Thompson featured in the ensemble of characters, and though their parts are small, they definitely add a special comedic spark. From The Amazing Steve and his trusty sidekick Wyoming to the lazy Wayne Chung, Splinterheads will leave you feeling entertained and satisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice plot - disappointed with language","review":"This could have been a good movie, but profanity simply for the sake of profanity took a lot away from it.

I fully join in the earlier reviewers' praise for this book. I do, however, have a couple of constructive criticisms. First, much too much space is devoted to non-literary historical and political figures and events. Hopefully, the next edition will cut down on this stuff, so that more \\"minor\\" writers can be included, especially contemporary writers and writers from the non-English speaking world. (In this respect, the Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature is probably a more comprehensive reference.) Second, too many entries about particular works are merely brief plot summaries that do not convey to the uneducated reader (such as this one) the essential meaning or significance of the work in question.

Who wrote \\"Catch-22\\"? These are just some of the questions that \\"Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia\\" can answer. Bruce Murphy's book offers biographical notes on writers, synopsis of famous books, plays and poems, descriptions of characters and detailed explanation of literary terms and movements.I have had my copy of Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia since its publication in 1987 and have found no better reference tool for writing research papers and for general literary inquiries.

It differs from the \\"Pure\\" discs in both aim and style, but is a credible addition to the series. There is considerably more diversity on this disc, with hard-rockin' guitar tracks like Eric Johnson's brilliant \\"Cliffs of Dover\\" side-by-side with mellow, contemplative tracks like Morricone's \\"Gabriel's Oboe.\\" There's trip-hop, contemporary latin guitar, classic new age, in short: something for everybody. Particular highlights that you might not know previously are Vanessa-Mae's astonishingly beautiful \\"Widescreen,\\" Neal Schon's driving \\"Midnight Express,\\" and New Age legends Cusco's \\"Montezuma\\" (which also apears on \\"Pure Moods II.\\" This disc is worth of both its heratige and a place in your collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Editorial Review","review":"\\"Unlike its predecessors, Pure Moods and Celtic Moods, Instrumental Moods doesn't follow any specific style. Instead, it strings together a number of instrumentals from different genres, from new age (Enigma), reggae (Afro Celt Sound System) and worldbeat (Cusco) to rock (Eric Johnson, Santana), film scores (Ennio Morricone), pop (Vaness-Mae) and trip-hop (Massive Attack). The only connection these songs have is their laidback tone, and that happens to be enough, since the diverse range of styles prevents the record from being monotonous. Not all of the songs are familiar, but there are enough recognizable pieces to hold the attention of the curious, as they discover that Instrumental Moods is fine mood music. ~ Rodney Batdorf, All Music Guide\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a water filter should; you can smell & feel the difference","review":"The water filter in this device works much like a Brita filter--with finely ground bits of coconut husk (and some other stuff, I think). It's a good, effective filter that produces better-smelling water immediately (nice especially when you're taking a long soak in a tub). It seems to work better with soap and shampoo as well. We've gone through several of these over the last few years and will continue to replace the filters as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary","review":"This video really helped clarify what Tom Delay and his corporate pals did to steal the election... what a democracy we have!

What should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame. Ronnie Earle, the district attorney at the center of the film, says, \\"This isn't about Democrats and Republicans, this is about cops and robbers.\\" If only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say. Instead, from the start, The Big Buy feels like a film you've walked into thirty minutes late. Following the theme stated by Earle of cops and robbers, The Big Buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic, but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely won't notice. Somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story, to bad it's not being told here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appallingly bad video","review":"I have seen many travel videos and this is by far the worst I have encountered. The shooting and editing are worst than home videos, with excruciatingly long, poorly framed shots of water, harbors, hotel facades, and hillsides. Shots go in and out of focus, tilt left and right, and you can actually hear when the camera is bumped. The content and narrative are no more informative than the front page of any travel website on Maui. Do not waste any money on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for seductive pin-up","review":"The overall artwork is superb!

I too was skeptical at first but when I bought it I was immediately impressed by how much simpler things were. No longer did you need oodles of dice. All you need now are a few cards, chips, and friends. The rules are simple and with the emphasis on storytelling instead of dice rolling everyone has more fun and can concentrate on the tale being told. I love this Game. The only down side I noticed is NO TASSLEHOFF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifth Age setting alright, but Saga Rules System is great!!!","review":"I bought the Dragonlance: Fifth Age not for the setting, but for the Saga Rules. Imagine TSR producing a diceless RPG, it's crazy! But it is true. The Saga Rules are very, very, very, good and very adaptable. My friend and I always liked the idea of the Shadowrun RPG, but never liked the rules (It required about 1000 d6's to play). But we converted Shadowrun to Saga Rules and it works great. If you are a fan of Dragonlance, get it, and if you are a fan of new, intelligent, and unique rules systems get the Saga Rules System."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"Three words: they ruined Krynn. Dragonlance used to be the best campaign setting for D&D, but TSR discontinued the campaign setting boxed set and replaced it with a new game, separate from D&D. The game rules are okay, some interesting concepts, but unfortunately incomplete. The rules are just not completely enough explained to run a game here, so you'll have to buy a bunch of (expensive) game suppliments. Even worse, though, is that they ruined the setting. Fifth Age distorts Krynn in a number of ways, the game world is much less appealing than the old \\"Fourth Age\\". Unless you have money to burn, I say give this one a pass. If you like the idea of a card-based RPG, I suggest you check out \\"Castle Falkenstein\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only last 10 hours and dead","review":"I bought one in July, played about 4-5 movies, and it's DEAD, I opened the metal top enclosure as I wonder maybe the fuse was burned, well, I can't believe what I saw, the 2 AC input receptacle housing metal contacts were loosen from the PCBA, it seems to me a defect of \\"cold solder\\", the other AC bypass housing was came off the PCB as well, no wonder when I set it up, the AC outlet on the back has never been worked!Terrible quality assurance, this cold solder should never pass the \\"vibration test\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong edition","review":"Not the Illustrated Junior Edition depicted on Amazon.

In spite of his great popularity he knew there was more to the heart and soul of country music than big stage shows with lots of lights and overbearing sound. His life long friend knew he was growing weary of the big productions, and Grandma always had the best advice. I give this heart warming romantic movie 2 thumbs up.

It's the best biographical movie that I've ever seen, and one of the best period. It tells the story of the best country singer, George Strait. George Strait is a great actor in this movie. Yes, you'll actually see him get upset for once while he acts out the highs and lows of his career in this movie.This movie made me respect George Strait more for what he had to go through to become the superstar that he is and there couldn't be a better ending to a great movie. Along with the great music that you'll hear in this movie, this is one of the top ten movies of all time in my opinion.

The other actors such as Leslie Ann Warren pretty much just go through the motions in this mostly predictable and not very believable film. It may be worth seeing if you're a fan of old-fashioned love stories or country music (and some of the music here is pretty good, even for this non-country fan:) ), but if you want an original and exciting film, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Country","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

But it didn't matter to me in this movie!!I believe George Strait is very talented, and he really projected a presence in this film. However, the storyline just didn't cut it for me... it's ridiculous how this woman meets Dusty (played by George Strait), and doesn't know he's this famous country singer... especially since she goes out to country and western clubs. Hmmm... just a little too far-fetched... surely she would have seen a poster of him somewhere in one of those clubs... and how could a country performer just hang out at a country and western club and not be noticed by the others. But that's just one hole in this poorly-written film. George Strait looks great in this film, the music is wonderful... but the story... well, it's a good story, put together badly. Why am I giving it four stars?? I just can't give George Strait less than that... sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a zero if I could.","review":"This movie has been inflicted on me three times, and despite the fact that I'm a fan of Kyle Chandler, the word \\"inflicted\\" still applies. It's as if the writer and director took every redneck country music cliche, wrapped them up, and then packaged it as a movie. The plot is obvious and overused, the songs all sound like each other, and there's one character who never speaks in anything except stupid and overused analogies.The really sad thing is the number of people who consider this movie to be gospel. It's horrible!

I grew up on this movie and love it, so my 2 stars is for the product itself.First off, I put the DVD in my player on the widescreen side. Unfortunately, no matter which side I put the disc on, it was full-screen format. Second, the sound isn't that great. The movie hasn't been enhanced in any way, shape, or form. The sound is that of a VHS and those gross little white specks from older, non-enhanced films make quite a few appearances. I was hoping it would have been upgraded to be compatible with surround systems. Lastly, and thank God it's fixable, subtitles are always turned on when you start the movie. At first, I thought I accidentally hit the button, but when I turned the movie off halfway through and resumed later, I found that it was something to be dealt with every time.While I did enjoy the movie, I'm not happy with the DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Country","review":"The movie was well written with great actors.

The clip that holds the barrel and cylinder for the caps in place is made of plastic and can come loose quiet easily. Also the lever to advance to the next cap sometimes jams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good so far","review":"I haven't had the chance to shoot any caps in it yet (I was hoping to find some locally, but that may not be the case), but the gun itself seems pretty sturdy. The hammer doesn't cock back (I honestly can't remember if they did when I was a kid or not), but the cylinder does spin when the trigger is pulled. One thing to be aware of is that it does ship with an orange plastic piece on the end so you know it's fake (I honestly wanted something without an orange tip, but I'm pretty sure I can pull it off if I want). I'm using this with a Woody costume kit for Halloween and I think it'll work out just fine.My son loves the belt almost as much as he loves playing with the gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Tex Not So Big On Wear","review":"gave to 3yr. old grand son. did not take long for the chamber to start popping open when the trigger was pulled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken already...","review":"As other reviews state this gun seemed great at first. After about 2 weeks the latch that opens the gun to swich out the caps broke. It would still stay in place except my son likes to pretend to \\"fast-draw\\" and it would fly open every time he pulled it out of the holster. Today something in the trigger mechanism broke so the gun no longer fires the caps and is officially broken. Both parts that broke are plastic. Disappointed!!

This product was disappointing. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This cap gun is an absolute joke. The ONLY thing it has going for it, is the fact that it is not plastic. But that is where it begins and where it ends. The caps are next to impossible to remove once fired. If you do buy this, then you will also have to give your child a pair of needle nose pliers, or a flathead screwdriver for cap removal. The caps that this uses are all but silent. My five year old can snap his fingers louder than these things are...that is the ones that actually do fire. This cap gun has many \\"misfires\\" All in all, I would recommend going to Wal-Mart and buying the cheap orange plastic one they have for $8.00. It is a much better cap gun. I promise your child will be very disappointed with this cap gun. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!

It looks great, is heavy and seems like a quality gun that will last a while. We did not buy caps yet so I can't say whether or not it fires well, but my son enjoys \\"shooting\\" it just the same. He's 6. The holster is just plastic, I think, but is adequate. The belt is just plain cheap and the buckle does not secure well. It did not look like the one pictured online. We swapped it out with my son's regular leather belt and that works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Cool","review":"This gun looks and feels great - especially for a kid.The biggest problems? It's almost impossible to get the caps out after they have been shot. There is no release or push pin as you find with even the cheapest ring cap guns. You need to carry a knife or screwdriver to pry out the ring, and then hope the ring doesn't break, leaving small cap pieces in the drum that are even more difficult to pull out.Second... the caps aren't very loud, and only fire about half the time. Not sure if this is a problem with the caps or the firing mechanism on the gun. At any rate, VERY dissapointing for a kid to have only a few shots fire.. and then even more so when they can't get the caps out. That means Dad has to be on hand full time to be the 'assistant'. not so cool, especially when there are better guns for about $3 at the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten gallon hat size of fun.","review":"I bought this gun for my younger brother and he loves it.

Useless, it went straight into the trash. The holster is cheap plastic and looks like cheap plastic. The gun, at least, is metal, but it's tiny too.

The roots were so knotted and filled with fertilizer it looked like it was suffocating. I carefully removed the fertilizer and what soil there was and washed the roots and repotted in a new similar sized pot in bonsai soil. I followed the included directions and within tow weeks, the leaves shriveled and started falling off. I am not a beginner when it comes to plants so I was shocked when this plant \\"died\\".

Coles is the author and Reinfeld simply checked the annotations.

I got so disgusted with them after a few years that I refused to read any more. But when my niece gave me this one recently (she picked it up in a used bookstore ... ), I took the plunge, and I'm glad I did. The book's point is that spirtuality devoted to Mary concentrates on bearing God in your own soul-womb, and that the birthing pangs are fasting, prayer, and love. The author seems to be very influenced by the desert fathers and mothers, who are quoted a lot throughout the book.

Much to my disapointment it is not up to snuff. First, Johnny sings without his customary \\"growl.\\" In fact, he sounds more like Buck Owens than a blues singer. Second, he plays through a phase shifter or flanger effect box on every song! Now, I can see using it here or there for effect--but every song! The volume of Johnny's guitar is a steady warbled drone, as though under water, and the band reminds one of an uninspired, beer gorged, garage band. The guitars solos, which are usually what one buys a Johnny Winter record for, are trite, repetitive, predictable, pap. No fire here folks. If you liked, Johnny's first album on Columbia, or Still Alive & Well, or Third Degree, -- you will think he has completely lost it after hearing this album -- it is, absolutely, the weakest album Johnny has ever made. All the same we're looking forward to his next effort. Hint: ditch the effects box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A shadow of his former self","review":"A major disappointment. Nobody who saw this great guitarist in his heyday would call this collection of badly sung blue standards a great album. I had heard that Johnny Winter's health has been failing for several years and that now, nearly blind, he needs to be led on and off the stage. Listening to Live in NYC reminds of concerts I have seen with some of the aging blues giants -- John Lee Hooker, B.B. King -- where they are well past their prime and just going through the motions.

If written differently, I could have enjoyed it. It had points where it read like a trashy romance novel, this woman and her younger boy-toys in sex scenes that were a little too vivid. It's science tech was very elaborate and well thought out, and sometimes described in such detail that it detracted from the story.

This kind of sleazy sex is so boring. The author's fantasy that sleazy sex results in love and marriage is not only not realistic, its laughable. I hope no teenage girls get a hold of these books.

I have used one in my travel trailer for quite a while and never had any issues with water purity. Sadly, this purchase is to replace the one that broke after very little use. The nipple at the bottom snapped off, where it plugs into the filter housing. They're pretty expensive to be that delicate. If the ceramic portion had been what broke, maybe I could understand, but this was the plastic part at the bottom! As for purchasing from Amazon, WOW what a slow delivery. I ordered it two weeks before an upcoming camping trip and had to take the trip without it, because it didn't arrive in time.

It was recomended to me by a friend who honestly I thought had no taste in movies and had suggested many stinkers to me before. Well I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day, and he was right that day. I happened to be at the video store the other day and noticed this sitting in the video bargain bin for a buck. \\"All that came to mind was that was a good movie\\". After watching it again some fifteen years later I was wrong that was a great movie. An Acting Toure De Force starring Matthew Modine, Albert Finney, and Kevin Anderson and all are excellent. Perfectly directed by Alan Pakula, the same Director that directed All The President's Men, Sophies Choice and Klute. If you are a guy in search of a good movie you can't go wrong with Orphan's (1987). I can't believe this is not out on DVD release as of the writing of this comment. Don't those studio heads know what good films are."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Masterpiece!\\"","review":"Lyle Kessler's great stage play comes alive on screen.

This story of three generations of women, each dealing with their own problems, really touched my heart. I am 19, and I found myself relating so much to the things that the women were going through. I couldn't so much relate to the grandmother, but that's expected. This book gives a very realistic example of how mothers interact with daughters and vice versa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny teenager drives me nuts","review":"It is good to know that fifteen-year-old Ruth's mother and grandmother love her because I found her one of the most selfish, judgemental, and whiny kids I have ever met in literature. Carrie, the main character, gripes that her mother controls her, but her daughter is really in control. So what if her mom sleeps with her old heartthrob almost a year after her husband dies? How can this possibly affect Ruth except to remove her as the center of her mother's attention? And the reader, \\"Goooodddd!\\" I was a high school English teacher and I really don't think teenagers talk like this anymore. I will struggle through to the end of the audio version of this book only because I paid for it. I usually pass my audio books on to friends but I think this will go directly to the used book store. A really unpleasant listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chic read for sure","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was interesting to me to see how the author depicted the mother and daughter dealing with their grief over the loss of their husband/father. The fact that it was told from the points of view of the teenaged daughter, mother and grandmother added depth to the characters and to the story. It was a fast read and I had a hard time putting this book down when it was over. The author wrapped up the book nicely in the end.After reading this book, I'm encouraged to read other books by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, funny and heartfelt.","review":"This was a wonderful story about three generations of women and the men in (and out) of their lives. Told from each of their viewpoints, Gaffney especially captures what it is like to be a teenager, along with what it is to be like the mother of a teenager, and what it is like to be the matriarch , growing older and trying to hold her family all together. Recently widowed, Carrie struggles to get on with her life, raise her teen daughter Ruth, and come to terms with her pushy-at-times mother Dana and the relationship she has with her father George. Enter Carrie's highschool sweetheart and throw in her domineering new boss and some ark animals and you have a wonderfully entertaining story that will stay with you for a long time. A terrific novel for any generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circle of Three","review":"This book was sooooo boring and very predictable. I was very disappointed to say the least.

It never really took off and the characters were flat. I kept thinking it would get better but sadly it did not. It was an OK book but if I had read it first I would not have read TSG thinking that it was average as well.

Just like in a review I read from a critic--when he's not straining, he sounds flat. I think that people shouldn't compare him to neither Luther Vandross or Barry White because he's nowhere near as great as they are. He has a good voice but needs to work on it more. Also, it just seems to me like he's desperate now because he has turned to hip-hop and there's just so much of that now, just because it's supposedly \\"in\\". Whatever happened to good ol R&B, gospel, etc? I hope that in the future that his singing ability will expand and stick to music that will show it.. then just maybe, we can actually compare him to those two great singers. Also, one more thing, he ought to pick songs that have better lyrics than such lyrics as 'no ruben' and 'what is sexy' and make more classier, just better covers so that it'll stop the stereotypes of what people see black people as."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is worth every penny!","review":"I think Ruban did great for his first cd and I am glad it is not like AI.

If he wanted to brag about his win on this album, then he should've mentioned how he was just a pawn in the competition. The white man needed to show that American Idol is not a racist show and they used Ruben to that effect. The end result of that is that this album turned out mediocre when it could've been a great album. Ruben's talent was wasted on this album, but the show accomplished what it set out to do. Ruben, I hate to say it, but you are the white man's token."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Not Have Won American Idol 2","review":"Okay, people, the sad fact is that Ruben's music does not appeal to a broad base of people. It is R&B; sounding as opposed to pop sounding like Clay Aiken's album. On the whole, the R&B; sound does not have mass appeal.What's sad is that America let Ruben win American Idol when you never even see his crappy music around anywhere. What do I hear being played on the radio? Kelly and Clay. What do I like the sound of? Kelly and Clay. Who do you see getting television appearances and cameos? Kelly and Clay. The only things I have even seen Ruben on are the NAACP Awards and some urban sitcom on the WB or UPN.So to sum things up, this album is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like what Ruben sang on American Idol.

The majority of the songs are lyrically banal and sometimes offensive (telling us how great you are Ruben seems just a little self serving to me!). The beats are monotonous and sometimes just so darned SLOW that it's hard to keep interest up. And worst of all, Ruben's voice often sounds high and thin, and on more than a few occasions, somewhat off key!If you're looking for a great truly SOULFUL CD, I would recommend either of Alicia Key's albums instead of Ruben's attempt.

I bought this album attaching high expectations. I was hoping this album would distinguish and solitify Rub's place in R&B/soul folklore, however, this album fell well short of the mark.

Rub, does nothing to distinguish himself on this album, in fact, he sounds very much like Dave Hollister. I only hope that Rub can weather the storm and come back with something more heartfelt and genuine than this mindless project. Rub has the chords to do it, and it would be a shame to loose this talent in the sea of mediocrity that has become contemporary R&B."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VELVET TEDDYBEAR IS SO SOULFUL!","review":"RUBEN STUDDARD'S CD IS WONDERFUL.HIS DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC ON HIS CD IS AWESOME.WHAT I MEAN BY HIS DIFFERENT STYLES IS HE HAS ACLASSIC R&B;, HIP-HOP,URBAN, SMOOTH GROOVE AND GOSPEL SOUND TO IT.WHEN YOU COMBINED ALL THESE DIFFERENT STYLES TOGETHER YOU GET THE WORD CALLED SOULFUL. A PERFECT NAME FOR A PERFECT CD.EACH TRACK HAS IT'S ON STYLE TO IT....I JUST LOVE THIS CD AND I JUST LOVE RUBEN'S VOICE.HE REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF LUTHER VANDROSS.IF DON'T LIKE SOULFUL MUSIC YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS CDBUT IF YOU DO LIKE SOUFUL MUSIC YOU CAN'T GET MORE SOULFUL THAN THIS CD.THANK-YOU FOR READING MY REVEIW AND GOD BLESS!PS: THIS IS NOT A CLAY VS RUBEN THING THAT THE MEIDA HAS MADE. BOTH MEN HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICES I LIKE THEM BOTH. LET'S STOP THE HATE THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING BETWEEN CLAY AND RUBEN. BOTH MEN DESERVES MUCH SUCCESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big SWEATY BEAR SUCKS!!!!","review":"I did not buy this album but listened to it from a friend and it SUCKS!! How did he win the American Idol title, anyway? Oh I know, it was rigged.. He can't sing so save your money and DON'T buy it, the album is not worth it......"},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBEN!!! WHAT HAPPENED????","review":"I have listened to this cd all of it. SOme songs are cool but most of them I don't like. I think he is great but the music choice he picked is awful. I think he would be good in gospel music. He has a good voice but not for R&B there is too much out there that I think is much better then him. I guess I expected to much from him he is the AM 2 and got disapointed while I listened to it over and over again. If he has a next albumn I will listen to it again before I waste my money. Good Luck try again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck was he thinking?","review":"Many of the reviewers are rabidly defending Rueben's choice of songs and styles on this album, ranting that we, the American record buying public, don't have the right to expect pop music on this record. Helloooooo!!! The American Idol series started in Britain as \\"Pop Idol\\". If he had no interest in singing pop and smooth R&B, he should not have tried out for the show. What if Kelly would have put out an album of nothing but Broadway Show tunes, or Clay would have recorded his first album as Country? Fans would be disappointed and we have the right to be disappointed about Rueben. He should stick to pop and R&B and leave that rap cr@p at the curb where it belongs. I had high hopes for this album, but my copy has already gone to the Salvation Army. Don't expect his high sales to last very long once word gets out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak and Terribly disappointing","review":"This cd was a huge disappointment. It would have been a decent cd if it came from someone else, but from Ruben, it's not good. It doesn't fit the \\"Soulful\\" title that it's given. At times, it seems like hip hop is forced into the songs. I guess I was expecting this cd to take me back to the days when R&B actually had content. But this cd lacked content and was quite immature. There is a verse in one of his songs that mentions something to the effect of \\"It turns me on when you curse me out\\". If that's how he really feels then perhaps the title of his album should be changed to IGNORANT. This album is lucky that it got 1 star. There wasn't an option for 0 or a half of a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this CD really sucks!!!","review":"I don't know why anyone would buy this cd. Sorry 2004 has the cheesiest lyrics I have heard. This is not what is expected from an American Idol winner. He could have done so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Debut CD","review":"OK, I love Ruben Studdard's voice... the guy is gifted, however, most of this album is just so-so. Best cuts are \\"Sorry 2004\\" and the cover tunes (\\"How Can you Mend a Broken Heart\\" and \\"Superstar\\"). My problem with this album is that I'm not a great fan of hip hop and many of the new tracks fall into that category. I know Ruben is trying to find his own way, which is wonderful, however, I think he might have been better served by doing more of a pop album as his debut. Don't want to be unfair and say that he should be recreating his American Idol performances... every artist deserves to grow... but would have been nice to have a CD filled with Ruben's beautiful vocals. This CD just doesn't 'represent' his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deniece Sanders review....","review":"You decide that people here need to \\"grow up\\"? You say that blacks not whites are making this a race issue? I failed to notice any poster stating their race. And your comment about Clay, saying \\"when did he start liking women\\"? You assume a lot regarding an issue about which you *know nothing. Don't listen to unfounded rumors and do some growing up yourself. Everyone has his or her opinion about Ruben and Clays singing. It's just that, an opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't show \\"The Velvet Teddy Bear's\\" potential!","review":"I think Ruben has an amazing voice and great potential! BUT, that said, I think that this cd is in no way a showcase of his quality! He has such potential! I am hoping that once he is free to have more control over his music and AI no longer has control over it, I am hoping that he will put out a higher quality album with songs that the music buying public will enjoy more. This cd will make a great coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gift you can... uh.. keep giving...","review":"Being in Alabama, I wanted to like this CD. I tried to talk myself into liking it, but it is just dreadful. I got one as a gift and I'm going to be rather cheeky and pass it along to someone else as a gift - you know, one of those people you feel compelled to buy a gift for but would rather not have to.. or I could use it for a game of Dirty Santa."},{"rating":"1","title":"One week later","review":"I bought Rubens CD the day it came out and thought it was awful but decided that maybe I should keep listening and it would grow on me, that maybe I judged it to soon. It's been a week and I still hate it. I liked Ruben on Idol and thought his voice was very smooth and filled with emotion but this CD is very flat and he seems to struggle with the notes. I liked Clay Aikens CD but just can't recommend this one, I wish I could but can't do it.Maybe the next one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulful by Ruben Studdard","review":"This album was a disappointment. I really liked Ruben but hemisrepresented his musical style on American Idol. This modernR & B all sounds the same. I just spent 14.00 on a album Iwill never listen to again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry is right....","review":"Let me start out by saying i LOVED Ruben during American Idol and couldn't wait for his album to come out. Ruben's voice is amazing, but the lyrics of his songs are laughable. I'm Sorry for 2004 is an example of just a horrible song. I was really looking forward to hearing more songs like Flying Without Wings, which Ruben sings beautifully. I hope Ruben puts out another album that portrays the Ruben we all know and love from the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"congressman dave","review":"I will not purchase this CD based SOULY on the samples provided on Amazon. This sounds just like any other R&B record put out, large bass lines and over produced. The background beats and sounds are much better than Ruben's voice. This album would be better served being re-released as an instrumental. Ruben clearly is not a hip-hop/urban/r&b singer, I agree with most of the other reviews....he would be better served to release some sort of gospel album. This may have been what Ruben wanted, who knows but I will say this....his 2nd album will not see the light of day. Ruben, you should have lost AI. I would vote anyday for Clay, just on shear vocal range and talent. You sound like every other R&B artist out and you also went the route of all other Urban artists....heavy in bling bling, sex, etc. This is a hurting debut album. I only gave it 1 star because ZERO is not an option!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what the whole buzz is about","review":"soulful??? even britney spears(and she's so...fake and worthless and such a piece of crap) is more soulful than this....I don't know why people make such a big deal of this talentless singer, he has no talent! I still have no idea how he won AI, there where such great talents on the show and they give the record to the worse one! He has no voice, and now he's making a mix of R&B with Hip-Hop???? pls stop! I'll kill myself, you don't have to put this awful music, I prefer listenning to justin guarini(and he has zero talent also)pls go back home, and leave the field free for real singers, there's no time for wanna be's"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sorry\\" but \\"No Ruben\\" for me","review":"Even with all big names pushed with this debut cd, along some cover songs, I was sadly disappointed. I found myself changing tracks before each song was over. Superstar, omg, how long can that song be?? No Ruben is a chessy wannabe rap song. Sorry 2004, the lyrics/ Pulease! Maybe he should have taken a few more months to work on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"From AI2, i always wondered why Ruben won? I am not a Clay fan but i seriously think that Clay is much better than Ruben.This album shows Ruben just don't have the vocals nor the correct music direction. People is buying this album because he's the winner of AI2 but as time goes by, Ruben will be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent wasted...","review":"Please, Ruben! Don't waste your voice on trashy lyrics and join the throng of disgusting rappers. Oh, too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"What happened to the \\"Velvet Teddy Bear\\"? This is a mess of tepid hip hop and in your face lyrics about why Ruben is great. The only good song on the CD is \\"How can you mend a broken heart\\" and that is because it is a near clone version of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untitled.","review":"What I can't beleive is that he has enough energy to sing. I saw him on BET and he said he weighed 350 pounds. I used to weigh 500. When I was at the 350 mark (In high school), I couldn't even breathe. I sounded like an ashmatic. My high school was 3 stories high. The elevators were only open to the handicapped. I was just plain HUGE!!! I actually passed out at school once (when I was about Ruben's size). He is pretty good at singing but I just can't believe he has enough energy to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy should stop eating and take a singing lesson.","review":"I'm sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on this CD. I'm amazed that Roben even made it to the top ten on American Idol. I think that the only people that voted for him were fat people that thought Ruben was like one of their family members. Personally I think he is a disgrace to the pop music industry. In conclusion, the only reason I give this CD one star is because I can't give a zero star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is capable of so much more","review":"This CD was a huge disappointment to me, I think Ruben is capable of so much more. Did not like the style of what he sings. Would not recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"velvet voice - poor choice of material","review":"Ruben Studdard's rich warm voice is wasted on the material included in this CD. Next CD needs better material for Mr. Studdard to be around for the long hall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible....Thought it would be better!","review":"This cd was a waste of my $10.00. All Ruben is is a hip-hop wanna be. This sounds like everything else being made today by hip-hop artists. Plain out...JUST DON'T GET IT!The only good song is \\"Flying Without Wings\\" but thats a cover anyways. A boyband called \\"Westlife\\" were the original artists who sang it. Listen to the original song. It's better than Ruben's.Get Clay's CD. It's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rita Roo Review","review":"I enjoy soulful very much. I do think Ruben has more to give, but I like a CD I can pop in a listen to the whole thing and I can certainly do this with Soulful. I really think there is the whole thing of people who like Clay over Ruben doing some bashing instead of acknowledging the talent of each. I agree with the person who says you can't really compare the two. I like pop and I like Soul/hiphop and rap so I guess this is why I'll probably keep supporting both guys, as long as the music is good of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Stars","review":"Wonderful CD. Ruben's sound is so beautiful. He really needs to get the respect he deserves. People have to remember that Clay and Ruben are not in the same genre of music, so you cannot even compare the two. Ruben is wonderful, and I can't ge enough of this CD>"},{"rating":"1","title":"NASTY!!!! GARBAGE!!!","review":"Album is garbage. Sounds like fat guy about to have a heart attack. About as soulful as the sound of toilet flush."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This CD!!!","review":"This was a great cd. I am so happy the songs were madefor Ruben. I am so glad they let Ruben be his self andnot pattern him after others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking Heart Attack","review":"Man, this guy really needs to lay off the wings! I bet his blood pressure is through the roof (not to mention his cholesterol, sugar, etc) He won the American Idol competition (which automatically makes him an industry joke) and follows in the footsteps of the Queen of Uncool, herself Kelly Whatsherface. This CD is a bomb and is already falling down the charts, too bad it is not the pounds. Don't expect Reuben to be around much longer. Either his contract will be cancelled or he'll suffer a stroke."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD should Hip Hop out of my CD player","review":"Oh noooooooo! This is a typical hip-hop/rap CD. Not for the American Idol fan. I'm soooooo disapointed. I listened to it once and that is probably my last time. I wish I could return it. Reuben fooled us on American Idol. He is a hip-hop wanna be. I wish his record label would have kept him on track as a pop star.Sorry Reuben. I can't say anything nice. (I voted for you and wish I hadn't now)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just listen before buying","review":"This cd is okay, nothing outstanding, just like his voice, average nothing phenomenal here. Sorry but just like his single, Flying without wings, most of the songs seem to linger on making you want to switch tracks before the end of each song. Just my honest opinion but this cd is not one you will want to keep listening to. Two stars, its not bad, just nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the cd!","review":"Ruben great job on your first album! My favorite song is After the candles burn! I can't stop listening to this song. This album proves why you are America's Idol!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good album","review":"Expected more from the winner of American Idol. He is not living up to what I think he is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a Ruben fan","review":"voted for you on the show and was so glad when you won. Then I saw you in concert singing No Ruben and thought OH, NO! I hated that song and its on your CD. I just don't like these songs, cept one. I did like Invisible at the concert by Clay Aiken and although I personally can't stand him a friend gave me his CD for Christmas and just asked me to listen to it. I'm blown away. The songs on his CD are awesome. Sorry, Rube, just don't like your direction, you should have listened to those that wanted you to stay true to the people that voted for you on the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I loved Ruben in American Idol but I feel totally let down by this album. I wish I new he was going to change so drastically before I bought it. I didn't like any of the songs on the CD, and why all of the other singers? why not just Ruben. I can't recommend this album it's not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This cd has a lot of hip-hop & rap tracks with a few of the songs like the ones Ruben sang on American Idol that made him the winner. If, like me, you are expecting more of the songs like Ruben sang on American Idol, you will be disappointed. Soulful, as a title is misleading. It should be more Hip-hop and rap from Ruben."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO RUBEN!!!","review":"WELL HERE GOES....I WISH THAT I COULD GIVE THIS ALBUM A GOOD REVIEW BUT I CAN'T. YOU SEE I THOUGHT RUBEN WOULD SING SONGS THAT BEST FIT HIS VOICE. I THINK THAT HE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO THINK ITS OK AND WILL CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO HIS CD. AS FOR ME...ITS NOT WHAT I LIKE. I HOPE RUBEN WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME. I HAVEN'T COUNTED HIM OUT YET. I LIKE RUBEN AND I LIKED HEARING HIS AWESOME VOICE. I JUST WISH HE WOULD SING SONGS ALONG THE LINE OF WHAT HE SANG ON IDOL. THAT TYPE OF MUSIC WAS WHY HE WON. BUT AS FOR NOW..... NO MORE RUBEN!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I hope for and more!!!!","review":"I have been waiting for this CD for so long, and I was NOT disappointed. The tracks are good. He lives up to his title of \\"American Idol\\". This CD will remind all of his fans why they voted for him. Buy it. You will definitely be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben's new Album is \\"Soulful\\"","review":"The mix of new and old beats keeps up with the soul and gospel background that everyone loved when Ruben won American Idol. A great Album for those who like Hip-Hop, gospel, soul, or R&B, and a good all around Album for those with other tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulless","review":"Dreadful, simply dreadful. Instead of this mish mash try Ludacris or Luther Vandross but this mixture of Ruben's supposed hip hop is silly. And he can't sing R&B that well either--so go for Luther--now he's got soul. And Ruben being nominated for a grammy in the same category as Luther---what a laugh, what has this world come to when they put such an amateur in the same category as an icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the CD before buying it","review":"I was able to listen to this CD before buying it and I was glad that I did because the CD overall was not memorable. I think the problem, at least for me, is that the songs are too slow and lifeless. His soothing voice that is admired by others often lulls me to sleep because he sings with almost no emotion and energy. I suggest for those who are interested in buying this CD to listen to it first before making a decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I return it - it's horrible!","review":"I love R&B. Soul is great. This is way too rap-oriented.What a waste of a great talent.Ruben's heroes like Vandross would not be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Sorry, good choice of song title for this album. I was hoping for more. I couldn't wait for this CD to come out, what a disapointment. I tried but I just can't listen to it. I just hope this dosen't ruin Rubin's chances for a career in the music industry. Unfortunatly too many feel the same way I do and the music business is brutal \\"You never get a second chance to make a first impression\\".A music lover.............."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed :-(","review":"I do like Ruben's voice, but there are sooo many hip-hop singers out there. The songs are nothing but average. I do like \\"How do you mend a broken heart\\". It's different than most of the others. I can not recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP HELP HELP!","review":"This man is in serious decline. This cd is anything but good. His \\"what is sexy\\" makes me want to forget I am a woman as his singing leaves me very cold on this one. Sorry 2004 well isn't that a justin guarini remake just adding 2004? Now we come to What if? Hello this boy needs serious help. I do not recommend this cd, save your money and buy someone that really has talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"GRASPING AT STRAWS","review":"Sad, so sad. I read these comments, and see very little in the way of record reviews. I came here to read them to see if the record was worth buying. All I see is a group of people who are using incorrect statistics and grasping at the only thing they have to be proud of - the title of American Idol.Why can't you Rueben fanatics let anyone else be successful too? I won't buy this album if these messages are any kind of indication of what fan base I would be associated with. If you all have this much time on your hands, volunteer and do some good. Get off Mr. Aiken's back. Would you like some cheese with that whine?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I have been waiting a long time for Ruben's album and I am so glad it is finally here! It is a hip-hop album, so if you do not like hip hop, look elsewhere. I liked the slow-fast mix and Ruben's voice is strong on any track. In fact, the more fast paced songs (Take A Shot, and What Is Sexy) were my favorites.Great Job Ruben!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointing","review":"This cd didn't measure up to Rubens talent. The look Ruben has with the hat and all does not lead one to think this is his kind of music. I have heard Ruben sing many songs and this cd is not Ruben. Looking at the cover on the cd makes me think of the old Mississippi River Boat days. I would love to hear Ruben sing something that makes our hearts melt."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"All I can say is better luck next time. Ruben should have been voted off first. This CD proves he has \\"NO\\" vocal range at all. Sounds like he's out of breath in almost every song. In other words IT'S THE WORST CD I'VE EVER HEARD! Clay is on top now and will be in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like I said...FROM VERY GOOD SOURCES!","review":"YES, if the sales of this album are low the only one Ruben can blame is Ruben himself. Ruben wanted to sing RAP and HIP HOP. He didn't want to be a choir boy but a rapper! Yep, as funny as it sounds he says he can handle DA HOOD!Also, from very good sources, J records didn't want him to record rap/hip hop UNTIL his 2nd album and the only reason slow ballads were included in this one are purely for sale purposes the only 100% decision of the producers but even that took a great deal of arguing with Ruben.As for the album, IS NOT WORTH BUYING, not even ON SALE 'cause eventually is going to end up at a thrift store anyway. The lyrics are just plain DUMB. We know he's no player or a thug. RUBEN GIVE IT UP ... YOU ARE A MAMA'S BOY."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER!!!!","review":"This CD is great! I have not bought any CD's in a long time and I ran out to buy this. I love every song on this CD and that's hard to find these days. This makes for a great Xmas present! I would defintley recommened this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs but overall BORING","review":"I was a fan of Ruben on AI2, and bought and love the single Flying without wings. That is the best track on this album. The other good ones are For all we Know and Superstar. Thats IT. The rest are laughable, since when is Ruben from the hood? How many times can he sing about his crib & big boys? Stick to singing the ballads Ruben, you are no hip hop artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad As From Justin To Kelly","review":"Both are good singers, but honestly, didn't a majority of us think Clay should have won? His CD sounds like it was put quickly together, and has a very lazy sound to it. Maybe Rerun...ahem I mean Ruben will have better luck next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you mend a broken ear??","review":"I am crushed.I worked my fingers off voting for Ruben and for THIS?

I was a big fan and voted every week for Ruben. So, it pains me to have to call this CD awful! However, I feel if given another chance, Ruben can step up to the plate and do some work that will give him his do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real","review":"Let's just be truthful here, folks. The CD is round, it has a hole and when inserted into my CD player, it produces sounds. Boring sounds. I got mine at work, as part of a shipment of radio promotional CDs. The only reason I brought it home to listen again is that I was asked to seriously consider playing a different cut than \\"Sorry\\" on the air. Problem is, I couldn't find a \\"better\\" cut.The next day at work, my program director, along with myself, the music director, a promotions assistant, our maintenance person and the IT guy sat down for a listening session. For 25 minutes, we all sat back and looked at each other in amazement that some folks actually pretend this was a good CD. The unfortunate thing is that in order to appease the record promoter, we'll be giving it some airplay. I'll opt to turn down my studio monitor when it plays on my show.It'll make a great coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't compare","review":"I loved Ruben's CD. First of all I don't understand why people keep trying to compare Ruben with Clay. They are not singing the same type of music. Ruben is Hip-Hop and R&B,Clay is not. It's like comparing apples and oranges, it doesnt't mean one is any better than the other ,just which one do you prefer. If you have no taste for Hip-Hop or R&B then no you will not like this CD. You should find something that is more suitable to your musical tastes, and stop putting down Ruben's wonderful effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund","review":"I like the Rubester, but it's just not the type of music that he sang on AI.

TERRIBLE CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what I waited so long for?","review":"I waited anxiously for this CD and to say I was dissapointed is an understatement. Where are the soulful songs as suggested by the album title. I didn't realize we were voting for yet another hip-hop artist. I was looking forward to at least one or two new soulful songs, not covers or remakes, something he could call his own. The only new songs are the hip-hop ones and the only one of those that has a good beat is \\"What is sexy\\", though the words make no sense to me, the beat is catchy. The rest of them sound all the same and make no sense either.With all the backup on these songs, you dont even here Ruben singing most of the time. WOW, I can't believe he thinks this is good music. I wont buy another album unless I hear the songs first after this experience. For all of you who like hip-hop, you will like it I guess, but for those who don't, wait til his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBEN HAS LET US DOWN!!!","review":"RUBEN HAS LET US DOWN!!

I thought he would do more songs like Flying.. I am not a fan of today's music and to me this CD is today's music. Ruuuben did great with Tamyra Gray on the Christmas CD. Do more with her! Sing in that register. This voice is the voice I can't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i could rate it zero","review":"Putting aside the fact that i wanted Josh Gracin to win. Ruben Studdard killed the song \\"flying without wings\\" a great ballad previously performed by british boy band Westlife.

Josh Gracin just signed a record deal and is recording with one of Rascal Flatts producers durring leaves from the marines."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE LISTEN FOR YOURSELF BEFORE YOU BUY THIS CD","review":"I must say I bought this on a whim.

This is the worst CD that I have heard/bought in a long time. Dont waste your money on this one.In contrast, Clay's debut CD, Measure of a Man, is outstanding. Clay has such a beautiful voice.

Hoping for better with the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Artist!","review":"I love the album but what I was disaapointed in was the lack of promotion and just the respect that was denied to a great artist - I never watched American Idol before but when I heard Ruben sing it was like taking you back to the Luther Vandross and Al Green, Teddy P days ya know? Clay Aiken was the Sinatra type - The rat pack days are over - Ruben brings back the true R&B - Buy this album - It's well worth the money and definately worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is nice tooo me but tooo each it own","review":"i think everyone is putttin ruben cd down for no reson i think its nice it suprised me!! it hink they could have promoted him more!!! he is a very talanted brother! i love his soulfoul melody he is smoooth!!! i love you rubben! hold your head up sweetness!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced, Adolescent Lyrics, Amateur Dreck...........","review":"Admittedly, this is the guy's first CD, but give me a break! He sounds like some guy who bought studio time to make a CD for his mother. But wait! Nobody's mother would want to hear these lyrics that equate love with sex, brag about money, bling bling and winning contests. What a turn off. Not something my children will hear before the age of 18! The guy sings FLAT-that must be why they overproduced it-trying to drown out the flatness and gasping for breath. He's an amateur, an imitator, karaoke king! He might be OK at weddings-for free. This kind of \\"music\\" is the exact reason that CD sales are down. It sounds identical to all the other garbage out there today! Glad I didn't waste any money on this junk-I downloaded it. Don't worry-I'm not sharing it-I wouldn't want anyone to know that I had it on my hard drive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start","review":"Very good first album.

Despite my opinion that some of the lyrical content on the lot of these tracks were as if they were penned by a 14 year old, standouts like \\"After the Candles Burn\\" (HOTNESS BTW), the club friendly \\"Dont Quit On Me\\", \\"We Have Not Forgotten\\" and \\"Superstar\\" (though a subpar remake) was worth the purchase.In the future, I think that Rube should work with the likes of Organized Noize (TLC,Outkast), A Touch of Jazz (Jill Scott), Jaydee (ATCQ, Roots, Badu, Common), and James Poyser (Badu) for an album thats truthfully SOULFUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben Studdard is truly our American Idol","review":"Ruben has displayed his true style of music on this Cd. His cd expresses what is inside of him. He is truly a R&B singer. Ruben will be around for a very long time. I think some people forgot who the real American Idol winner was. Now the world will know it is Ruben Studdard. Keep up the good work and always be true to yourself and you will continue to be blessed. I know his cd will do well and I encourage everyone to support this cd and not buy the bootleg copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Ruben's voice??","review":"My only question is who is singing on this album? He sounds just like the other 800 guys on the radio. This is a tragedy as Ruben has a beautiful voice. He is singing out of his comfort range and it shows. I think both Ruben and Clay have been done a disservice by their \\"handlers.\\" More of the same is not what we need from two truly talented young men. No racism, no clayism, this album just doesn't do Ruben justice. I am hopeful that he will find his voice next time. It is a debut album, given time and better material, Ruben could become a legend. The quality of this album, however, will not get him there.To steal a phrase from Simon, \\"dreadful.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN, YAWN, AND DOUBLE YAWN!","review":"If you're suffering from insomnia, then this is the album for you! Just put it in your CD player, and within minutes you'll be in deep sleep. Ruben is an allright singer, nowhere near great. While he was competing on the show American Idol, Ruben Studdard chose \\"safe\\" songs to sing, and remained in a one-dimensional singing zone throughout the length of the competition. This album is no different than his one-dimensional performances on the show. On this album he shows his lack of range and sounds raspy in nearly all of the songs. It's clear that Ruben's \\"win\\" on American Idol was merely a ploy to make R&B music appeal to the masses. Sorry my dears, but this album sucks. I want my $14.00 back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What??!??","review":"This album stinks.Ruben was awesome under pressure on American Idol. He had an edge and urgency and feel.This album fails on many fronts, mostly by not capturing what is really inside that big man. I think that without the 'need to succeed', Ruben was led astray into this cluttered mess. The only song worth a second listen is 'How Do You Mend A Broken Heart'. He pulls that one up by the bootstraps.I hope that he stops listening to his handlers and moves BACK to center stage on his next album and belts out some of the soul that he showed us last year. Otherwise we'll all be saying, 'Ruben who?'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and tedious","review":"Superstar is so slow and tedious that you can hardly wait for him to stop groaning his way through it. Elsewhere in the album, Ruben takes too many breaths in the wrong places. And the faster songs are just as tedious due to the monotonous melodies and uninspiring lyrics. No, Ruben, this album will not make you a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"THESE ARE REVIWS?????","review":"I CAME HERE TO READ THE REVIEWS OF RUBENS CD...INSTEAD....I FIND INSULTS OF ALL KINDS BEING HURLED AT ONE ANOTHER......AND BY THE WAY ....

I'VE READ A NUMBER OF THESE REVIEWS AND CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY TIMES CLAY AIKEN HAS BEEN HARSHLY ATTACKED BY MANY OF YOU.HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO ANY OF YOU.I UNDERSTAND THESE YOUNG MEN ARE FRIENDS...PLEASE RESPECT THEIR FRIENDSHIP. NOW TO MY REVIEW. I THINK THAT THE CHOICE OF SONGS ON THIS CD DO NOT SHOWCASE THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE THAT RUBEN HAS.HE HAS PROVEN THAT HE HAS THE TALENT,I HOPE THAT HE MIGHT MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF LUTHER AND YET STILL BRING HIS OWN STYLE INTO HIS MUSIC.

I THINK RUBEN HAS A BEAUTIFL VOICE BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO. WHEN HE SANG ..I COULD SHOW YOU THE WORLD HE SOUNDED AWESOME. REMEMBER WHEN HE SANG THE BEE GEES SONGS? HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE HIS BEAUTIFUL VOICE. I KNOW THAT RUBEN HAS IT IN HIM.. IF HE WANTS MY MONEY HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE ME HIS BEST. THIS CD IS FULL OF MUSIC THAT IS SUITED FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

UGH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Popstar?","review":"I thought the whole idea of American Idol was to find a Popstar? I feel like the people that voted for Ruben like myself were misled. I bought this CD thinking it was the Ruben from American Idol but it's not. If you like R&B then you might like this album, if you are expecting Ruben from the show you will be disappointed. Listen before you buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED ???","review":"WOW! I MEAN WOW!!! THIS ISN'T GOOD. WHAT HAPPENED?

SORRY BUT I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"I rushed out and got the cd as soon as it was released and I'm not disappointed.Fortunately, this album is not a \\"fluff\\" album with little substance. Ruben shows us his range by singing songs that appeal to everyone from the young to old and hip hop to gospel.On some songs, he does not sound like himself, but that is not a bad thing. We get to hear him sing songs that he's obviously comfortable singing and it shows (including a remake of \\"Superstar\\" and \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get into it!","review":"I wanted so much to like thiscd, but I just can't get into it. He seems to have trouble breathing or something. I want the AM2 back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album ever","review":"It's shocking how awful this album is. I mean it's downright horrid. I wish I was Simon so I could come up with some witty way of describing how truly horrible this album is. I liked Ruben on American Idol. I thought he deserved to win. But if he had been singing songs like this I would have wanted him gone before he even made the final 12. I mean the songs are just terrible!!! And I wish he'd do something about his weight because he is extremely unhealthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Ruben sounds like hes out of breath and his songs are totally boring.

HIS CD ACTUALLY \\"BOMBED\\"! THE WORST CD OF THE YEAR IF NOT OF ALL TIMES."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Sorry too...","review":"I'm sorry to Ruben. I heard the album and fell asleep in the middle. First off the song \\"Sorry 2004\\", only has to words: \\"I'm sorry\\". Yeah, Ruben we got that the first time. But thanks for saying your sorry for this album, we are to. The other song that drives me crazy is \\"what if\\". \\"What if I didn't win..\\" Hello?! Could you be any more big headed. \\"I love you like I used to love cake\\" or something like that. Very romantic Ruben. And you \\"used\\" to love cake, looks like you still do. I heard this at a friends house and have no intention of buying the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"my gosh, this cd is a total waste of my hard earned dollars, and i want a REFUND! shame on ruben, and it was ruben who held up the record BECAUSE he wanted to do stupid 'hippity-hoppity' music w/ the names all mispelled, lol! (got that from the trailer for the new tom hanks movie, the old black lady says it) but it is very apropos for this tripe. it is a case of 'bait and switch' and false representation for mr. studdard to do that, after hooking everyone to vote for him by portraying himself as the NEW luther vandross or something, and then after winning the recording contract, boom. he should have at LEAST waited until after he released 1 or 2 discs w/ songs like the show, and THEN gradually moved into rap and hip hop! he just DOESN'T care about the R&B; fans who voted him the winner, AT ALL!show him you don't like this, by NOT buying into this scam! don't buy this 'sorry' recording, i wish i hadn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Don't waste your money. The cd is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luther Your Not!","review":"I keep hearing references that ruben studdard is another Luther Vandross. After listening to this cd I can honestly say their very wrong. This man can't even carry a tune. Gospel in a church maybe but there is no place in the music world for Ruben Studdard, maybe his local church will have him or free concerts but does not deserve another cd in my estimation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Debut CD","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to Soulful. I will admit that I do not like every song on this CD, but that can be said about any/every CD I purchase. If you like 4 or 5 songs of a CD you're doing good. Out of the 14 tracks on this CD, I can easily say that 10 of them are absolutely great!!! Ruben stayed true to his roots with this cd. I do feel for anyone who was expecting the cookie cutter rendition of songs he gave us on AI, but that's not who Ruben is. He did what was required of him on that show. The show is over and Ruben has moved on. There is a world beyond AI, and fans to boot. Ruben has fans now that you couldn't pay to watch AI. That's what this is all about. I say KUDOS to RUBEN STUDDARD for making a great CD. It was definitely worth my wait and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good singer who disappoints in this cd","review":"I've heard Ruben do much better. Although I didn't watch AI2, i heard clips from the show and I know Ruben can do a much better job than this. On this cd, his voice is a little too plain and doesn't show anything special at all. However, this may be because that I am not a fan of R&B...so you can call it a bias if you would like. Overall, the songs are boring and fail to portray his special flare. Songs that are ok are \\"For all we know\\" and \\"Flying without Wings\\"...i think only these songs redeem the cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am not going to buy it-----","review":"I never cared for his singing when he was on the show, I still cannot believe he won. He always always sounded the same --- his voice range is so very boring. His personality isn't much better. He looks like a heart attack waiting to happen. I just do not care for this man or his singing. Yes, I did buy Clays CD, I absolutely LOVE It!!! That guy has persona written all over his cute little bod."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD sucks!","review":"Okay, this CD is one of the worst of the year. It was obvious that no one wanted it to be released, that's why its release date was pushed back so many times! Ruben wasn't the real winner of American Idol, Clay was. If there was a choice for zero stars, I would have chosen that instead. However, I am forced to give it at least one star. Ruben is trying so hard to be like Luther Vandross and Barry White, unfortunately, he is nowhere near as good. \\"Sorry 2004\\" can't hold a candle to Clay Aiken's \\"Invisible.\\" \\"No Ruben\\" is also a weak, pitiful track. Ruben's rendition of \\"How Can you Mend a Broken Heart\\" is not as good as those of Al Greene or the Bee Gees. On this CD, Ruben brags many times about how he is so rich and famous, and how he gets a ton of girls. We all know that this is untrue. Anyway, this CD is horrible. Don't buy it; it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"REFRESHING!!","review":"I am not in the same age group as our american idol, but I can appreciate a SINGER when I hear one. I grew up in an era where the recording artists had to have pipes!! This young man is a throwback to a time when your voice was used as a precious tool to alter the feelings and emotions of people. This album may not appeal to everyone, but, its not supposed to. My favorite songs on this album are the ballads because they really set the tone for his Soulful theme. He pays homage to his idols beautifully without trying to imitate... You go Ruben!! I have seen you on tv and I realize that you know that you can sing. That confidence will sustain you through the rough time sthat you may experience along your journey. There are some people who believe that you should'nt be the American Idol. That's O.K. If these people were really listening honestly and saw what I saw, they know in their hearts You are the chosen One. Stay close to God, my brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben comes through again.","review":"It doesn't matter how many Clayfans don't have a life and spammed these reviews. Clay's no God and this is Ruben's album, so on to the review.Ruben effortlessly switches from hip-hop to R&B to Gospel, and showed tons of diversity with his debut album. Now, there was a song or two on the album with bad production, but as far as his voice and lyrics, etc. it's flawless. If you enjoy any of the already mentioned genres, this is an album to look into. If you're a Clay fan who likes straight pop, get out of these reviews.A great album from an awesome talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh","review":"Ruben is to Boyz 2 Men what Clay is to the Backstreet Boys. If your into the whole soul kind of thing then you might like this, but I've heard 2 of the singles from this and I think their pretty bad... He's still better than Clay Aiken though, he just didn't get the best material to sing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE GGAARRBBAAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is trash!! A huge pile of trash with moldy bread and dirty diaria dipers!! Ruben can't sing!! He is absolutly pathetic ,this album is THE WORST I have ever heard since I came to America!! Ruben needs to work on his music instead of gorging himself with CAKE, GRITS, HAM SANDWICHES ,AND PORK & BEANS!!! Rubin is a no talent lardo, and this album needs to stop being sold because it is so BAD!!! IT IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What?!","review":"To all of you reviewers giving this cd one star, you are seriously tripping! It's like 20 degrees outside in Chicago right now but his cd is keeping my heart warm. With jazzier, upbeat songs by Swizz Beatz, he's got rhythms that make you bob your head, dance, and other producers make you want to get up and slow dance with even the ugliest man in the room! Ruben still has a pioneering voice, hits the high notes just right, and songs like \\"Sorry\\" where he explains love, relationships, and sincerity without being soft and whiney (like MANY R&B singers today) make this album great. I loved it from beginning to end. I didn't vote for dude to see if my phone worked. I voted for him because I knew I'd want to hear his voice again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I bought this CD 2004","review":"I do not mean to offend anyone but this CD is awful!

A star on the mic on \\"AI\\", but a disappointment on this album. How do you market this? It was too \\"black\\" for pop audiences and too corny for urban audiences. Cheesy songwriting and weak production made matters worse. Fantasia won this year's \\"Idol\\" so that probably means it's the end for Ruben unless there's a \\"From Clay to Ruben\\" movie in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain ick","review":"That is all I can say about this. Ruben can do Luther, but that is about it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, awful material!","review":"I can't believe the record label actually considered the songs Ruben sings, let alone making him sing them! The lyircs of \\"What If\\" and \\"Sorry 2004\\" are rediculous. I can't believe this album is double platinum, people must be flocking to the stores to buy this album simply because of his reputation and deaf to the dumb lyrics of this material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love both of them, like Ruben's cd better","review":"I love both the voices of Clay and Ruben and own both cds. However, Ruben's cd has soul, most of his songs are interesting and really show off his voice capabilities. I agree with others that say his voice has improved even more since the show. Clay's album is to slick and overproduced, and all the songs sound the same. I will still buy his next album ( as well as Ruben's) though and hope more of Clay himself comes through. Ruben- congratulations, excellent! My favorites are songs 1-6."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVE IT FROM VERY GOOD SOURCES THAT...","review":"I have it from very good sources that ALL the songs chosen for this CD were RUBENs decision...with the exception of superstar and flying without wings which were included for sales purposes.The J records didn't agree that easily but since Hip hop and Rap are so big right now and a big part of their income they decided to allowed Ruben's wishes.Also, from very good sources, Ruben has always wanted to be a rapper not a choir boy that is why SORRY 2004 is one of his favorites songs AND he gets \\"GIFTS\\" for wearing \\"hip hop\\" clothing wich was expected to sell more if he's cd went platinum.What do I think of the CD...not much...everything sounds the same and the lyrics are quite dumb... I really hope he likes he's choices because I sure don't.Please TRY AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the CD is not what you wanna hear from ruben.","review":"ruben is a very talented man but the CD..........Disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ruben: why do you sing all those rap and hip-hops in the CD? that is not soulful, that is annoying!!!!!most of the song are covers... and ruben does NOT have a unique voice so he didn't do good jobs on the covers.it has only a few original songs, but they are too poorly written that they don't suit Ruben.the first song \\"sorry 2004\\" is so cliche that the melody is totally platitude. it's vulgar, sounds like a black gang member.Ruben was not like this on American Idol!!!!!!!recommend you to download the songs from Kazaa or WinMX..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrrrrrrring!!!!","review":"I'm sorry I bought this cd. Ruben is as boring on this CD as his performances were on AI. He has no range and always sounds like his straining just to try and get through the song. Sorry, Ruben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Indeed","review":"Wow. Has this guy got a voice. At first it seemed a little \\"poppy\\" at times with a few typical cheesy pop beats that are indicative of American Idol bubble gum fluff, but Ruben's voice adds so much depth and class to the music. He could make the Oscar Mayer song sound rich and dreamy. If you like the Luther Vandross style of smooth vocals, this cd is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD PROVES AI WAS FIXED","review":"I listened to this CD in a used CD store....and it only proved one thing to me....that AI fixed the outcome and did Ruben a huge disservice. Ruben deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulful is NOT Soulful","review":"Poor Ruben! He got some bad advice along the way. If you buy this expecting the wonderful songs and the great voice of AI, you will be sadly disappointed. Hip-hop light? COVERS? This CD is a total missmash, an unpleasant missmash at that. I am at a loss to understand what happened. \\"Sorry 2004\\" is too long and very boring which is the best thing I can say about the entire CD. The covers Ruben does are the only songs I could listen to all the way through. I am feeling very sad for Ruben because someone let him down and I find that difficult to understand. This CD took a long time to come to release and it just should have been better. There is just no excuse for his record label to do this to such a talented guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I liked the style of music that Ruben sang on American Idol so much more than the style of music that this C.D. is made up of."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have staye a Luther wannabe","review":"On the strength of his Luther Vandross/Carpenters cover, I bought this cd. I played it, and wondered, who this guy was? This is not the singer we voted for on AI. His style is tottally NOT him. He should have stuck to being a Urban AC singer, instead of vying to become another unknown. This cd does not distinguish him at all. I will most likely sell mine on ebay, for cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suddard must have \\"won\\" AI like Bush was \\"elected\\" president","review":"There's no other way to explain it. Based on sheer talent and effort, Kim Locke deserved to win, with Clay as the runner-up.At its best, Studdard's voice is appallingly mediocre, at its worse, painfully flat and strained. His best performance was his initial audition for the show - it's been all downhill from there, including this dismal album. The songs on Aiken's album may have been bad, but at least Clay can sing...a misguided but undeniably talented Christina to Ruben's inexplicable and atrocious Britney.If you loved Ruben during the show, you might like the album, and probably have it already. Good for you. Different strokes and all that. But otherwise...yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I am very disappointed with Rubens cd, and why so many covers, why duets? Slow and dragged out songs, then you get hip hop songs in there too!!!!!!!!!! AWFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace","review":"What a disgrace for Ruben to do an album like this. I was expecting him to use his voice as an instrument, and instead he used his succes on American Idol to do a terrible rap and hip-hop album. The songs on this album are terrible. I would have expected much, much more from him. He has a great voice and with good song selection he will be very successful. I hope he gets a better manager, because this album is dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly why Ruben never excited me","review":"Just listening to a few seconds of each track (well, not Flying Without Wings - I couldn't tolerate even a few seconds of that again) bored me to no end. Yes, Ruben has a smooth voice, but after a few minutes, everything sounds alike. It's too smooth; there's no passion here. When slow songs and rap and R&B and gospel all sound the same, there's a serious problem.For me, this is a complete dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have they done to you, Rube?","review":"Yuck...this is NOT the music(?) I expected from him. In many ways, it reminds me of my Bassett hound..same eyes and same sounds ... sorta MOANING! I mean..could the lyrics get any S*L*O*W*E*R ? There is no life in these tunes at all! I'm very, very disappointed. Wanna buy mine cheap? I'll be listing it here in the Buy It Used section!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful.....","review":"I was looking forward to Ruben's release. I am disappointed with what I've heard.

This CD was horribly produced as it didn't bring out the talents that Ruben showed last year. Why did the producers hide that talent behind horrible background vocals and music that had no dicernable merit. I sure hope this is not how this young man's career is going to be handled. Let Ruben sing and use that wonder voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"please......NO RUBEN!!!","review":"YES, if the sales of this album are low the only one Ruben can blame is Ruben himself. Ruben wanted to sing RAP and HIP HOP. He didn't want to be a choir boy but a rapper! Yep, as funny as it sounds he says he can handle DA HOOD!Also, from very good sources, J records didn't want him to record rap/hip hop UNTIL his 2nd album and the only reason slow ballads were included in this one are purely for sale purposes the only 100% decision of the producers but even that took a great deal of arguing with Ruben.As for the album, IS NOT WORTH BUYING, not even ON SALE 'cause eventually is going to end up at a thrift store anyway. The lyrics are just plain DUMB. We know he's no player or a thug. RUBEN GIVE IT UP ... YOU ARE A MAMA'S BOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruben, WHAT HAPPENED!!!????","review":"This album is awful! Rolling Stone Magazine gave Rubens cd a 1 out of 5 stars! Seriously! It is true! TERRIBLE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"Idol\\" you're expecting","review":"Overall, I am completely dissatisfied with this album. I think that Ruben had some solid performances on American Idol, but this CD in no way reflects the \\"Idol\\" that American voted. Ruben won the competition by singing Luther Vandross-type songs that suited his voice and personality. However, he completely changes genres on his album, i.e. rap duets with Fat Joe. Ruben has a good voice, but uses it in all the wrong ways. This album is not an accurate reflection of the \\"American Idol\\" America voted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Oh my goodness, I'll be selling this one. It's nothing like I expected. Maybe 3 good tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason why amazon won't let you sample the music","review":"This CD is boring, a true sleeper. Not only that, but Ruben's voice sounds strained in a lot of the songs. They should have put more effort into this one - unless he shows us something better soon, his career is sunk. Amazon wants you to buy it - that's why there are no song samples available to listen to before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Ya Ruben, but 'Soulful' STINKS","review":"I was a huge Idol fan, behind Ruben all the way. Couldn't understand why I was seeing Clay's CD everywhere, but no Ruben. Finally I found it! Boy, I wish I hadn't! This is the worst CD I've bought in years. It's a waste of his talent, with the exception of maybe 1-2 songs. Badly produced/mixed, Ruben sounds like he's off in the background somewhere, while the back-up singers come through loud and clear. The material is short on substance and long on cheap lyrics. Generally, a bunch of chatter. I sincerely hope Ruben will find some better material and go back to the song stylings he is so suited for, and which won American hearts on Idol. If you're expecting this CD to be filled with what you saw on the show, you'll be very disappointed. If you prefer choppy hip-hop to smooth R&B, you may like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD is the Ruben We Know & Love","review":"The American Idol Winner of 2003, Mr. Ruben Studdard, is giving his fans a CD well worth the wait. His silky-smooth voice shines through as always, especially on the songs: \\"How Do You Mend A Broken Heart?\\" and my favorite \\"For All We Know\\" and his gosel-inspired \\"We Have Not Forgotten\\" with Fred Hammond.American got it right when they voted Ruben the winner and his Ruben's CD is an absolute must-have for his fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He should be second","review":"He can't sing nearly as well as Clay and it shows I can't stand the album gave it to a friend.

I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH A FEW OF YOU WHO THINK THIS IS A VENUE TO VENT YOUR PERSONAL ATTACKS UPON THOSE WHO WE THINK ARE DIFFERENT OR JUST DONT AGREE WITH US. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HELP RUBEN AND'M SURE THAT IF HE WOULD READ SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THESE REVIEWS HE WOULD BE UPSET.RUBEN IS A GOOD MAN....AND WE ALL KNOW THAT....I'M A 66YEAR OLD GRANDMA AND I LIVE IN AL.

GOD BLESS"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Purchased the Reuben CD and must say I was SO disappointed. Only a few ballads on the CD.. The rest have a rap beat/sound to them. Although this guy can carry a tune, he didn't do it on his debut. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the American Idol","review":"If you are expecting this album to sound like Ruben from American Idol,, it doesn't. He has completly reinvented himself.He doesn't look the same or sing the same. I thought this album was awful and unlike others who are using these reveiws to bash each other's choice for AI, I didn't vote for anyone. This album is awful, I bought all of the top four CD's from the Idol contestants and I have to honestly say Kelly and Clay's were the best. Ruben can't seem to even hold a note. Maybe the American population should acctually vote for someone who can sing rather than going for someone the judges call by pet names.Very diapointed in this and the voting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The winner gives back to his fans (not)","review":"Studdard has a marvelous voice, this cannot be denied. His voice captivates no matter what genre of music he chooses to sing. However, he runs the risk of alienating his American Idol fans with his hip hop/R&B flavoured Soulful. His fans voted for the Luther Vandross style Velvet Teddy Bear, and are given a cleaner version of a Fat Joe or Ja Rule album with Studdard's Soulful. That isn't to say the album doesn't have its standout tracks - Sorry 2004 is a fresh song concept and Flying Without Wings recalls the VTB's AI days. But two or three tracks catering to his original fanbase won't make Studdard a star. Here's hoping that Studdard's next album is more stirring soul and less dreary attempts at contemporary music."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE CD!!!!","review":"Make up your mind!

(The rest...garbage)The rest, well, they're not pop, not hip-hop, not soul, not ballads, NOT MUSIC we expect from Idol's newest winner Ruben. You can't play it during dinner, can't play it with the kids, can't play it to be romantic...wouldn't even sound good with your top down on the convertible.I'm glad I bought the CD because I support American Idol, but I don't recommend anyone waste their money on this CD. Buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I usually order my CD's online but was in a hurry to hear Rubens album after waiting so long so I was at the store first thing this morning to get my copy.I really liked Ruben on American Idol but was very disapointed In Soulful. I thought most of the songs were slow and boring. I kept wondering is this Ruben? It didn't really sound that much like him, I don't know what I expected but this wasn't it. I had planned on picking up a couple of more for Christmas but I think I will pass on this one.My advice if you can listen to it before you buy it do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor material for a great voice","review":"Ruben's debut album is very disappointing because of the poor musical quality of the original tracks. Most of the songs are poorly written and do not do Ruben justice. He has the potential to be the next Luther, but he needs writers to support his talent. This album just did not cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT JOB--GREAT CD!!!!!!!","review":"I listened to the entire cd and I must say that I am truly very pleased. Ruben's cd \\"Soulful\\" has something for everyone. He has something for both his young and mature audience base. His cd includes R&B; (Sorry 2004, Play Our Song, After the Candles Burn), Gospel (Flying W/O Wings & We Have Not Forgotten w/ Fred Hammond), Ballads (Superstar, For All We Know) as well as hip/hop (What is Sexy feat Fat Joe and Can I get your Attention feat Pretty Tony).As this is his first cd, it really is impressive and showcases his singing abilities and further reiterates that he can sing every type of song no matter what genre.For those individuals who ACTUALLY take the time out to listen to the ENTIRE cd, they will see that he included songs that he sang from American Idol 2 but also included songs that display his R&B; influence.Great CD. Will definitely purchase more copies as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"~~~PHENOMENAL COULDN'T EVEN DESCRIBE!!!~~~","review":"THIS CD IS AMAZING! IT IS THE EPITOME OF BEAUTIFUL!

I love Clay Aikens voice and Clay loves Ruben so even for that reason alone I wanted to like it... but it was freakin impossible!...it was that lame...the lyrics are stupid... \\"the idol with the title\\"...\\"a house with no roof and no doors\\"....he seems to want to make mention of AI in the CD which I think was a big mistake... and he comes off sounding very haughty in several of the tracks...talkin bout girls screamin his name everywhere he goes now... well they scream Clays name even more and throw underwear at him, but you don't hear him gettin all puffed up about it and singin about it do you?....I think singles from this CD will totally bomb on the charts and I doubt that any video from it will ever hit number 1 on MTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruben Soars, Then Bombs.....","review":"Ruben Studdard, America's number one teddy bear icon. Ruben has a very good voice but the songs were badly picked. He attempts to sing older songs which make the album not appeal to the younger audiences. \\"Don't Quit On Me\\" is the absolute best song on his CD. I only listen to this CD for \\"Sorry 2004\\", \\"Play Our Song\\", and \\"Don't Quit On Me\\". The rest of the CD is crap. Save your money and do not buy this unless you are truely a fan of older R&B music."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Soulful\\" Review","review":"I loved both Ruben and Clay on American Idol for different reasons - and their voices and styles are so different that they really complimented each other. After hearing both cd's, I would recommend Clay's \\"Measure of a Man\\". I found so many of the songs on \\"Soulful\\" to be repetitive; that is to say, if I didn't know I was listening to a different song, I wouldn't know it was a different song! With the exception of a couple of songs on this cd, it's not that great. By comparison, with the exception of a couple of songs of Clay's cd, most are great. I realize everyone is different and prefers different styles of music even though I loved something about both 'idols'. But I'm sorry to say, at this time, I prefer Clay's cd. Looking forward to Ruben's next effort though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE CD!","review":"I bought this and do not like it at all. SLOW dragged out songs, then you get a hip hop rap type song! What is this a smorgasbord of awfulness! DO NOT BUY! What a total DISSAPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cryin' Shame","review":"Ruben has such a terrific, no fantastic, voice so its such a shame they (his producers) came out with this as a debut album. This CD does not do him justice, what were they thinking?? I bought this CD very enthusiastically, I listened to it a few times hoping it would grow on me but sorry to say it didn't. I hope that the music industry learns what good \\"real\\" music is, not the produced stuff they try to cram down our throats. Sorry, Ruben, about your CD but you are still a winner in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grammy Nominated Recording Artist and AI2 Winner","review":"This CD was definitely worth the wait. From new songs such as \\"Sorry 2004; What is Sexy; No Ruben\\" to the beautiful covers of Superstar (which Ruben is nominated for a Grammy)and How Do You Mend a Broken Heart, to a beautiful Gospel selection of \\"We Have Not Forgotten\\" this CD has it all. There are ballads and up tempo songs. Beautifully done, well throughout and definitely worth the seven month wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD START!!!","review":"ALL THIS TALK ABOUT A NOMINATION. RUBEN NEEDS A LOT OF LUCK IF HE THINKS HE CAN GET A GRAMMY. THIS ALBUM IS NOT ANYTHING THAT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM RUBEN. HE HAS A GREAT VOICE AND FOR SOME REASON HE LET DOWN A LOT OF HIS FAN.I THOUGHT HE WAS GOOD ON IDOL AND EXPECTED GREAT THINGS FROM HIM.HIS VOICE IS AWESOME AND HE COULD BE DOING SONGS THAT SHOWCASE IT. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH BLUES OR HIP HOP BUT IT ISN'T FOR RUBEN. I DON'T LIKE THIS CD BUT YOU CAN BUY IT AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF."},{"rating":"1","title":"HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!","review":"I FEEL THAT WE WERE CHEATED.THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM RUBEN. RUBEN HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE....WHAT WAS HE THINKING WHEN HE PUT THIS CD TOGETHER? SUCH A BEAUTIFUL..WHAT A WASTE.IF THIS IS HIS BEST I WISH I HAD VOTED FOR SOMEONE ELSE. FOR ALL OF YOU WHO KEEP CALLING US RUBEN HATERS BECAUSE WE DONT LIKE THIS CD ...GROW UP! STOP MAKING EXCUSES..ITS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT THIS CD IS LACKING THE BEST OF RUBEN.. I KNOW RUBEN CAN DO BETTER ..DO YOU? IF YOU'RE WILLING TO EXCEPT THIS AS IS THEN YOU DON'T DESERVE BETTER. I WILL NOT BUY HIS NEXT CD UNLESS HE BRINGS US A CD THAT EQUALS WHAT I HEARD HIM DO ON AMER.IDOL. SO BE IT. A RUBEN HATER? NO. ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION? IF RUBEN SANG THESE SONGS ON AMER. IDOL WOULD HE WIN?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing is the right word for this cd! Although I thought rubens voice was different, he is actually like any other singer on the street. Nothing special about this cd, all this hype and I am just listening to a singer who has no energy or emotion in his songs. Do not recommend this cd at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want Ruben Studdard the winner of American Idol","review":"Boy, I loved Rubens voice on AI, he was really the Velvet Teddy Bear! I picked him to be one of the finalists. He sounded so soulful on the show. The songs he sang were great for his beautiful voice. Now as for his album, Im really hurt, where is that great voice. My favorite song on that cd continues to be Flying without wings, because thats the Ruben I know and love, I had wished he had more songs like that, pure R&B. Ruben, I miss your beautiful voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I should have realized that the American Idol ballads were not going to be on this CD. I love the cover songs, but I am just not into hip/hop. I would love to see a little more of the old style R@B and less hip/hop. Sorry 2004 is okay, but does not live up to the Ruben of American Idol. No Ruben, I heard in concert and it was cute to watch him perform, but I don't care for Rap music. What Is Sexy, oh NO Ruben. I just can't imagine this being Ruben. I hope that in the future, Ruben's beautiful voice will be showcased and not covered up. He is an amazing performer, but this CD is a disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFUL","review":"Shockingly poor effort to promote the latest American Idol winner. I agree with the recent reviewer who said this is NOT the Ruben America came to love.The music on some tracks isn't bad, but the lyrics on the original songs are mostly stupid....simply atrocious at times. Little, if any, warmth by Ruben. Velvet teddy bear? Nope. Not even close.Shame shame on the producers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm....","review":"I watched American Idol and I voted for Ruben a few times. I really love his rich, pleasant voice. But I have to admit that I'm disappointed in this cd. My daughter bought it for me for Christmas because I requested it. Maybe I expected to hear the same Ruben that I heard in the show, but I was very disappointed in the song selections for this cd, except for the Bee Gees song and For All We Know. I like Superstar also. I guess I'm not much of a rap fan, although the rap in the cd is rap-lite. Even his voice seems a little worn and fatigued, I'm disappointed. Better luck, next time, Ruben."},{"rating":"1","title":"snore...makes me sleep","review":"So sorry, but I do not like this Cd. I listened to the whole cd once expecting to find at least a couple of good songs to listen to, but boy was I disappointed! Except for Flying without wings (which is just so-so), the rest of the songs are really wrong choices. I don't know but somehow the way they were sung made me want to sleep...so booooring. Maybe I was expecting too much from this American Idol, but honestly, I like Clay's album better. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just in time.....","review":"If you're looking a good cd to pop into and keep you in that good mood throughout this long winter....Just pop in Soulful....The good mix of uptempo songs and ballads are like music to the soul.....I no longer look at him as an American Idol contest....I look at him as a real artist who's voice will radiate our ears for many years to come......"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"The songs didn't show-case his voice enough. I agree with other reviews that he has a very limited range with his vocals. Clay's debut was definitely more powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Velvet Teddy Bear","review":"I love this album!!! I fell in love with Ruben's voice from the very first moment that I heard it. His voice is very soulful and I just love to hear him sing. I purchased the album the first day that it came out. I've yet to receive it, but I'm able to listen to it through Aol's listening session. I log on every day just to listen. I can't wait to receive my copy. I wish Ruben much continued success and I can't wait to hear his sophomore album and any subsequent releases. He is the true American Idol!!! Many Blessings Ruben!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"204 Scores!","review":"I really liked this CD and I thought it was great! I know that it was not a lot like some of the other songs that Ruben sang on AI but I think Ruben did justice to both genres of music. I think that this might be more the music that Ruben wanted to do. I honestly think that he sang the kind of songs he sang on AI better, I LOVED it when he sang \\"A whole new world\\"!! and I thought that he was the best one to win AI. He is a great singer and he shows us that he can sing all different kinds of music with this CD. I liked the songs, some of them were not his best, and he came out sounding a little self-centered in some of the lyrics but overall this CD gets my 4 * vote, he did great. Ruben is an American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG.....Absolutely Terrible!!!!!","review":"How in the world did Ruben Studdard win over Clay Aiken?????

Listen to the demos of this cd before you buy it...You will be glad you did, and you will save your money!!! I'm glad I did, because I would have brought it back to the store for a refund in a heartbeat.....Just goes to show you that Paula, Randy and especially Simon did not know what they were talking about when they kept boosting Ruben up, and putting Clay down...I hope they are all eating crow right now.....And it just goes to show you they didn't know talent when it was right in front of their faces!!! They blew it big time.....By choosing Ruben and not Clay!!!!Too bad Canada wasn't allowed to vote...Clay would've blew Ruben right out of the water in a major landslide!!!!!!Enough said!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben Is Doing Big Things Now","review":"I Think That Ruben Is doing big things now why they couldn't do all the R&B singers like this cause some do not need to sing But I would like to give up all the props to Ruben and say keep Making CDs Like this one and The Green will keep coming in."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's SOUL people!","review":"Ruben sings soul in modern day's truest sense. Those who don't like it are those who are looking for a pop idol or something similar to what was on American Idol. His roots are in the south and he is a soulful, soulful singer. If you don't like modern soul or R&B, then buy Clay Aikens' music. Ruben is only being true to his roots.This is probably one of the best CDs produced in a very long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Ruben!","review":"Ruben you have out done yourself with this cd! My favorite track is \\"After the Candeles Burn\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"eh?","review":"Ruben took 7 months to come up with THIS? Looks like he hooked up with the wrong folks and needs to get with some other dudes ASAP! He is lucky he got the politically correct votes and won the TV show title, but now he is going to be dethroned soon and will soon be forgotten for good, unless his little buddy Clay lets him keep riding his coattails!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU DON'T WANT IT...GIVE IT TO ME!!!!!","review":"For all of you who think you wasted your money on this cd pleeeaaassseee give it to me!If you have the time to write reviews then you have time to sell your cd right here on amazon!USE IT AS A COASTER?

However, I have to agree with a couple of the other reviewees in saying that the song selection for this album is somewhat puzzling. I understand the idea of mixing things up a little bit, but there is too much contrast here. Tracks like \\"How can you mend a broken heart,\\" and \\"Sorry 2004,\\" are good soulful Ruben tunes, but the rap songs just don't do it for me. It is a starting point for Ruben, but I do expect better things to come in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are You people serious?","review":"Are u serious, I can't believe u people can have a straight face and diss this album. In my opinion, Ruben has DEFINATELY held his own on this debut album. The opening track is just an outstanding way to start off the album, and it sets the pace for the rest of this masterpiece. All of the songs have a great feel to them and (as said in one of the other reviews) you can make love,dance, or just lounge while listening to this one. By the way, who says that hip hop is not soulful music, this IS his culture and background regardless of whether u like it or not. Also, if u cant hear the words, you're probably NOT LISTENING, because if you were, then u would realize that this is GOOD music. This is a must have. Ruben is definately here to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job Ruben!!!!!!","review":"What a great CD. This was without question worth the long wait. Ruben's soulful voice is perfect. His blend of music is also great. This is not for the POP lover, this is for everyone who loves a mix of hip hop, R&B, and soul. Bonus track w/Fred Hammond is also great. Thanks RUBEN ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush job","review":"Like so many others I absolutely love Rubens' voice, but this release is so very dissapointing for an \\"American Idol winner's debut cd.

Though I am a big fan of American Idol, as well as Ruben AND Clay, I have to say that this CD was a disappointment. I was one of those fans who expected something truly great from Ruben, something closer to his perfomances on the show.I didn't get it. I'm sure he wanted to spend more time on it so he could one-up Clay, but it doesn't work. Clay's CD, though monotonous in songs, was worth listening to just to listen to the powerful sounds of his voice. However, Ruben sounds bland and tired-out, and most of the songs are no special treat.This is no way a \\"Ruben\\" review, so you don't need to call me a \\"hater\\" or \\"claymate\\", because this was a \\"music\\" review. In all honesty, Ruben's CD does not measure up, and the only thing more I can say that I hope his next CD will be better. But if you must purchase an AI CD, I strongly recommend that you buy Clay's this time, not because he is better, but simply because his CD is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another CD filed away!","review":"I have listened and now it goes into the file of the CD's I will probably not listen to again.

I was not expecting much from this album, but was very pleasantly surprised. It is a solid contemporary R&B album that includes both slow jams and faster songs that have a more hip-hop edge, and I can honestly say that there is not a single song on the album that I do not like. Also, although I watched most of American Idol 2, I had no idea that Ruben was such a good singer with such a professional sound that is so effortlessly fresh, innovative, and yes, soulful. With this album, Ruben has clearly positioned himself as a force to be reckoned with in the music world for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TRUE AMERICAN IDOL!","review":"YES HE REPRESENTS FOR US ALL!

However, this was the case with this CD, Soulful, by Ruben Studdard. The thing sounds like someone put the same mid-tempo sample behind Ruben as he sang each tune. How terrible is that! Not to mention, Ruben simply doesn't have the full capabilities of his voice at hand throughout this album. I think Ruben has some talent, but I think more energy was used in creating Clay Aiken's album....even though both of them are equally sad. Why are the American people so eager to act like a flock of headless sheep and listen to this tripe? Have we gotten to the place that we will accept anything (or anyone) the media thinks is \\"good\\"? Granted, Mr. Studdard has some talent...but he needs to leave the American Idol thing behind...along with the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Cannot understand a word this man sings, can hear every breath he takes totally disappointed in this cd.

It was because I genuinely enjoyed listening to BOTH of them on American Idol and believed that their CDs would also be enjoyable. Well, I now can say that I still enjoy Clay's voice and his CD. It's lively and upbeat, but Ruben's is BLAH, and actually BORING! Yes, it's just my opinion, but for what it's worth, \\"Soulful\\" is just \\"Soul-LESS\\"----and less, and less. Not worth the price of admission, folks, unless perhaps you buy it from the \\"Used\\" market for only half the original price---or \\"LESS\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and monotonous","review":"What in the world is this album? The songs all sound the same, and Ruben sounds tired. When I saw him on Letterman, he about put me to sleep with his boring song. Half of the songs you can't even understand what he's saying!! This is not the same Ruben that was on American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I cannot believe they shipped this out as the final product! Ruben is out of breath on half of the songs? Sorry, I voted for him and definatly sorry I paid money for this worthless album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing !!!!!!!!","review":"It's depressing to hear \\"Sorry\\" so many times in the song. I got bored in the middle and lost interest listening. Ruben may have a nice voice, but it gets boring towards the end as most of I just can't understand how Ruben got nominated for the grammy award! There are a lot more singers that deserve to be nominated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but just not for me","review":"This album just doesn't do it for me. It sounds like one long song. If I wanted to listen to the same thing for that length of time , I would hit the repeat button. I like more variety on my albums. Ruben sounds great and did a good job. It's just a little too much \\"mellow\\" for me. I prefer some excitement mixed in. It's a great effort and I'm sure it will do well. It's just not for me. I hope on his next album, Ruben will step up the pace a little and add a few more upbeat songs. Good Luck to Ruben!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE, MAKE IT STOP!

I've sat here and read most of the reviews posted, and truthfully, I tend to agree with both sides.First, if I were a betting man, I'd bet that most people who rated this album bad are not fans of hip/hop and R&B music to begin with, so of course this is going to disappoint.Second, don't get me wrong, I do think that his vocals left a lot to be desired on some of the tracks on this album. But at the end of the day, can I sit and listen to the album? ABSOLUTELY!! I have listened to it non-stop since I got it. Everytime I listen to it, I hear something new (both good and bad), but I keep listening, and I will keep on listening to it.Let's rate the CD for what it is: a blend of contemporary R&B and hip-hop, and as that, it scores big with me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a long wait for a dissapointment","review":"I don't know if it was as long as it took for this album to be released, but I guess I expected more from the AI winner.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CD YOU ARE CALLED A RUBEN HATER,DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE RUBEN WON AND HE IS BLACK OR YOU ARE A CLAY MATE AND YOU ARE GIVING THIS CD 1 STAR SO RUBEN WON'T SELL MANY CDS AND....IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CD YOU SHOULD STAY OFF THIS SITE BECAUSE ITS RUBENS. IS THAT REALY WHAT THIS REVIEW SITE IS FOR? I MAY BE OLD...... BUT OLD DON'T MAKE ME STUPID.COME ON PEOPLE. IS THIS WHAT RUBEN WOULD WANT? THIS IS NOT A GOOD CD. I AGREE WITH THE PERSON FROM FOLEY AL.BAD ADVICE.RUBEN HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.I THINK HE DESERVES BETTER AND I HOPE THAT HE GETS ANOTHER CHANCE TO PROVE HIS WORTH.HE NEEDS TO TALK TO RANDY JACKSON TO GET FRESH IDEAS AND BOOT THE ONES WHO WON'T LISTEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for 2 songs i really like","review":"I am one of rubens biggest fans so needless to say I was not happy with just liking 2 of the songs on his CD. When a singer does a \\"re-do\\" of a song that has been very popular in the past, you have to at least do it better or what is the point.I am refering to \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" for one. Unfortunately, \\"Flying Without Wings\\" is one of the 2 I still enjoy so much. I wish Ruben the best and hopefully his next CD will reach his potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sorry!","review":"I am so sorry i can't give a good rating for this CD. I just loved you on AM2 and thought you were the stand out of the group. But, this album is typical, not special like you promised. I will probably still buy this CD because i want to support you. I will look forward to the next CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Ruben, Indeed","review":"Don't waste your money-unless you want an expensive coaster! This is one of the worst compilations of eighth grade level lyrics, monotonous, syntehsized beats and flat, out-of-breath singing that I have ever heard! Soulful? I don't think so. The Father of Soul (Sam Cooke) would be turning over in his grave if he heard this. This artist is nothing more than an imitator, and a mediocre one at that. No distinctive voice, in fact I can't distinguish his from the guest artists on several tracks. Same schlock that is polluting the airwaves of today and causing CD sales to plummet. And to anyone who thinks that a Grammy nomination here is anything more than American Idol trying to make their artists believable, contact me-I have some land for sale in Florida! Notice that both season winners got nods! I'd rather stick steel spikes in my eyes than listen to this CD again. No Ruben, indeed. Prophetic title. Someone, anyone, please take away his microphone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GO RUBEN!","review":"When I heard you sing GO RUBEN at a concert I wanted just that. Who talked you into that song?

F"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycle it","review":"Ruben can sing but not on this CD. I've listened to it once and that will be the one and only time. I'd give it no stars; he can do so much better. Ruben should stick with the Luther Vandross/Barry White type of songs that really showcase his voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our American Idol (NOT)","review":"If your not sure about buying this \\"PLEASE THINK AGAIN\\" In my opinion don't waste your money. If your a fan of Ruben's and you thought he did awesome in American Idol then you will like it. I'm a 100% Clay Aiken fan. Clay in my opinion is going to blow Ruben away. All I can say is Thank God they are friends. It's not worth fighting over. They both have talent. Good luck to you both."},{"rating":"1","title":"IDOLS and child abusers should not mix !!","review":"So Ruben is the American IDOL? I don't think so ! An idol should be someone that folks (especially children) can look up to and admire. Instead we have Ruben selling out and collaborating with R. Kelly, the same R. Kelly who was video- taped sexually abusing a young girl. Is this who an IDOL should be associating with? I think not. I will not buy this CD, not because of Ruben, but because of his association with a child molester. I can not support anything that causes money to be placed into the hands of those who violate young girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a Ruben fan but this CD does not do justice to this man's talent. Too much hip-hop and not enough of the soulful ballads that compliment his voice.Not every cut is a disappointment. I did enjoy 'Sorry 2004' and 'How can you mend a Broken Heart'. These are the type of songs he needs to stick with. Ruben, I love you but you have to go for the mature listener rather than your peers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rooting for Ruben...","review":"I recently purchased this CD over the holidays and have enjoyed what I've heard so far. He is new and finding is way in music. I trust that with time and experience he will become a solid and strong entertainer - just like fine wine...So, to those who write to critize and condemn, if you don't like what you're hearing - then simply turn off your radio and don't listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The cd doesn't deserve such bad reviews","review":"There are a lot of people putting bull**** reviews on here about this cd. It's actually a solid effort. I give it 3 1/2 stars. There's always room for improvement. If you like r@b and hip hop go get the cd, but if you like that pop s*** go get Clay's cd. There are a lot of bitter Clay fans out there who just can't get over him not winning so they come here and write ignorant s*** and most of them probably haven't even heard Ruben's cd. Get over it! The best man won. It's pretty dumb when people say the only reason Ruben won is because AI needed to prove they aren't racist. He won because he can sing. Race had nothing to do with it. Don't put trashy reviews on here just because you don't like the type of music he chose to sing. And lets not kid ourselves people. Racism STILL exists and it ALWAYS will because there's always gonna be IGNORANT a** people in Amerikkka who refuse to change their views and realize that all races are beautiful and created equally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul-Less","review":"All I can say is that this was a true dissapointment!!! There are a lot of long wavering runs in his songs (that are often flat by the way) and no real true show of power, soul and talent. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! What a shame!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This is not anywhere near what Ruben is capable of! Once again, people he trusted to guide him let him down. I hope Luther doesn't hear this CD, I am sure he would be as disappointed as I am. Thank GOD there are 2 songs I will listen to and not have to sell it cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start for Rubin!","review":"I love this cd overall. The beats are tight and the vocals are tremendous. Rubin picked great producers to help him out with his debut.My favorites are \\"Sorry 2004\\", \\"What is sexy\\" and \\"What if\\". The duet with Fred Hammond is also a radio friendly gospel toon. Rubin is definetly on the road to a very successful career. God bless you Rubin Studdard and keep the faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first effort","review":"I think the album has a good mix. Ruben has a great voice and it shows in some of the tracks. Liked the ballads the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album","review":"I rushed out to buy the cd as soon as it came out and I am not disappointed.The cd has a variety of music styles that are catchy and (thankfully) not as flimsy and overproduced as the album of last year's winner of American Idol. Also, some of the songs do not sound like the Ruben we've grown accustomed to hearing on the show, but that's not a bad thing. Rather, it shows that he has more depth than he was able to display on American Idol.This album should appeal to all age groups including \\"old schoolers\\" who will love the remake of \\"How Do You Mend a Broken Heart.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"I liked Ruben more than Clay (although I thought both were very talented). Clay's CD blows Ruben's away. It sounded like Ruben needed to clear his throat all the time. He doesn't have the power or range that Clay has. This CD has made me a Clay fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Indeed","review":"Finally, the Grammy award nominated American Idol has made his arrival, and what an arrival it is! This is an awesome R&B album with some Hip Hop Flava. It has great beats along with Ruben's velvety smooth voice. R&B fans will thoroughly enjoy it, but some of the \\"typical\\" cheese-loving American Idol viewers might not. As for the Clayborgs, they'll criticize anything and everything that Ruben puts out, so just ignore them. That Green-eyed monster is huge!Congrats on your Grammy nomination Ruben!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LMAO","review":"Ahahaha, i saw this fool on tv last night. He's so useless. This guy can sing, granted, but doesn't have anything else. There's nothing going through the guy's head. He's stuck on something, god knows what. His songs are really cliche and overproduced. He will appeal to the \\"Owww he's so cute because he bought his girl a house\\"-type girls. Avoid this album, and honor your brains.Oh, and by the way looks like he could use some of that \\"Trimspa\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Soulful","review":"Didn't like...

Clay Aiken is the man with the voice!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Ruben Basher's Reviews","review":"It's really shameful that so many Clay supporters came on here to bash Ruben's cd. The songs are good, much better than most of the disposable R&B out on the market right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruben sold out to sell records","review":"I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. Ruben has a beautiful voice. He studied opera. Why would he want to present himself in such a vulgar way? He made some good song choices on AI. They showcased his voice beautifully. Why these choices? It's a shame he isn't being true to his enormous talent. It's obvious he has sold out to sell records."},{"rating":"1","title":"KING OF SOUL???","review":"TONIGHT ON AMER.IDOL3 RUBEN SANG..HE STILL ISN'T AS GOOD AS HE WAS ON IDOL2.

He would be great at weddings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disspointment","review":"when people think of Ruben they see three words: Talented, Calm, and American Idol. After this cd they will be screaming three others: STOP STOP STOP! Absoultely unenergetic, not at all what should be expected from someone who recived 11 million votes. It shows that once the image of a big, cool, fun guy dies down, there is nothing left but dry singer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed when I heard some of the songs on this cd. Without Wings is the best song. I noticed on one of the reviews that if you like Luther Vandross you'll like this cd. I think not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Maybe his next cd will be better. I will not be buying this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I enjoyed hearing both Rubin & Clay on American Idol.

Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED????","review":"I really liked Ruben on American Idol, I voted for him! I am so DISAPPOINTED with this CD! Many songs are super sloooooooooooooooow and quite a few covers too! WHY? You have a sloooooooow song then it goes to a HIP-HOP song!! UGH, and WHY are there other people singing on this cd! I thought this was supposed to be a solo cd, not one with a lot of COLLABORATIONS! I am so upset, very DISAPPOINTED, was expecting so much more from Ruben! I DO NOT recommend this cd to you, it could have been so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This cd is absolutely horrible, I would have expected better from Ruben...it's not original and it is what everyone else is doing right now-that kind of soulful music...they was he does it is not very good, it appears his big ego is getting the worst of him..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer away from Rap!!","review":"Ruben-Your voice is better than this rap-hip hop stuff. I think if you stay on this path, it'll be a disaster for you. I've listened to the samples and saw you perform \\"Sorry 2004\\" and I have to say there is nothing distinctive about your voice on these tracks. I can't hardly tell you from the background singers. Your cover songs aren't that good, you have a tendency to drag out a note/song. It reminds me of AI2, certain songs you sang, I was falling asleep. I'm not going to compare you to Clay, however I feel you should follow his example of staying true to yourself. Knowing your voice, what type of music is best suited to bring out the best in your voice. If you insist on doing rap/hip-hop I think you'll become a little fish in a big sea of better artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the words of Simon \\"I don't mean to be rude but........\\"","review":"I'm sorry, but this album SUCKS!!!I really love Clay Aiken, so because Clay likes Ruben so much, I decided to give Ruben a shot.

There is NOTHING wrong with Ruben. He has an AWESOME voice!But the song selection is just......horrible!!!!He is litterally straining to sing some of these songs.He just seems so manufactured. Clay on the other hand is really real about everything.Sorry but I'd reccommed Clays Album over this one ANYDAY! Luv ya Ruben but terrible CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulful........Not!","review":"I really enjoyed listening to Ruben on Idol, and was looking forward to his new release. What a disappointment. Sounds like R Kelly Studdard. RnB to the max. There was only one or two songs that were decent enough to keep the cd for, but it's not worth the money. It's albums like these that make illegal downloading continue to prosper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweaty guy sings of sex and love","review":"PUH-LEEEEZE!

I've only heard two songs on it, but that's enough for me.When I heard \\"Sorry 2004\\" me AND both my parents (My mom actually used to like Ruben) agreed that the song was boring, and I think it could've been written better.But the biggest turn-off for me was \\"What Is Sexy\\". I listened to a clip of that song and was in shock. If Ruben would produce a song like that now, think of what he might be singing later...I would not recommend this CD unless you're a die-hard Ruben Studdard fan who'd buy anything he came out with.P.S. Sorry if I offended any Ruben Studdard fans, but it's really a waste of time to type a review just to say that I'm wrong, so please don't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fat man has potential but...","review":"The music is pretty lame, his voice goes out of tune once in a while, and the lyrics.

Just download a few songs off this if you want and go buy a Killing Joke cd instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an American Idol!","review":"First the voice on this CD sounds nothing like him. It's amazing what a recording studio can do to improve a not so perfect voice. There were only a couple of songs I thought were decent. The rest are hip hop crap. His voice is for ballads... he should stick with those for his next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The smoothness of Ruben's voice on American Idol is not even in the least, repeated on Soulful. His new style of singing is disappointing. For winning the AI title as being a Luther Vandross type sultry singer, he has a different style on Soulful such as singing duets with \\"Fat Joe.\\" The duets with rappers were totally unexpected and very ill-received by me. He has lost almost all of his deep, loving voice we heard so much of on AI.I would not recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISASTER!!!!!!!!","review":"This CD is absolutely terrible. I listened to it riding in a car with a friend. Oh, what a disaster. Stay away....stay away. Studdard will not last mark my words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruben is capable of better","review":"I knew this CD wouldn't be the typical ballads that Ruben sang on AI2, but I did expect more than these boring, generic sounding songs. 'Sorry 2004' may be the current single, but it's extremely monotonous. 'Play Our Song' and 'Don't Quit On Me' sound nearly identical to each other. His best work is the last song on the CD 'We Have Not Forgotten'.Ruben has a good voice, but he obviously chose to go the safe route and just sing styles that are currently popular, rather than showcase his talent. He also seems to almost get buried among the vocals of the other artists accompanying him in many of the songs. I hope he learns from this, and that his next CD will show improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed- Lack of R&B","review":"I consider myself average in age (36) and pretty diverse when it comes to music. I loved Ruben's voice on American Idol, adored his R&B sound.I expected his Debut CD to showcase his voice as he did on American Idol. However, I was very disappointed as to the absence of the R&B on this CD and instead was replaced with Hip Hop. Had Ruben of done Hip Hop on American Idol, he wouldn't have gotten my votes.I wanted on his CD what I voted for on American Idol.I am sadly disappointed.Folks, if you think this CD will be songs similar to the ones Rue sung on American Idol....think again. There is Hip Hop/ Rap on it that may disappoint you- I hear no Velvet Teddy Bear. I do hear a Rapping Grizzly Bear, though!What a disappointment that he forgot us fans who voted for his Smooth R&B sound. He sold us out to the younger Hip Hop teens :-(Yes there are 2 R&B songs on the CD which are \\"Flying Without Wings\\" and \\"Superstar\\" but we've been hearing those for months...nothing new there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"This album was a total waste of money- every song was identical and was totally boring- I do not think Ruben has any staying power whatsoever in the music industry- if he ever does release a second album it will do terrbily- just because he was the american idol does not guarntee good music, and just because you lose american idol doesn't mean there is no success- just look at Clay Aiken- he is totally what America needs right now and who really cares if Ruben shipped platinum because Clay is up to triple right now. Ruben may have won that battle but there is no way he will win the way in the music industry if he continues to put out garbage like this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did buy the CD to support you, but...","review":"I'm disappointed Rube !! You are a balladeer, not a hip-hop star. Your voice was strained and rushed through all the hip-hop sounding stuff, and not as strong on the ballads. Stick to what got you to this point; smooth ballads that showcase your voice instead of the crap that makes you sound like you're gasping for breath. Love ya Rube !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparing","review":"This is in response to the person who said comparing Clay and Ruben is like comparing Alicia Keys and Faith Hill. Yes, they cater to different audiences, but I will not turn off the radio if either Alicia or Faith are on. After listening to Ruben's CD, I would turn it off or turn the station. Sorry. Ruben has an excellent voice but it certainly isn't evident on this CD. I agree, it's his first try and I hope he has an opportunity to do another. I don't expect him to be like \\"Idol Ruben\\" but I sure expected him to sing something with a little substance. What I hear is the background vocals and music and Ruben saying \\"oh yeah, yeah, yeah\\" a few times?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Like a Church Singer","review":"Ruben was on AI which came down to 3 singers. I believe ruben has gone away from what he was voted on and has come out with a more rap/hip hop album which is not to my liking. Sorry ruben your cd is sorry and I am sorry I voted for you. Your not the man I thought you were, you sold yourself to the highest bidder. I personally would not recommend this cd but you need to listen to a few sample songs yourself. Very disappointed from an ex fan in NY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TAKE ME AWAY TO ANOTHER LAND!","review":"Ruben Studdard the sinking american idol who can't carry a cd by himself. Please these songs do not reflect who he is. First he says he sings like Luther Vandross, NOT, then he says he sings like other stars NOT, who is ruben studdard? A failing American Idol sinking fast. This cd SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry","review":"I was hoping you would put this Clay stuff to rest, but not with this CD. Maybe next time, Ruben. It is (with the exception of the 2 sig. songs) slow. When you draw out notes you lose power. When you sing a song that has been a hit before you have to do it justice, you did not. I am taking it back and getting Outkast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Reuben we loved on Idol!","review":"When his CD was released, I went and bought it for a Christmas gift for my husband...both of us are fans. We are VERY disappointed. We had it on while playing cards thinking it would be nice \\"background\\" music to listen to...sort of mainstream, Luther V meets Barry White kind of stuff. But NOT. It's all over the place and very stylized. It's just not the velvet teddy bear we loved on idol. It's like he appealed to tons of fans on the show...then he went totally off the beaten path with his CD. I'm a Clay fan too, and I must say, Clay's CD is much more across-the-board appealing and fun to listen to. We haven't listened to Rueben again since."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Ruben I know...","review":"I have to say I was really disappointed with this album. The songs Ruben chooses to sing are nothing like the songs he sang when he adopted and embraced the Luther-Vandross-like persona on American Idol. He seems to have turned his back on what got him to this point in his career. It's a shame that he is wasting his voice on songs like \\"Sorry 2004\\"...after buying this CD, I'm the one who's sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry 2004 is right on","review":"Reuben should be sorry about this sorry CD. I listened to the sample music before I bought he CD and I'm glad I did. I will not waste my money on this sorry CD. Reuben is almost a Johnny one note singer - although I think he could do a little better on his next album - if there is one. I won't go into the whole AI thing as it is over now, and we know who came out on top!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Sampler","review":"I never watched American Idol, but it seems like I missed something. I borrowed this CD to listen to because I was curious about whether these guys were any good. I certainly couldn't buy it based on these reviews, which are obviously biased. If you like the winner, then you don't like this guy, and vice versa.The problem I have with this album is that it is all over the place--R&B, Hip-Hop, Gospel. Is this a sampler? Is he trying to find himself, or just trying to please everybody? In any case, the songs are just average, sometimes not even average. I don't understand the hype.I won't be buying this one. Don't feel bad fans. I won't be buying the other guy's either. Maybe their next albums will be more seasoned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Fan from Chicago","review":"I enjoyed Ruben's voice on American Idol on occasion (until what he was singing started to sound the same from week to week.) I gave a thorough listen of Soulful twice and came to the same conclusion both times - very boring and very bad hip-hop. Ruben wanted to spend more time on this CD to put out a quality product. Why so many covers? Why so many collaborations? No Ruben was nothing but boring and self-promoting. I don't think Ruben has the right vocals for How Can You Mend A Broken Heart - just did not do the song the justice it deserves. The majority of the CD had the same old boring beats you already hear in the music world. Very disappointed in the choice made for this CD and based on what I listened, I will not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Velvet Tiddleywinks","review":"Ruben seems like a SUPERNICE guy with IMMENSE talent. But after listening to these tracks, I think somebody dropped the ball for him. I think his voice wasn't showcased in most of these songs. \\"For All We Know\\" is really good. And I like \\"What If.\\" But for the most part, Ruben seems to be trying SO hard that he sounds kinda \\"flat.\\" I don't see too many hits coming from this album unless there are a score of remixes being worked on. I am very disappointed. I waited for this album so long... I thought it would be exceptional. Better luck next album, Roob."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Your American Idol***!!!!!!","review":"Thank you America you have truly picked the right man!

By buying the cd you have already given him your money and you're making his sales go up every time. So either way you have lost, yet again! He deserves respect and should not be hated on just because of this competition. This CD is very good and I love every song on it. This is not another pop artist cd. He is an R&B \\"Soulful\\" singer, and didn't change his music or image to please pop culture. He is what he is. REAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Ruben's NEW ALBUM instead!!","review":"Ruben Studdard's freschman album, Soulful, is a huge dissapointment, especially with painfully hokey ballads like Sorry 2004. BUT that doesn't mean that the big guy doesn't have a lot of tallent! His new album I NEED AN ANGEL is excellent! So if you're a Ruben fan, be sure not to be biased my his horrible debut album, and pick up his sophmore album I Need an Angel! Plus if you're a fan of American Idol (or not) i would also reccomend Blue Skies, by Diana DeGarmo (she has an amazing voice)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soulful...pitiful","review":"This CD is the biggest waste of money ever. It just makes it more apparent that Ruben didn't win based on any musical merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD - DONT LISTEN TO THE RUDE COMMENTS","review":"Ruben Stoddard's Cd is full of vibrant tunes that will set any mood. He has the \\"soulful\\" voice that helps build this cd into the masterpiece it is.... Soulful is a must for a cd collection. Those that love good music with uptempo beats, slow beats , and some new flavor for the 03' this is for you. The entire cd is awesome... from beg. to end Ruben has proved to me that he is \\" An American Idol\\". The way that he carries himself, the way he puts emotion into the words he is singing is a wonderful experience. I am very happy with this cd, and i suggest you check it out for yourself ... don't go by my comments or anyone elses comments ... check it for yourself.. Music can be interpreted a number of ways ... but in order to fully comprehend the music .. you must not only listen to the song but listen to the words ... My review is that this cd is worth the 15.00 and will not disappoint you ... Soulful is what this cd is!!! 5 STARS"},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY 2004 IS A SORRY CD!","review":"the velvet teddy bear is losing his fur. This cd is great if you want something that will put you to sleep. Very disappointed and that What if song and what is sexy well can I say flop? Ruben needs new material or at least not justin guarinis left overs of sorry. Please lets move on to someone that can really sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruben Studdard fails to impress me.","review":"Ruben Studdard's debut album is the worst album from contestant in American Idol. His vocal ablity stands far below from Kelly's and Clay's. Sure he has a warm and souful voice, but a lot of the other finalist from AI did as well. I think the Idol winner should have a big voice that stands out and he does not. His album is one dimentional, all songs are R&B and nothing else. I doubt that he will have a long lasting career. Sure a lot of people bought his album but they did not know how it was going to be before they bought it. And I doubt they will buy his next album for it is only his personality and his calories and fat that carried him this far."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RECOMMENDED","review":"THIS IS YET ANOTHER BORING R&B CD WHICH YOU FIND IN THE RECORD STORES. THERE IS NOTHING SPECIALON THIS CD SO I WONT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. ONE STAR ONLY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay should have one","review":"I'm sorry Ruben, you have a good voice, and a few good songs, but you're just not as good as Clay Aiken.I think they counted up the votes wrong or SOMETHING, because it seems like everyone is going against Ruben and more to Clay. Face it, he really is better. Especially if you compare this album to Measure of a Man from Clay Aiken.I could never imagine humming or singing one of the songs on this CD. Maybe this is just my opinion, but i'll know people are agreeing with me if i see 'yes this review helped me'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and non-musical","review":"I really wanted to like this CD but frankly I was shocked by how horrible it is. I have given it to my 9 year old who seems to be more the target audience. Drivel. Poorly sung. Lacking energy and frankly never to be listened to again. On the other hand, we have Clay who has certainly shown who the better singer is. And we have Ryan Malcolm who has put together a really terrific CD. Ruben, who I really wanted to see succeed will fade into obscurity before the end of 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so Sorry!","review":"Another AI failure, please this whole cd was based on the concept of hip hop which it is but come on this man is no Luther Vandross. As much as he wants to be a Luther hes not. Typical singer you can find in any church. I do not recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Music Fan...","review":"This is definately NOT what I was expecting. I think the album would've been a LOT better if he stuck with POP like on American Idol. I also don't appreciate how people are giving this album 5 stars JUST because he WON American Idol. Don't listen to them the album is NOT worth the money. Give it to charity or something. Anything would be better than spending it on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is not what I expected from RUUUBEN!! I enjoyed his smooth R&B on American Idol but most of this album is a mish- mash of hip-hop and rap. With guys like Chingy, B2K and Outkast there, why would you buy this? I'll stick with the movers and shakers from now on. Sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"very disappointed, to many deep breaths, sounds like ruben can't breath, also not the type of songs he sang on AI. He didn't stick with what he knows best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben is NOT Clay, let's get that straight","review":"Now that I got your attention! Its funny how people are trying to lump them together. Its like apples and oranges, R&B; and pop/balladeer, they ain't the same!Now for my review, on the whole, the CD is good, some songs I love, some I like but there are a couple, I'm not sure about. My favorites being \\"Sorry 2004\\", \\"What is Sexy\\", \\"Superstar\\" (of course). \\"Take the Shot\\" had to grow on me but its on the like list. I was disappointed that there was no earth-shattering song sung that I know Ruben is capable of. I played it for my sister and she made a valid observation that his singing reminded you of Gerald LeVert. I highly recommend for R&B; fans, its worth the price and will be play several times in my house!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Close your mouth!","review":"Why, oh why, does Ruben always have his mouth open in pictures. Is it because he is hungry, hoping a fly might land in there, or is he belting out music that sounds good but says nothing. My guess would be the latter. Maybe if he wrote his own songs, something that came from the heart, he would sound like he means it. On this album (ironically called Soulful) it is obvious that he hasn't had enough life experience to have a developed soul. Experience with the buffet at Sizzler doesn't count. To be a mucisian you first and formost must have something to say. Here, people try to put words in the big guys mouth but it comes off as if he's never experienced the things he sings about. My advice: live a little, write your own songs from the heart, then use your voice to show people where you're coming from. This album is just sad. If you're over 14, steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"The tracks are just not what I expected. Very cookie cutter, same old, same old. I was hoping for better. Quite a few cover songs, which was disappointing, especially Superstar. Karen Carpenter must be rolling in her grave. The BeeGees cover is just average. As a trained vocalist, I was disappointed to hear the Ruben doesn't hold a note for it's duration without jumping on the chord around it. Nothing really sticks out as exceptional. Better luck next time, Ruben."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBEN 2 or 3 stars","review":"I believe Ruben has a great voice but some of the songs I found not my style in music and I would just breeze right by them. Ruben should do more songs that are slow and some upbeat, but I expected more from him since he is the American Idol. I am sure in whatever style music he goes into he will do fine. I do not compare him to Clay they are totally two different people that is why they get along soo well and sing well together. I think when Ruben comes out with his next Cd he will go more into Luther Vandross style ( I am hoping). That is they way I like him the best slow and soft. Good Luck I wish him the Best,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh No Ruben","review":"I liked only 3 songs on the CD. I enjoyed Ruben and voted on the show and this CD is not what we expected. Stick with R and B Ruben. I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful","review":"I think this CD is the best of Rhythem and Blues today. Hey, what the heck, it's the best music of the day. I really love how Ruben mixed hip-hop with R and B,it's really working for him. The best tracks are what is sexy and can I get your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOULFUL","review":"I loved the album. I loved some songs & liked others. Sorry 2004 ****** is a great start. I also loved How Can You Mend A broken Heart *****, For All We Know*****,Superstar*****,What If*****,Flying Without Wings*****,Take The Shot*****,What Is Sexy****,Playing our song****. I liked Can I get Your Attention***, After The Candles Burn***,We Have Not Forgotten***,Don't Quit On Me***. The stars* represent how much I love/like each song. It was hard for me not to rate this album a 5 star CD. But it's still worth every cent and more. It's a good piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Justice!!!","review":"Ruben has an excellent voice, however this CD does not do justice to his voice. Not only are most, if not all, of the songs boring and monotonous, they also have the most unintelligent and mundane lyrics I have heard in a long time. Most of the songs sounded as though they were cheap rip offs of popular R&B hits whose main purpose was to attempt to fit in with whats in at the moment instead of focusing on what could be in if Ruben developed his own style. I was strongly disapointed in the fact that this CD didn't showcase Ruben's versatile voice. Ruben has a lot of talent, but if you never watched American Idol you would never be able to figure that out by only listening to this CD. Although I am disapointed in the material on this album, I can look forward to an imrovment in Ruben's next CD. Lets just call this CD a learning experience for Ruben."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reuben get a new manager - recording contract FAST","review":"Loved the american idol \\"Reuben\\" and awaited his CD and ordered it in advance...... So Sorry Reuben but it is very disappointing and I know he has so much more to give.... definitely wrong songs; wrong back up; wrong management..... Save yourself Reuben, get whoever Clay Aiken got ... and he is not as good as you Reuben but his CD is much superior... Sorry^pre"},{"rating":"1","title":"focus on the ballads","review":"They marketed and produced him so poorly. Ruben's talents and market strengths are in ballads. If he get a chance again he should focus on some Peabo Bryson and Luther Vandross songs.(join the Brian Mcknights, kenny Lattimores etc.) as much as he spoke in interviews about doing his own thing he surely and obviously let the studios pimp him, but no one is buying it. Just like the average so called ganster rapper models and formulas they use. You heard one you heard them all. Hey whats going on with Johnny Gill now he has talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me a headache - so disappointed","review":"I gave the CD 2 stars only because, in my opinion, it has a few redeeming tracks, namely, Sorry 2004, How Can you Mend a Broken Heart, Superstar and Flying Without Wings. Only there did I hear the Reuben I had admired on AI... The other tracks literally gave me a headache. Not only were these other tracks filled with annoyingly repetitious dragging beats and insipid lyrics, but Reuben's voice often sounded raspy and strained...like finger nails on a chalk board. If I have to listen to another \\"Oh baaaaaby\\" or \\"Oh yeaaaaah\\" I will go nuts. I had originally intended to purchase an additional CD for my niece who is a huge Reuben fan, but I don't want her to be disappointed.Please Ruben, will you choose better material for your next CD? You are capable of so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Stone Got It Right!!!","review":"Thank you Rolling Stone for giving Ruben's CD the 1 star rating that it truly deserves!!!...As a product, this CD sucks 100%...Anyone that thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves...Ruben fan or not (I WAS a fan)...just admit that you threw your money away on this dreadful waste of recording studio time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style at all","review":"After hearing Ruben on American Idol this past spring, I was really looking forward to hearing both clays and his albums. After listening to soulful, I dont know how to explain it but the music just didnt do for me. It is like he didnt put any feeling into his sininging. He just sang the songs as they were suppose to. I thought it was a drag, and I really do feel sorry for 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNIMPRESSIVE!!!!!","review":"Very disappointed in Rubens Album and I am sad to say I voted for him!

TERRIBLE cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Clay vs. Ruben","review":"I found this cd \\"okay.\\" If it hadn't been Ruben, I would have placed it in the range of the average cds I can walk past without purchasing. Is he just a little flat sometimes?Not a big fan of the Idol show, I purchased both Ruben's cd and Clay Aiken's on a whim. I must say that I can't understand how the former got a grammy nod while the latter did not. Aiken seems to have something new and special. That voice.... Haven't heard one like that for a long time. His cds will continue to go in my cart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Breath you Take","review":"Every Breath Ruben Studdard takes hes gasping for air. This cd is the sorriest I have ever heard. I do not recommend this cd at all unless you need it to put you to sleep. I might recommend Kelly clarksons cd Thankful which is energetic and fun to listen to. That will keep you awake and happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am SORRY 2","review":"Ruben says it all in track #1. SORRY. Yes I am sorry he made fans wait so long for his CD. SOrry that only 5 of the songs are worth listening to. Sorry that stores do not take back CDS that have been opened. Sorry that I did not take the hint from Amazon.com, . Ruben SHOULD be sorry, because he has lost a dedicated fan. Also I will watch the next American Idol- though it is doubtful that I will take the time to rush out to the stores, and stand in line, and pay TOP DOLLAR to buy the next winner's CD. SORRY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I return this AWFUL CD!!!???","review":"Rubens cd is terrible, I got it for a gift! This music, my ears just do not like! Slow songs then hip hop songs! UGH, wish I could return it but the plastic is off, darnit, do not waste your money, and please, do not buy this and give as a gift, terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Ruben his props!","review":"Stop hatin' on Ruben because he didn't stick to the \\"formula\\" that made you vote him the American Idol! Also, don't hate just because you are not a fan of R&B or hip hop. I don't listen to country but I know good country music when I hear it. Ruben is worthy of the American Idol title and he proves it on this CD! And if R&B is not your style, don't buy the CD and don't criticize something you know nothing about! Go Ruben!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Himself!","review":"This CD is definitely R&B, and maybe not what the pop-loving AI fans wanted, but that makes me respect Ruben even more. He put out a CD based on HIS style. So what if they sing Disney favorites on American Idol? Ruben sails with smooth ballads, and upbeat hip hop songs on Soulful. I love Ruben's voice! I just hope he gets the respect and the press that Clay has gotten...because he deserves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Circuit City..Target sold out...Thanks Amazon","review":"Im from NC and no...I dont have Clay Aikens CD.

I think that the CD is in very good taste. It is good finally to hear someone sing a song or songs with meaning for a change. Some would think that because Ruben is a young person that he should sing or rap about gang life, being a playa, or being gangster. That is what sets him apart from the rest. Ruben will be around for the long haul because he has true talent. We are missing talent in today's music world. Ruben is a part of our rebuilding in the music world. Ruben is the American Idol not Clay and that happened for a reason! The current CD is nice. It identifies with who Ruben really is. I like it a lot and I'm looking forward to hearing from Ruben more in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS DIFFERENT","review":"RUBEN IS VERY TALENTED,PEOPLE NEED TO RESPECT THAT.

AND YALL NEED TO RESPECT THAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just really sad .....","review":"Not much else to say. He's such a nice guy - but he's in over his head. I think it's a shame that the phone company glitched or whatever happened to cause the votes to be so far out of whack ending with Ruben being named as American Idol, when he just can't handle it. This CD is the ultimate proof of that. Sorry Ruben.

All the ideas are reseached from ancient folklores around the globe but Europe in the main.You wiil discover the luck, wisdom and power of objects as diverse as besoms (brooms), juniper berries or socks and stockings.

The book is in good condition, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intolerable","review":"This is among the most frustratingly uninteresting textbooks I've ever read. Every chapter takes the same dull, sensationalistic view of its subject, citing a limitless number of redundant examples of life in lesser-known cultures while condemning every aspect of modern, industrial cultures. Each unit restates the same cliches ad nauseam, and reading this material does nothing to enhance one's appreciation for humanity or for science. It is a terrible and tiresome introduction to anthropology."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the previous reviews...","review":"This text was required reading for my anthropology course and although I was looking forward to learning about the subject matter, I felt that Haviland wrote in a way that made it much less enjoyable than it should have been. Often repetitive, always with his own biased version and even his terminology (using such phrases as *something like* when using descriptives)were not what I expected from someone of his caliber. To make matters worse, the *Original Study* segments which were some of the most interesting parts of the book were printed on a green background with the print lightened so that it was barely readable...what were the publishers thinking? I was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for the Educated Reader","review":"The editors' review would lead you to believe this is an unbiased, thorough and scholarly examination of cultural anthropology. It is not. There is subtle age, gender, cultural and religious bias. Although it is a thorough look at various cultures, it is by no means comprehensive or accurate. It is inaccurate in highlighted descriptions of minor aspects of Native American culture, especially of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation. It seems to imply Western European cultures and various organized religions are the greatest evil on the planet. The portrayal of some cultures, such as the Malaysian, Pacific Island, and a few of the African Bushmen cultures, are very nice but that is the only redeeming quality of this text. Real scholars should avoid this text at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Excuse for Required Reading","review":"Just as with Haviland, et al - Anthropology: The Human Challenge (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac), there is to much opinion and to little good science.Certainly a lot of information, but when flavored with such a bias against \\"Western Civilization\\" it is 528 pages to be avoided not required reading in an introductory Cultural Antro. course. I hate to use monikers, but this is liberal junk, not a good introduction to the subject of Cultural Antrhopology. One should introduce a science and its methodology to students, not ones personal opinions and possible agendas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book!!!","review":"I tried to read and like this book; I really did. But after about 1/3 I refused to go on. Nothing truly worthy while is in this book, the writers do nothing but praise anthropology without telling you more about it, and all information is from a naturalistic, relativism, and liberal stand point. Anthropology hinges on the stance taken, and I think these writers would discover much by opening their minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading text","review":"This text explores human nature in a completely dry, systematic, and cliched manner. It conveys none of the realities of human experience. It describes the customs and practices followed by only a handful of societies in the world, and it does so in a distorted and often sensationalized manner. For example, it portrays Christianity as a simple religion of snake handlers, and it describes the Christian practice of eating the body of God in the COMMUNION WATER! The text communicates that there is no meaning or reason to human existence, and it picks apart each aspect of humanity until there is nothing left but the absurdity of all human thought and belief. If you wish to understand Man's history, get a firsthand look at what Man has written, built, believed, and striven for throughout the ages. Don't go to this book to have your questions answered. I don't know who wrote that ridiculous one sentence review about this book being wonderful, but they were a moron to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Sucks","review":"This book is down to earth stupid!

He also mocks religion constantly and the book repeats the same thing in several chapters...its like after a while you'll say \\"dude, we get the point, move on!\\".

It may be that I wished too much for Patrick O'Brian's passion when detailing the life of a real person but this entire biography felt like nothing more than a series of quotes being strung together. And, too often, the quotes were so out of context it was hard to even understand them. Besides that, often the quotes completely contradicted each other.

It is such an impressive piece of work. \\"Edge to Life\\" is one of the best songs that you can make love along. It includes lots of stuff from Depeche Mode, and things that Wilder would use later in his Recoil albums. Douglas McCarthy formerly from Nizter Ebb, includes a song here - buy Nitzer Ebb stuff too -.

Buyer's warning- these snap if you bend them with particular pieces and shrapnel flying at your face. It's also pure wood, so there's no laminating layer on top. It is a thin layer of wood, with a feel similar to balsa when I run my hands over them."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing","review":"In my opinion, this toy is a piece of junk. The \\"makeup\\" would not appear even when my daughter used ice water--disappointing. The hair easily falls out--disappointing. Two of the hairpieces fell apart within the first hour--disappointing. The head will not stay on the base--disappointing. I was a little surprised that this toy only cost $14.99 and now I see why it was so cheap--you definitely get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea, but it doesn't work...","review":"This is a cute concept. My 3 1/2 y.o. daughter has wanted the Bratz doll styling head, but she is still a little young for that look (grin), so I thought this would be a good compromise. It is a cute idea, in that you don't have to use real make-up, and she can still do a makeover. Well, even after putting ice in the carriage cup, the water still wasn't cold enough to elicit a color change on the doll's face. We tried everything, but the makeup didn't change colors. The hair falls out easily when brushing it, and the barrettes are difficult for a little girl to fasten alone. She ended up being very disappointed in this toy, and it sits up in the closet unused. Perhaps I will let her buy some cheap makeup and give the doll a real makeover, but then, that sort of defeats the purpose of this toy. Overall, I consider it a big waste of money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST EVER","review":"Don't even stop to look at it 1 star becouse it's the most boringest toy EVER 5 stars for education for kids to know NOT TO BUY JUNK! and one star of durable becouse i was brushing her hair at the FREAKING brush break in TWO!!!!! the hair was falling out and the crown didn't fit very well you can't even put make up on i love cinderrella sooo i bought it was of my money the only thing fun about this was i cut her hair realy short and died it Blue and Pink with green streeks and put blue nail polish on her lips and I throw it out and on the big forhead(thats after i cought the bangs off) I wroght PIECE of JUNK!!!Don't buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adore this Film!","review":"A fun, whimsical movie about a presidential look alike mixed in with the dredges of political scum.

It is a well written movie filled with optimism and innocent idealism. Kevin Kline does a wonderful job of making the political machine account for it's own actions. When you are sick and tired of hearing about Clintons newest scandal, watch \\"Dave\\" and feel a little better about the state of the nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Review","review":"There is no question that the movie itself is a winner.

The Blu-ray is very good. Color, clearity. Just a great film. Kevin Kline does a very good job with both roles, and Sigourney Weaver nearly takes the show away from everyone in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light romantic comedy.","review":"President Bill Mitchell is not exactly an ideal President. He looks after those who helped get him into office than the people and he is a philanderer. One of the ways that he keeps his amorous play a secret is to hire a lookalike to impersonate him. Now the man whom they have hired is Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline), a goodhearted man who likes to help people find jobs. After making his little exit, the real President suffers a stroke and is completely incapacitated. The corrupt and manipulative Chief of Staff, Bob Alexander, plans to use Dave to elevate himself to the White House. Unfortunately, he doesn't count on Dave enjoying himself in office, using his luck to make the country a better place and falling in love with the beautiful First Lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one","review":"If you love politics and political humor, you will roll on the floor while you watch this terrific movie. Kline is great in this dual role and the rest of the stars complement the story and are quite believable. On top of that, you get a couple of good whacks at the crew on John McLachlin's crazy panel. Helen Thomas and several other prominent reporters and politicians also toss in their two cents worth. Well worth watching, you won't regret the time you spend on it. You may keep asking yourself, has this been done in real life?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"Kevin Kline gives one of his best performances as a fill in president. Sigourney Weaver as the first lady. Frank Langella and Kevin Dunn as the presidents right hands. Ving Rhames as the Secret Service Agent assigned to protect the president. And Charles Grodin as Daves best friend, and a host of real life reporters and senators bring a very amusing story about a man chosen to temporary fill in for the president when he is incapacitated by a stroke, by a look-alike. He (Kline) proceeds to win over everybody, and makes the preident more popular than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love Dave","review":"Kevin Kline is without a doubt one of the finest actors I've seen. The chemistry between he and the rest of the cast is incredible. Ving Rhames is perfect in this role and talk about heavy hitters...Frank Langella and Ben Kingsley are perfect in their respective roles. And you have to love Charles Grodin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh & Learn (for the family)","review":"I've watched this movie countless times, so I had to buy it! It is hysterical without having a lot of foul language or nudity. I thought it was interesting & informative, too, as it gives a little insite into the inner workings of Washington. (Taking into account that it is fictionalized of course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun Political Drama/Comedy!","review":"DAVE is a great movie. It's fun to watch and is family friendly. At the same time, though, it has plenty of political jargon and Oval Office scenes to keep the political drama lover happy. DAVE follows a man who could pass as a twin of the President. He is recruited as a double for the Prez. for public appearances, but quite unexpectedly, gets a big promotion! Definately see this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Put Together Story","review":"Dave is one of those feel-good movies that is both enchanting and very-well written. Before taking office, politicians should be made to watch this and Mr. Smith goes to Washington. One of Kevin Kline's best roles.Frank Langella does an excellent job as the corrupt Press Secretary with designs to become president."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful--You'll watch it over and over","review":"This is a great story, entertaining, fun, with laughter and pathos mixed in, much like life itself. You'll find yourself watching it over and over again; it is a \\"feel-good\\" movie that will leave you smiling. Kline and Weaver give outstanding performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming","review":"I just saw this movie for the first time, but I wished I'd seen it when it first came out almost 15 years ago. it's a delightful, heart-warming political comedy with a terrific script and a very impressive cast, all of whom seem to be enjoying their roles in this light-hearted but compelling little movie. One of the movie's many charms is all the cameos by congressmen, senators, reporters, and other Washington notables of the period. It really is a blast from the past. Kline is superb as the ordinary guy who resembles the president and finds himself suddenly at the center of Washington politics, and gets a chance to make a difference. Frank Langella is formidable as his chief of staff who concocts the whole charade, which backfires on him when Kline turns out to be honest and incorruptible. Sigourney Weaver, Vingh Rhames, and Charles Grodin are also excellent. Overall a truly enjoyable and fun little movie that I would watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining political Spoof","review":"A fun story about what if a normal guy replaced the president. very realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average Film","review":"As much as I like Kevin Kline, this film is just an average film.

I prefer the film, \\"American President\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Diversion","review":"It might be time for everyone involved in the bitter partisanship of contemporary American politics to take a few hours away from arguing and laugh a little bit. There is no reason two people of differing ideologies can't get together for an evening and enjoy a very astute, funny comedy as a way to break the monotony of anger and mudslinging pervading America's political debates.Dave may just be the answer to all our problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting an old friend","review":"Dave was one of those \\"feel good\\" movies that never offended anybody and was always a good stand by to watch if an entertainig and relaxing movie was required. I purchased the blu ray to upgrade my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO DISAPPOINTING!","review":"When I bought this book, I thought it would be more of an autobiographical type of book. I was so disappointed to find out that all it is, is a compilation of quotes from Peter Gabriel over the years.Yes, there were a few interesting facts to be found in it, but nothing that would really, truly give anyone a feeling that they finished the book knowing any more about this brilliant artist than they probably already knew... it simply stated a topic.. and then followed with a few pages of various quotes on that subject by Gabriel. Not what I expected by any means. Not worth the money in my opinion. You could probably get more info through Google or any other site like that. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Tool for Any Kitchen","review":"As a novice gourmet, who enjoys cooking just for the mere enjoyment of watching people's faces when they bite into something delicious, I found this book to be quite helpful in searching for something new and exciting to produce from my oven. I highly recommend the Beef Tenderloin with Bearnaise Sauce. It is a classic and easy to prepare, as are most of the recipes contained in this book. No matter what your skill level it would make a great addition to any cookbook collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent original recipes!","review":"I recently attended a graduation dinner and was delighted by the fine array of unusual treats.

However as a visual learner, I prefer the visuals in the Maran Illustrated Knitting and Crocheting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"This book is probably the most comprehensive knitting reference ever written.In addition to a master index at the back of the book, it has mini-indices at each page bottom referencing related topics for that page. Of course, an index and table of contents are present but, divided into categories and coded by color (even the yarn used in the photographs is consistent with the topic color), this book makes it easy to page through even without using those.The instructions are precise and concise, pictures and illustrations are accurate and clear, and there is more information here than you could gather from a day at the library. This book was made with the knitter in mind, and obviously created by knitters who understand questions asked by everyone from beginners to designers.This book will TEACH you to knit and if you are already an experienced knitter, deserves a place of honor in your reference section. There is simply NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"knitting","review":"This is an excellent book whether you're a beginner or a professional.I would recommend it to anyone looking for information on how to knit or crochet."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABU","review":"I LOVE this book.

Does that describe you?","review":"I was new to the craft of knitting, so I chose this book after some heavy research. I couldn't be happier.I barely knew what knitting was, and now I have a full understanding of the craft. I owe it all to this book, a bit of zeal, and dedication.I can't stress enough that this book has the ability to take you from a know nothing to an adept knitter all by itself.The pictures and descriptions combine to let you know exactly what to do, how to do it, and when."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners and reference","review":"I recently learned to knit and have found this book to be a wonderful resource. The diagrams and illustrations are very helpful. Each time I have a question about something in a pattern I turn to this book for the answer. I'm not crazy about any of the patterns in the book, but that isn't the reason I bought it in the first place. Vogue Knitting is well worth the money for a beginning knitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book for new knitters","review":"I love this book! I started knitting about a year ago, and essentially taught myself to knit using it. It is very comprehensive, from the most basic techniques to the most advanced.

It is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MUST HAVE knitting book from beginner to experienced","review":"After kissing several toads I finally found the prince! This book contains everything you need to know about knitting that even a beginner can understand and follow. The illustrations are wonderful and complement the instructions beautifully. The layout is very organized and follows a logical order in the knitting scheme of things. The most important thing is that it is not so longwinded that you get bored after the first ten pages! All subjects are covered in a straightforward and succinct manner. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to knit or who is thinking about getting started. My mother-in-law comes from Norway and has been knitting since she could hold the needles. I told her she needed a copy of this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference","review":"Exceeded my expectations for a knitting reference.

Considering the Vogue spiral bound reference for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vopgue's Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book","review":"The book's title said it all. It uses various methods of knitting and then goes into detail with the \\"how to\\" for assembly plus it also covers maintenance of knitted items (hand or machine). One can use it to teach yourself.

He goes out of his way to look and sound like a pig as he devours whole raw fish, for example, leaving bloody guts on his hands and face. This is not the Penguin I came to appreciate as a kid.Almost as bad is Michelle Pfeiffer. She is sadly obnoxious as Catwoman, looking fantastic but acting like an idiot and completely out of place.I very much wanted to like this movie, and was willing to give it a lot of slack...but it just left me with an unhappy and sick feeling by the time it was over.

But enough is enough. A full book about the madness caused by Kalhan missing. We do not advance in the story one bit. Although we see Richard in a new way, I actually want to see the end of this serie before im 40 (now im 24). We must compare this serie to the whell of time of Robert Jordan, and must say that M.Goodkind doesnt have the same writting abilities on the ever going, fun to read, story. If there is no more then 2 books, i suggest you read it, but it wont make a big difference if you dont. By far the worst book Terry Goodkind made in this serie"},{"rating":"1","title":"More pain thanks to Goodkind (2.5 stars)","review":"Well, what is left to say about Goodkind? He still claims that he doesn't write fantasy and that his books are about human interaction/etc. Sadly this latest in the SoT series doesn't measure up to his earlier works such as Wizards 1st which were at least decent reads. As is normal with Goodkind he rehashes a fairly stale plot with his same cardboard cutout and inane characters. This book is better than his last offering by far, but that isn't enough to get Goodkind out of the hole he has dug for himself.Goodkind continues however to offer bocks for the lite fantasy reader which seems to be his forte, those that like his style (or lack thereof) should continue to enjoy his series Those of us that just read Goodkind because we like to abuse ourselves after getting sucked in by a couple decent books at the beginning of the series will continue to suffer at the hands of a guy that is bringing new meaning to the term \\"hack\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"short story, long","review":"This book tells a story that could have been told in one fifth of time that the author uses. The story points get repeated over and over again, not adding to the narrative, just dulling the reader. If you are invested in this series, as I am, read the first five chapters and then the last five. The middle is not the stuff of the first books of this series. The philosophy/politics in this book would not bug me so much if it was part of the story. But this whole book was written to push the ideas. That is why there is so little action in Chainfire. The ideas get pushed down our throat though -- a leader has to go it alone -- he's the only one who really knows what is going on. And another idea that the author brings out toward the end, torture is justified if it is for a just cause.So read the beginning and end. Skip the middle. I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is just a good book","review":"Once again Terry Goodkind has written a book that you can't put down. Preachy at times (just like the last few books in the series), but if you don't like the sermons, just skim them. The story is original and gripping from the start. Only disappointment is I read the book until my eyeballs ached so I could finish the book and was left hanging. If this was supposed to be the first book in a trilogy conclusion to the series, then all three books should have been available at the same time (I would would have bought them all)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this one in the library - or skip","review":"The same old, the same old... As much as I liked the first books in the series - and even gave them my personal \\"Best ever written fantasy (after Tolkien)\\" prize, as much I was struggling through \\"Chainfire\\". There is nowhere to go, nothing more to develop in the characters - so Mr. Goodkind includes more and more philosophy - instead of telling stories, as it is expected. The result is disappointing. All of you, who have seen Matrix re-loaded, re-furbished and re-installed, know the feeling.I guess the real skill that fantasy writers should master, it's realizing when to stop the sequels ( My applause to Dave Dunkan, who knows how to do it and best wishes to JK Rowling).PS I am still going to buy \\"Phantom\\" next March, hoping for the miracle: after all, I liked \\"Pillars of Creation\\"(7) more than \\"Faith of Fallen\\" (6)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard loses Kahlen, yet again...","review":"O.k., enough with the I love my wife but I keep losing her bit. This was the worst book of Goodkind that I ever read, was a chore to read and only the last 100 pages started to get good. Then ending was disappointing and I felt like I wasted my time reading so much about Richard trying to prove his wife, did I mention whom he lost again, still exists. The missing wife tack is getting old. Why don't you let their love flourish and they fight together against the bad guys for a change. If you are thinking of purchasing this book--don't. It's the perfect one to check out of a library much as some movies are only worth the price of the DVD video rental. I love his other books but this one sadly was not the quality read I have grown accustomed to seeing by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chainfire","review":"I do not understand why so many complain about the politics in Mr. Goodkind's books. Doesn't an author have the right to express himself in his work? That is one of the reasons a lot of authors write, so that they can be heard. I like the politics in these books, it makes them deeper than the average fantasy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks to all reviewers - I am not going to buy this book!","review":"I will invest this money to another book...Problem is that... Hallowed Hunt I've alerady red...George Martin is long overdue with his last book, Jordan is no better than Goodkind, my beloved Robin Hobb is also getting worse...

So, I am still wondering how that could take 667 pages, and does not even produce an ending.There were some creative elements to the plot but the preaching and rehashing from previous books (Goodkind can cut and paste with the best of them), diluted what could have been a welcome break to Goodkinds downward spiral.I have read all 9 of this series and they startd out GREAT but it seems each one has less meat in it. This one was just a sappy story, and reduced the great Richard Rahl to just a High School kid who lost his girl. This thing should be in the Romance section and NOT in the Science Fiction/Fantasy section. How the mighty have fallen: both Richard Rahl and Terry Goodkind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't start at night","review":"I thought this was a really good book, even if it dosen't end well.

Not having the cover reduced my enjoyment of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Probably the most boring book I have ever read. I was hoping it would get better but I had to put it down halfway through. I liked Wizard's First Rule though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashing covered ground...","review":"While Mr. Goodkind has introduced some new elements to the story line, it's mostly a rehash of previous books. The main plot drags while Richard keeps remembering past events, as if someone would actually read the 9th volume in a series without having read the first eight. It is also grating to see the same troubles rehashed. Richard and Kahlan separated, bad things happening, evil and dispair looming, world about to end, etc. etc. (yawn) Been there, done that. I would almost believe that Goodkind has taken a page from Robert Jordan's guide of \\"How to Drag Out a Series to Make More Money\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"This is one of the better books that I have read. Terry Goodkind is a terrific author who has been able to hold our interest in this series for years. I believe he yet again proved his unique and quite talented form of writing. Not only did he grab our attention with another outstanding book, but he also was able to make it a compelling piece of work by giving to us the basic truths of life, and philosophy we all ourselves believe. Once the book is read, you can't help but think about the truth of it all, and try to apply everything said within it in everyday life. This book was magnificent, and I belive that it deserves no less than a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind - Jordan same editor same advisor","review":"Both series started out great and became unreadable after 5 books, 6 if you are tolerant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop, enough, uncle!","review":"I am in the middle of reading Chain Fire and I just read the synopsis of Phantom.

I have read the series 4 times over and love it every time I read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Invisible Wife?","review":"As with all books, after book one of a series, the author is obligated to bring all readers 'up to speed' with backstory. We are well into the series now and this author fills in backstory endlessly to the point of boredom. If I were not hook on the story, I would have shelved the book. There is an awful lot of exposition ... the why of what is happening. It does get tedious.In this effort, we finally find out what is causing Kahlan's problem and determine what might happen if it is undone... the book then leaves the reader hanging... No real conclusion. a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"complicated but enjoyable","review":"If you are a hard core fantasy fan, this book won't let you down.In fact, if you are new to Terry Goodkind like I was, this book # 9 is a must read because it contains quite a lot of flashbacks/references to previous volumens.But if you don't have the patience or if you don't enjoy stories that are grand in scheme and complex in structure, then skip this one.There is no dragon slaying, but plenty of original/unique magic to keep one entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chainfire","review":"The first 15 pages of the book are very interesting but then the story became so boring that I had to stop reading the book, I was actually forcing myself to continue reading the book hoping that it would get better but it remained boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll have to enjoy the perspective to enjoy his books.","review":"I enjoy Ayn Rand's work and Objectivism. So these books and I get along very well for the most part. I anjoy the parrallels he creates. I am guilty of skimming at times. But I always got back and read it again.I wish Mr. Goodkind had retained the voice and the pace of the first books in the series (which is why I only gave it 4 out of 5). I always go back and read those again with pleasure. But I find it hard to relish in his latest works.My suggestions would be, finish writing the series from this point on the just the drama, action, romance and inventiveness his fans have come to expect. The write a companion the the series that lays down the Objectivist perspective and adds the things, in his passion and plead for common sense he feels compelled to add. I think that would be much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the other half?","review":"I have been an avid SoT series fan but this one left me angry. I would suggest that if you are considering buying this book, wait until chainfire 2 comes out so you can read a complete work. This books drops the reader (after 500+ pages) in the middle of the story. Reminds me of the old part 1/part 2 batman episodes. Perhaps it is time for Goodkind to end the series and move on to another work? I agree with many of the previous comments. I enjoyed the philosophy up to the point that I had to start skipping pages because the repetition became burdensome. This occurred after the Temple of the Winds. Hey Goodkind...Are you really going to make us wait for the rest of Chainfire????? UGH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Yes she is\\"....\\"No she isn't\\"","review":"Since Terry Goodkind's first book I have been a fan. At the end of each book I felt full, satiated from a huge bowl of his creative talent. However, the soup is quite watery this time out. Like his last effort we are staring at thin again. \\"Yes she is\\"....\\"No she isn't\\" is what the first 55 chapters are all about. Maybe this was some attempt at producing a cliffhanger element to the story. I am not sure. What I am sure of is that it brought the books story line down to the level of a soap opera. Start this book on Chapter 56 and enjoy the beginning of the story and skip the drawn out angst of the previous chapters. Thankfully this book has glimpses of the Terry Goodkind fantasy world so many of us came to cherish in his earlier works. Still, I will never give up on this author because I feel his best is yet to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series used to be good...","review":"As many other people have mentioned the book could be several hundred pages shorter by simply NOT repeating what happened in the previose 8 books so Maybe mention some key points in the first copule chapters to refesh memory and drop it.The first few books were good, but lately the whole series seems like Goodkind is trying to impart some grand morall truth onto the readers. It's WAY to preachy and anoying after a while. I found myself skipping paragraphs constantly in the past couple of books.Also ive notived that the characters often take many chapters to come to some 'grand realization' that was rediculously obvoise from the begining. Everyone (except for possibly Richard) is very lacking when it comes to intelligence.Im only sticking to the series becuase someone I know buys the books so im not wasting money and ive read so many I might as well finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest Argument","review":"I only gave this book 2 stars because I found myself not able to put it down. The problem is that I couldn't put it down not bcse it was so great but bcse I wanted to find out what was going to happen next and it took forever to get there. I love the earlier Goodkind books but have been very disappointed in the last two (this one included). When I finished, I felt like I just read 600 plus pages of Richard trying to win an argument. I should have known the book was going to go nowhere when he started off one chapter describing how someone is approaching. The chapter ends and you still don't know who is approaching. Almost 700 pages and he still didn't finish the story.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get On With It, Already","review":"A friend assured me that Pillars of Creation was the only stinker in this series to date. He was wrong. This is - by far - the worst book I've read up to this point.A trilogy's first book isn't always the best. You lay out the rules, and set up the conflict. That's the way it goes. But the fact of the matter is that setting up the rules - and the conflict - didn't need to stretch on for 600+ paperback pages. Man, what a tedious book this was; if Richard wasn't reiterating his frustration in monologue, he was beating the same old dead horse with various characters.I have a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and hadn't really taken issue with Mr. Goodkind's thinking until this book. Zedd's ramblings regarding contradiction and faith are ridiculously juvenile, and Goodkind did a startlingly wonderful job of making a wise character turn in to a stupid fool.Here's to hoping Phantom isn't this burdensome."},{"rating":"1","title":"same plot, new twist","review":"This would have been a great book 4 or 5, but I think were all tired now of having the Imperial Order trample all over everyone while Kahlen and Richard play hide and seek. Granted this is a new twist and perhaps the best one, yet still about the 5th or 6th book, if Im not mistaking, where Richard and Kahlen get separated and spend the entire book looking for one another, Either that or one is very sick or injured, and the entire book is focussed on trying to save the one whos injured or sick.I don't neccisarily need to see the series end right away, but I atleast want to see an entire book of Richard, Kahlan, and their army strike a major blow to the order and give the reader some hope. I don't think that even if goodkind ended the series right away, that theres much to save anymore.Oh yes, Goodkind still has a perfect record in finding ways to keep an incredibly powerful wizard from using any (or very little) magic in his books (9-0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kahlan's missing again...","review":"Yaaawn...Kahlan is missing, Richard must hunt for her, discovers a new magic along the way, blah, blah, blah...This is repetitive to the point of insulting. This theme has been repeated over and over throughout this series, which I was a huge fan of for the first several books.Goodkind is a very talented storyteller, but he's run this one to the ground. My advice Terry, is to move on. Maybe write a story about a evil wizard attempting to take over the world using rings of power. That story line has more originality left in it that The Sword of Truth does at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be an adventure series, not a lecture series!","review":"I have been a loyal reader of Mr. Goodkind's Sword of Truth series since its inception. The first 5 books were wonderful. Since that time, however, Mr. Goodkind has provided less adventure and more lecture in his stories. This book is truly NOT WORTH READING if you are a fan of this series. This book is focused more on trite philosophical diatribes than progressing the story or developing the characters. Even if you are devoted fan of this series, don't feel guilty if you skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"I've loved everyone of Terry Goodkinds books, but this one left me upset that id spent $30. Until the last 50 pages absolutely nothing had happened. Richard had traveled somewhere, got attacked and talked with people...a WHOLE lot. Thats all this book was, all talk...no action. BORING! I actually found myself skipping entire pages because I felt like i was being preached to about stuff that I've read in the last 8 books. Unless his next book is any better, I wont read his books anymore. They're becoming long and redundant. Get to the end of the series already!! Its long overdue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forewarned is forearmed","review":"I had been anxiously awaiting this release but a little voice inside me told me to put my credit card back in my wallet and save the $25.00!!!

Unfortunately leaving it here means that the reader has trudged through 600 pages to meet..... Nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliff Hanger","review":"This is the last published book in Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series (as of July 2005). The series is more enjoyable if you read it from the beginning and the title of the first book is \\"The Wizard's First Rule.\\" My best advice is to work up to \\"Chainfire\\" in the order the books were intended.Having said that, though, I thought this book was great. It isn't at all what I expected and has a serious cliff hanger ending, but it was wonderful and exciting just the same.I tend to like this type of fantasy and I like series because there is more time to develop characters and relationships. These books remind me a bit of the Katharine Kerr Deverry series, though I think hers are for slightly younger readers. If you've read any of the Deverry series and enjoyed it, you will probably like these too."},{"rating":"1","title":"We love you Terry, but come on","review":"I have followed this series from the beginning, and I love the message he is sending with each book. I love the images he paints and all the characters. This book was fun the whole way through, but when I got to the last 50 pages, I was wondering how he was going to wrap up the complications. The answer was a real let down. He just needed another 50 pages and it would have been great. At least he could have solved ONE of the three major problems. He just left us all hanging for two more years before he writes another one. I don't mind waiting, but I expect a book to have some sort of goal reached at the end. Kinda like the feeling when you saw LOTR1 in the theater for the first time and the ending sucked, but the movie was way too good to be mad about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!","review":"It's not often in this day in age to come across a series of books that is through provoking, insightful and pertinet to the world that we live in now. Terry Goodkind has done all of these things with the Sword of Truth books. His characters are mature people who actually think about their actions as well as feel remorseful when they make a mistake. It is truly a pleasure to find a series of books that leaves you hanging on every word and looking forward to the next book with bated breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chainfire","review":"It's like...if you've read one, you just keep reading the same story over and over in the whole series...too much time back tracking.

Kahlan lost, Kahlan found, Kahlan lost again, Kahlan found again. Or Richard lost, Richard found, ohp...Richard lost again, Richard found again. Goodkind has run out of ideas. He should put the Sword of Truth series down and move on to something fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard, Kahlan, Richard, Kahlan","review":"Everyone that started this series was blown away by the first book....a truly \\"adult\\" fantasy. It was awesome! And just like so, so, so, many fantasy series that have a strong book or two, it just goes on and on and needed to end 4 books ago. Lord of the Rings had a plan, and it was awesome because of it. Sword of Truth had a great two books, and now, it is a cycle of the two main characters taking turns playing \\"the love of my life is in trouble\\". Mr Goodkind, it is ok to end this and start something new! Like everyone else reading this, I too will keep reading to the end. I just wish you knew before hand it would be like this. Of course, it took us 20 years to get through the Dark Tower series....what can one expect!cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"GET ON WITH IT !","review":"By the time we get to the 10th book, it's time for Terry Goodkind to treat his readers with a little more respect. We know (and may or may not agree with) his social dogma ... so enough already! We also know the story ... try advancing it a little farther. Within 700+ pages, there were 100 pages worth reading. If the next book is anything like this ... I'm done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy, repetitive and incomplete","review":"Just confirming the opinion of several other reviewers. The book is preachy (Ayn Rand covered this material years ago), excessively long for the plot (too much time sent reintroducing what happened in previous books) and doesn't appear to end at a complete point in the story.

I'm angry that there were great characters that could have been but never were... no development beyond the paragraphs they were required to occupy. I'm angry that such a brilliant and evil villain like Jagang is left undeveloped and ignored and his sweeping and overwhelming army is on some sort of Tivo pause. I'm angry that Richard has to endure being a hapless buffoon throughout the pages of dribbling crud like \\"Chainfire\\" and \\"Naked Empire\\" in his quest against evil.After Naked Empire I decided his books weren't worth my hard earned money. After Chainfire I've decided his books aren't even worth my time. Someone send me an email and tell me how it all ends because I'm through. Read at your own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chainfire by Terry Goodkind","review":"I found the book a struggle to get thru. The philosophy in place of substantative action is bull. Filling pages because of editor requirements. Also, the continuous and laborious recap of all the other books stinks - again some editor beefing up a book where there is no substance for business reasons. I think these things are true of the last 2 books as well. Could have combined into one for all I care and have done a much better job. Of course then wouldn't have made as much money. Not sure I care to buy the other two because who wants to hear about the boxes of orden again. Wasn't that book 1? What a waste of a good story!

First, and foremost, it is poorly written. The author has raised repetition to a new height. It seems that every character has to recount the story line at every opportunity. The story could have been told in a concise, and more entertaining fashion in a third of the page count. It would appear that Mr. Goodkind's contract is based on the number of pages he produces, not the quality of the prose. Secondly, the plot of the larger story is not advanced in this book. Since the second volume of the series the main theme has been the struggle with the Imperial Order. With this book it appears that that struggle was incosequential and the true enemy is something else. I could have hoped that the author would have finished one story, before he began another. I do not recommend purchase of this book, or its inevitable sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The third best in the series","review":"First of all, I can not imagine anyone reading this book withput first having read the other 8 books in the series. If you would however, Goodkind has made it possible to understand the plot by telling what happened in the previous books every now and then. To me, who have read all the other books, that is a total waste of space. I ignore those passages.Secondly, some passages in the book are quite lenghty and you have an urge to progress on to the really exciting parts. But in fact, that is why the book is so good. Because the plot is still brilliant and you can not wait to see what will happen to our beloved characters. I am SO interested in this world of his and I have to know how everyting is going to turn out in the end.I feel a great sympathy with Richard Cypher in this book, and I also think Goodkind made a good job of letting us see him closer to despair than ever before."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"Im tired of always hearing the same thing in may different ways. He needs to get on with the story. If you want to to read great books, get books by David Gemmell."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can a great story disappoint so...","review":"I came to write a detailed, critical review of Chainfire only to find so many others expressing my exact sentiments. Great storyline, great characters, but too much rehash, too much philosophy, too much (I hate to say it) \\"fill\\" for too little advancement of the story. One other reader beat me to the punch: \\"Unfortunately, other than rehashing what I've ALREADY read in his other books, not much happened. I especially felt cheated in the end, which I won't ruin, but it felt like half a book.\\"As other reviewers have commented, I will continue to read the series to conclusion (if it ever has one); but I am disappointed in the author for being so unwilling to move along. I find myself skipping more and more rehashed prose until I find something actually happening. I must admit that I have started getting the latest release of this series from the library rather than purchasing it. And I love building my library of books that I own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dull and Boring, Too Much Preaching","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this book, but I found the story so boring, while Goodkind gives us his lame politics and philosophy. What a shame, the series started so strongly and has fizzled like a wet candle."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Enough has been said about how Goodkind's objectivist preaching detracts from the storytelling. My main concern is that the writing itself was just bad. Even when he was carrying forth the plot and not his sermons, the characters felt like badly drawn caricatures of themselves. Their dialogue was forced and out of character, getting downright insipid at times. Their actions were completely out of joint with their character. New characters were thrown in seemingly at random and did not advance the story. It almost makes me wonder if he got a new editor who had not read any of the other books.All in all, I hope that Goodkind will return to the formula that made his previous books great (yes, I liked Pillars, Faith and Naked Empire)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow Richard Rahl became God","review":"This is a problem with all the long fantasy novels (except Tolkien and George RR Martin) that I wish authors could find a way around. They take a person from humble beginnings and build him up, give him magical type ability. Then this character that you can relate to is turned into this superman or demigogue in this case. I just kept getting the impression that Goodkind actually worships his character. All the prayers at the People's Palace and how it does all the characters so much good when they do it. Richard has turned infallible. I had hopes with the premise of everyone forgetting Kahlan in this book, but a complexity of character never really materialized.I just no longer relate to this character and it makes reading the preachy crap totally not worthwhile. This was much better than the book before it, but I wouldn't recommend either one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I ever let myself care?","review":"Fortunately, I commute by train and therefore have two hours a day for recreational reading.Unfortunately, long ago I read the first book in Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. I care about the characters. It's too late to go back.Somewhere in the publishing hall of fame there's an entire floor dedicated to the man or woman who invented the \\"series.\\" I know it's a scam, and I still can't stop.What makes the Sword of Truth worse than the rest is the constant barrage of Objectivist drivel. Please if you see a friend in a bookstore about to take that first fatal step into the never-ending morass that is Terry Goodkind's fictional/polemical worldview, stop them, take away their cash, their credit card, their library card -- just don't let them buy any of these terrible books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chore to read","review":"Wow. I was a huge Goodkind fan. I gave his books every chance. I liked his ideas and characters, and I liked how the story was progressing.Too bad the story isn't progressing.And too bad this story just sat there. God this was the worst. I coulnd't finish reading this book. I will have to go back and read it through thoroughly, but any book that takes me weeks to read is worth 2 stars. A book should hold your attention from page one. This one did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be half the pages!","review":"I love this series of books, but the last few are getting off track. Half of this book could have been left out. It was so repetitive I found myself skimming pages just trying to find something worth reading. Near the end the action starts and it was awesome. What really made me angry was that this was just a set up for the next 2 books.In past volumes there has always been a complete story (beginning, middle, end) and this book had the beginning and a little bit of the middle. Why did Terry Goodkind shy away from Kahlan's torture? This is what made his other books so enthralling. I suffered with Richard when he was with the Mord Sith and after this book I feel like I'm reading about characters instead of living along with them.NOTE TO TERRY GOODKIND: Leave behind the repetitive philosophy and get back to the actual story!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lower kindle price","review":"I can no longer justify spending nine dollars on the kindle version for 1/4 of a story and 3/4 recap of the previous 8 books. I read up to this one, but the last two or three have really been kind of a struggle to not just skip the explanation of the things the reader should know by now, if you pick up book 9 of a series you should have some idea of whats going on. Don't get me wrong, it's been a good series so far (if a bit preachy at times) but character development has slowed to a crawl and the stressed importance of ridding the world of the imperial order seems like a side project. I want to finish this story and I would probably spend another nine bucks if the story part of the next three books could be condensed into one. Goodkind needs to cut the exposition and the price and maybe I'll pick it back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT NEVER ENDS........","review":"THE SWORD OF TRUTH IS A WONDERFUL GROUP OF BOOKS, BUT THE MAINPROBLEM IS MR.

If you purchased this book, it is only because you have read the first 8, so I don't understand why Goodkind has to give us a recap of the first 8 books. While it wasn't as preachy as his last 3 books all it did was pretty much summarize all the previous books in the series. It's like watching one of your favorite TV show take the cheap way out by showing clips of previous episodes. I mean, no ones is going to start getting into the sword of truth starting with book 9.Goodkinds first 5 books were great, but his writing has slipped and I only borrow them from the library now."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Much like the last 2 books of the series, at one point you realize 100 pages and 11 chapters have gone by, and the characters have accomplished... almost nothing. I don't know whose idea it was to spend the first quarter of every book rehashing everything that happened in the rest of the series but it makes for mind-numbingly boring reading.It's not even philosophy. It's the endless pontification of the obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"22 CD's Long","review":"I am writing this as a first time reader/listener. The label on the CD case from the library obscured the fact that this was a series let alone a trilogy in a series. I'm glad I listen in the car as no objected to my frequent \\"Enough already, get on with it\\" outbursts. I stuck with it through 22 CD's to end with a let me down ending. It wasn't even a suspenseful ending, it actually left me a little angry. Maybe Terry is of the groupthink that if you repeat something often enough people will believe it. Only the other reviews telling about how different these rest were would get me to read any of the earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank you","review":"I too gave up this seriees about 3 books ago... His writing progessivly got worse with each book, and he showed that after he broke from mimicing jordan he really didnt have much to write about... I thought to myself however, Maybe he regained his old story, I was close to picking up the book but thanks to these reviews i know sometimes you just have to let the dead stay dead...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End is Near","review":"The only good thing about CHAINFIRE is that it is the first in a trilogy that will FINALLY put an end to the SWORD OF TRUTH series. Otherwise there is nothing much good that can be said about it here. Shallow characters, a rehashed boring storyline and, of course, by now his trademark, endless preaching. It will be a bestseller, of course, but it is just utter trash. There are so many good writers working in the fantasy genre. However, Goodkind is not one of them. Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you reviewers","review":"When each Terry Goodkind book comes out, I now read though all the reviews to see if the emphasis on preaching is still there. Since it is (even in the good reviews), I will again skip this book. I never read better books in my life than the Sword of Truth, right up through Temple of the Winds. After that... they were just agony. I even have a book or two I bought, but just couldn't get started, because I new they were going to be full of preaching, and little else. So every couple years, I will look at the new book, read the reviews, and wait with great hope that I see \\"Great fantasy, no preaching\\". Then I will immediately buy. But not before."},{"rating":"1","title":"spare us","review":"as close to drudgery,as this master storyteller ever came.he madeup for it though,in phantom.still love ya dude.\\\\"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Paper","review":"This book was a dull, plodding recap of all the other books. It read like a 7th grade book report. Goodkind is not a good writer, but he has shown imagination in the past. This book is waaaay past. Nothing happens until the last few pages and the action is not worth the effort. Total rip off. No more Sword of Truth novels for me -- and that's the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again...","review":"I used to love the Terry Goodkind books - but then they started getting repeditive. Richard and Kahlan are going to live happily ever after... oh, wait, no they aren't! And the whole world is in terrible danger! And Richard is going to open people's eyes to goodness and the Value of Life with his Amazing lectures along the way!The ninth book, Chainfire? Only half a book. Stops abruptly at the end - most of the action will be in the next one. At least this book is a little less preachy than the other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure, unadulterated propaganda","review":"This book reads like a treatise on enforcing the spread of democracy written by Paul Wolfowitz.Mr Goodkind, stick to the Fantasy genre please, stay away from politics.The fact that your first few novels were so enjoyable only makes this piece of garbage worse by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"If you have or haven't read the rest of the series; which I would strongly encourage, it is a wonderful book. The characters are deep and real. Once you begin the journey, you will not be able to put it down till you find out what happens next. 5 stars isn't enough of a rating, it should have 10 stars for this book and the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubtful","review":"This series started out great, but the last few have been more like atlas shrugged than epic fantasy. Yes, it's an ideological war as opposed to a more simplistic good vs. evil bit. I'd appreciate it if Mr. Goodkind could get back to writing books that contain a story, instead of just repetitive preaching. But still, at least he has projected an end to the series, unlike a certain other best-selling fantasy series."},{"rating":"1","title":"make the hurting STOP","review":"Well, what is left to say about Goodkind? He still claims that he doesn't write fantasy and that his books are about human interaction/etc. Sadly this latest in the SoT series doesn't measure up to his earlier works such as Wizards 1st which was at least a decent read. As is normal with Goodkind he rehashes a fairly stale plot with his same cardboard cutout and inane characters. This books is better than his last offering by far, but that isn't enough to get Goodkind out of the hole he has dug for himself.Goodkind continues however to offer bocks for the lite fantasy reader which seems to be his forte, those that like his style (or lack thereof) should continue to enjoy his series Those of us that just read Goodkind because we like to abuse ourselves after getting sucked in by a couple decent books at the beginning of the series will continue to suffer at the hands of a guy that is bringing new meaning to the term \\"hack\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"..yeah, right it's more like ashes or kindling than'FIRE'...","review":"Terry Goodkind should have used the Sword of Truth to cut this rambling \\"epic\\" down to proper size... Personally, I have always hand a fondness for extended series, e.g. character development,detail oriented, intricate plots,etc.But lately, authors of this venue (Goodkind, Jordan, Wurts) seem to be stretching their storylines to cover through their retirement!!! CHAINFIRE is so thin it should have been a couple chapters instead of an extended novel. This is the reason I stopped reading Jordan's series. Unfortunately, I really like Goodkind's characters - so he'll probably get the price of one additional installment out of me before I join his character Jajang(sp) because the magic is truly gone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to his roots","review":"After the boring Pillars of Creation and the positively awful Naked Empire, I was skeptical and worried about Chainfire. However, Chainfire, with the exception of only a few scenes, is a wonderful return to a time when the series was enjoyable. It kept me enthralled until the last page, and now I'm rereading the series (minus PoC and NE) to tide me over until the next book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse yet","review":"the majority of the book seems to have been written for the sake of writting a book. skip the first few hundred pages and read the last one hundred. You'll save yourself some pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This truly is an awful book and I\\"m afraid to continue reading the rest of the 3 part series. Like everyone else, I've invested both time and money into the entire series and the first 5 or so were really good with full character development and dialogue. This book almost seems like it was written by someone else. The character conversations are, well, juvenile and very repetitive. I'm on Chapter 50 I think and absolutely nothing has really happened up to this point. Mindless dribble between characters that are being portrayed as weak and whinny about every single thing. I can't believe whomever proof read this manuscript and approved the book to be published was in their right mind. It really is awful writing and certainly is no Wheel of Time. Stay away or you'll be sorely disappointed and down right angry over this horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this","review":"I believe this book is just terrible. Mr. Goodkind spent far to much time reminiscing and re-describing places already described, not to mention the descriptions again how mord sith and mother confessors work. If Mr. Goodkind is tired of writing then please tell him to retire, this is absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time...","review":"As a Goodkind fan for over ten years, I keep buying his latest book with such hope - only to be extremely disappointed, again and again... Chainfire is no exception.Lousy, boring, way toooooooo long and the ending wasn't an ending (imho) since it concluded as if he said \\"that's it, I'm through writing for today\\" - and could have happened 300 pages earlier.<sigh> to say I was disappointed (once again) is an understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say NO!!!","review":"Terry Goodkind YOU WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER GET ANOTHER DIME FROM ME!!! I have waited for the last few books for Richard to become this gifted so called wizard, but NO he is just riding off of the coat tales of everyone else. The women in his life are the true hero's not to mention his grandfather Zed!!! I was yawning the yawn that really was a yawn. I wanted to rate this a big fat \\"0\\", but it wouldn't let me. By the way I totally used to love the story line and the characters, my sister-in-law and my self were huge fans. She is done too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the story???","review":"Don't bother with this book. Every place Richard went he ran into more characters and the whole point of the story had to be explained in painful detail to the new characters. I have read the whole series and this was one of the worst. Even a big important battle scene is barely talked about so they could focus on repeating Richards feelings to someone new... blegh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long-winded and repetitive","review":"This is a book that could be one-third the length and become a better product. If I had not enjoyed the first few books in the series so much I would not have even finished this one. I love the characters and want to see this series to a completion, but I'm so tired of the long-winded dissertations and telling the same thought in so many different ways. The back and forth discussions of why something could or could not happen often last several pages when they could be done better with three or four sentences. This being said, I love the series and hope that the finish comes back to its roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fast Read","review":"Chainfire is a fast read because of the redundant, repetitive and boring passages that can be skipped to get at the heart of the story. In Chainfire Richard Rahl reaches a lowpoint--as must all heroic figures--and his closest friends lose confidence in him. It appears that characters are congregating and moving together as the end of the series looms on the horizon. In Chainfire, travelling with Cara and Nicci, Richard visits Shota the witch woman, then he travels to the Wizards Keep to meet with Zedd where they are joined by Ann the secret Prelate, and Nathan Rahl the prophet. Finally, he travels to D'Hara, to the People's Palace, and back again to Adindryl. So, a lot of territory is covered, many passages are repetitive, but it feels as though the characters are moving together to present a united front in the final battle to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check it out from the Library","review":"I found myself skipping through this book because most of it is just filler. Unless you want to have the whole collection on your shelf, save your money and check it out from the library.Richard gets injured, Nicci saves him, everyone forgets aboutKahlan, Richard is the only one who remembers Kahlan, No one believes Richard, Richard goes looking for Kahlan. That was pretty much it! The most promising new addition to the sword world are a tribe of dreamcasters but they get pushed aside towards the end when it seems like the author is just trying to wrap things up and end the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stopped with \\"Faith of the Fallen\\"","review":"I don't read to be preached to on the philosophy of free will, love, or prophecy. The story gets completely lost. I won't finish this one and I won't buy the other one until it hits the $2.00 table. ANd only to finish the collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, BUT NOT HIS BEST.","review":"Ok, first of all I have to say that Goodkind is starting to write like Jordan. The first couple of books were good but they are declining as the series progresses. Goodkind has the knack for turning simple things into ten page explinations. thus makeing Chainfire 600+ pages.In this book you read all 600 pages, and at the end you are left hanging with alot of unsolved problems. But, still it is a great series and im waiting to complete the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hope It Gets Better Than This","review":"I have read all of the Sword of Truth books. Wizards First Rule was awesome and I loved the next few books. The longer the series goes though, the more soapbox speaches and the less story. This book was very dissapointing to me. Terry Goodkind has a great way with the pen, I can't wait for him to get back to telling a story instead of trying to get everyone to believe his philosophy.Another thing that bothers me about these books is the lack of communication between characters. I can't believe what the characters don't tell each other. The characters spend days and weeks together and don't tell each other important things that that almost certainly would. Very dissapointing book in a too long series."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of god finish the damned series","review":"To be honest, I stopped reading this series after I finished Book 8 Naked Empire. At that point I became fed up with reading the same story line over and over again. This series has been by far my favorite series if I exclude the last 3 or 4 books. Wizard's rule and Faith of the Fallen were two of his best, I think. Beyond that he begins to drop many of the great character interactions and quirks and starts becoming too philosophical and too wordy. I grew weary of the 3 page long explanations that could have been dealt with satisfyingly in 2 or 3 sentences, and I grew weary of Richard being an idiot and getting captured all the time, and finding some miraculous way out of it that somehow defines his new abilities. A word of advice to Mr. Goodkind; You should have ended this series 4 books ago, would you just end it already. Start a new series with new characters and I will read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Following Robert Jordan down the garden path","review":"I was so very happy to yet again be invited to feast at the table of Terry Goodkind. He had never before failed to fill me with delight. Imagine my disappointment when all he served this time was a few aperitifs, and long reminiscences of his previous endeavors.Terry has either fallen for the old tell-the-past-history-so-the-reviewers-know-what's-happening routine, or he has simply lost his passion for writing. This seems to happen to many series writers when they become too successful. Waiting for the next \\"Eye of the World\\" installment? Don't hold your breath. The \\"Explorer\\" series? Is C.J. still alive? The Sword of Truth series seems to be destined for the same purgatory. (...)Don't buy the book, you will only be disappointed. Terry says on prophets-inc.com that you need to \\"savor\\" the book, not rush through it. He also says it will be at least a year before the next installment. Wait for it, hope for it, and read this book as a prequel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not fantasy. This is propaganda.","review":"It was simply to frustrating a read, bear in mind that I've read all the 8 other books. Now I didn't mind Mr. Goodkind dabbling with philosophy in Faith of the Fallen, as long as it supported the plot.Sadly this book is philosophical propaganda disguised as a fantasy book. The universe being used as a vehicle to prove Mr. Goodkind's pseudo intellectual philosophies.A character like Richard simply disgusts me now. From being a boy with strong beliefs, he has been molded into a righteous tyrant, who enforces his beliefs upon everybody and everything. Its sad to see.No. I really recommend anyone to stay clear of this book, its not worth the read. Its an insult to the reader, with endless monotonies and weak philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"What a difference of opinion here! Some readers think this book was wonderful, and some hated it! Well, I'm afraid I have to come down on the side of the haters: it really is an awful book. Sure, most works of fiction require some suspension of disbelief, but this one goes way too far. I was too busy saying 'no way!' to concentrate on the story.As for the white pony the other reviewers complained about, what a stupid idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"This is one book I want to forget I ever spent good money on, or invested time in reading. How did this author get published? Who told her that so-called 'mystic ponies' belonged in Regency romances? And worst of all, didn't her editor tell her she'd got so much plain wrong!This book reads like it was written by an amateur with no notion of the habits, customs and rigid social structures of Regency times, let alone simple inheritance law. The characterisations are all over the place, and overall the book is just terrible.I can't understand how this book got good ratings; maybe some of us are more fussy about accuracy, realism and consistent characterisation in our reading than others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urghh!","review":"This book was bad. Totally incredible plot, no consistency of characterisation, and those white ponies made me want to be sick! This is not a Regency romance; it's a piece of poor fantasy written by someone who has no notion of the period in question but has a very strange imagination. Don't know how anyone can say the author is known for her research - this book bears no resemblance to the reality of the period or the habits of those who inhabited it, and contains some factual inaccuracies.Probably about the most awful book I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeewww!","review":"This has to be the most nauseating, unbelievably bad book I have ever read. Totally unconvincing plot, unlikeable and incredible characters and to add insult to injury, the most stupid, insulting plot devices I have ever come across. This book had no redeeming features whatsoever.A duke falling in love with, and marrying, the illegitimate granddaughter of a witch? The illegitimate son of an earl inheriting his title? 'Mystic' bloody ponies? I wanted to be sick.The saddest thing of all is that Nadine Miller's first book, 'The Duke's Dilemma', was just so good that I was really interested in reading more of her work. But having read this and 'The Unlikely Angel,' I'm almost inclined to doubt that they were written by the same person.Appalling. Truly abysmal.

The gladiatorial conflict between the psychopath and arch-fiend Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) and his nemesis John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) of the LAPD (cryogenically resurrected into the SAPD police force) is genuinely exciting.

We're not trained to handle this kinda violence!!","review":"For its time, this movie was rather innovative. If you recall the late 80s and early 90s, most of the action movies of the time assumed that the world would be completely dystopic by the 21st century. (SEE ALSO Robocop, Predator 2, at least half of the movies made by Schwarzennegger...)Demolition Man defies this by swinging the pendulum completely the opposite direction and pitting classic action archetypes against each other in a utopic future setting instead of the prosaic dystopic one.Some disbelief suspension is necessary to enjoy this. There's plenty of overacting and the whole movie's rather campy. You'll either love it or hate it. Most people I've talked to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't mess with a Demolitionary Man...","review":"No wait!?!

The plot is really stupid. Many important personages were not well developed. There were not even good actions. But, what the hell! I watched the movie several times and I have really enjoyed it. Why? Because Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock just saved this stupid film from crash. Her sweet way and nice smile actually transformed this movie from substandard to great. Stallone's acting and humor was terrific. Thus, this movie is really worth watching. Watch how Bullock said to Stallone quite innocently: \\"Would you like to have a sex?\\" Wow!

So both sides are vulnerable to damage. What made it even worse is the wide-screen side starts automatically with the Directors commentary turned on and there seems to be no way to turn it off.Finally I found it under the Languages menu option, which is NOT where it should be. Now to turn it off you have to select English from the first column of options, which then causes the subtitles to be turned on. So now you have to go back to the same menu, Languages, and this time move to the second column, subtitles, and select off.

But they're plastic, so that's to be expected I guess. I can't imagine them blowing away, but I wouldn't attach them to the downspouts as has been suggested. Because if they do go airborne, you don't want them taking the spouts with them.The finish is fairly realistic and will probably become more so once they weather. Or they may fade. I don't know. But they look fine as is and they do the job. They fit well with my landscape and they're tucked in places I don't see anyway, so once the newness wears off I expect them to become invisible.All in all a nice item at a fair price."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 pictured in discription, 1 received","review":"There really isn't much to say about a pencil.

Didn't the children deserve some kind of priority?

I must admit to being only 150 pages into the book and am weary of reading how Dad spent the family's dole money in the pub (which has happened about 20 times so far)while his children starve and die of pneumonia. The portrait of Irish poverty is gripping but degrading in its constancy and pervasiveness. Enough is enough! The style is flowing (storytelling style, not, great literature) and had the book been written by anyone else, I wouldn't have slogged through the Limmerick mud even this far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book about a man who escaped brutal poverty.

She is content to just sit there and exist. Her children are starving and dying and she doesn't even think about getting a job. No, she'd rather go begging for scraps of meat and rags for clothing. Why take care of your teeth? You can just go and get a set of falsies!The book was well-written and intriguing. My only complaint is that I did not see the mother as an angel, or as anything admirable at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very dramatic, but also interesting book!","review":"In this book you see the miserable life in a Irish town.

What, then, is the difference between his ability to overcome and the teens in Columbine who changed our lives dramatically? I don't have any pat answers, but I plan on using examples from the book extensively in my task of training foster parents. Letting them find their own answers to \\"what made the difference?\\" Thank you, Frank, for allowing us the privilege of getting inside your skin and living your life through your words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Everyone!","review":"I've read it twice and loved it...Even though it's about poverty in Ireland, it's not about poverty, it's not about Ireland...it's about the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. McCourt's writing style is what lends it the most credibility...in the beginning it has the quality of a child telling a story and it matures as he does throughout the book. I didn't care much for his \\"afterschool activities\\" in the later chapters...the book could have done without them, but I guess the crucial part of any memoir is the truth through your own eyes. The last chapter is perfect! I'd reccomend to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Must Read' for anyone who whines","review":"I swear I will never complain about anything in my life as long as I live (my husband wishes this were really true). I put off reading this book because when a friend described it it sounded so depressing. This friend would describe the authors hardships but with a strange smile as she tried to explain,\\"But it's not just about starving, it's funny. Trust me.\\" So I trusted my friend. This book broke my heart--sent me into utter dispare. But McCourt's down to earth writing style and naive childhood dialogue was hysterical. A four year old would really talk and think like that! I finished the book last night and didnt go to bed depressed--Instead I am truly grateful for all I have. I loved this writing style--without quotation marks and with run-on sentences. Children dont usually think in perfect sentence structure anyway. What an incredible story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angela's Tears -","review":"It is probably the most depressing book I've ever read. If you're down in the dumps to begin with - don't read this book.My mother grew up in an Irish family. Her mother had to live with her maiden sister, who helped to raise my mother and her two brothers due to a father that spent most of his time away from family and reciting poetry in bars for a drink. He only showed upon occasionally to give everyone a beating and then be gone again.From what I've been told, my grandmother would go to the rectory to ask for an annulment, only to be refused.I never knew that my grandfather was alive until he died when I was in the third grade.Maybe it was too close to home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angel's Ashes","review":"Not my favorite book.

Right from the beginning I was laughing.. then crying and repeating that throughout the whole book.I guarantee you'll laugh out loud many times, especially if you are/were a Catholic. The \\"Holy Toast\\" had me laughing for quite a while.Sometimes it's hard to imagine a life as difficult as what he lived. Having nothing to eat, or eating a sheeps head for dinner. The living conditions I think were almost worse. Bug filled beds, flooded houses or living behind a communal loo. This is one of the few books that I can read more than once and still enjoy it as much as the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela's Ashes Audio Cassette- Fabulous!","review":"There is absolutely nothing like hearing a wonderful story straight from the horse's mouth. I had heard from several people they felt this was a depressing book, but hearing it exactly as Frank McCourt intended, made it a very different experience. He made me laugh out loud, he brought tears to my eyes, he made me fall in love with this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for 2000: Angela's Ashes","review":"If there is a memoir you are interested in reading for the year, it is this one. Frank McCourt brilliantly describes the life of his childhood, a life some of us could only dream of. He describes to the readers the many hardships facing families growing up during Depression era in a poor town in Ireland. The struggles of his life were many, even with some days having only crumbs to eat. The reader can fully understand what it was like to live in such poverty, and marvel at how Mr. McCourt got himself over such a large hurdle. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, but I warn you, it is not fairy tale. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"humor I understand","review":"I was very impressd with this book. I liked it so much I read it in six days. I just couldn't put it down. I am waiting to get a copy of \\"Tis\\" because I feel like I need to know what happened to with the rest of McCourt's life. My father lent me the book to read and described it as depressing with a lot of dark Irish humor. I found the book very humorous and felt a common connection with McCourt. His experiences seem to be relative to all childhood experiences, just his are in a more depressing context. I felt the same way as he in many situations of my own chldhood experiences, which were simlar to his, yet in a middle class setting. I have to say that every Irish-American should read this book if not every American looking to laugh at life's depressing times, from a young Irish man's prospective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I wonder at people who call this book \\"depressing\\" and desire not to know about the reality of life. Unfortunately, they'll never understand the courage and the humanity of those who take what they have in life, do the best they can, and then share whatever they have left with others. Frank McCort is a remarkable man, a real person, with faults and talents. It is his unabashed telling of his childhood which makes his memoir so compelling, so intense, and so very REAL. If you can't handle this book, perhaps you need to take off the rose colored glasses and start living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelas Ashes","review":"A superb book I must say.

The best thing about this book to me is that it may be just the thing I needed to finally quit wasting money!

'Tis deeply disappointing!","review":"Frank McCourt's writing style is fantastic, but the content of Angela's Ashes leaves much to be desired. I like a book that teaches moral integrity, that shows that man or woman can overcome the filth of everyday life. This book did not meet that criteria."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"Yeah, I must admit that McCourt did have a hard life. But naming the book after his mother kind of put her on a pedestal in my opinion, and that let me down as I read the book because she was not a great person. And also, I think that Frankie (the main character) did things that other boys his age shouldn't be doing, and I didn't enjoy reading those parts, especially in great detail. I do not think that I would buy this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I think that this book is wondeful.

I thought it was insincere. If I were from Limerick, Ireland, I'd be offended. I find it hard to believe that almost everyone in Limerick is as cruel as Mr. McCourt portrays them. Mr. McCourt's book is bitter and raw, but to what purpose? I have no desire to read 'Tis, but I'm hoping that many chapters are devoted to Mr. McCourt's therapy sessions.I would recommend Rick Bragg's All Over but the Shoutin'. Bragg deals with the same theme, growing up impoverished and overcoming a difficult childhood, but he writes with a lot more sensitivity. Of course, Rick Bragg had a wonderful mother. And, I bet that makes all the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I wonder about the reliability of his memoirs. The Irish are great storytellers--my dad once told me that Ireland produces the best storytellers. However, this memoir is nothing but a revisitation of the same themes: Religion, Drinking, Sex, Poverty and then the kid grows up. I felt like I had already read this book while reading it. I don't believe it deserves a place on the classics of Memoirs. Read a Tree Grows in Brooklyn ahead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK! Don't bother.","review":"I looked forward to reading this book because of all the hype and 5-stars from the other readers, but I did not get past the first 104 pages. I knew I might not like it after the first chapter, but kept plugging away because I thought \\"it would get better.\\" Unfortunately, I could not take it anymore and it will go on my graveyard book shelf. This author just could not get past the father who drank to much and the mother not knowing how to take care of her children to the extent that she did not know they were sick. It revolved around the younger children dying and the older ones starving. Eating milk, fried bread, water and sugar, and eggs and hearing about a drunk father and mother unable to do anything while her children died around her are the focuses of this book. It did not matter if the location was Brooklyn or Ireland, it was still the same monotonous plot. I'm sorry, but it is not very interesting to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAMN GOOD!","review":"Theres a reason someone decided this was good enough to be a movie. Frank McCourt has an amazing voice on paper. Highly recommended for the \\"ponderers\\" of our generation. Please read his others-Well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one to keep","review":"I usually buy CD books for my daily commute. Most of them I \\"read\\" and then I sell them. Angela's Ashes, however, will stay with me. The story is sad, because it talks about a difficult life, but it will also make you laugh. Overall, it's just a beautiful story. And you can't beat the pleasure of having the author reading for you. You simply know that he's giving each word the exact meaning it had for him when he wrote this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is truly a great novel! Everyone needs to read this!","review":"From the moment I picked up the book, Frank McCourt stole my heart. I could really feel the heartache of a small child faced with situations that the characters live. Coming from an Irish family, I understand what my grandmother went through growing up in America with Irish immigrant parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela's Ashes","review":"The book Angela' Ashes is about an Irish family who traveled back to Ireland, after living in the ghetto in New York.They moved back to Ireland expecting a better life than in New York. Life wasn't a whole lot better in Ireland. His dad was still an alcoholic. He was still spending all of the family's money on beer. So the dad was drunk, and the family was starving.This book also talks about all of the problems they faced in Ireland and New York. Frank tells it all. He is very graghic with his descriptions. He makes you visualize the setting in which the story takes place.This book is a sad story. The thing that makes it worse is that this is a true story. Frank McCourt actually lived through it. This book reveals the true horrers of living in the ghetto, and the poor country of Ireland. This book catches your attention and dosn't let go. Once I started to read, I could not stop. Thats how interesting this book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Recollection...","review":"\\"Angela's Ashes\\" is a poignant, gripping story that reveals the the strife of poverty, but also shows us that humor and love can exist regardless of the circumstance; that all of us have the ability to look above our stations in life to what we want to be. This is a treasure of a book that touches the human spirit. Everyone should read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, saddest books I've ever read.","review":"Listening to this book, I found myself crying on a regular basis. It makes one appreciate what one has. I thought my childhood was bad, but it opened my eyes. Listening to it by the author added 5 more stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful book, when I started I couldn't stop reading","review":"Before I write about the book, I want to say that it's real difficult for me to write about it in english because I'm still learning to write english for school (I'm 17 and almost ready with my secundary school) , so that's why there will be a lot of mistakes. Sorry.What I liked a lot about this book, was the way it was written, simple and clear. The humor was also great, the book tells about an miserable childhood, but still there are things to laugh or smile about (not making fun, if I wrote that wrong) and though it is a book about an poor and miserable youth, still you can feel some luck in the describing of his youth (in my opinion). It's a real big book, but I was never bored, I enjoyed every minute of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I can't believe all the fuss and accolades about this book. To me, it's a load of whiny self-pitying tripe. Intolerable.1 star is too much for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relentless misery and a quirky style ....","review":"... I can handle one but not both.I am afraid that this is one of very few books that I stopped reading about a third of the way in. I'm now of an age when I no longer feel that I am obliged to read a book just because it has been venerated or is somehow defined as a landmark, though I admit that I will persevere longer in those circumstances. But when I decide night after night that I am not enjoying it in the least, and even that I am finding it a chore to read then I am old enough and ugly enough to consign it to the charity box.I'm sorry, because I love Ireland, and Dublin in particular ... my job takes me there several times a month and I am very fond of the people. I really looked forward to a good read. This wasn't it. Shame, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of a great read","review":"Although McCourt is a gifted writer, and I did enjoy many sections of the book, I found it too depressing with few redeeming qualities. As a Catholic growing up in the 1950's, I could identify with the numerous occasions of sin he portrayed. However, the ending was flat - and unrealistic. It seemed as if Mr. McCourt got bored with all the misery and body fluids and just wanted it over. The title has no relevance to anything in the book - \\"Angela's Ashes\\" appears to refer to his Mother, whom he left alive and well in Ireland and not deceased. I shall be more cautious about running out to buy any of Oprah's Book Club Selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"HONESTLY not worth all the hype","review":"I simply base my judgment in books according to the entertainment value. This book lacked precisely that, and I must say, it was a hard book to finish. I am surprised it received such a positive response overall. Shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book","review":"I have been an avid reader all my life. From all my childhood reading and all the marvelous literature I read as an English major in college, I can honestly say that \\"Angela's Ashes\\" was the most moving book I have read. It is amazing to see that any individual could overcome such dire hardships and sadness in his young life. The one thing that kept me smiling throughout the book was knowing that Mr. McCourt became a teacher and author and had a family and brought happiness to himself and so many others. I can't wait to read \\"'Tis\\". I also have my copy of Malachy's book \\"A Monk Swimming\\" ready to read as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done Frank McCourt!","review":"Generally I do not read books. I don't have the time or the patience. However, I was taking a holiday break abroad and thought that it would be a good idea to get a book for the flight to try to keep me occupied on the journey. I couldn't believe what a moving and gripping tale this was. Frank McCourt couldn't have done better. For three days it kept me quiet. What a good idea to tell the tale through the eyes of a child. Although it is a sad account of Frank's upbringing I found parts of the book very funny. I am looking forward to reading 'Tis' and have just ordered Angela's Ashes on DVD. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Irish Catholic childhood","review":"I thought Angela's Ashes was so moving, I cried through most of the book. I also laughted at Frank McCourt's sense of humor, even with the sad childhood he grew up in. Frank McCourt grew up with so much responsiblity as a small boy, he was a strong and compassionate child. It was unbelievable what he and his younger brothers had to deal with, and they survived it somehow. I was born and raised in the 1950's here in the US, the third oldest child, of a poor Irish Catholic family. We did not have a lot, but we never went to bed hungry. Reading his book helped me understand what dirt poor really meant. I thank God, my mother, and father for what we really did have. Reading Angela's Ashes has change my whole out look on life, I thank Frank McCourt for this special gift he has shared with all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to your hearts","review":"Read this book... if you've ever pondered the deeper meanings of life... if you've wondered why some of us seem to suffer more than others... if you can't imagine what there is to be grateful for... if you need a good cathartic cry... if you don't have time for your children... if you've ever thought it ironic that we (man & womankind) so often torture each other in the name of God... and especially if you've forgotten your own childhood experiences of discovering the horrors and the joys of the seemingly absurd adult world around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book immensely. Great writer and I couldn't wait to download his next book, \\"Tiz,\\" which I'm just in the middle of now. Captivating, real, heartbreaking, and told from the heart. One of the best I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"De-PRESS-ing","review":"I guess it would be a good book if you are okay with the unending misery of hunger and spineless alcoholism. These books where the wife is so noble and long suffering while the father drinks the money away are so miserable it is hard to read.I understand in those days, there were not a lot of choices for women with children. Certainly not divorce in Catholic Ireland at that time.I'm just saying after the first one hundred pages it gets redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written, terribly rambling story","review":"Honestly, I can not figure out how anyone can get through this miserable book. The writing is one continuous run on sentence. It simply rambles. And it is the same story over and over again throughout the book. Dad drinks, family has no money, and a child dies. Turn page and repeat,repeat,repeat. I read a ton of books, and can usually get through even the mediocre ones. This one however will be a fail on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Off Yer Arses and Read It","review":"This book was great. McCourt really takes you to Limerick as good as anyone could.

A cut that could've been good is \\"Homies And Thuggs\\" (with a raw verse from the late Tupac Shakur), but it's ruined by Master P's UUUUUUUUUUUGGGGHHH's. Don't waste your money on this.

I'm on a small budget, so I didn't want to drop a ton of money on it. I tried setting this up without reading the manual and I definitely wouldn't suggest it. After I read the manual, it was pretty easy to set up. I only have two complaints about the product though.1. There's no on/off switch for the input. I sure wish I could just turn off an input without turning the volume all the way down on it.2. On the merged 3/4 and 5/6 inputs, if you only have one plugged in (right channel for instance) it is bridged across left and right. However, if you plug in the second input, 3 goes to left and 4 goes to right, instead of bridging them across both channels. I know that it's the way it's supposed to work, but I wish it would bridge them.Other than that, it does a great job. Very solid little mixer. I'd definitely buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea for a book.","review":"I love historical photos of places I'm familiar with. This one is fantastic.

She's not just a tour guide, though, she's a native of her beloved Rome and has a master's degree in art restoration. Because of that combination of skills, the book is full of not only her amazing breadth of historical, architectural, and art knowledge, but it also has those wonderfully interesting little tidbits that only a good tour guide knows! So, yes, get the book for the cool, old black & white and sepia photographs and the new color ones, but also get it for the interesting information that will make you feel like you've been taken around Rome by one of its best tour guides. (And then when you're ready to actually go to Rome, look up her website and give her a call!) I'm thrilled to have this book...it will be a constant reminder of those wonderful days I spent in Rome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!","review":"This video was one of the WORST I've ever used. The instructions are poor, there are times where you can barely hear the instructor, and I became so disgusted with it that I turned it off a third of the way through and hopped on my treadmill instead! Just NOT a good workout! If you are looking for a great workout to dance music, I highly recommend MINNA's Cardio Emergency Workout. It's to Latino music, and is fantastic. You'll love the instuctor and can follow along very easily while still being challenged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed","review":"Want a fun 45 minute dancey workout to country music. You won't get it with this DVD. The music is not country and the only thing country about the whole thing is the instructor has pig tails and boots on. Even the people behind her can't follow her instructions and the moves are basically aerobics. I bought one for myself and one for my neice as a Christmas present. I just called my sister and said to throw it away before even opening it. What a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even use country music","review":"This was a sad excuse for a \\"country\\" workout. There's no country music and only a small handful of the moves have a country feel to them. The video seems barely rehearsed as the two girls supporting the instructor often struggle to get the choreography right. She seems to make the routine up as she goes along and mumbles a lot. I suppose I could recommend this to a beginner who doesn't need a very complicated workout because it was extremely boring for me and not at all challenging. I had to put another workout video in right after this to make up for the lack of a decent workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't think he was THIS good!","review":"I have been a Gary Hoey fan for about five years.

As a guitarist myself, it sounds to me like he has been working diligently to improve his playing ability. I think he has greatly strengthened his technique and speed, and this show is THE BEST thing I've ever heard from him. Don't wait, don't think. Just shell out the money for this album and soak up a HELL of a performance! Unfortunately, though, someone borrowed this from me and never gave it back!

James Earl Jones play's the dying deputy chief of CIA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown dreck...","review":"This third installment of the Jack Ryan series gets too confused too quick and can't find a way out. It also contains way too much action for a movie that wants to be taken seriously. Harrison Ford is Jack Ryan again, and he's the worst to date. Alec Baldwin will forever be the best Ryan and Ford and Affleck will just have to deal with it. In this movie, it's Ryan vs. everybody from Columbians to the president of the United States himself in a plot so perplexing it's a wonder the movie ever gets off the ground. This is not that good of a movie and a poor follow-up to the cool \\"Patriot Games.\\" I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER","review":"First of all I love the scenes where they used the Special Forces Group aka Green Berets. My favorite scene is where the point leader steps on the door on the ground in the jungle until he yells to his men DOWN DOWN DOWN. The other scene is where they in the river and in a comabt situation. The faorite scene here is when the CO [Commanding offifer] the one in charge goes on the radio and says \\"Vairable this is Knife I am not receiving but i said we under heavy fire and need air support over.\\"Overall I would add this to my collection because it has several scenes where they were special forces [just actors playing the role of special forces]involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a fan of John Clark/John Kelly don't watch!","review":"If you're a fan of John Clark/John Kelly from the Tom Clancey books don't watch this movie.

It was a great price and it was fast shipping too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Harrison Ford performance","review":"Although there are other Harrison Ford movies I like better; this one is very good. Other characters get in the way a bit too often."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is an abomination","review":"From the high rating I see on this, it's obvious that none of the reviewers have read the book. This movie, simply put, has nearly nothing to do with it. Sure, the general plot is 'sort of' there, but it's more like they borrowed the theme of the book than the book itself. You might want to see it for the sake of Harrison Ford, who does a great job playing Jack Ryan. It also does have a good deal of carnage and some exciting points, and even with the watered-down plot, there's no way to make a Clancy story completely dull. However, if you're expecting something along the lines of Patriot Games, or want to see a real adaptation of the novel, then you will regret seeing this movie. Tom Clancy didn't like it, and I didn't either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently directors and screenwriters cant read.","review":"This is a BAD film version of a GREAT book. nuf said."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very clear danger","review":"This is the second best film of the Jack Ryan series because the first is The Hunt For Red October. Tom Clancy is my favorite author and I think Hollywood should make more movies out of his books. Harrison Ford should have been casted to be Jack Ryan in the first one as well. This is a good drug war movie and if you love movies where there are people from the CIA, then this is for you. Great sourround sound and just a solid dvd. I really did enjoy the special feature on this behind the danger. It was helpful and interesting. It overall was a really cool movie with a fantastic plot. I think this si better than Patriot Games. It does not get old and is just a fast paced movie. I take a star off because I was looking for a little bit more action. Buy it if you like the Jack Ryan series. God bless you and have a great day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but better book....","review":"The third installment of Clancy movies and the 2nd of the Harrison Ford movies was better than Patriot Games but not as good as Red October. I thought Alec Baldwin was a closer match to Ryan than Harrison Ford. Ryan in the books seems to be Preppyish and Alec Baldwin got that to a T. Harrison Ford seemed too much like a average guy to be Ryan although he was better in this movie.

Clear And Present Danger is the third installment in the Jack Ryan Series, like the novel, the story involves around the death of three Americans by the Cali Drug Cartel in Columbia. The thing is, I read the novel, it did not involve around the novel most of the time, the novel had more suspense when you got to the end, and I think that they could of gotten a better actor to play John Clark (played by Williem Dafoe in this movie.) because he did not fit the role of a Ex-Navy SEAL, John Clark is bigger and older than Dafoe, but it is good nonetheless.If you want to love Clear And Present Danger, then read the book first, then see the movie, take my word for it, you will like the novel better than the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Ryan at his best!","review":"A really taught thriller with a detailed plot that twists all over. It was fun to watch this film again and marvel at how well-directed it is. A great script and Harrison Ford is awesome as Jack Ryan. The supporting cast, particularly Henry Czerny as the nasty CIA Operations Director, Robert Ritter, is also terrific.The High Def transfer looks great. I had read some complaints about it, but I saw no pixilation or artifacts. In fact, I was amazed at the detail, particularly noticeable in the stitching on clothes! I compared it to my DVD, which was grainy and couldn't compare at all.The True HD sound is really spectacular, highlighting the powerful and brassy James Horner score and a large array of explosions.If you're a fan of these films, it's definitely worth the buy. This film hasn't looked and sounded this good since it's original theatrical release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Intrigue, Anyone?","review":"Is there anything that Harrison Ford can't do?Ford stars as Jack Ryan in a follow-up to the successful PATRIOT GAMES. This time out, he finds himself tightly wound into a plot involving the US's highest elected officer -- that's right, the President -- in a failed campaign of the secret drug war. The script is actually penned by Clancy (along with John Milius), and it has an air of authenticity lacking in the other Ryan thrillers: it's a real story set in real place with real villains and real consequences, which makes for a more layered thriller than GAMES or THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.Excellent supporting performances are turned in by Anne Archer (Mrs. Jack Ryan), Willem Dafoe, and Henry Czerny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Just the escape I was looking for!

Otherwise, they are alright for 35 bucks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're no Bose...","review":"First, the main con - the headphones unfortunately lack good, heavy bass! The main pro - the volume and clarity are nice enough for you to still enjoy your music and block out external noises. They're lightweight; the headband sits comfortably on my head and the speakers fit nicely over my ears without pinching (even though I always wear hoop earrings - major plus). The long cord allows plenty of freedom and the volume clip is pretty convenient. Overall, these are fun headphones and great for use at work. The style attracts a little attention as well. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skullcandy S6TIBZ-BG TI Headphone","review":"These headphones have great sound quality at various frequencies. Though it's not comparable to more expensive one's like these Bang&Olufsons I have the price justified it. They've been comfortable for me except when I have earrings in. I can wear them all day with it becoming irritable. The cable length is short on the headphones themself, but come with an adapter to extend that. Works out for me because sometime's I don't need all that extra cabling. As far as I know they get loud enough without any distortion(without an amplifier). The build isn't the same high quality on other more expensive headphone's, but on the cheap they look great. I even bought the other versions to rock out with my different shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds awsome!","review":"they sound great and looks cool and goes loud but, the cord is too long. you can just stick in your pocket but it can fall out of your pocket so just tape around the extra cord and it'll sound awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift Purchase","review":"Purchased as a gift!

Specailly cause they are white."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more realistic view of the sense of magic...","review":"This is a highly readable book, and jam-packed with information and insights into Breton, as a poet, and as a man, who knew what he wanted, and what he imagined. This was a powerful collaboration between a poet and a painter, between Breton and Miro. Touching on magic, on the force and importance of analogy, on the struggles of surrealism during the years when it was considered to have passed on (proving to the contrary) and, in essence a very intriguing history of the spirit of surrealist exploration. Very much against the other review here, this is an important, and very powerful book. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable!","review":"I could not make it through the first chapter of this book. I am not an English teacher, but the run-on sentences and atrocious sentence structure drove me crazy! The author tries to provide a political context for the Constellations, both paintings and poetry. However, he jumps from year to year and place to place without transition. I found this extremely confusing and also incomplete. I was also disappointed in the black and white illustrations. I don't think the paintings can be appreciated at all in this book.

It's 120 pages of two elderly men who have nothing to say about Moby Dick other than that they don't understand it, and the only reason it's a classic is because literary critics have to like it so that it doesn't look like they don't get it. Why would I spend $10 on a book about Moby Dick if I didn't like Moby Dick itself? Really? $10 to hear these two pompous men complain about the book being boring? And despite the great reviews here on Amazon, I found none of it to be funny. I bought this because I wanted some outside opinions and actual insight on one of my favorite novels. If I wanted to hear two guys complaining about Melville, reading off sports statistics and obsessing over weight loss, I would go back to high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"I paid $29.74 for this book new and when I received it in the mail the cover price of it was $9.95...

It is not what you want if you are any kind of a Ricky Martin fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I expected this to contain live performances of this great artist. This is a documentary which interview people who have passed close to the artist. For example, a woman who works at Tower Records where he signed autographs once was interviewed for over 10 minutes. On top of that, none of his music was ever played. Even the interview with the man himself was dubbed over by a narrator. If you are a real Ricky fan, I would avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"The whole DVD consisted of unknown people putting in there two cents about Ricky.

We wanted to see him perform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low production quality, but somewhat interesting","review":"This is a low budget production that is mostly interviews with people that have met Ricky Martin.

There is one interview with Ricky (in Spanish)around the time he was promoting Vuelve spiced though out the video.

If you are looking for a fire magazine that is not full of hype and has serious professionals writing articles then in my opinion this is the one for you. Articles are based on fact and have been field tested many times. I think that Fire Engineering takes difficult topics and makes sense out of them, in a pratical and easy to understand way. In my opinion there are probably about 5-7 great/good fire magazines out there but this one tops my list. If you are involved with the fire service and want to stay on top of current, tested and proven methods this is the magazine for you. Although Fire Engineering seems to have its share of advertisements they do not seem to bow to any particular manufacturer.

But I also recommend it to anyone who is interested in the meaning of family in this country -- how we define who belongs to whom.Adoption Nation is a smart, thoughtful, well-written examination of a social trend that has silently been transforming the American character. This book deserves to move beyond the adoption community to find a place on everybody's bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letting in Sunlight on a Complicated Topic","review":"Adam Pertman's open minded approach to the tough topic of adoption will help the next generation of adoptees and their families. Pertman writes from the vantage point of a happy adoptive parent--as such he is sure to inspire others to adopt. He also champions adoptees' rights to information and access to whatever biological and ethnic roots can be determined. His confidence about the benefits of adoption enables him to tackle the secrecy and attendant sense of shame that has made adoption difficult both for couples seeking to adopt and for adoptees. Pertman's energy and optimism virtually bounce off the page. The vast community of people affected by adoption should welcome this approach. Not everyone will agree with Pertman, but his book is a must-have for the latest wave in thinking about adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Pertman makes a compelling case for breaking the seal of closed adoption records. By presenting important, relative, fact and data and poignant personal stories, he lays out the foundation for how adoption is transforming the family, and why adult adoptees should have the right to their roots. Anyone connected with adoption and/or adoption reform (e.g., legislators and professionals, especially lawyers, teachers, and therapists), will be enlightened by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adoption Nation","review":"Adoption Nation provides an interesting historical and sociological account of adoption. However, the author has a very clear bias and is not afraid to let it show throughout the book. He presents important facts, many of which I have not found in other books, however he does not fail to insert his own opinion about these facts in every place possible. If you agree with Mr. Pertman that absolutely open adoption is the only healthy alternative, international adoption is misguided, and that non-traditional families are morally incorrect when they wish to adopt healthy children (as Mr. Pertman and his wife did), then you will read this book without cringing. If, like me, you disagree with any of any of his very clear biases, then you will find his lack of journalistic objectivity disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read dozens of books on adoption and foster care, I was looking forward to this book. While some of the ideas were compelling, I found the tone to be too aggressive and some of the facts misleading. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't actually have this product!","review":"This store front doesn't have this product, yet they continue to offer it in their store front.

For anyone who has ever loved against all logic, this novel touches deeply. I loved the racy heroine of her first novel, Playing the Bones, and in Faith she has again created a vivid character of great depth and humor. Faith embodies the mixed emotions of those old enough to know better who nevertheless can't help themselves from loving against the odds. Redd has an incomparable ear for language, and her voice sings clear and true. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

Right now I'm listening to track #2 \\"Consolation Prizes\\", and I really like the rhythm of this track. The rousing drums and guitars have a real Americana rock sound you don't hear that much these days. Vocals, while not so original, are not grating or overproduced. I hear some electronic synths, but they're used in moderation. Nothing on this album is over-produced or overdone. A nice blend of catchy tunes and quirky lyrics.Overall a catchy and easy to listen to album from this french foursome. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet at the Rally","review":"Perhaps like most people I was introduced to Phoenix by their latest album, \\"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\\". I was worried, before I listened to \\"It's Never Been Like That\\", that it would pale in comparison to the latest album. I was pleasantly surprised. All of the tracks have an upbeat (but nevertheless genuine) feel. The sound is very modern: bits of electronic rhythms mixed with loud guitar; Thomas Mars's vocals fit the tracks well. All of the tracks are solid. Consolation Prizes and Long Distance Call are the popular ones, but Rally, One Time Too Many, and Sometimes In the Fall are similarly good. The vocal-less track, North, is also a pleasant addition to the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk Talk Talk","review":"\\"It's Never Been Like That\\" is my introduction to this French band, who sing quite well in English by the way. Singer Justin Thompson whose jazz gemBrand New Same Old Obsessionstotally knocked me out said this was one of his favorite bands, which brought me to it. I can certainly see the attraction. The music is original and bubbles with a classic feeling. \\"Rally\\" keeps varying the pace from the verse to bridge to the delightful chorus, \\"Don't you give me those shifty eyes, pay attention, dirty talk talk talk, quiet.\\" \\"Long Distance Call\\" crosscuts a lovely melody with the repetition of the lyric that becomes title to the set. \\"Courtesy Laughs,\\" the instrumental \\"North\\" & \\"Sometimes in the Fall\\" are also favorite cuts. Phoenix's delightful pop is original and sets a chronic smile on my face. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember when you liked the Strokes?","review":"No one's making comparisons to the Strokes. They should. There are similarities in influences, phrasing, rhythm.And if you've been disappointed in the Strokes recently, you'll be happy to know that Phoenix has no interest in emulating that downturn. They can't. They build better songs, they take more chances, they have a singer who can carry a tune. They have made an album here that holds up very well to repeated listening.So, my point: \\"It's Never Been Like That\\" will go down well with fans of the Strokes.If you're not a fan, you'll like this Phoenix that much more. It's great pop songs without the rumpled expensive suits. The attitude is in the right place: in the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun! Upbeat!","review":"This music will get you going...

So it was neat to be able to see who was responsible for the content of the site, day-to-day operations, and all the little things that I took for granted. I read first with trepidation, because the cover makes it look far more dire -- the frowny interpretation of the logo suggests that the author was unhappy with the company and will write accordingly -- but in actuality, he seemed more than fair, and there didn't seem to be any sour grapes about it. I gave 4 rather than 5 stars because of the oft-mentioned Emerson tangent... I'm afraid I haven't as much patience for literary diversions as some (though I am a voracious reader, go figure), but would certainly recommend this as a good, quick read about Amazon's early days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epicenter? Not","review":"There are too things you need to know about this book: 1) it is written by a former, slighty disgruntled, employee who was just that, an employee, not an executive that can shed much light on the behind the scenes events that transformed Amazon into what it is today and 2) you need to tolerate Mr. Marcus' writing style as he loves to unnecessarily show off his extended vocabulary in sterotypical east coast elitist fashion.That being said, the book is an interesting, sometimes insightful journey from Amazon's yearly days up until the .com crash in 2000. Unfortunately the author's insight seems to be that of just another Amazon employee. Even though he was Amazon's 55th employee, he didn't even have the clout to get a meeting with Jeff Bezos to discuss the book. I got the feeling that the book could have been written by an Amazon janitor who was there during the early years.I don't know of a better book on the topic, but surely there must be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful writer, a wonderful book","review":"Marcus swept me off my feet with this tale of what it was like to work at Amazon during the golden years. I should have seen it coming, should have known someone with his skill and sensitivites would be the one to document this tale. Frankly, I didn't, and am thrilled to death I didn't, because I dove into this with few expectations, and devoured it in one sitting. Totally satisfied, I can only thank him for his honesty and perspective. And, oh yes, did I mention the guy can write?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A look back at the halcyon early days of Amazon.com","review":"A brilliant insider account of what it was like to work at Amazon.com. The author was an early employee (55th) in the company and tells many interesting anecdotes from being called in to help package books in the warehouse to the introduction of user driven customized homepages and the waning influence of the editors at Amazon.com.The author has a friendly and humorous style of writing that makes you feel as though you are in conversation with him. A pleasure to read and also a quick read.

I really enjoyed the inside look at how amazon grew from nothing to something that is now major for the history books. James takes us on a personal journey of his life which becomes intertwined with Amazon when he is hired on at Amazon in the early days.I now have adopted the \\"Bezonian curveball\\" to use when interviewing candidates and as an ice breaker when facilitating classes.

He said his camo's were near new, the wind was at his face and almost everytime the deer would see him in the tree and run away. I told him to use this product because it will eliminate the UV rays in his clothing thus becoming invisible to the deer and if he gets busted it's his fault. With hesitation and skeptisism he washed his clothes with the Atsko wash and sprayed it with UV killer. Well what do you know, he didn't get busted the next time out. He said the deer would walk by or come to his mineral lick and never notice him. He's now a believer. Do the research on deer vision.

The ON/OFF switched only worked after repeated attempts. Very erratic. Absolutely no water protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking it back","review":"I bought this product at Williams-Sonoma and am taking it back after 1 day. When I got it home I tested it by putting the tip in ice water which produced a range of temperatures from 22 to 34 degrees. The display would show one temp for about 30 seconds then change. Obviously 22 degrees was very wrong, this was a cup of cold water with a few ice cubes in it. I would have understood a steady temp of 33 or 34, not 22.When I tested it by putting the tip in boiling water, it showed a more reliable steady result.The real disappointment came when I tested it on a steak I was cooking. The first time I checked it, the result was 110 degrees. After another minute of cooking I checked again and it showed 80 degrees!Back to the store it goes.I think I'll have to break down and buy the Thermapen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent - for a 1 time use thermometer","review":"I've tried 2 of these thermometers, and the same results with both. They work great the first time you take it out of the package. But won't work after that.In both cases, I pulled the thermometer from the drawer for its second use, pressed the On/Off button and \\"ON\\" scrolls across the screen (normal so far). Only, instead of showing the temp, the screen flashes and \\"ON\\" scrolls across the screen. This continues, and there is now no way to turn off the thermometer or get it to respond in any way.Tried changing the battery in the first unit, and the only thing that accomplished was wasting a few bucks on a new battery. No change in (the lack of) performance.I tried emailing Taylor's customer service, and got no response (it's been 2 months now).I'd definitely stay away from this thermometer, and probably all Taylor thermos if this is supposed to be their \\"higher end\\" line."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoddy construction, buttons poor, accuracy questionable","review":"I strongly agree with points made in some of the other reviews:1. Construction is shoddy/cheap2. The on/off button only works some of the time. You have to push again and again to get the desired result. And, in fact, when I first opened the package the on/off button didn't work for about a half hour. I was about to drive right back to the store with it when suddenly and mysteriously it came to life.3. The instructions for changing the battery are so vague (they don't point out where the screw is that you have to remove) that it's very easy to destroy the whole product while trying to get to the battery4. While I haven't done the freezing/boiling accuracy tests that another reviewer did, I have noticed strange leaps in reading from one minute to the next which really don't seem plausible.I'm returning this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the others, used once and then dead","review":"As seems to be the usual for this product, I bought it, used it once, put it in a drawer, and then found it dead upon next use a month or two later.No response from the vendor.Wasn't mistreated.

An extra hour of roasting later and my roast was still measuring less than 120 degrees, or barely rare. Unable to wait any longer, I pulled it, let it rest, and cut into it. It was almost past medium. This $20 thermometer nearly ruined a $208 prime rib. I am not a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This SUCKS","review":"It was a gift. It worked for a couple of months. Now it only reads 72 degrees. I called the company and they say I have to return it at my own expense (about $8) for an item that costs less than $20. Why should the consumer incur ANY expense for a defective item ??? I asked them to send me a shipping label -NO. So I told them that I would leave an accurate review. Read it and weep Taylor !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for other options","review":"I would not recommend this product. We use our instant read thermometer about once a week and this model stopped working at about month 4. We were very careful to only wash the stem and the thermometer was never submerged in water.

Worked ok. I recommend setting the auto-off feature, or you will keep forgetting to turn it off.I had to change battery after 2 years. Taking it apart, I found one of the small white wires that lead down the probe broken. I replaced battery anyway, and it turned on and gave a reading. I put it back together thinking it apparently didn't need two wires; had to take it apart again to make sure I had the parts oriented right, and the 2nd wire broke. These are too small to easily repair.Warranty is 1 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"Didn't work. At first, all of the pixels flashed on and off. It wouldn't turn off. After a day or so, it stopped flashing. I assume that the battery finally gave out. Unfortunately, there was no information about the kind or number of batteries it uses and there were no instructions on how to change the battery. I was able to get one side to open but I couldn't get the other side to release so I was unable to get to the battery. I was able to get an RMA from the supplier but the effort and cost to get a refund hardly seemed worth it. Maybe one of these days I'll be able to get it open, change the battery and find out if it was any good. So I bought a mechanical meat thermometer at WalMart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Unit","review":"I bought this item at a store. It worked out of the box for a while, but after maybe week, I noticed the the temperature was stuck at 72.5 degrees F. I tried sticking the probe in warm water and ice water, but the temperature wouldn't change. Fed up, I considered the unit broken and tossed it in a drawer.Several weeks after, I decided to open the unit to see what was wrong. After opening the casing, I noticed that the wires that run inside the probe and connect to the main \\"head\\" were cut. I imagine these wires are to relay the temperature reading to the display. The end of the metal probe is rather sharp, so my guess is that the probe was pushed into the main head of the unit, and thus, the end of the probe cut the wires from the head. Its kind of hard to explain without seeing the unit.I only read the temp on some steaks and such and don't recall treating the thermometer harshly. IMO, its kind of a design flaw. YMMV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, Easy and Sturdy","review":"I have used this for about two years, I leave it outside year round on my BBQ underneath the BBQ cover. It has always started up fine and gives out reasonable readings. Sometimes you do have to check a couple of different places to double check your results, but it is real handy to make sure your food is done. The battery lasted about 2 years and I just swapped it, BTW it is a CR2032 and to get to it you need to peel back the grey bottom plastic to get to a small phillips screw. Couldn't find that info anywhere.

This book is to be treasured and is one of two books (both by Lanting) on my coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good photos, awful printing","review":"I had heard of Frans Lanting as an outstanding wildlife photographer and jumped at the chance to buy one of his books for a reasonable price. I would have expected maybe $40-$60 for a good coffee table book, and now that I've received the book I know why it was only $13: the print quality is just awful. Resolution is poor -- every photo looks blurred; there is not a sharp contour in any photo (seriously). Many photos have a reddish color cast. None of the images pop out of the page. Most are dark and have no detail in the shadows. Bottom line, every photo is dull and nearly lifeless, even though the subjects are anything but. I am sure this is not how they started out from Lanting's shots. As an amateur photographer who has spent considerable effort calibrating my workflow for color reproduction, I recognize many of these problems as basic issues that any decent photographic-oriented printer should have solved long ago. But maybe that is the reason the book is $13."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrost print ever","review":"Poor author, Frans Lanting, who obviously put much effort in making stunning wildlife photographs...it must be really disappointing for him to see the terrible quality of reproductions of his pics.

It takes ten minutes and you'll be happy you did it. It not only improves on the guitar's ability to stay in tune, it improves the tone too. Don't ask me how, it just does. Also you'll probably want to get a decent bridge for it as well. I just ordered one off ebay made by TonePros for 65 bucks. The stock pickups are great, I wouldn't swap them out for anything.

It's fast-paced, and I really work up a sweat. It targets all parts of your body, not just abs. The walkers are wearing the abs belt (which you have to buy separately). I don't have the belt, but use 3 lb. weights instead. It works just as well.Both the music and the energetic group of walkers make the time fly by. It takes about 45 minutes to complete the 3 miles. Throughout the program, Leslie shows the meter at 1/2 mile increments so you can see how far you've gone.As this is in a DVD format, I should be able to bypass the sales pitch for the abs belt in the beginning of the program and just get to the warm-up; however, you have to fast forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Workout!!","review":"I absolutely love Leslie Sansone!

The people in her video are also very down to earth folks and extremely inspiring. You see people of so many different age ranges that it only motivates you to exercise along with them. You work up a wonderful sweat for despite the fact that you are just walking, it is quite a cardio workout and Leslie does incorporate kicks, knee lifts and kickbacks in the exercise along with some toning using the belt. However, since I don't have the belt yet I used stretchy bands and got a great workout just the same. I completely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Workout","review":"I love this workout DVD. It is not hard to follow and I love the pace. When I began using this product, I weighed more than 300lbs and I was able to keep up with the moves. Leslie Sansone is very motivating and she makes you want to make it to the end. I can't wait to buy another one of her workout DVDs. I did not buy the 1 or 2 mile workout, instead I just worked my way up and I finally realized that I could do the 3 miles and I felt great.

Gang Starr's Moment of Truth is an example. It is a rather classic hip-hop CD, but the songs are incredible! The lyrics are wicked, and the beats are thrilling.

Steve Tyler?...nah...his daughter maybe.They could have salvaged the flick by having more of sexy Christine Millian as a super hoochie or bitchy vixen in patent leather, at least get a thrill with her.Compared with say, Players Club, & Undercover Brother: both of those are also full of stereotypes & stuff we've seen before, but those two do it right, excellent movies full of action, comedy, soft & hard stuff, vixens."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is an absolute bore.

The reason it received more than one was because of the Rock and Cedric the Entertainer.In general, the movie was all over the place. Not in a creative Tarantino way but in a disjointed, several-stories-going-everywhere-way. And what about the characters from Get Shory, we saw Devito's character, but what about Renee Russo? They had Chili doing too much of the same thing over and over again(e.g.\\"Look at me!\\") and it just got played out. I don't want to give the movie away, but there were some characters, scenes, and plots they could have seriously cut out.Lastly, I like some of Christina Milian's music, but the story around her made the movie look like a personal career booster.Compared to Get Shorty, Be Cool lacks the smoothness, subtlety, and overall coolness that made the story short, sweet , and right to the point.P.S.-The ROCK IS HOT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I started watching this movie not knowing it was the sequel to Get Shorty. With the introduction of Chili Palmer and him staring the Russian hitman in the face, I was expecting another good movie. I was sadly mistaken. I feel as if Elmore Leanords's legacy is tainted.All this movie offers is an allstar cast. With John Travolta and Uma's dance scene I'm reminded of Pulp Fiction. The director couldn't even get that right. At the end when the singer wins the MTV award and the RZA and Fred Durst are shown, i realized the awful ploy of the movie. Fred Durst was funded and brought up by the same people who own MTV.

I said to myself, this is a must see movie. I like John Travolta as an actor. I have a few of his films already. This movie is a bit comedy,drama,gangster,and Pulp Fiction. The Rock's character was amusing,who would have thought he would play as a gay bodyguard. I'd recommend adding another good movie to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rock and Andre 3000 characters were great, the rest...","review":"Was pretty much trying to capitolize off the funny parts/characters from the first one. Even the new faces were still pretty much the same characters from Get Shorty. Hell, even a good portion of the plot was taken from Get Shorty.The Rock's character, however, was great! It was the perfect role for him, I just wish it would have been in a better movie. The satire based on his wrestling persona was priceless, and the homosexual angle had me in tears several times. Andre 3000 was good too, I could see him with a decent career in mainstream comedic roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disaster","review":"Sometimes when I hear an A-list cast will be bunched up together for 2 hours in a movie I hope that it is good, not for the sake of 2 hours, but for the sake of these actors' careers. In the case of \\"Be Cool\\", everything went to waste.Everything about this film was a big question mark. The first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. These are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad. They constantly reference a movie called \\"Get Leo\\" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty.I question anyone's taste who actually thought this was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"See \\"Get Shorty\\", skip the sequel","review":"Although \\"Get Shorty\\" is one of my favorite movies, this tepid sequel lacks much of the wit and originality that made the first one so good. It looks like too many of the sequels from the '80s: very similar plot in a slightly different setting with slightly different characters. As much as I like all of these actors, it felt like they were just going through the motions on this one. I also think the movie suffers from an overabundance of bit parts just so they could squeeze in some more recognizable names and faces. The only bright spot was relative newcomer Christina Milian, who can not only sing but actually looked like she was having fun with it. It's because of her that I am giving this two stars instead of one. Overall this movie was a couple of hours of mild, mindless entertainment, but that's all it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame sequel","review":"You know a movies bad when The Rock is the best thing in it.Be Cool is nowhere as good as Get Shorty.Most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking thru their performances.The changes from the book dont help either.Whereas Linda Moon in the novel was more of a Lucinda Williams,Sheryl Crowe type the movie has turned her into a generic R & B singer with the typical over produced well done but instantly forgettable songs that pass for modern R & B.Rent Get Shorty instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WONDER WHAT ''GET SHORTY'' WAS LIKE","review":"CHILI PALMER [JOHN TRAVOLTA, ALWAYS PUTTING IN A GOOD PERFORMANCE AS ALWAYS] DECIDES TO LEAVE THE MOVIE BUSINESS FOR THE MUSIC BUSINESS.

In so doing it lost much of the suspense, intrigue and humor of the book. Elmore Leonard is one of my favorite authors and I have read every one of his books in the \\"crime and suspense\\" genre. I have also seen all of the movies made based on his books. This movie is the weakest adaptation of all. I was really disappointed that many of the characters were left out of the movie who added so much depth and life to the book.

If you hated the movie you would still love the book if you like this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the beef ??","review":"I gave this movie two stars only because I am an avid John Travolta fan, and Chili Palmer is one cool cat. Get shorty, is one of my favourite J.T. movies and that's why I feel let down by this empty sequel. It's true that in the past Travolta has made some questionable film choices (or maybe his agent has) but this movie is all salad. A Long, drawn out, 2 hr collection of boring musical performances, highlighted by a handfull of great moments delivered by a chosen few(Travolta, Andre, Cedric and the Rock). Too much bun and not enough burger."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sequel Sucks!!!!!!!!!","review":"One and a half stars actually and that's only because of the very funny Vince Vaughn and a humorous turn by the Rock, apart from that this movie is total rubbish. John Travolta shouldn't wonder why he's not getting any good roles lately if this is the kind of crap he thinks is worth his time. This movie is 100% recycled from the excellent original and offers nothing new but a ridiculous singing pipe dream story and far fetched bad ass John Travolta moments. Everything that worked and seemed fresh the first time around seems tired and stupid this time around. Fully unnecessary and unforgivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"only an idiot would give this movie 5 stars","review":"This movie sucked...the only entertaining thing was Vince Vaughn and The Rock...Cedric the Entertainer played the big bad gangster (could they have found a more NON-threatening black guy?)...and why is he in so many movies? Cedric the Mediocre is more like it. Even more overrated than him is John Travolta...yeah he was OK in pulp fiction but damn can somebody please retire him again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel","review":"\\"Be Cool\\" is a disappointing sequel to 1995's \\"Get Shorty\\", a clever, funny satire of mobsters, mayhem and the movie business. Both movies are based on novels by acclaimed crime author Elmore Leonard.In \\"Get Shorty\\" gangster Chili Palmer comes to Hollywood to collect a debt and ends up falling in love with the movies. In \\"Be Cool\\" he has become a big Hollywood producer who is now bored with it all. After a friend in the music business is murdered, he becomes involved in a war between various factions of hip hop music. Along the way be becomes involved with a beautiful woman and guides to career of a talented young singer.The movie's big problem is that the satire is not fresh. The jokes about movie sequels, stars and hip hop music aren't that funny. Even the in jokes about Travolta and costar Uma Thurman's movie classics don't work.Rather than buying or renting \\"Be Cool\\" [which isn't], I suggest you reach for \\"Get Shorty\\" [which is]."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it 1 star because they won't let me give it 0.","review":"The most extraordinary thing about this movie was how boring it actually managed to be. Having seen Get Shorty already, I went in with low expectations, but it couldn't even deliver on those. I can only suggest this movie to those who really can enjoy laughing at how bad a film is.

I couldn't watch anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks","review":"It's rare that I'm moved to write a few bad words about a movie (and trust me this one deserves few words if any) but alas I must. I should say that I did not make it throught the whole movie (actually had I paid attention earlier to the friend I was watching it with, I would have barely made it through the credits)--only about 30 minutes--maybe. Let's say I stopped watching it when Harvey Keitel starts spouting on about the idiocy of hiring a \\"faggot\\" for a body guard (No, I'm not gay, just a non-bigoted person). OK, I'm thinking at this point, what's this all about? What it's a about is Hollywood at it's reckless and despicable worst. Surely Harvey's words and the earlier piece of meat scene with Uma Thurman prove that.

Poorly acted, poorly written, a poor waste of time. ****When I die, Im gonna petition God to get my 90 minutes back that I spent watching this!**** I mean the plot was so poorly developed, and all the characters were so out of place!

Its all downhill from there people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Two Hour Waste of Time","review":"I usually give movies like this a pass, but Be Cool was so terrible I had to write something. Get Shorty was a well-paced, well-written, and an entertaining movie. The sequel Be Cool was slow, poorly edited, and too long. The movie was more effective as a commercial for Andre 3000, Aerosmith and Christina Milian. The music scenes in the movie were far too long and a few of them were completely unnecessary.The only remotely funny part of the movie was Vince Vaughn and The Rock. The Rock definitely steals the show, but that is not saying much for this movie. There are cameos galore but no amount of recognizable faces could save this film. John Travolta has been in some terrible movies (see Battlefield Earth, Look Who's Talking Too) and Be Cool adds to the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching","review":"All \\"style\\" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The \\"Entertainer\\" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Lame.......................................................................................................","review":"I would give this movie (0) stars if i could. This movie sucked really bad. Don't even watch it if your F*ckin bored cause this movie is B.O.R.I.N.G T.O D.E.A.T.H. I went to sleep while I was watchin this movie. Trust me you will zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzoff in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reason to watch: Vince Vaughn as a pimp/producer/manager","review":"There is one reason and one reason only to see Be Cool: the outrageous performance of Vince Vaughn as Roggie, a would-be music producer/manager who thinks he's black. Seriously. Between the Burberry jogging suits, gold chains, played out slang, and Pimps Up Hoes Down attitude I was almost amused enough not to notice that the rest of this movie was absolute [..]. Almost, but not quite.So if you're going to watch this movie, go ahead and fast forward to all the scenes with Roggie because the rest of it is more or less useless. That's my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah","review":"Yeah, unfortunatly, this movie is LAME! Get Shorty was much better. But It's ok to watch if Iyou have seen Get Shorty first, and or have \\"realy!\\" nothing better to do.., and you should see it first before you buy.."},{"rating":"1","title":"How un-original!!","review":"I can't beleive how many blatant rip-offs there were in this film from the legendary \\"Get Shorty\\". I bought the special edition of Get Shorty that had the free ticket to Be Cool in it. I have been a huge Shorty fan for years and have read many Elmo books. The book \\"Be Cool\\" was somewhat of a dissappointment, but I figured that Travolta would be able to resurect this in film format. Wrong! It felt like he had a gun to his head to do this film.....if I had to hear \\"Look at me\\" one more time, I was gonna shoot myself!From character ripoffs to lines, I feel like they should have left Get Shorty alone instead of trying to \\"Cookie-cutter\\" it into the sequel. Bad job! It has actually hurt Get Shorty some!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"This is one of those movies you rent just to keep up with the Smiths down the street.Personally I found the movie rather dry and irritating. The movie carried a certain smugness that made me want to reach though the screen and punch John Travolta in the face. The movie fails to really come alive, it just kind of drags until it collapses into itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I don't understand the poor reviews of this movie. I thought it was hilarious, and the second half of it was just as funny as Get Shorty. Plus, this is one of the few instances when the movie is actually better than the book. I didn't like the ending of the book, where Linda Moon dumps Chili Palmer, after he got her career going. I much preferred how they wrapped it up in the movie. Anyway, it's great fun, and the cast is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWWFUL","review":"This movie truly sucks!! Get shorty is my favorite movie of AALLL TIMME but this movie just sucks. I walked out, not funny, not cool, and John Travolta forgot how to play the part of Chili and that Piano scene just ruins the pace of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"I cannot believe how bad this film is compaired to the original.Get Shorty was such a fun movie to watch, Be Cool is trash!Why would Hollywood make this garbage? One reason, money!Throw in as many popular actors, rapers, and singers as you can and watch the money roll in. Forget about everything else, it's just about the money. That's what it's all about with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is possibly one of the worst big budget movies every made. That's especially disappointing since the book clearly intended to be the plot for a follow-up to Get Shorty. Elmore Leonard received some sort of production credit, so against the better judgment I'd made after seeing the previews, I rented the DVD. The plot is irrational, unbelievable, and simpering. Maybe some music exec decided to water down the criticism of the corruption in the music business, but that's what the story was about. Without that background and with a completely plain and marginally talented remake of the main musical character, Linda Moon, the story simply doesn't make sense. This is the first Elmore Leonard movie I've ever disliked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the *#@%'s My Money!","review":"This movie proves one thing above all others - make a few hit movies and then you can foist any piece of crap you want on the viewing public. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies ever made. It could have been remotely funny with a little effort. But with John Travolta playing what appears to be s straight man, Uma Thurman barely acting, and Harvey Keitel phoning in his part, Vince Vaughan and the Rock are the only amusing part of the film. The writers even managed to make Cedric the Entertainer not funny. And lest we forget, the sicky sweet singing interludes make it almost unbearable. I want the last 90 minutes of my life back. The way I see it, the producers owe me $3.99. Perhaps I'll send Cartman and Kenny to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Cool...","review":"Picked up this dvd previewed from a local retailer. Get shoty was funny and entertaining. \\"Be Cool\\" is far and a way the worst movie I have seen in a very long time.After the first 45 minutes I realized that I did not laugh one time. Needless to say, I still stuck it out till the end and I did not laugh. This is not a comedy and was not funny at all.If it was not for Cedric the Entertainers speech to the Russian Biggot (a serious point of the movie), this movie is entirly forgettable.Typical movie for the masses. If this is the deffinition, I am glad I am not or ever will be \\"Cool\\".By the way the music also is beyond terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 for the actors","review":"I would rent this and not buy.

Moghul or Buffet or Peshawar really have nothing to do with the book it could be in timbktoo and still be boring. The plot is not only confusing but totally bizzare and left for the reader to imagine in the detail. Murder and sex is mixed in at odd places without purpose. This is not a novel, or a story, tt's a gibberish. Odd collection of minor facts arranged to no end. Try hard as you may you can't like anything about the book, neither plot, nor locale nor characters or the writing is of any consequence and one would do well without dwelling on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, AND an excellent primer on Pakistan and Islam","review":"I read this book right after it came out, and loved it.

Her husband, Zalmay Khalilzad, is a native of Afghanistan and a member of the National Security Council advising President Bush on Afghanistan and Southwest Asia. Dr. Benard gives you an up-close-and-personal look at Peshawar and the whole ambience of living in an extremist Islamic state.This was always a great book. Now -- after September 11 2001 --- it's also one of the most relevant books you can read if you want to understand the extremist Islamic movement -- and get some good laughs at the same time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting fictional look at Pakistan","review":"This is a great murder mystery which takes place in Pakistan.

Charnwood offers nuanced insight into Lincoln's mind and his character, probing much deeper and more convincingly than later authors were able. Charnwood's brief treatment of Lincoln's complicated religious faith (tied in with the section on the Second Inaugural Address) was particularly poignant.I suggest William E. Gienapp's \\"Abraham Lincoln and Civil War America\\" (2002) for learners who are new to Lincoln or have lost touch with him since 9th grade history class. Gienapp synthesizes all the latest research and criticism within Lincolnian studies into a brief yet surprisingly thorough 240-page book.After that, step up to Charnwood. It is truly great historical writing (almost literary in moments) and one of the best character studies published of a truly incredible human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesing","review":"could of been a little longer and alittle more details but very good i would recommend. to those lincoln fans.. more to go"},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Pages","review":"I guess it was fluke, but I have tried two (2) copies of this book and in both copies pages 233-264 were missing and pages 265-296 are repeated twice. Too bad because it cuts off right at an interesting part leading up to the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation and Lincoln's effort to keep the border states in the Union.Apparently the missing pages situation was not the case with the copies had by the other reviewers here, or........they didn't read far enough into the book to notice. None makes any mention of the problem.I give it five stars for the content that was contained in my copy anyway, but no stars at all to the printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding Prose","review":"Stylistically congested. Although written just after the turn of the 20th century, it could have been written a century before.

Result ? He had a grin from ear to ear. He loved it! I do too! It is just as fresh and important today , as I read it, as it was 11 years ago when it 1st came out. My son loved the idea that to be free, one must be an outcast in rational society. The free man irritates those around him. Are you yourself, or are you an image that others expect from you.

He was forcing himself on her even while she was saying no, and then when it was over she was smiling and content while he was smug and arrogant.

I loved the period piece and the authenticity of the time they were capturing. My dad and mom both agreed it kept with the time. I especially loved the Rosie the Riveter aspect, as that character always intrigued me and Goldie does an excellent job in filling that role. This type of setting and story probably happened hundreds of times across the US during the Pearl Harbor days. Maybe others feel it wraps up too pat (like a typical Hollywood ending) but I felt it was true to what probably happened in those days. I love this film for all the marvelous acting and pairing Goldie with Kurt was great casting. They do it again in Overboard, another often overlooked Goldie film.

McKanna skillfully examines a nineteenth century murder case that resulted in the conviction of a poorly defended Native American in San Diego County. From a messy crime scene that would make a modern \\"CSI\\" team cringe to an almost comical court case, McKanna shows that the conviction of \\"Indian Joe\\" was perhaps inevitable given the racist nature of the local citizenry and judicial system. In 1893, José Gabriel would become the first man executed at San Quentin.

One more important point to add: In the climb to the corner office, keep in mind that you never, ever get a second chance to make a first impression. Women show far too much humility about their talents, skills and accomplishments. If we want people to value us, we must first show that we value ourselves - by making sure our accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences. If we want people to hire us, promote us, buy from us, and invest in our companies, they have to know who we are, what we have accomplished and why they should have us on their teams!

So many of the negative behaviors Lois Frankel describes were things I did in the office on a regular basis. These behaviors were so ingrained in me: don't be too aggressive, apologize profusely for any misdeed, be grateful for any crumb tossed my way, and I sat with my foot folded under me ALL the time. I do agree with Frankel that it's difficult for women to get ahead by always being a \\"nice girl.\\" Her book struck a chord with me, and I had to work hard to forcibly change behaviors that were so much a part of me. It's been nearly ten years since I first read this book, and no, I'm not in the corner office. But Frankel's advice has helped me to at least be perceived as more confident and assertive, even when I don't always feel it. This book provides some very helpful advice and insights for women of all ages and at all stages of their careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Title...Good Book","review":"While the title of this book is offputting, the content is great.

But Frankel's take is that it is generally a mistake to stand beside \\"rigid interpretations\\". The truth is that if any of us (male or female) don't have the backbone to abide by and advocate a higher standard, we don't deserve to be leaders in our organizations.This book will confuse people about what to do in otherwise clear-cut situations. I suggest instead the book \\"The Servant\\" by James C Hunter. It goes to the heart of true leadership.This book also devalues girlhood and the best qualities of nice girls: kindness, modesty, collaboration. These are the very qualities most needed now by our families, communities, and organizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather be nice.","review":"I would much rather be considered nice and earn my way through this world the way I am.

Her ethics are a little too much \\"go along to get along\\"--if I were president of a company, I wouldn't think it was okay to discover that an executive's secretary had been lying to me about the executive's whereabouts--In fact, I'd fire the secretary. (Even just saying \\"he/she isn't available\\" would be better than blatent lying.) As for keeping one's mouth closed about sexual discrimination, there are more \\"subtle\\" options in the business world to address the problem than the book covers. Frankel does make some good points: the need to balance being respected with being liked; the need to consider other people's motives in deciding how to respond to a situation; and perhaps most importantly, that if you want something, you need to ask for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good, Some Bad","review":"I read \\"Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office\\" when I started out in the business world. While some things in the book are true (for example, \\"Waiting to Be Given What you Want\\" and \\"Asking Permission\\" are very valuable chapters), othera are just not applicable in several industries to be considered an overall truth (\\"Feeding Others\\"), and some are flat out wrong (\\"Working Hard\\").I found this book to have equal parts good and bad.

The author seems so bent on showing off his prowess that he forgets that we beginners don't know anything. And I check the targeted audience: Beginner to Advanced! My suggestion: (1) Though Macromedia sells Dreamweaver and Dreamweaver UltraDev, these are, from a learning perspective two different programs and you have to learn Dreamweaver before approaching UltraDev; (2) Buy Dreamweaver 4 Hands-On-Training by Lynda Weinman and Garo Green.

But when I bought this new issue it was a disappointment the sound was in the antique MONO, this belongs to the early 60's. The sound of this CD is flat and obscure. The technical features of this edition don't mention the media they use to make this poor CD. Digitalization is a resource available, but his one was a bad copy of an old Long Playing too waste for the years it has been in use. They omit the Wedding March, Edelweiss, and the introduction of the film reprise.

They have the reprise (from the scene with the big show before escaping), but they totally left out the one most people are familiar with -- where he sang with the children when he first discovered they were singing.The original soundtrack (RCA version) had it, but left out the second verse (where the daughter joins in during the movie). I was hoping that this new soundtrack album would restore the second verse, but it looks like they decided to drop it altogether!!Nice sound, though, on the others. And nice to have \\"Laendler\\" in there. But skipping \\"Edelweiss\\" was crazy, or a big mistake (since the later track calls it a reprise -- a reprise of a missing song!)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved the film, this is the one to buy!","review":"Those of us who love the show may find the film soundtrack a little slick for our tastes but individual taste aside, how can you argue with popularity of this dimension.

It cuts off the end of Sixteen Going on Seventeen, it doesn't offer the original time that the Captain and Liesel sing Edelweiss, it doesn't offer the music in the chase scene or the complete wedding music.

But when I bought the Fox 30th Anniversary Boxed LaserDisc it included the COMPLETE soundtrack on a gold CD. Not only did it include extended versions of songs (Sixteen going on Seventeen, The Lonely Goatherd), but also includes the waltzes played at the party scene, and the original versions of Edelweiss (with Captain Von Trapp and Leisl) and Sixteen going on Seventeen (with Maria and Liesl). The CD runs 74minutes and has 29 tracks. It is a must-have for any Sound of Music fan!

I use Lift-the-flap books with my preschool students for 'speech' therapy. I was disappointed that some of the flaps (first, fifth page) seem useless, and on the page with upper case alphabet, the flaps lift up in rows - not for each individual letter.

Full of emotion, it stirs the soul, and is a most enjoyable relaxing experience. But behind the composed, varied arrangement of sounds there is a message. It might not be a new message, but it is a positive one, and I can't fault him for that. It is an eclectic mixture of musical styles that crosses all boundaries, from soul, and jazz to hip-hop and ethnic tribal sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enigma...Deep Forest...Nitin Sawhney","review":"Although known as remixer and collaborator Mr Sawhney is also a gifted musician. His choice of samples and rhythyms ring around the globe blending deliciously on song after song. I first discovered him on the Cafe del Mar series Vol 6, not notable but original. I recommend this to those who like the above artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful mish-mash of eco-trip-crap","review":"This disk is truly as bad as Nitin's previous disks were wonderful. Take any previous Nitin disk, throw in some Alpha, a bit of Craig Armstrong, some predictable eco-freindly american diatribe, mix until extremely smooth and you have a prophesy. As with most prophesies there no good news about it. My prophesy is that anyone who buys this won't ever buy another Nitin disk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible introduction to fusion/world music","review":"Except for a few tracks, this album is pure genius.The first track, Sunset, is a good introduction to the kind of music you'll be hearing in the rest of the CD. A mixture of English and Hindi-dialect vocals, it is both beautiful and relaxing.Track 8, Breathing Light is my favorite track, mixing together violins, piano and fast-paced rhythms. I haven't met anyone who did not like this song.Track 15, Prophesy is a pseudo-tribal rhythm that starts slow and picks up with detailed vocals that accompany the even-more-detailed instruments. The pace at which the background singers chant at the end is incredible, almost too fast too pick up. Listen carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking for emotive music...","review":"I was introduced to Nitin through my cousin who lives in England. She saw him live in London and raved about it...so off I went in search of this artist. He was difficult to find; nonetheless I was determined. I am one of those people who love music from almost all genres, cultures and corners of the globe. In other words, I am not a radio-pop saccharine sweet loving music listener. I look for music that proposes thought (although I do believe even top 40 has its place) If you are looking for an album/artist that resonates emotion, along with a powerful subtlety check Nitin Sawhney out. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not programmable as described","review":"The description \\"includes a programmable thermostat with a 7-hour timer, allowing you to pre-set room temperatures for different times of day\\" is not true. This product is no different than other heaters that have a simple thermostat and a simple timer. You cannot \\"program\\" temperatures for different times of day. It doesn't even have a clock! No different than a Lasko which is much cheaper.

Last three words remain in my heart and made me feel the same cool wind (toward the future) which 12-boy Nunzio should've felt after the last summer in his boyhood. I think \\"PARADISE SALVAGE\\" is about an Italian-American boy's coming-of-age story as well as universal children's one. I was surpried at some critical reviews here and considered why? When we were childs, small things were not small things. So once you see the world from Nunzio's viewpoint,things were filled with wonders and I smiled,laughed,wept,thrilled, and was moved while reading. I enjoyed several episodes about Italian-American lives. Those are realistic and visual. I've read this book as \\"a novel\\" and I recommend you who want to read a mix-cultured and adventurous boy's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rights, Lefts and Rites of Passage thru the Junk Yard","review":"A screen player writer, the author has given us a book that cries out to be a movie and apparently is going to be. It has an innocence and reminded me so much of \\"Stand By Me\\"Even the chimpanzee who appears charmed me and I can hardly wait to see who is cast in this tour de force for actors.Great little book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on the money","review":"It is the vivid descriptions in this book that are its strength. Growing up in \\"Nunzi's\\" neighborhood, I feel that John Fusco has captured the experience of what it is like to be part of the Italian-American culture, and how it is viewed from within, and without. His portrayals of the ethnic diversity of a melting-pot town of different neighborhoods are authentically real, right down to the Italian ladies with the flowered smocks and rolled-down nylons. Also the suspicion of different cultures from different neighborhoods. It made me remember what a shock it was to enter high school and find that not everyone had dark hair and eyes! A great book on cultural dynamics, and the essence of the Italian experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AMERICAN ITALO CALVINO!","review":"What are they drinking in Avon, CT?? This book is the firstAmerican novel I have read that draws on the magic realism of Italo Calvino and jumps off the page into the room! There are times when I feel that the author is actually paying homage to Calvino--and at times Baricco--when he takes characters so farinto sixth gear that a reader with no familiarity of opera buffa or magic-realism might cry \\"stereotype\\". To me, this is exciting terrain.I just saw the author do a reading in Boston and it only confirmed my excitement. He said he is directing the movie version (I think). I say James Gandolfini as Big Dan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should stick to writing movies.","review":"This is a perfect example of someone in Hollywood who thinks they can write a book but so obviously cannot. The descriptive passages are endless (and badly written) (and worse: BORING). Every cliche seems to be used, every ugly stereotype (the character names alone are like out of a bad 70's sitcom). The pacing is rather like being at a wake for the dead relative you only met once when you were five. WHEN WILL IT END? I kept reading thinking maybe the ending would make it all worth while. NOT! But it wasn't even an ending that made me want to throw the book against the wall, at that point I just didn't care any longer. I bought this book because someone (the author's friend I think) compared it to \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" (I thought COOL! A mystery with Catcher elements) - and to that I say: YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! Salinger should sue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loaded this DVD and immediately cued up \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\", my favorite Police song. The sound seemed a bit off, and the video was surprisingly bad. Reviews here warned me that the video hadn't been cleaned up, and it hadn't, but it was something else. I put in my copy of \\"Every Breath You Take\\"; a collection of videos on VHS released in 1986, which also includes \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\". I picked a random frame, and did a freeze frame at the same spot on both my VCR and DVD so I could switch back and forth between the two. I was amazed at how much better the VHS looked than the DVD. And this tape is *19 years old* and has been played many, many times.As for the songs being sped up, I did one quick check. My DVD player reports \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\" as being 3:53. My vinyl copy of \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" lists the time as 4:03."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for Police fans","review":"So nice to have all the classic Police videos in one place for the first time. The Police emerged just as the music video medium was beginning to take shape, and they used the format quite well. By todays standards, these videos may seem \\"cheap\\", but for the era they represent they are just fine. As the band grew so did the quality of their videos. It would be interesting to see what kinds of videos they would be making today if they were still together. The bonus footage is nice to have as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"I like the songs of The Police very much, including their music videos, but whoever produced and mixed this DVD must have been smoking crack. I agree with Megan Foster from Hermance, Switzerland. A lot of the music videos included in this DVD had tracks missing (i.e. vocal tracks, guitar tracks, etc.). I thought I was the only one not hearing these things. I tried exchanging this DVD from the store I bought it from to see if it was just a bad DVD, but all the other copies I got were the same. About the only redeeming thing this DVD had was the documentary film from Montserrat. The videos on that documentary sounded better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Playeds repair guide","review":"Very good repair guide.

I found the directions to be scattered and not in an order where things are made simple. Only certain brands are highlighted. This may be a great book for guitar techs. In fact, it should be called \\"The guitar technician's guide....\\" NOT \\"The guitar PLAYERS guide.....\\" But then they wouldn't sell so many copies then would they? I'm thoroughly disappointed.

However to me, the presentation of the material, viewed from an instructional standpoint, is very disappointing. This lies both in the organization of the material (it jumps all over the place) and the vagueness or lack of clarity in which the instruction is presented. If your intent is as mine, to find a book that gives you straightforward clearly defined steps in setting up a guitar then you may be disappointed in this book. The author makes an honest effort to do this but then falls victim to too many ambiguous and indistinct phrases. The material is there but you may have to reread it numerous times to try and extract the actual intent of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative and friendly","review":"I agree with all the other positive comments (that would be all the other reviews) and I have one minor problem with the writing style: he keeps saying you should \\"get a professional to fix it\\" if you have any doubts about your own abilities... I wouldn't be reading the book if I just wanted to get someone else to do the work!I reffretted my acoustic that I've had for almost 20 years using this book and it plays better than ever! I learned a lot about many other aspects of repair that I might never use (and wouldn't have thought about on my own) but am glad I know now."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW -TMI4ME","review":"Really in depth.

The author skims over a lot of information. I agree with most of the other 3 stars or less reviews in that this is no way a step-by-step guide to doing anything. I surfed the net quite extensively and found instructions for exactly what I want to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Repairs, History Too!","review":"I agree completely with the other reviewers, but would like to say that in addition to the excellent technical information of guitar/bass mainatnenace, there is very useful historical information contained in the Guide. For instance, if you've ever wondered about the evolution of Fender guitar and bass neck shapes over the years... its covered in two interesting sections, one on guitars neck shapes and another on bass neck shapes.On the maintenenace front, even if you get a luthier to do all your setups and adjustments etc, this book is still very valuable in terms of being able to develop a basic understanding of what luthiers do.... so that you can establish a meaningful to a dialogue with a luthier on exactly what it is you are wanting them to do for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fan of classic music","review":"The music is beautiful, but the recordig quality was so bad. I would not recommend buying it because of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay.","review":"You pretty much get what you pay for. In the case of this laptop, you don't even get that.It is powerful enough for just about anything(other than gaming) that most people do, with its Celeron M processor.The screen quality is bad. The bottom part of it leaks a lot.It is entirely out of plastic, so definitely not sturdy. Mine bends, etc.Quite heavy, not for carrying around, yet not powerful enough to be a desktop replacement.My DVD player no longer plays dvd's without major skipping. This is probably party due to the 150 CD's I have burnt with it.So if you want a budget laptop, and find a good deal(ie. around ~$200) then get it. It can take a beating, with a few minor things going wrong.There are better laptops out now for cheaper than this, with Dual-Core processors, etc. If you can, get them, as this is now an 'old' laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Let's me charge extra batteries these extra batteries still work great after several months of use, I don't need to be connected to a charger with a cord when my battery gets low, I just swap out the battery..."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible battery -- don't buy it!","review":"My husband and I have two Motorola Razr V3s, and we needed new batteries.

The first one had been working pretty good for about two weeks until I accidentally dropped my phone in the water while fishing. I get it out almost immediately, by something has happened - I couldn't charge the battery anymore: \\"unable to charge\\" was the message on the phone. Fortunately, I kept my original battery that came with the phone, and it was still working - it just required frequent recharging (that's why I replaced it). So I ordered a second battery, but have had trouble with this one from day one. Some times, after numerous tries, I can get it charged, but most of the time it just doesn't work. So I'm back to my original battery and, most likely, will buy a new phone when I'm fed up with recharging every other day...

If the DJ was any good at all he would be doing the sampling too. And the masks sadly enough is far far from orginal. If you think this is heavy, that is really sad.

Aside from that, the \\"music\\" is just AWFUL, and I am a big fan of other REAL metal bands like Pantera, older Metallica, and Megadeth.

Songs like Wait and Bleed, Surfacing, Purity, Liberate, Prosthetics, and Scissors give you the feeling of wandering through a post-apocalyptic San Francisco. What an awesome album.

It's been done a million times and it was annoying the first.I noticed some moron called this CD revolutionary. No, The Beatles were revolutionary. People have been listening to their songs for 40 years and will continue for a many years more. This is along the same lines as Papa Roach. I once bet someone that in 2 years they will be forgotten.

I heard a live version of Wait and Bleed, and I decided to buy the CD. It is bad, really really bad. I like noise like everybody else, but this just does NOT make any sense, you can barely make out any of the lyrics. The music wasn't even good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...........","review":"I bought this CD recently hoping for some great metal. That's not what I got. All the songs sound the same, and the guitars are so dry and lifeless. The background sound FX are weird and pointless. The worst part though is the \\"singing\\". Slipknot are less a band than a noisy gaggle of maggots who don't know how to play their instruments. Why don't people get some GWAR if they want good music. All in all, this was a crappy CD by a crappy band. Don't buy it. KoRn blows Slipknot right out of the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I luve tis albim.

They came with high recommendations from everybody I knew. So, I bought it.I know this is supposed to be heavy, but there is a difference between heavy and try-hard, music and noise. This album crosses the boundaries.I call this album just a bunch of noise. I like heavy, I listen to Slayer, but this is just noise. Screaming and noise. I just can't handle that kind of junk.Slipknot's newest album, Vol 3: The Subliminal Messages, is a good example of a good Slipknot album. It is much more matured and has depth. I highly recommend that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! SLIPKNOT IS SO HEAVY!","review":"Yeah, right. I can't believe some people think Slipknot is the heaviest band on the planet. There are heavier bands out there that are being ignored and spat upon because people are listening to Slipknot and making them believe it's the only metal band that exists. All Slipknot is doing is making their fans think they're hardcore while the people that are into real metal are laughing at them. Even bands from the 80s make Slipknot look like whiny little wimps(80s metal is better than nu-metal!). Note to people who listen to rap: just because someone listens to heavy metal, it does not mean that person listens to Slipknot. Slipknot is a disgrace to heavy metal. Fans will be reading this and calling me names and all that crap, but that's not going to do a thing. That will just make me hate Slipknot even more. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to listen to real metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Ok wooow like i like hard rock and stuff but i meen where do we draw the line? Slipknots actual musicians are not bad , and i think it's great how they have 2 drummers, it's very cool. But what .. about the lyrics, seriosuly, anyone could do what they do they just scream all the stuff sounds the same, YAA Ripitty ... i am hated blah blah blah dude go get a tool album.i guess like if you were going to have a mosh or sumthing itd be ok but not just to listen to, thats about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"Slipknot doesn't have an original thought in their collective 9 brains.

And while you're at it, listen to the music on Trout Mask Replica to get a feel for what you'll hear here. Second, the music. Remember the movie \\"The Fly.\\" ? If you put Korn's first CD together with Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music\\" into the Fly machine, you'd come up with the music on this Slipknot disc. Don't know what I'm talking about?

I'm sick and tired of every 15 year old kid thinking that metal is rap music with guitars. That's all it is - rap, or shall I say crap. Also, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock are not metal either. If you want to hear some real metal listen to Judas Priest or Iron Maiden and get this garbage out of your head. For society's sake, please stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"This is definately one of the worst CD's I've ever heard in my life. Mindless screaming of meaningless lyrics and saying that it speaks for our generation...Okay. It is obvious that none of these 9 members has much talent - I mean, 2 of them just play a beer keg and 1 member is like a manager-type person. And the lead-\\"singer\\" does nothing but scream his head off. If you want talent, get an old Metallica CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is being TOO generous","review":"You can't even understand what the singer is saying. It's so bad that he needs to go back to grade school and learn how to speak again, then take singing lessons after 5 yrs atleast learning how to pronounce words and complete phrases. They have no musical talent what so ever. They just bash and jam and wear stupid masks.

HARDCORE, RAPCORE all there is to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"Apparently, Slipknot managed to make good sales thanks to the amount of advertising and merchandise they've been doing. Overall, this CD is not what I'd expect a good hardcore heavy metal band to be. Slipknot does have a few good songs here and there or in one part of a song but it's just not good enough guys. Although a good start for the band, if they keep up the way they started, then problems will begin to occur. Slipknot is only recommended for you if you're the kind of person to enjoy moshing. Otherwise, avoid purchasing this CD completely. You'll be disappointed as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Overrated","review":"Ok. i bought this disc when it first came out. it was ok. nothing special. then somehow these guys became very popular. why? they're nothing special.I saw them perform live at the Tattoo the Earth tour with slayer. Somehow Slipknot wound up with a 60 minute set, and Slayer, a much more skilled band, with a 50 minute set. That is an insult that some trendy \\"metal\\" band gets a longer playing time than such an incredible band as Slayer. This is an OK band, but i find they have a much too industrial sound than they should. And the lyrics are just boring. And the masks are irritating...not scary. If you think they are, perhaps buy the backstreet boys album? If you're simply looking for scary, buy Deicide. If you want REAL metal...i suggest slayer...maybe even pantera or sepultura."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to own","review":"this CD has a lot of pretty good songs. Wait and Bleed and Spit it Out aren't the only good ones. Sic is my favorite. Anyways, if your a fan of Rap-metal(System of a Down, RATM) or Speed metal(Pantera) then you would definately get this CD. If you just like creative music(Nine Inch Nails, Tool, RATM, Deftones, System of A Down) then you might want to borrow it before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one hell of a cd!","review":"when i first heard this cd, i was blown away! this is probably one of the best debut cd's by any band in a long time. with all of the members in the band(2 guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, 2 perrcustionists, a DJ, and a sampler and a vocalist), they create a HUGE sound that will floor you! if you dont have this, you better get it now, you wont regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"HEAVY METAL AT IT'S BEST!!!","review":"THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM I OWN!! Every time I listen to it it gets better. IF YOU LIKE KORN YOU BETTER GET THIS! In many songs especially Scissors it sounds just like KoRn but with the exception that SlIPKNOT IS BETTER THAN KORN! I was a die hard KoRn fan until slipknot came along. I still love KoRn don't get me wrong it is just that slipknot is alot better than their new stuff. Maybe that will change when the new album comes out but any way just buy Slipknot it is well worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY COOL","review":"This cd is blowing off the roof! the music is tight! and WOW 9 members! its also awesome cuz these guys are from my home state, IOWA! my fav. song right now on this cd is \\"eyeless\\". it just rocks. these guys arent like korn at all! but korn is still rocking hard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot's best Cd hand down","review":"As is a sad fact with most decent bands their first cd is the best one and the same is true for Slipknot.

A must own if you consider yourself a slipknot fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"All Slipknot sounded like to me was a 2000's version of Slayer w/a slightly alternative sound.Thrash metal is like science fiction...it's either done well or done badly.Slipknot isn't totally terrible,but they're nothing I haven't heard before. Slayer - satanic gimmick = Slipknot"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is much better out there","review":"this band is just another korn/limpbizkit band. nothing orginal. nothing all that good.

I don't care what you people say but these guys have made a bad attempt at trying to create a \\"Korn meets Deftones\\" sound. I know, all you \\"so-called\\" hardcore metal fans out there will dispute this and say \\"you just don't know what you're talking about\\" but c'mon, let's keep it real. It sounds as if Slipknot are just trying to go for some guitar speed record. I have to admit, some of the songs show signs of brilliance and good melody but then somewhere along the line they ruin it with unneccesary screaming and tuneless speed guitar riffs. Don't get me wrong, I like heavy riffs and screaming, ala Deftones, but this just does not go over well. I can't wait til the new Deftones comes out. Until then, I'm going to get some more Advil."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The F***?","review":"It is amazing that such garbage like this can be so popular; even more amazing that it takes seven people to produce this sound, even though you can only hear the words. Yes, I call them words because that is all they are. Just profantic words shouted in no sort of rythm and with no sort of pitch. My lawn mower makes more music than this trash. The only good thing I can say about this band is that... um.. I can't remember. It must not have been anyting important. Anyway, this album blows.

I have their CD. Sic, Wait&Bleed, and the hidden song are the only ones I care for. The rest of the CD is pretty darn poor. The worst part is...these guys are a Sepultura RIP-OFF! I find it funny that Sepultura has been making this type of music for 15 years, and then Slipknot comes around at the last minute and cashes in on it. Sepultura does what Slipknot does 100 times better, and they only need 4 band members, not 9. Igor Cavalera from Sepultura can drum better than all 3 drummers from Slipknot at once! I saw Slipknot live and they were terrible. I dunno, I think these guys are very over-rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah, blah, blah","review":"oooh! these guys are scaring me! with those 'crazy' get-ups and all... give it a rest kids. contrived poseur music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Metal? LOL","review":"I got this CD in August and at first i kind of enjoyed them but now i cant listen to this anymore. This isnt heavy metal at all. Sure you can say its heavy metal when you compare it to Limp Bizkit and Nsync, but this is not really heavy metal. if you think this is heavy at all you should listen to Thrash/Speed, some Black, some Death, or some Melodic Metal. This is just pop music with louder guitars and a pretty good drummer(I gotta give Joey some credit). the only people that think this is heavy metal are people who have never listened to real metal in their entire lives. and also these guitar riffs are the worst ive ever heard in my life of a pop band like this. and yes they are pop music. this one band is more well known than the whole genre of black metal. also compared to some death and black metal bands, they are not sick people at all. they just have this sic image for publicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a thirsty youth, but not much for me.","review":"Ok, I am a metal head.

LISTEN TO THIS!\\" Well, it was Korn, and I was impressed by how they fused some hip-hop with thrash metal. BUT, they weren't my favorite. Now, Slipknot . . . well. It's a good fusion band, they've taken some styles and fused them. Now, when I listen to them, I don't really hear something I can be impressed with. I listen to Korn, Marilyn Manson, and other Darkwave style music for the emotion because it is methodical. I listen to OLD Metallica, Slayer, etc,; for the A)Technical compilations B) Speed of the rage. I see don't see true emotion in Slipknot, and I can't relate to them.

Not that I particularly care for that genre, but I have heard some death metal; just one reason why this isn't death metal, at times Corey would go back to his normal voice and just sing or rap, meaning this would not go down in the death metal category. As for the music, it was nothing that good or nothing that I haven't heard before. I do think they have some talent with the drummer(Joey I think his name is) and some decent guitarists who can play their instruments and play them well at times, but do they have to swear every second word? And Corey does have a nice voice when he decides to sing with it. I've heard worse, but I think Slipknot needs to come up with something a little more original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I bought this album after hearing the songs \\"wait and bleed\\" and \\"spit it out\\", which are both great songs.

I would also say the album is quite original too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Err, dammit this albumn rocks","review":"i bought this because i heard wait and bleed on the drilling the vein vidio and that was exellent so i bought this albumn with the extra tracks and it was equally good. it was different from what i had heard befor, all of there songs were good and i liked the way they wern't all the same style. each song had something a little different which made me want to listen to the whole albumn every time i put it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I love this CD. There are a couple of tracks that I thought were dull and meaningless, but most were great. Any rock fan will love this CD, I promise.

The keyboardist plays no good key-riffs. The bass sounds dry, and the voacls & lyrics are just horrible! Filled with a cussword every other word.

This CD is the best form of anger relief for me - while I'm certainly not an unhappy person, everyone experiences moments when we just feel like going beserk, and this band provides an outlet for stress relief which won't result in anyone getting hurt.And, for anyone who is suspicious of Slipknot due to comparison with such rubbish as KoRn, don't worry; there is nothing that I can see these bands as having in common.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SlipKnoT is the best band!","review":"SlipKnoT is so good.

SlipKnoT did the whole mask thing because they didn't want people to like them because of there appearance, but because of their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative 10 stars","review":"These guys are awful. They try to pass themselves of as original but they stole the music from Korn (who suck as well) and the costumes from Mr. Bungle. Then people claim these guys are metal. Obviously none of the MTV soaked nitwits who listen to these guys have ever heard real metal. It is in insult to the gods of heavy metal! You want heavy listen to Nile. You want speed listen to Krisiun. You want groove listen to Death. You want catchy songs listen to Devin Townsend. Hail True Metal! Down with MTV bred stupidity and New \\"Metal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!!!!!","review":"This is a great album, I've listened to hard stuff for years and have never heard anything as good as this. I have yet to hear a band whose songs express even nearly as much power as this album does. It is is great album and well worth your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"It's pretty good. songs 2,4,5,6,8 are awsome. the rest are average at best (korn with less talent and somewhat louder). the singer sounds a lot like john davies on much of the album. he can sing pretty good though, especially on 4 and 8. the 3 drummers are awsome and the sampler and the dj are pretty cool. the guitars and bass are pretty average. the guys are pretty strage (idiotic masks) but the album is pretty good overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORCHESTRATED MADNESS","review":"Slipknot is THE best heavy metal band, EVER. With 9, yes 9, members, these crazy guys from Iowa produce a higher level of music. The only term that can perhaps capture the total brutality and awesome sound of slipknot is \\"orchestrated madness\\" You may think having 9 members is too many, but it helps create the music better, it wouldnt sound right without one member.You, really, really need to check these guys out. I like Korn, and Slipknot kicks Korn in the head and throws them around the room. It may take awhile to adjust but check out: \\"Eyeless\\" - \\"Wait and Bleed\\" - \\"Spit It Out\\" - \\"Liberate\\".These guys will be huge."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLipknot: Masks and metal","review":"Nine guys, masks, and Good metal? I wouldn't believe it either if I were you but the band from Iowa uses their talent and puts out a great debut album. Corey, the lead singer, a.k.a. #9 has a great deep voice that really ties it all together. Mic (#7) uses his guitar skills to keep the beat up and the heads banging. If you are scared by their masks and hate \\"screamer\\" music than this isnt for you at all! However if you like bands such as slayer then Slipknot is right up your alley. I would also recomend Iowa by Slipknot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I have ever heard","review":"My favorite band now. It just blows you away. If you ignore the 1st track numbers 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 and the bonus track 15 will all become your favorite songs. If you dont have the cd go get it now. I MEAN IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Slipknot Album to Date","review":"Slipknot at their best this album rocks on all levels great effects loud a$$ gutiars and fast drum beats. If you dont own this album or Slipknots Iowa or Vol 3 Subliminal Verses then get them I have heard Vol 3 and its not even out yet. Vol 3 is a more mature CD there are a few songs that are soft but all the other songs are heavy and full of great screaming. If you do pick up Slipknots first album pick it up in this format (Digipak) it has demos a live song and a hidden track at the end of the disc great album to own. If you haven't seen them live you are missing out big time they are way better live than in the studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick album.","review":"Personaly I loved the album and hope to see many more like it. It wasn't as fast as some of their new stuff (IOWA), But I think the songs had alot more meaning and thought put into them.Defiantly a good album to have in the CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album....","review":"I think this is a great album. they're carefree, balls-out insane, and they jsut put together an excellent record. i've been listening to slipknot since 1999, and i love their first two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most in your face albums I own.","review":"I tell you what. Aside one of Slipknot's single called \\"Wait and Bleed\\" their is no such thing as a heaver song on this disk. All of Slipknot's song are very [angry] and loud. I think thats a good thing for a change like other reviers on this page have said, even though some might be turned off by all of the yelling and stuff.Its not like Corey is unable to sing. He proves this in songs like \\"Wait and Bleed\\". I strongly suggest you pick up the Digipak. It is full of [awesome] Demo's, live songs, and remixs.Its well worth the money and haveing foever if you a metalhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy, dude.","review":"First of all, I found this quite interesting. Amazing drummer, for instance. Eventually, this had become the album I turn on when I open a bottle of Jack Daniel. Makes it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD to take into battle!","review":"As an Attack pilot in the military we are sort of aggressive individuals. Slipknot fuels that aggression even more. I love this band and can't wait for the harder, darker IOWA! Keep it up guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SLIPKNOT","review":"This cd has a lot of bad reviews, many reviews say that this music is just profanity and hate filled noise. Thats what it is supposed to be. Real music has emotion, you can feel it. Not the cheap so called emotion called love, hate is the strongest feeling, even people that cant feel anything(like me) can feel hate. And not all of the songs are filled with screaming, in my opinion the best songs on the cd are the ones without screaming all the way through, like No Life, Diluted, and Scissors. When I first listened to this cd i didnt really like it, but then I listened to it again and again and it all made sense. The same thing happened to me with Cradle of Filth and Deicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another (below) average hardcore band...","review":"Yeah, some of the songs on this album are good, but not many. Instrumentally, Slipknot is no different than their Korn/Bizkit/Deftones brethren, though their drummer is pretty amazing. But lets be real - most of these songs are pathetic musically. The masks are nothing but a gimmick, and I'm not sure why the heck ANY band, let alone a thrash/metal one, would need nine people. If you are big into the tones or Korn, then this is for you. If not, not."},{"rating":"2","title":"ThiS CD KiCkS....!","review":"Okay, well first of all I gotta say that this is one of thebest CD's I got! Most of it is pretty hard, but it's all reallygood. I can't say that there are any bad songs on it, but if you don't like the screaming effect, this really isn't a good CD for ya. This is one of those CD's you can listen to when your [angry], cuz it fits the mood. But over all it's the tightest CD and you gotta get it! But if you do get the new release with Putirty on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best album of the year","review":"The band Slipknot has come out with a brilliant masterpiece with their debut album. Their brutal guitars, teamed with the screaming vocals, provides an overall mayhem that has never before been heard. I honestly can't see where any comparisons with Korn originate. Korn has put out one good album (debut) and all their songs seem to sound exactly the same. And I'm not sure if I can take Jonathan's whining and bitching anymore. So the comparisons with Korn can stop with Slipknot. This band has burst onto the scene and will leave its mark as one of the greatest metal bands of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy child","review":"My son was very happy with the cd/DVD.He watches it every chance he gets and has uploaded the music to his phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing is better then the KNOT","review":"Ok we have all seen the heavy metal bands of this millenium (korn,limpbizkit,Powerman5000,Staind,Taproot,etc...)They are nothing like these Iowans who show what heavy metal music should be like. Slipknot brings Clockwork Orange arrange of matching outfits with Music that makes you wanna break things with a bat. This album is better than any album I have ever listened to. I highly recommend purchasing it, there is nothing like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but awesome","review":"Slipknot is the best CD I have ever gotten. This is the first CD i got that wasn't country. It was worth every penny. I love the way \\"Surfacing\\" talks about not caring about what other people think and to take them as they are. I'm sure anyone who gets this CD will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this CD","review":"I really enjoy listening to this CD. The selections bring forth so much emotion that I practically feel what Slipknot was feeling when they selected them. It is obvious from the singers voice that he loved singing these songs and that is what makes this CD such a joy to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, this one's a classic","review":"If you ever need something to wake you up from a coma, this album is the way to go. Get nine angry guys from the middle of nowhere and have them start making music, and the result is the musical equivalent of a slegehammer to the crotch. If you have an annoying neighbor that blasts R&B all the time like i do, just start playing this really loud, and they'll be cowering under their living room sofa. I think the best thing about this album is instead of the usual depressed, self pitying lyrics common to this type of music, the lyrics are much angrier and lash out more. This makes it more fun to listen to, for instead of saying how much they hate themselves, they scream about lashing out at the world and messing up the other guy. Needless to say, if you need a loud angry album to calm you down after putting up with a day of school or work, this is definitely the way to go.Any thoughts on this, e-mail me: Khutta@aol.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd kicks @$$","review":"The first time i listened to this cd i was just blown away by the guitars and vocals of this band.They are very promising for this being their debut album.My favorite songs are surfacing andsic because they rock and they blow you away.BUY THIS CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"my friend had me listen to this cd, and it is aweful!

This CD defines what's wrong with our society. Our children are listening to angry, hell-spawned garbage like this while we sit and wonder why tragedies are committed by our young people. This is nothing but pure trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind","review":"There is a common misconception that Slipknot are THE heavy metal band, that they're the heaviest there is and the best that there is. That's not true. What is true is that Slipkot simply talk fast, which has no place in music. Don't get me wrong, I love metal more than anything else, but I hate Slipknot. Slipknot's instruments sound more like a lot of metal bins being beaten with distressed cats. They are trying to be heavy, which really restricts their music. Seriously avoid, do not fall to this level. The only people I know that like them only do to fit in with the crowd. Music's about expressing yourself. Don't do it with this. If you really want to listen to something heavy, then try out some Cryptopsy, Morbid Angel, The Berzerker or The Red Chord. That'll shut you up and put you in line."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wonderful Remembrance Of Happy Times Past","review":"Slipknot's art is the music of high energy automotive crashes and would best be utilized as backround noise to a hacking murder. This \\"music\\" helps explain the descent of society into it's most primitive and barbaric roots.

Every parent should make sure this happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the 5 star reviews","review":"People that think this cd is worth more than 2 stars are just plain dumb and have no understanding of music in any way.

ITs not bad enough that they have no talent, but at the same time they have to have no originality, they borrow from past bands but dont add anything to the mix themselves, to add that they bad mouth their forefathers, korn, and act like they're a bunch o tuff guys and how everyone else is posers, but they dont realize they're the biggest posers themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This band makes me sick.

But lots of the songs are really addicting. and if your one of those ppl who only like this cd just because of Wait and Bleed, then you suck. cuz that song is overplayed and isnt really even that good. the songs worth hearing on this cd is (Sic), Surfacing, Eyeless, Diluted, Spit It Out, Only One, and Me Inside. But i would definitely recommend you try out Vol. 3 first because its much better than this cd anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is real metal.","review":"This is what heavy metal is about.

Instead expect lyrics about suicide, mental illness, murder, rape, drugs, and of course self mutalation, screamed while one chord guitar ballads are accompanied by drums that sound like a child banging on pots and pans.If you are battling schizophrenia and need something to relate to purchase this album, if you are looking for a good modern metal album look elsewhere.

Absolute garbage, stay away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn SU**S now, Slipknot IS now!","review":"After hearing only the track (sic) I would love the entire album. The songs are so aggressive, they kick you in the chest. Slipknot stands tall above all the current rap-rock type groups, that have followed Korn and have increasingly gotten more lame by album. Some might think that because they wear masks that that is the band. They're wrong, because the music is what makes this band, and it is spectacular. Slipknot is the perfect blend of new metal that only can be defined as Slipknot. They've developed their own sound, very similar to the way Korn once did. My personal favorite tracks are the first four actual songs. (sic), eyeless, wait and bleed, and surfacing. Well worth it's weight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, yes...","review":"This CD is unlike anything I've heard before.

I just have a hard time seeing why seeing a bunch of preppies in masks whinning about ... is so appealing. Bands like this are a dine a dozen, also if anyone has it read the Rolling Stone article they were on the cover of. I mean how arrogant is it to say \\"we rule your children, they do what we tell them to\\". Right there they wallow in the fact people love them for their total lack of talent.

I remember when there lead singer was like who came out to see slipknot and there was very little crowd response. This is what disgraces American Metal, no talent what so ever, these guy are an embarrassment to the world of music.

And they sound horrible live!! That is all i can say, this band kinda disgusts me, reminds me of how mindless and dumb music listeners are nowadays. Unfortunate really...seriously though, if you like this album, buy fear factory's 'demanufacture' the greatest metal industrial masterpiece ever.

It took me awhile to get into the album, but when I finally did, I couldn't stop listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the whole thing i think is sic...","review":"let me start out by saying that slipknot is something that you have to have a taste for, so if you don't like it don't listen to it! anyway this self titled album is a great cd, it features some of their earlier work such as eyeless, and wait and bleed. the band its self consists of 9 members: sid wilson(DJ), corey taylor(lead vocals), jim root(rythem guitarist), mick thompson(lead guitarist), paul gray(bassist), shaun crahan(percussion), chris ferhn(percussion), craig jones(sampler), joey jordison(drums). needless to say, its a big band that packs one hell of a punch! oh and to those who said sid does nothing for the band, your wrong! he's a great dj, and only does what needs to done so that he's not over-bearing! i geuss in closing i'll say that if you love slipknot, then buy this album, because its a great one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Every One...","review":"Indeed this is not for everyone but if you like Korn, Coal Chamber, or MACHINE HEAD this will rock your World. Slipknot is a very hard band with great singing by No. 8 (Corey) and Great drums and percussion by nearly half the band (there are nine people in all). Also if you have a chance to see them in concert BY ALL MEANS GO!( But stay in the back because the Mosh Pit gets very Hectic and dangerous, unless you like that sort of thing.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"¿¿¿LpK\`'¿","review":"this is probobly the best cd ive ever bought. this was definately not just thrown together. a lot of work was put into it- it only took the first 3 songs to make me buy the cd. the only way it could be better would be if it were made in 5.1 format - the band would have fun with it, but id be forced to buy a new woofer"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cds in the last 5 years","review":"Slipknot isnt a very new band(the roots date back to 96). They are an extremely talented musicians who know what the fans want. Regardless of what others think, they DO NOT think they are better than any band. They are very humble and work hard to win over fans. The cd is also identical to the US release with a bonus track and two demos. The bonus track is alright, its a studio cut. The two demos are of Diluted and Purity(later removed off the US editions due to legal problems). Personally, I think the demo of Diluted is, in ways, better of the original song. If you havent pick up the cd, get this edition..its got 3 extra tracks..or wait for the US digi-pak to come out in a month"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretend its pudding","review":"When the song (sic) started to play i was blown away by the intensity. i came to the conclusion when the cd was done that slipknot was my new favorite band. this cd is really brutal and intense. it is original also especially with the 2 percusionists and the drummer joey (who is extremely good). also this isnt ur average howling shouting metal singer. corey (singer) could sing regularly and scream good to. the guitarists are good too playing riff after riff. bassist has good sounds.sampler makes some crazy sounds mostly in songs:scissors, prosthetics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"Great album. Nice and aggressive. Subliminal verses is also great, they really improved their melody on this one, yet still keep all of their heaviness, unlike many bands who attempt to do this. Corey Taylor has a great voice. Shouting, growling, or singing, he's awesome. The singing shows up a lot more in Subliminal verses. All of their cds are great. Great stuff to listen to when your mad at the world or having a bad day. Just hard brutal alternative metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I own a different version of this same CD","review":"I have the same version of this CD, except it is in a DIGI-pack case, had the videos for Wait and Bleed and Spit it Out, the demos for Get This, Interloper, and Despise, and it came from Englan, not Japan. And it only cost me 52 bux in stores. If you ask me, you are better off going into stores to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously a freshman effort","review":"Slipknot breaks out of the box running, with tracks 2-6 being flat out awesome. Then they break a couple legs. Nothing else on the album compares to the first 5 songs. Nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent start for Slipknot.","review":"\\"Slipknot\\" is a good start for the 9-man band but this album isn't nearly as good as \\"Iowa\\" and \\"Volume 3\\". Iowa is less rap-oriented and Vol. 3 shows that slipknot has amazing talent they don't necesarily show in this album.Slipknot's self titled album has some of my favorite songs on it ( (sic), Eyeless, Liberate) but the album as a whole really is not very good. It starts off strong but the album has many weak songs towards the end, songs that are basically just rap with a hard screaming chorus. The album doesn't end very well either, Scissors is a creepy song that isn't enjoyable at all to me. I suggest getting Slipknot's other 2 albums first and then getting this one if you're a fan, since it is worth it for the few songs on it that are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell On Earth","review":"Well, in the confusion of multiple releases and altering tracks, this is the version I got. I would have far preferred the version with Purity and Frail Limb Nursery over Me Inside, but it's a great CD. The intro is not really worth wasting the time on, but it is a great CD. I just hope you don't mind hearing constant swearing. Wait And Bleed is probably the most oddball track on this CD, seeing as how Corey Taylor actually sings on it. The highlights are Spit It Out, Me Inside (good song, even though Purity is better), Wait And Bleed (who cares if it's the oddball), (sic), and Eyeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal!","review":"But very good! This is by far, one of the best heavy metal CD's I have. Good songs like (Sic), Eyeless, Wait and Bleed, Surfacing, Spit it Out, Liberate, and Scissors. I have to admit, Scissors is pretty sick in the lyrics. Oh well, who cares. Well parents can be a little over protective. But they will understand our music someday! Anyway, this album make you have adreniline rushes and it has very good guitars in it. What else is there to say, well, this album is well worth 15 bucks but I advise you to get the Digipack. That one has all the original songs on it, plus it has bonus tracks and demos..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd will change your life!","review":"This is the best heavy metal rock or whatever u wanna call it cd out there! i have let all my friends listen to it and they became obsesed with it and bought the cd like i did!I know a bunch of people that listen to nuthin but rap and still say how slipknot is krazy and that they have the cd!its freakin funny!So no matter what kinda music u listen to BUY THIS DAMN CD!Thank u :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW METAL/ROCK/ALT./DEATH/THRASH with a little rap.(notmuch)","review":"Slipknot is a strange crossbreed of metal new and old. I obviously pegged it for a Korn-alike right away. But after listening to the whole cd the comparisons drifted apart. The confusion of a new sound disorientates the listener the first few times around. I saw origins of Slayer, Sepultura, Pantera, and of course the ever present Korn. They have a distinct new sound that actually sounds better the more I listen to it. I give this cd a high replay value which is hard to find among the sea of BS today. I would definantly buy Slipknots second cd if it were to appear. Track #11 \\"PROSTHETICS\\" is a good adrenaline rush from hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot is the best metal I've heard.","review":"Slipknot is what everyone would consider heavy metal but I think it's just another way to express yourself. You really can't put Slipknot in a catagory. It's too unique to be put in a catagory. I reccomend you buy this album if you want something unique and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sic, but awesome","review":"Slipknot are one the best heavy bands to ever come out since Pantera, Metallica, Slayer, and Cannibal Corpse. It's so amazing how nine guys from Iowa that wear creepy masks and different colored coveralls can create such sick chaotic but awesome music with so much anger and adrenaline. Comparing Slipknot to that phony punk poser Avril Lavigne is a big mistake. This band kicks the sh** out of her anytime anywhere. Best songs include (Sic), Eyeless, Wait And Bleed, Surfacing, and Spit It Out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, Hard, and emotionaly beautiful","review":"This cd is very hard and raw. It combines the most brutal music in america to this point and takes it to another level.But unlike talentless repedative bands like metalica and megadeth, Slipknot actualy have something to say. Even with their hard sound they keep lyrics that are very in-depth and emotional. No other band has been able to blend poetry, emotion and a hard unique sound into one cd as slipknot have.I would give this five stars, but the only thing I did not like was the Purity wasn't included here. Not to say I dont love the rest of the cd, but that song would have made it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"those poor animals... i think","review":"Is this music? Seriously i'm not joking. Is this music or cats getting tortured?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this crap ?","review":"Slipknot sounds horrible and if you like them? You need help bad. I can see slipknot fans being the ones at the mall, playin vdeo game, watching mtv all day and going to every off crap fest...There is. You guys are a bunch of groupies, specially the ones that calls themselfes \\"maggots\\", it should be more like \\"fag*ots\\" haha!All you nu-metal/mtv retards should all just die! By the way, i heard that Corey is gay. Do not bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"top 40 metal","review":"HA, ya right. This band is horribly cliched, they're about as \\"metal,\\" as good charolette. You want metal get \\"Dying Fetus, or Cannibal Corpse, or Dimmu Borgir,\\" not this becuase this is pretty much skin head metal (aka for stupid bald kids from the south,) Anyway, DO NOT BUY THIS, DO NOT BUY KORN, THEY ARE ALL TRL \\"METAL,\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent....?","review":"Now, I listen to just about any kind of music, but i refuse to listen to any band that has 10 members and still sounds like crap. There is nothing in this CD but screaming and cacouphinous melodies (if u can even call them melodies). Thank god I only borrowed the CD from a friend and didn't waste my money on this pile udder nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"Slipknot is a great band. People who are REAL metal fans should calm down. Joey is a good drummer, he can do nice job even in another REAL metal band. I like Corey Taylor's voice, he's not like really death metal but it just not bad. Shadow Fall's singer is pretty much like him.This album still catchy and fun. They might not a METAL band(cuz they have bad dj) or they're not from Europe or they're not HEAVY enough, but I still like it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is music???????","review":"Who would listen to this crap?????? This has got to be one of the most lame excuses for music I have ever heard. THIS IS NOT MISIC IT IS ROCK GARBAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"and now a word on talent...","review":"I'd like to talk about talent, or the lack of it in slipknot's case. frankly, they aren't any good. Screaming is something I can do, so I don't see any need to waste good money to hear someone else do it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW SLIPKNOT 9 MEMBERS SO BAD","review":"wow slipknot, i do not own this cd but please look at the album cover, 9 members that is almost enough to hate them. Then try listening to them, Corey Taylor might have some talent but doesnt use it at all. After hearing songs as wait and bleed and spit it out this band is quite possibly the worst band out there today. Why are there 9 people! Seriously 3 drummers?!?!. Why do they wear masks?!they think there so hardcore because they of this but there not. they are simply retarted. If you want good metal out there i suggest everyone buy system of a down,both of their cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap For Your Mind","review":"Thank you slipknot for giving true metal a bad image and making true metal heads look stupid. I am sorry but if you listen to slipknot you arent very hardcore. Slipknot cant compare to infamed bands such as cryptopsy or nile because its purely power cords overpowering bass and awful drumming. Give me a break... You where haloween masks and plumber suits, very original. I believe that if you listen to Slipknot you either must be 10 years old or you are deafened by the sound of talent grouped by hardcore bands. To clasify this music i will use three words \\"Alternative to Talent\\". Also before i finish i would also like to point out the fact that they have 9 members..... That sorta reminds me of grade 3 when i tried to start a band and every kid in the class was in it.To sum it up i give slipknot 0 out of 5 because they make sofisticated metal look awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From Slipknot!","review":"How do \\"bands\\" like Slipknot get signed anyway? No Talent what so ever! However, I won't say that Slipknot are Korn Klones. With Korn, you can actually hear some emotion in the music, lyrics, and singing. With the exception of Metallica (old and new), RATM, NIN, Ozzy/Sabbath, & Type O-, I barely listen to metal. Slipknot make me thankful for that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is music, then I'm Mozart","review":"Oh boy. Yet another band full of angry people (or at least people acting very angry because it's \\"cool\\" to have a negative attitude), with a lead singer that screams obscenities instead of sings, instrumental parts that more resemble the sounds of construction work than music, the obligatory scary picture and parental advisory sticker on the front, and an overbearingly bleak and extremely pessimistic worldview.I play piano, drums and guitar, and don't think I'm all that great, but I feel like my musical skills are pretty darn good when I listen to utter rubbish like this. And in the space of 30 years, we've gone from \\"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make\\" to...whatever this is. I'm guessing these guys are seriously PO'd about something. Yep...rich and PO'd. Seems to be the norm these days. Sorry, I just can't share the mad-at-everything outlook of these sorts of bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very let down...","review":"Gee, I remember getting this CD before it was even released..my friend works in a record store and got the promo copy for a friend of mine...we loved it, and they were one of my favorite bands. I first heard of Slipknot way back in April of '99 when I got their demo tape at a concert..no one had heard of them, and I liked it like that. But the point of all this is--Slipknot sold out...big time. Now I am not like the other people that think a band has sold out because they are on the radio or MTV, which is fine, but if they change their music so they are played on MTV or the radio, then I consider that selling out. My case in point...\\"Wait and Bleed\\". I heard it on the radio with the second verse completly changed..no longer does Corey scream, but he sings normally...Slipknot, I am very letdown.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is mind blowingly terrible","review":"Don't get me wrong. It's not that i don't like hardcore bands or music that is made with passion, but it's just that.this band is continually supported by people claiming that it is poetic and passionately expressive, but in actuality it is just 9 people getting together and making a lot of noise while someon screams about how everyone hates them and how terrible people in the world today are. This id the kin=d of thing that i find disgusting and am shocked that people actually buy it.I would encourage you to buy a cd by The Mars Volta or by At the Drive in if you want to hear actually strongly passionate music and something by opeth if you want to hear actually good heavy music.this band is just the worst in the history of the world"},{"rating":"1","title":"EGG PLANT...YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU DONT LIKE DMX OR THE GAME,BUT YET YOU LIKE BULLSH*T LIKE THIS?","review":"EGG PLANT WHAT A CRAB AZZ NAME...YOU WEAK,YOU SUCK,I'M NOT ONLY TELLING YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THA RAP GAME...TRY STAYING AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a 9 piece with the creativy of none","review":"9 people and this product?

An intestinal disorder characterized by the abnormal fluidity and frequency of fecal evacuations.Slipknot, noun. A nine-member poser nu-metal band characterized by the production of an abnormal quantity of trite and worthless \\"musical\\" garbage/psychological excrement. This creative equivalent of a bowel movement has for its foundation deeply unintelligent lyrics in which four-letter words are indispensable tools for maintaining poetic value and a mindless bludgeoning of the guitars to produce toneless sonic distortions forms the backbone of the \\"music.\\" The heartbeat of the aural turd that is Slipknot is provided by Joey the Drummer, whose contributions include rhythm less pounding and yet another rubber mask. Corey the Vocalist tops it all off by delivering the aforementioned lyrics with all the emotion and vocal range of a female baboon in labor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Slipknot, Slipknot.....","review":"First, let me say that I have mucho conflicted feelings about this band. My sister loves them, so I feel bad trashing them, and yet I do it so often. My problem with them is that when I listen to them I don't hear much. I look at their lyrics and I don't see much. The writing is juvenile at best, and all of those guys just create a wall of sound, and not a good one. The masks and such seem like a contrived marketing ploy, and I hate when a band does that. Oh, and don't think I can't take such \\"heavy\\" metal. My favorite band is Emperor, so there. I like my metal intelligent and real, and Slipknot comes across as neither of these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backtrack","review":"As i said in my review for the IOWA album, i have only recently been getting into Slipknot so i thought that i had better review this album. My first contact with this album was at a friends, who plays this cd religiously everynight, so i had heard all of the songs, but the more i listened to it the better it became. My favourite tracks are Wait And Bleed, Spit It Out, No Life, Me Inside and Only One. This album is what kickdtarted this band and propelled them to dizzy heights and IOWA is what is going to keep them there for a long time to come"},{"rating":"2","title":"grrrrrrr........","review":"Although Slipknot may not necessarily be the heaviest band out there, they have to be the heaviest band to become this popular and I think the biggest reason for that can be summed up in one word: INTENSITY! If this record doesn't make you agitated, hyper, destructive, etc., then you ain't alive. The only warning I would make to the potential buyer is that this is definitely an album you have to listen to a few times before you understand it, i.e., the first time you listen to it you'll probably think it's just a bunch of atonal noise and incoherent screaming. Oh yeah, and if you think bands like limp bizkit, papa roach, and staind are \\"heavy metal\\", then stay far, far away fom this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the love...","review":"Slipknot is a band to be reckoned with. Their debut album is a perfect example of how insane these guys really are. They have one of the heaviest, most incredible forms of metal around today in their music.

I urge you not to miss out on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot Import","review":"This cd is good. I love it. The demos are awesome. If you liked the original Cd you will like this one.

This cd has 9 freaks with their crazy masks and industrial jumpsuits tearing up their down-tuned guitars and drums. The songs are very loud (what would you expect with 9 people) and everyone (except for scissors) are perfect for the mosh pit. Whoever said that Slipknot has too many people are wrong. Even without the DJ they just wouldn't be the same. You can't really label Slipknot as one thing. They're neo-metal, hip hop, and a little bit of techno and rap. But most of what Slipknot is, is pure adrenaline and rage. This cd is a must for any metal fan and I hope Slipknot can make more excellent cds in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme Vibes!","review":"This Album is a CD that many people can not live with out, If you like Death Metal/Hardcore stuff, like KoRn P.O.D.

Im up and open for new things but i just dont think this band has any talent. Then to my surprise i find out that this band consists of NINE people!!?!

I had to sit through their hour long set at ozzfest and it only made me annoyesd and gave me a headache.What an overhyped thrash. They suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big cluttered mess of an album","review":"How the heck do you produce the record of a band with nine members without having it sound like a big cluttered mess? You can't, and that's exactly what this album is. Yes I do admit it must be pretty great to see this band live, few can match Slipknot intensity wise but the songs are just noise, there's too much instrumentation and it sounds terrible. The only good track here is Purity, the rest is just unlistenable. I'm a metal fan and I do know the difference between this and Limp Bizkit, and yes this is real but it sounds like the band just decides to play heavy stuff for the heck of it meaning this is just stupid tasteless track after stupid tasteless track. If you want something that'll get your head banging and that has some diversity go get some Slayer, leave this one on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disgracing","review":"I cannot believe people call these guys metal anymore. They said that they lead the revolution against \\"nu-metal\\", but you people sit here and say how great their \\"nu-metal\\" sound is. If you ask me, a band that says that Limp Bizkit, Korn, and MTV all together is trash, then goes and makes an MTV album with Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and the rest? Official sell-outs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Slipknot's most recent...","review":"Heard \\"Duality\\" on the radio, got interested in Slipknot, heard \\"Wait and Bleed\\", and decided to buy this CD. Well, its not a complete dissapointment, and is certainly interesting, but, to be blunt, a toddler with a pot and pan set has more flow than this. Incorporating repetitive gutiar riffs, annoying turntables, thrashing drumming, a virtually unhearable bass, and then rap-metal screaming on top of it all, Slipknot's self-titled album is almost unlistenable. Would be completely unlistenable if it weren't for songs like \\"Wait and Bleed\\", and moments on \\"Me Inside\\" and \\"No Life\\". But I can't stand rap-metal unless its REALLY good, and I havn't found any good rap-metal yet...Bottom Line: Angry, unorganized, and talentless sounding (But its easy to see that they ARE talented by listening to their most recent, \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses\\" and \\"Stone Sour\\", which are highly recommended)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Screw------>Katherine Turman","review":"Katherine Turman claims that Yet Slipknot are no Insane Clown Posse, using hyperbole to mask a lack of talent, she is obviously some hypocritical morn that doesnt understand anything.

Honestly there's 9 members and 2 percussionists playing trash cans and they suck at it! Most of the guitars sound just like Korn(who i also dispise). The only talented mebers are corey and joey. If you want good nu metal, check out Nothingface and Kittie. Slipknot is just a kid's clothing line."},{"rating":"1","title":"The missing link","review":"Well, after seeing these guys I know what humans have evolved from. This is just bad music. Ok. It's not music. It's sound. I could make this album in an afternoon. Chances are you could too.

The lead singer has a nice voice, however, I just didn't like the cd very much. This is just something some angry, hopeless, teenager who feels like the whole world is against him would like. If you are an angry, hopeless teenager, then this may be a great cd for you. but for me...It's just not something im interesting in. I want something more creative and inspiring...i guess... Anyways...I would like to say eyeless is an awesome song and it just made me go like \\"wow!\\" so I gave 2 stars for the first 3 songs after that the cd is just like \\" ughghgh\\" If you wanna hear slipknot, get iowa, that is a decent cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im not writing a bad review","review":"Ok im not going to write a bad review on slip, though I cant stand them but thats not the point. Just to let you know one thing, dear people slipknot is not metal they will never be metal, why you ask? Because slip doesnt have lead solos and why they dont is because their guitarists arent very good and cant play them, all they can play are power chords, which means just noisy guitar. However they have a good drummer but he belongs in a real metal band like danzig or something. Oh and when you rap that has nothing to do with metal, but hey enjoy the album its fine if you like slipknot but just dont consider them metal just because MTV and the radio says they are, because they arent,its just rap&rock; mix, nothing more and nothing less. It misses everything metal has to offer, know that just because something is heavy doesnt just make it metal...."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song, so download it on Itunes or Yahoo","review":"If you are thinking about buying this CD, I'm betting it is because you heard \\"100 years\\" on the radio and you thought it was such a great song, you wanted to check out what else John Ondrasik or Five For Fighting was capable of. Let me save you the trouble, the answer is not much. This CD is unbelievably dull, surprisingly vulgar at times given the theme and context of the hit single, and really just poorly constructed. Just because you enjoyed \\"100 Years\\" or even \\"Superman\\" which are both very good songs, don't be fooled into thinking you might like the rest of the albums. There is a reason that you only hear one hit single from each of FFF's albums, the other songs just aren't worth the listen.

I'm just not sure what they were thinking with this cd. They had all kinds of momentum going into this cd. I'm sure they were given more resources than they have ever had at their disposal, and all they could come up with is a mediocre cd that honestly doesn't have one good song on it. When they tried to kick it up with Angels and Girlfriends, they blew it, so even the potentially fun song on the cd is just bad. Awful cd.

Should SONY opt to fully promote this CD to a mass market, they may be pleasently surprised to discover they have signed this year's anserw to COLDPLAY.

It was very disappointing to not hear this artist reach his potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"If you are a true five for fighting fan and have listened to all of their CDS, not just America Town, you will realize that John is losing his 'edge'.

Not saying that's always a bad thing, and I know artists evolve through the years, but I just wish some of the fire was left in Five For Fighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT his best work","review":"This was by far my least favorite of all the Five for Fighting albums I've purchased. There's a tone I didn't exactly expect from John Ondrasik, and most of the songs have a rather menacingly dark and sullen feel to them. The song \\"100 years\\" is about the only even marginally optimistic portion of this CD.I'm not saying it's totally horrible music, just that it's not the happy, worthwhile music I'm used to from Five for Fighting. If you're into this style of music, you may like it more than I did. Otherwise, just be aware that this album is definitely a little different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Your While","review":"Five For Fighting has released yet another awesome collection of hits. My favorite on the track is \\"100 Years\\" which tugs on the heart in the right way, while offering a brilliant commentary on life today: Don't think about the things that You haven't done, but dwell on your successes. \\"NYC Weather Report\\" is another song that seems destined to be a hit. It is very upbeat, and you will find yourself singing along in no time. The song \\"Dying\\" will become an anthem for the people in confusing relationships. Another keeper. In \\"Angels and Girlfriends,\\" You never really know where they are going to come from next, but the overall effect is good. Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up![...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Five for Fighting","review":"\\"100 Years\\", the first single from the new CD, proves that the success FFF had with \\"superman\\" was more than just a one time thing.

Add this to the list of whiners currently marring the airwaves. Whatever happened to music that got a person moving and kicked a little [...], so to speak?Some of the songs have potential, i.e. \\"100 days\\", but are marred by vocals nearly devoid of warmth or \\"listenability\\". Instead, we have a series of sometimes well written pieces accompanied by a vocalist largely unable to carry a tune. A classic voice he is not.The bottom line? Keep the songwriter, lose the vocalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five for Refund please","review":"My 10yo son bought this album just for the one hit video which is on TV a lot. He is vastly disapointed! I have a very large and varied music collection and a wide range of tastes. This may be the worst album i have ever heard. The songs are poorly written, the musicianship is mediocre and the guy cant really sing. I beg anyone who reads this to NOT buy the album or at least listen to it first (who knows someone may like it).

The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because of the 100 years song! I waited and waited for the cd to come out. When the cd came out I rushed to the store to buy it on sale for $7.88; I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it! Its not worth it. The guy does not know how to write songs!

This album shows the unparalleled musical talent of John Ondrasik. It is the type of album you pop into the CD player and listen to all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's get back to our roots!","review":"The battle for everything is a wonderfully musical album that really goes back to the roots of a true artist. John more or less is Five For Fighting and his passion for music really shines through. Similar to America Town, there are classic guitar sounds combined with beautiful piano melodies. One Hundread Years, the single from this album, is the type of song that makes you think, laugh and cry. Disneyland just puts a smile on my face and reminds me of many summers at Disneyworld. NYC weather report really shows urban flare to it, and just is a wonderful song. I had very high expecations after America Town for this album, and John delivered 1,000 fold. If you don't have this album get it now, cause it is the type of album that you can listen to over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"As a new listener (I got the album for Christmas for the song \\"100 years\\"), I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. But after the first go-through, I was hooked. Ondrasik's talent shines through on each song in the lyrics, composition, instrumentals, and vocals. The breadth of his abilities is showcased with songs that range from bluesy to speed rock. While some here have complained about Ondrasik \\"changing his style\\", I think that's part of what really makes this album great. From \\"NYC Weather Report\\" to \\"Nobody\\", he takes you through an expanse of alt-pop-rock varieties and delivers bigtime on each one. What more can I say? Buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Reading Music","review":"The Battle for Everything is one of my favorite cds for reading and putting around the apartment.

But this is just frustrating. On the strength of the two singles (over the past two CDs) and a Mark & Brian interview, this CD seemed like a no-brainer. Regrettably, the CD is a profound disappointment. While he's clearly a skilled vocalist (see: 100 Years), the balance of the album is loaded with gritty and lazy vocals--like we were trying for a \\"live\\" unpolished sound. Swing and a miss!Bottom line: if you appreciate the pop sensibility of his hits, if you're looking for more of the same, you'll come up emtpy handed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't Let Me Down","review":"I expected nothing less from the Five for Fighting crew.

Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lyrical work of art.","review":"This CD is a great complement to the earlier \\"America Town\\" cd. The Battle for Everything is a little more laidback than the first FFF cd. The song writting is still outstanding and the band plays like they are meant to be a band, each complementing the other. This cd is recorded very well with a nice clean mix from the recording engineer. Overall, I think I still like the first album better but, there is not a bad song on this one and it's easy to listen to anywhere, anytime.

Not long after use, the paper began to bleed a lot even though it says it is bleed resistant. I am now going to try the Neehan Classic Crest Solar White 80LB, since it was recommended by a lot of copic users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could do better!","review":"I've read a lot about this man and was surprised to find a book about him in my local bookshop. However, I was dissapointed when I finally got down to reading the book and actually got so bored I didn't finish it!It unfortunately reads like someone's Masters thesis.

Mastery and technique are key essential to this review of prescience and educated guesswork. We would suggest following any fifth or sixth reading with a short sabattical referendum amoung your peers and a public reading on prime time afternoon television. An absolute must if possible.

AZ raps fluidly and with a completely original style. The beats on this album are great, but they have a slightly poppier sound to them. Although i like how they sound, more subtle-minded hip hop fans, to whom i'd reccomend Illmatic or Doe or Die, might not appreciate the smooth crispness in this cd. The songs are generally catchy, especially how ya living,\\" \\"love is love,\\" \\"just because,\\" and \\"last dayz.\\" The album is both a moody dark reflection of life as a hustler, while it maintains a heartfelt an lively sound through some of the tracks. Overall, this is a thorough cd and my favorite of AZ's. I would reccomend it to just about all real hip hop fans who aren't too stuck on singles with catchy hooks that you can hear on the radio. Not that this isn't catchy. But get this cd. Its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Pieces of a Man\\" Review","review":"This is the second endeavor AZ makes to keep his name in the rap game. There are a lot of great songs on this album, but not enough to give it that \\"classical\\" stamp of approval. This album maintains the New York vibe like his previous one \\"Doe or Die\\" by keeping the rugged beats and street mentality in his flows. The difference with this album amongst the others is that it reveals his thoughts of leaving the street life and pursuing rap and other ventures. In song 9 \\"SOSA\\" he says: I rolled dice/Trying to defrost from this cold life/Used to sell coke in the strip, but now I hold mikes/. This album is a must have if you are an AZ fan, if not, after listening to these records you will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic but not the best","review":"This album is a great album but its not AZs best. If this was any other rapper this would be the album that they would be remembered by. The best song on this album is How Ya Livin feat Nas. This is probably the best AZ song of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape this from someone else or somethin'!","review":"AZ's stock took quite a drop after realeasin' this album. He fell into the same category that Nas did with \\"It Was Written\\". AZ tried to gain the MTV viewers, but lost his trip hip-hop heads at the same time. Maybe a few songs here and there kept me goin', but overall, you should jus tape it from someone who went out and bought it. I don't think any CD is worth about 2 or 3 songs out of 15 that you can only keep playin'. If he does release another LP, he needs to sit down and think about things before anything can happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album was pure Trash. A waste of money.","review":"I can't believe he came up with that bull. i used to have mad love for AZ. I wasn't feeling his album at first. So I listened a few more times.

I struggled to read through this book. Phil Carpenter attempts to present how Internet brands are developed by presenting \\"case studies\\" on six well-known companies. The marketing strategies of these companies (iVillage, CDNow, BarnesandNoble.com, Yahoo!, FogDog Sports, and OnSale) are detailed in a manner filled with \\"buzzwords\\" but little in the way of thoughtful analysis or performance measurement.Carpenter follows the same business methodology of many Internet companies today in believing that \\"big numbers\\" translate into success. As we have seen this is a flawed formula. Further, the simplisitic discussions of banner ads, viral marketing, etc., provides little insight into eBrand management for your organization. Specifically, Carpenter never makes the connection between an eBrand and profit.If you are attempting to formulate an internet-based marketing strategy a much better read is Seth Yodin's book on Permission Marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Basic","review":"The ideas here aren't rocket science at all, really basic.

I prefer Customers.com by Seybold and Building Strong Brands by Aakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"These headphones are pretty terrible. I know $10 isn't a lot to spend on headphones, but do yourself a favor and just buy some $25 ones so you don't have to buy twice. They are reasonably comfortable, but the sound quality is just awful. They are tinny, and the bass is muffled and/or nonexistent. The cord is also \\"gummy\\". As in it is kind of elastic and rubbery and will retain its folded up shape if you do fold it or tie it up.I suppose this will be a good backup set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl Power","review":"Janet Folger uses humor and real life experience incorporated with God's word to let you know God has more for you than just waiting around to find Mr. Right. Just like girlfriends sitting around a coffee shop, she discusses with the reader if there is a Mr. Right, how to get over Mr. Wrong, and what God wants us to do while waiting.It's a quick, fun read but the reason I gave it a 4 is because of all the political stories she interjects. It won't bother most readers who are Republican, but some of you may question like me, \\"How exactly does praying for Bush to win an election relate to dating?\\" However, since her job is very political and huge part of her life, I'll cut her some slack. I didn't have any life changing revelations after I read the book, but it does remind you that God is in control. If God knows the number of hairs on your head then of course he knows who you are going to marry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelivable!","review":"This book got me through one of the toughest periods of my life. If you've ever wondered if you will get married this book is for you. I read this book after a tough breakup-it helped me deal with the situation with an unbelievable peace. You will also love how this book is written. It's as if your best friend is having a conversation with you. I highly recommend this book to single women and especially to anyone dealing with a breakup! This book will be a blessing in your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are These People Insane?","review":"I don't know what book the other reviewers read but it certainly wasn't this book. About half-way through the book I closed it, put it back in it's packaging, and asked amazon for my money back...It was just that bad. I don't call myself a singles expert, but I have read plenty of books on the single experience, and this, by far was a joke. The author seemed to have a problem with staying on the subject. She'd begin with a really great point then drift into a story about her friends or some wierd experience she had. It left me literally dazed and confused. I just didn't get it. How did the story relate to the point she was trying to make? At any rate, this book proves the saying once again, never judge a book by it's cover. The cover of this book has some really good key points to draw you in. The inside, however, is a hollow catastrophe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for younger singles","review":"I'm 41 and divorced. This book was not for me.... The audience is really the younger and non-divorced crowd. An 18-year-old friend and a 28-year-old friend LOVED this book, so I thought I'd give it a try. If you're like me, buy \\"I've Kissed a Lot of Frogs but My Prince Hasn't Come\\" (or something like that) by Kathleen Hardaway. The \\"Frogs\\" book is much better suited for you, if you're a divorced and/or older 40+ single.The book IS well-written. I agreed with all that Janet wrote, and her style is extremely lively and very conversational -- like she's talking just to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Blissed out and evocative music","review":"Loop, is a band that seems to have vanished from the radar screens of the cool kids. Too bad, because this record is pure pleasure. Very trance inducing music like the track , \\"Be Here Now\\". These albums deserve a reissue, as do the Main and Hair and Skin Trading company albums. This band and its offshoots way beyond their time. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple the best","review":"One of the best albums of all time.. Buy this record now..

It interweaves the close relationship between Naomi Judd and her daughter Wynonna with another allegory of intolerance and reconciliation between diverse ethnic peoples. The video also includes scenes of Naomi's wedding and private life. The finished music video, \\"Love Can Build a Bridge\\", is in 3D and done with highly professional polish."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album!","review":"This is probably the second album by the Judds that I had purchased when I started listening to their music in 1992. I have to say that I love it. In 1992, I usually listened to pop and alternative alone, but ventured out into country and I chose the Judds to do so. Every song on this album, I thought, really grooved except for \\"Are the roses not blooming?\\", which is a slow but more contemplative song but a sweet one to end the album with. The album as a whole, is a real thinker. It dips itself in a little heart mending, heart breaking and a little social awareness. I highly recommend this Judd album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music-Beautiful Scenery","review":"The music was great, the scenery was beautiful.

This truly is a superb cross-stitch resource. The alphabets are divided into various sections such as floral,antique,elegant,baby,kids etc. As with all The Better and Homes And Gardens imprint this is downright lavish in its use of colour and the size of charts. The alphabets are shown finished in myriad ways. It is all here, boxes, cushions, throws, towel borders, afgans and of course alphabet samplers. It is yet another book to make me wish to live and stitch for a thousand years. If I could only ever take one cross-stitch book to a desert island this with be a real contender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is a great book with a large selection of cross stitch patterns to choose from.

Bush was sworn in as the President of the United States. While this book is written by an admittedly biased person, the bias is in favor of truth, justice and liberty.Considering these factors were not used to determine the presidential winner of the 2000 elections, the American public could do a lot worse. Begala exposes how Bush's seemingly incoherent statements mask a far greater incompetence than has been suggested. Although it may seem inconsequential or cute to the underinformed, Begala assures us there are seriouis consequences from this behavor that will ultimately affect the United StatesYes, it looks like a very long and trying four years (assuming Bush does not do anyhing stupid enough to shorten the term) but intellegent citizens armed with this book can and will survive the most unAmerican election in ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic attempt","review":"This is probably the worst book I have read in the past 10 years. Begala's attempts to smear and slime Governor Bush are pathetic - he draws extensively upon hearsay, circumstantial evidence, and outright lies, for his material. His partisanship is naked, and his bias obvious.The quality of the writing is even poor. The paragraph structure is illogical and leaps from faulty presumption to irrational conclusion at pace that would even amaze Don Quixote. The metaphors are unimaginative and nearly collapse under the strain of being forced by this second-rate writer. In short, Begala needs to keep his writing in private journals (and preferably not published), where it belongs. However, I have no doubt this book will be praised by those who themselves are ignorant of good writing.Do not buy this book. It was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read For Americans!","review":"Should anyone believe that GW is going to restore 'dignity' to the Oval Office, they need to read this. This is one scary man and Begala documents it with glaring accuracy. God Help America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Begala does what the media doesn't have the guts to do.","review":"This is a book that is funny but scary. Paul Begala points out it is a joke to seriously consider George W. Bush as a candidate for the presidency. This is a man who decided to become an adult around the age of 36. For all of Mr. Bush's talk of Al Gore puffing up his resume, it turns out that the successful business career that Mr. Bush had prior to public office was due mainly to sweetheart deals (by both the government and private individuals wanting to help out then-President Bush). This is what Joe Conason calls Bush's \\"crony capitalism (see Conason's great article on Bush's business dealings in a recent article for Harper's Magazine). Let's hope enough voters head Mr. Begala's words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like most Bush bashing books...","review":"This book, plainly said,....The president has not even been inoffice for a year, and ... authors, such as Paul Begala havedeemed themselves worthy of eating away at the leader of the freeworld, and the minds of the American people.If Bush fails us after4 years, then such books will be fine, but give him those fouryears.So far Bush has surprised the rest of the world with hisdiplomatic measures, and strong showings in Europe. The only peoplethat cannot see those victories of his are the American people,because the press has continued to hound him.This book insultsAmerica, not the president.[END]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias","review":"This writer has a biased disregard for many truths. Bush actually made excellent grades in college. He does have an articulation problem but some people are too biased to look beyond that. Clinton almost destroyed the CIA which is one of the many reasons the attack on the USA couldn't be stopped.Thank God we have a real leader in The White House. Clinton looked the other way when the Cole was attacked. Gore would probably have done the same thing if he had been president on Sept. 11, 2001!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One, only because I cannot give it zero.","review":"I let the leadership and courage of the past six months speak for themselves as the undisputable refutation of the premise behind this pathetic collection of nonsense. It has been a long time since America has selected someone more suited to the Presidency and books like this (and those of Molly Ivins, Micheal Moore, Allen Dershowitz, et al) serve only to show how intellectually bankrupt the political left has become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not informative","review":"Mr. Begala should understand that the average American is able to determine opinion from fact. This book is a collection of Mr. Begala's assumptions, opinions, and hypotheses. If you are looking for FACT look elsewhere. If you want a light read for a day at the beach, then Mr. Begala has a story for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Enquirer - type writing","review":"Not for the intelligent reader for sure. Mr. Begala screams out accusation with very little support. I had trouble wading through this book without scoffing.For the serious political minded person, I would refer them to George Will (Conservatives) or Jesse Jackson (Liberal)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The facts should have spoken for themselves","review":"Unfortunately Paul Begala felt the need embellish terrifically damning facts regarding George W's business dealings, politics, and personal history with snarky comments and childish personal attacks. He assures us in the introduction this will not be a piece to round up support for Gore as he's perfectly capable of making his own case. Yet throughout the book, Begala holds up Mr. Gore as a paragon in both politics and intelligence. Made me kinda think of a one-sided internet flame war.I am a registered Democrat and couldn't abide by George W. before picking up this book. I was hoping to gain some insight into the workings of his mind in order to discuss his candidacy with certain misguided friends and family members ;) But this book was a disappointment and an insult to the reader. Shame on you Mr. Begala; you should have let the facts stand alone rather than trying to tell me what to think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, Written by Hack","review":"Lame insults against President G.W. Bush.Now, why isn't anyone asking about President Obama's grades?Oh, that's right. We aren't allowed to ask, are we?Be afraid; be very afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and inaccurate","review":"Like his campaign consulting firm partner, James Carville, Begala fights political battles through misleading soundbites. There may be much to like or dislike in Bush's policies, but there is no serious analysis to be found here. The title comes from a Bush verbal grammatical error from the end of a long day of campaigning, and this choice of title shows the sophmoric nature of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written throw away writing","review":"I usually enjoy political books of all sorts, liberal - conservative and anywhere else in the spectrum.This book suffers from some basic flaws that any intelligent reader will pick up on right away.1. Completely substantiated claims. If you can take outrageous claims at face value without any traceable facts, you might enjoy this book.2. Leap from claims (#1) to even wilder conclusions. I would give this book a better rating if the writer would have clarified if these were his opinions or supposed facts.Other than the basic flaws, it is very readable and engrossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but obviously biased","review":"Believe me, I'm not a supporter of bush's history or actions in the white house. I picked up this book to learn a little about the man, and honestly, it's a little hard to get an objective opinion with this book. An entire novel could be written about any human being, and depending on the facts, it could either be entirely positive or entirely negative.The book was written before the 2000 election, and it even goes so far to describe a Gore asset after describing a place where Bush fails to meet the bar.It's got the facts in there, but its hard to know how to take them. This book is also already outdated at just 2 years old; it would have made a better infomercial or magazine article."},{"rating":"1","title":"The exact opposite of the Clinton story","review":"Paul Begala's detailed account of the low points of President Bush's early years is historically relevant, if unbalanced reading. Clearly the agenda here is to weaken the confidence of the voting public in a surprisingly popular President. If the reader accepts Begala's agenda and reads the book just for the \\"facts\\", this becomes a story of a fortunate man almost throwing away his advantages in life, then finding redemption as a gifted and popular leader. I am giving a copy to my son in hopes that he will not make the same mistakes President Bush made early in life. The book does present an ironic contrast to President Clinton. Clinton started with so little, excelled in school, kissed the girls and charmed the people, then squandered the voters' trust and his opportunity to make history...If only he had experienced the failures Bush did as a young man, he might not have floundered at such a critical time in his own career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"This book, which im glad i didnt buy I read it at my local library.

The magic of the book lies in the illustrations. In my copy from the Seventies, the images look as if they have been painted with water colours and are very beautiful. This modern reprint, however, is on glossy, waxy paper and the pictures look 'flat' and washed out.

They have done a terrific job of laying out the history of Japanese film in poster format, in correct color no less, witha lot of useful information for the Japanese film buff, and collector since many of the posters are available to order right from this publication. My only comment is when will their nextbook be issued? Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for this area of Japanese movie posters","review":"For this niche in collecting of Japanese movie posters, this book is great. It covers some uniquely Japanese genres -- Yakuza, Pink, Kaiju (monsters), etc., and serves that purpose well. However, just a couple notes in addition to the comments already made: first, if you're looking for Japanese posters for Western films (American, European, etc.) this is not going to cover that. Second, it does not cover more modern posters so if you're looking for new popular titles like Amelie, Lost in Translation, and the ever-popular Kill Bill, this obviously won't work.That said, again, great book for what it is. An excellent reference and a good start for a collector's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wonder how a person can change?","review":"This movie should be seen at least once as it depicts the reality of how person should think more of the people around and gain interest in their environment.

The illustrations are of an architectural nature, yes, but the book says almost nothing about creating anything like those illustrations. For instance, all of the illustrations use a hand lettered font that does not ship with AutoCAD, and nowhere is it explained how fonts are copywrited or even available outside the boxed version. Plus, much of the presentation is misleading - it seems that the book is edited for newer version by pasting more stuff onto the end of a chapter. Some key points are just plain wrong. Architects! pass this one up. Worthless to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Architecture??","review":"This book was a great disappointment. The title is especially misleading.

The house itself was roomy and reasonably easy to set up - you do need two people. If you buy it, go get some serious stakes because those that come with it are pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"poles bend with very little resistance","review":"We were excited to get this screen house because of the great reviews we read. This was an inexpensive price and seemed like it would be sufficient for our needs. As we opened the box, however, we were disappointed to see how flimsy the poles were. One of the poles bent and creased at the curved section where it goes up over the sidewall just with my husband and three kids setting it up. If we had been in a strong wind or trying to drag the shelter I could understand the easy damage, but this just has poor quality poles. The actual screen enclosure seemed fine ."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not a bad screen house","review":"We purchased this screen room for our campsite, to replace a really great screen room we had for a few years and have never been able to find one comparable. So far so good with the Wenzel. The only thing is it isn't as large as the dimensions would indicate. The footprint is 14 x 12 but since it tapers it becomes narrow at the top. It is great for keeping the insects out however, again because it is so tapered, it isn't usable when it rains except if you stay in the very center. It was relatively easy to set up and did not take very long. The stakes are pretty cheap so we bought new ones to drive into the ground. Hopefully, we will get a couple of seasons out of this screen room. Definitely not bad for the money though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Very roomy, great airflow with the doors tied open. My sister and I used it as a tent at a music festival and because you can see in it we got robbed. For more shade we clothespinned sheets on the sides. I plan on using it for music festivals again next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for whats its used for","review":"I purchased a Wenzel 10x12 I believe 5 years ago and the zipper finally broke on me. This is a great product for the price and for what its being used for. As far as the comments about the pols and about the sides dont help in the rain. This screen house for the price is used for around the picnic tables and protects from the little creatures that may come in. It is very easy to set up and for the length of time I had it, im ready to purchase a bigger one for the same price. There are many other products out there that are made cheaper and cost more.

Walmart no longer sells a hexagonal screen house of similar size, or I would have bought the exact same model again. As soon as I took the Wenzel out of the box (no nice carry bag like the Walmart one!), I could feel the flimsiness of the poles. Sure enough, while setting it up, one of the pole tips bent. When I called Wenzel, they would not stand behind their product. After it taking about a week to get through to them on the phone, they told me to disassemble the screen house, and mail them the pole back (at my expense), and then they would decide whether it was \\"a warranty issue or not\\". After telling their clerk how disappointed I was at the lack of product support, I hung up, and I guess I will live with a bent pole. Spend your money elsewhere - Wenzel has cheap, flimsy poles, and no customer product support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice screen tent","review":"This is the nicest screen tent we've seen.

Physically, the book is short and thick, with narrow margins, which makes it hard to read without breaking the spine. There are few exercises, and almost none include data from languages other than English. The bibliography slightly exceeds four pages. It is the only introductory textbook I have ever seen without a glossary.The title is misleading. This book is really an introduction to Chomskyan generative grammar, not an introduction to linguistics. Students who read this book will be plunged into the world of empty categories, covert movement, Merge, and the Economy Principle; on the other hand, they will never encounter the terms spectrogram, ergative, pragmatics, or Indo-European. If that sounds like your idea of what an introduction to linguistics should be, then I suppose this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Survey","review":"I found this book to be a decent survey of Linguistics.

Deep, transendental, dark, laid-back, and ultimately satisfying, Massive Attack's third LP is their greatest. I liked \\"Angel\\", and \\"Risingson\\" was good, but I thought having two abstract vocalists on one song was kind of silly. \\"Teardrops,\\" now being featured on almost every \\"chillout\\" compilation, is very nice and soothing, featuring Portishead. The rest of the album is nice and deep, with those trademark sinister-but-harmless vocals that made Massive Attack famous. A nice album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massive venture completely into the \\"trip-hop\\" realm . . .","review":". . . and that's why this is my favorite album from them by far. Dark moods, pulsing beats - trip-hop is mysterious, sexy and trips your brain out. Massive is totally keyed into that on MEZZANINE. All songs are great although some obviously stand out, but even the less engaging ones are far from objectionable and fill the album out nicely.\\"Teardrop\\" must be one of the most beautiful songs EVER and features vocals by the uniquely expressive Elizabeth Faser of the Cocteau Twins. \\"Man Next Door\\" is a particularly strange one, slowing down and manipulating samples from an old Cure song to a hallucinatory effect. Meanwhile, \\"Exchange\\" offers some respite with a more relaxed calm.P.S. - this is another album that's great to put on as \\"mood music\\" with your \\"significant other.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a LP","review":"Felt mislead with LP-replica in the title.

Massive Attack, however, has really caused me to open my eyes to this particular style. I am still no expert on \\"trip hop.\\" Im not even sure if that is the correct term for these artists, but I do know that this is an incredible ablum. Since I got it I have bought several of Massive Attack's albums, as well as some Tricky.

Every time I listen I hear new sonic pleasures that were missed the time before. To say one track is better than another would be unfair, but if pressed to choose I would say the first track, Angel, is my choice as it sets the tone and atmosphere for the whole journey ahead. I must say, however, that the reprise of Exchange is unecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't call it a comeback.....","review":"\\"Mezzanine\\" , the latest from Bristol supergroup Massive Attack, is probably their most adventurous work to date. Never being afraid to experiment with the unknown sample, mix, or vocalist is what's kept this group on the fringe for so long, but to people who've been folowing them, it's what keeps 'em coming back. The darkest of any of the previous albums, it's not to be dismissed as simple background music (although you wouldn't know it by how much Hollywood's been using these guys) \\"Angel\\" provides a sombre love sonnet, while \\"Rising Son\\" and \\"Inertia Creeps\\" put a morbid swerve on the albums mood. Never afaid of the odd ballad, \\"Teardrop\\" lightens the embiance. The 2 versions of \\"Exchange\\" are top rate, the second featuring the dulcet voice of toaster Horace Andy. In any rate, it's a definite must buy for the experienced listener or Massive Attack virgin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Angel (track one) begins quietly, and as it is slowly unleashed, it is merely a preview of all which is present on this incredable disc. Dark, amazingly atmospheric, and so different from any of the Top 40 rabble to the point where it is almost beyond description. It fits in no perticular genre; and lets the imagination flow smoothly and coherently as it shifts from one song unto the next... The future of music. \\"Group Four\\" is the best track on this disc, an 8-minute epic symphony of drums, conseptual lyrics, and a smooth flow which has no rival."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a trip.","review":"I don't know too much about their other albums, but I can't imagine any other being better than \\"Mezzanine\\". You can call this trip-hop or electronica if you want, but this is just cool mood music that is beyond beautiful. Perfect for putting on after the bars at home, with that last drink or smoke of the night. With guest vocals from \\"The Cocteau Twins\\" singer, and a cool sample of \\"The Cure\\" on track seven, you know this is gonna be good. \\"Teardrop\\" was the big song from this, and the rest is just as moving. It will go great with your \\"Portishead\\" and \\"Sneaker Pimps\\" cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"astounding","review":"this is the best album ever recorded. there is a deepness in every track, there is a coldness that heats the deep inside of our anxious soul. it's like I'm in a labirynth, and as I go trought it, trying to find an exit, I find suprises in every corner, and I feel like they are watching us. the sky is black, there is a possibility of rain.

The music is deeply sensual and chock full of imagery, the pulse of \\"Teardrop\\" resembling a heartbeat, \\"Inertia Creeps's\\" tribal drums evoking some sort of primitive passion and lust. The buildup in most songs such as \\"Risingon\\" and \\"Group Four\\" resembles the cascade of inevitable occurrences leading to an important plot event.

But, sadly, when I do I find little reason to change my habits. The praise lavished on these recordists made me curious, though I was utterly befuddled by this praise when I heard them. Their sound approximates a group of kids playing with casio keyboards in someone's basement. While certainly more creative than much of the drivel encountered on the pop scene, they are no more talented than a Britney Spears or N Sync--perhaps less so.

I bought this CD because people were comparing Massive Attack to Portishead (another great band), and I was pleasantly surprised to find music in the same vein, but much richer and more interesting. Massive Attack have a lot of variety in their textures, beats, and vocals, something you can't always say about Portishead. In addition, not all the songs are about pathos, which makes them better for general listening (and surprisingly, driving music). The selective use of electric guitars definitely (not definately!) enhances the music. Every single track on this album is good; the only faults are possibly #'s 5 and 11, which are a little dull. Intermission/Outro music, perhaps? Anyway, if this truly is their *worst* album, as some of these reviews have stated, then I can't wait to hear the other two.

The vocals are wonderful. The whole CD is jumpin' with musical ideas, and it feels fresh and full of energy. If you've heard 'Blue Lines' or 'Protection' and you liked them, I guarantee this one will blow you away. Year after year of the same music, artists copying one another, some artists try changing their taste for music. But there's one group that outstands them all. This is Massive Attack's essential work. It is one of the greatest midnight to early hour chill-out album ever created, an amazing blend of hip hop, rock, r&b, reggae, and soul seem to combine into one completely mind-blowing masterpiece. Massive Attack is one of the best bands of this genre, along with \\"Tricky\\", \\"zero 7\\", \\"Spicehouse\\" and \\"Morcheeba\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic by the masters of trip-hop","review":"It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening \\"Angel\\" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Massive Attack rules!","review":"Excellent. If you like to hear to different music genres, you have to try Massive Attack.

I still can't tell you the names of the later tracks, much less figure out which one we're listening to. Having said that, it's still great to have playing in the background. Also, the first half of the disc really is excellent. The tiny beginning of \\"Angel\\" exploding into a near anthemic sound is very very cool. \\"Risingson\\" is one of the best electronic songs out there, and may be worth the price of the album for some. All in all, I'd recommend this album for anyone interested in starting to listen to Massive Attack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack for the monster under your bed","review":"Yet again, the Massives reinvent the wheel.

The CD has tracks I'd be happy to buy as singles -- brilliant pieces like \\"Angel\\", \\"Inertia Creeps\\", and \\"Teardrop\\" among others make this CD one worth owning. However, it is not as consistent as one would like -- listening to it (as one tends to do at night, rather than day, with Massive attack) feels like flashes of light in the darkness. Those flashes are worth it, but the rest keeps the CD from being an all-out five-star buy.But then again, it is rare to come across a perfect, polished gem of a CD.

I'm so glad that I got to listen to them. It's one of the best album ever, truly..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massive Album","review":"After hearing this CD throughout, I can say with couth that each Massive Attack CD has been quite different from prior ones. Blue Lines was rougher and more raw than the two after it, while Protection was much smoother, jazzier, and appealing. Mezzanine, though, has to be my fav. It's sad to note that Tricky is no where in the album, having been on the two prior ones in 2+ songs. Anyway, I think the best tracks would be Risingson (Daddy G has an AWESOME voice and any song with him in it shines), Dissolved Girl (Sara Jay's Vocals kick), Mezzanine, and Tear Drop which is a really sad and sort of dramatic song. This album is just great..I'd love to see them live, and it's a pity the trio's been cut down to two. Good-bye Mushroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"\\"Mezzanine\\" is, from start to finish, a classic. The bleakness of it all is a refreshing break from the happy-go-lucky world of today's music, even with the new whining trend in rock 'n' roll. Every piece of it is sheer perfection and if this is the future of music, as some reviewers forecast, then that future is extremely bright, even if it's industrially dark as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"First encounter ...","review":"When I first heard Massive Attacks' Mezzanine I thought how wonderful it was to find such great music only to realize it was 3 years old and this was one of the newest albums! Nevertheless, I was immediately drawn to the flow of this album. The album, specifically, \\"Angel\\", \\"Teardrop\\", and \\"Inertia Creeps\\" are like intense, organized musical explosions neatly wrapped in melody. It flows so well molding intensity and mellow together ... like explosive relaxation. The other tracks are pleasant also, though not as strong the previous mentioned, but then again I prefer driven pieces. Personally, I think the dark tones and base elements are the most important pieces of this album giving it a massive foundation for the entertaining '\\"bells and whistle\\" elements.

Every wrench 3mm or larger is stamped with its size. The plastic case is elegant and compact and holds the wrenches snugly.The only flaw with this product is that the case is designed so that in order to remove a smaller wrench, you must remove or turn aside several larger ones. This is a little annoying when you just want, say, the 5mm wrench.

Then the other side split apart after about 5 months. Not very sturdy.

Our kitchen was dated and blah. Cabinet doors were worn and country looking. I stripped the facings and was amazed to find oak! So, we created new cabinet doors out of mdf and put the veneer on them. Doors totally look like they are made of oak! I stained the facings and the doors a nice rich cherry red, gave it the look of cherry cabinets. For those of you who want to do this, an easy way to get the veneer to adhear to the mdf is thin wood glue with water, paint the thinned glue onto the faces of the mdf. Let get tacky. Apply the veneer that's been cut the same size and use an iron on a high setting without steam and press the veneer to the mdf. The iron heats the glue, making it bond and dry faster.

I watched it many time and was very disappointed to see how this DVD version has been butchered. As I learned from an IMDB review at least 40 minutes have been cut and many scenes simply make little sense without the background material that was cut. Many of the music accents have been cut also (case: when George find the cigarette package in the tree).

I've used these cables for over a year on my Saturn in Big Bear, CA. Installation is pretty easy with just a little practice. No readjusting after installation; a real plus. Be careful not to spin the tire on acceleration; the hook on the inside can release and the chain will pop off. The rubber tightener is cracked, but has not broken; makes me nervous. The traction coils are wearing well, even with quite a lot of bare-pavement driving. The side cables appear to be untwisting, making the whole unit prone to knotting itself up and more difficult to install, (after a lot of use.) These cables have destroyed my plastic hub caps. Despite some problems, these cables are superior to conventional chains and I would buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Hate Them","review":"I have used them once so far. Quality is good and they do work well, but it's a pretty rough ride on cleared roads. They are a pain to put on and not quite so bad to take off, but plan on getting full of snow as you put them on or take them off. Put a set in your trunk along with a good pair of gloves and avoid using them if at all possible. But if you get caught away from home and really need to get back after a snow storm, they are wonderful. Also, if you use them in salt conditions, be sure to rinse them off and hang them up to dry before putting them away or they will rust. Doubt if it hurts anything, but the rust stains look bad. I would also recommend putting them on sometime before you need to so that you get a feel for what all is involved.

I removed the chains and drove up the asphalt drive with no problem except for some minor slipping on the ice and snow. On reason for the failure could be the cable chain design. The cross cables have wire rings which just spin on the bare asphalt and never gained traction. Very disappointing!

People need to just get over the fact that he's so talented he has the widest fan base of any jazz artist ever! He can sing. That's why he has an added dimension in his soloing with the guitar. His guitar literally sings and scats! I'm tired of these so called jazz purists tripping over the fact that he's got a great voice and has fans that appreciate it as well. Back to this album.I absolutely loved this whole album and can't wait for the next. If you have a chance to get the DVD be sure to because he does most of these cuts live and he really cuts loose. He and Joe Sample said they waited 30 years to work together!

My biggest complaint is that it is so hard for my husband and I to understand each other through these units. We have to say a word, pause, say the next word, pause, and so on. It's very frustrating.

I believe it was 'Living Single.' It was a take off of Sex in the City as far as I can tell. Too close to Sex in the City, but they're fun right. This novel is actually a little scary. The main character is so flat, so uptight, that the reader has a hard time relating to her. The opinions about life and social interactions make the character a nightmare to read and relate to. I've never given a bad review before, but being the type of person that once starts a book and has to finish, I felt that it would be an injustice to force this one on someone else. Chamberlin has every aspect of being an okay writer, but maybe she put too much of herself in this one, the character is too much like that friend that you tolerate, but only because you want to borrow her shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be about pregnancy?","review":"I am recently pregnant and so thought what a great book. Wrong!!! You never get to the baby part although the front of the nicely displays bottles. The author obviously knows nothing about all parnoias that pregnant women have today. She is eating pate somewhere in the book a big no-no for pregnant women. I just skimmed through the last half of the book and was so happy when it was finished. I agree with the other reviews.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that all of the main characters were soulless, including Anna, who seemed to approach her pregnancy with the sort of enthusiasm one approaches root canal. And why are all of the supporting characters so mean and nasty? From the cranky ob-gyn, the indifferent fiancee who wouldn't go to the doctor with her, and Anna's uncaring mother--there wasn't a single nice person in the entire book! Even the bit characters--like the people on the street who scolded Anna for having an attack of morning sickness in public. Wouldn't someone have tried to help her or ask if she was all right? It seems rather unrealistic that every single person in the story was suffering from eternal PMS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant, slow and flat. No substance!","review":"I didn't enjoy this read really; it's like a bad phone conversation with someone you could just slap for being utterly boring and unbelievably repetitive.For me this was like a mass of questions repeating themselves in a monotonous way.The only surprise of the book is that if you think you will be reading of a woman who has to change to accommodate a new life in her live, it just won't be so since she looses the baby with a natural miscarriage and her life changes like everyone else's does but there is no baby here.I found this book dull and the characters aside from Alexandra, Anna's best friend are unimaginative and terribly flat. I cannot recommend it since it is not even a light frothy read it's just a bad story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book really had potential but then it quickly went down the perverbial hill. If the author meant for the reader not to like Anna than she did a fabulous job. Was it the author's intent for the reader to slowly begin to understand and feel for Anna? If she did, she did not accompolish her goal. The characters were all selfish and shallow even until the end. The only 2 characters that were semi likable were Anna's best friend and Jack. So what does it say about the book when you enjoy the secondary characters of the book and not the main one? Not much. My suggestion: if you must read this book, buy a used copy or find it at your local library.

Mostly I just thought she was really shallow. Also, none of the supporting characters were even likeable. I couldn't find a single reason to care about how the book ended but I have a rule that I have to finish the current book I am reading before I can start a new one so I had to force myself to finish the book.

And that is palin awful.Do all of these bands like Franz, Mouse, Arcade Fire all get togeather and decide to make the worst music ever made?Hey. Let's all be the worst.Well they deifnetly have made an awful album and if that's what they were up to. My hats are off to them.Have fun cathing them on tour. Don't bring a date. Because they will just get angry and think you are a big jerk. Why did you subject me to this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stonedgoose","review":"Drivel.........absolutely drivel! If the wax build-up in your ears isn't vibrated loose by the sound emanating from the speakers which are wantinly attempting to commit suicide.....MM is definitely one of the worst if not the worst album I've purchased in the last year. There isn't a sniff of a melody here, nor will your hear one. Somewhere people fell on the bandwagon for a band that produced garbage and felt taken advantage of and then convinced others of their misjudging. Do yourself a HUGE favor, redirect towards the like of Muse or Blueline Medic, your taste bud will be thanking you and as will your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm at it again. This CD more than deserves to be thrown out, or just forgotten. >_<","review":"This is the second time I'm listening to these crazy songs. This CD is sporadic at best. Sometimes it's quiet and calm, next the lead singer is screaming his head off.I don't see the appeal in this type of approach to the music that we've come to know as art, but I'm giving it a 2 because of course, most rap and country CDs are unlistenable so this one is OK. I guess. >_>2.2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same band","review":"This album isn't in the same league as Modest Mouse's other work. I'm not the kind of guy who thinks that every bands first album is better or that all bands sell out, but this is far more mainstream than anything modset mouse has released. The song Dashboard pretty much sums this album up. It's catchy, but there's nothing to it. Every other modest mouse album is incredible, but this one is weaker in every respect. I don't even think I'd consider it modest mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not getting it","review":"I've been into alternative music for as long as I could buy records... which is a long time! I just don't see the appeal of Modest Mouse. I can accept challenging music but this stuff is just annoying. I thought maybe the addition of Johnny Marr would give these guys a listenable sound...wrong! It's simply not enjoyable music. And I don't mean upbeat and happy. I just mean it's like going to a nice restaurant and having some annoying little kid screaming through your entire dinner. Fortunately, I didn't pay for this meal and I'm gonna smack that kid on my way out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sammy Hagar did it to Van Halen","review":"I hate this album, which is sad, because I love this band. What happened? Why MM? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Directions","review":"Modest Mouse changed for this album, and while there are a couple good songs, don't get it if you like the older Modest Mouse or are attached to their EP Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks. The two singles are good, but other songs drag and sometimes things just sound bad. Maybe if they were recorded differently I would listen to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this band and what have they done with Modest Mouse?","review":"Modest Mouse are reported to be living somewhere inside this album. I, however, cannot find them. This is the first music they have released that is completely forgettable. It comes out of the speakers, into your ears and then disappears. All of the previous MM releases, and I've heard, loved and lived them all, are unique, enduring and beloved pieces of music; this record is not of that ilk. And that's a real shame, MM are one of the finest bands of the past 10 or 15 years, right up there with the likes of Ween, Built to Spill and all of the Jagjaguwar bands. Oh well, a rare miss. I'm still a huge fan, still gonna go see them whenever the tour rolls around (definately go see them live, when Isaac isn't too drunk, the shows can be legendary), still gonna love the freak rock phenomena that is Modest Mouse, just can't seem to get behind this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vinyl Ever (i love modest mouse)","review":"I am completely dissatisfied with this purchase. I buy lots of records and i have never experienced this shoddy of craftsmanship the songs skip in really weird places even though there is no visible damage on the record.

(this is not a player error, as ive been listening to all my other records successfully.)I wish this record worked, and my trust with amazon had not been shattered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Pressing","review":"While the actual album itself is great, I agree with James. This vinyl was terribly pressed. It arrived warped beyond belief, and I end up listening to skips more than the actual songs. I've also purchased many vinyls, and this is the first time I've been this disappointed. This is worth nowhere near what I paid for it, and I'll go out of my way to recommend friends not to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parting of the Sensory","review":"\\"Parting of the Sensory\\" is the best Modest Mouse song since \\"Cowboy Dan\\" and arguably the best Modest Mouse song ever. That is the best reason for owning this CD. \\"Florida\\" and \\"Spitting Venom\\" are added bonuses. The rest is all just good music you could live with or without. Don't hesitate to explore Modest Mouse's backlog of albums, they're all worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bands reinvent themselves","review":"Contrary to what you'll read in some of the negative reviews, this is a new and improved sound from Modest Mouse. The addition of Johnny Marr has definitely redirected the group from that jangly, dissonant chord sound that was getting to be a bit tedious and repetitive. Instead, there are now melodic and creative guitar accompaniments that complement what has always been their strongest suit...the lyrics. After a few listens of \\"Spitting Venom\\", I think that there's sufficient evidence to suggest that the \\"Moon and Antarctica\\" may end up being their eclipsed masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dig it","review":"Like all of Modest Mouse's albums, they take a little time to warm too, but after a while I can't get enough of it. This album in particular grew on me way faster then Good News for People who love bad news. There were several songs that I could get into right away, and I feel that the band's style is still evolving in a different and interesting direction. It still sounds like Modest Mouse, but not in any way recycled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likin it","review":"I have always like this band, this was my first purchase of their music, and I love it! Glad I own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album in 2007","review":"Great album. I am a recent fan with the success of the \\"float on\\" album which I really like. I thought it might be hard for Modest Mouse to follow-up with a second. Boy was I wrong... We Were Dead before the ship even sank was great the first time I heard it and fell in love immediately. I could easily listen to this album from beginning to end not skipping a single track and then start it all over again. I like their sound and really hope this album does not get played out by the \\"top 40\\" radio stations."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is MM's equivalent to the Cure's WISH","review":"mm is awesome, okay?but this one is not who they are, although it is probably who they will become. very pretty, catchy, perhaps over engineered tunes. love the multi-track vocals by the lead--old what's his name. this cd is like The Cure post passion. after all, the stage gets bigger when youbecome known and taking risks becomes, um...risky. I'm a sucker for post punk pop though. and this one's like a fat fast-ball served comfortably in my wheelhouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"bah... another great band that's lost it's touch","review":"I used to be a big Modest Mouse fan but these last 2 albums have been getting worse and worse. This album has a few songs on it I like but the rest is just filler. Easily one of their very worst albums imo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Modest Mouse CD yet.","review":"I am a Modest Mouse fan.

If you are liked M&A;, and lonesome crowded dont buy this. get your friend to burn it for you, listen to it once and then listen to lonesome crowded west and drink a beer.

All the pages of the novel are washed away describing inconsequential conducts and behaviors. I fail to see anything funny or at least an issue worth discussing with a friend, let alone explain to him/her what the book is about. Its theme is actually about nothing. Indeed my feelings for this book contradicts the enthusiastic reviews offered by other fellows, and I am surprised because some books which I have bought from Amazon.com based on the popular opinion have not disappointed me.

Their Pastelbord is designed to have a unique sandy clay coating over a strong wooden board. Its unique, fine grain tooth holds pastels and other dry media like no other pastel surface. I really preferred this to the pastel papers I've tried.The fine \\"tooth\\" of the surface makes it easy to blend colors, layer, and experiment with pastel techniques.Some people also use Pastelbords for water media, since they are so extremely absorbent. I haven't tried that, but I have used the \\"untoothed\\" Claybord 11\\"x14\\" Smooth and Claybord 11\\"x14\\" Textured for water media, with good results.These are available in lots of sizes and colors, so be careful to pick the right boards before you check out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I got the swimming goggles to use for swimming it was cute but when I entered the pool with the googles underwater water went into the goggles so I tried again and there was still water in the goggles!

One listen to this group and you can tell that they would list \\"Don't Worry\\" by Marty Robbins as one of their favorite songs. I first heard P.O. because I picked up this cassette from the free bin at my local used record store, which I now consider one of the more profound serendipitous acts of my life. Well written, sung and played, this is a record which will make you want to both hoe-down and cry in your beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old time country album","review":"This group is a wonderful blend of different influences that come together in an old time country/rock sound. Each song can motivate you to get up and dance or pickup that old guitar that's been collecting dust in the corner and play along. It's just one of those albums where everything comes together for an enjoyable experience. If you like country and want to dance or just play along, this one has everything you need. Although this is the only album I have of this group, I'll be looking for others and can only hope the next few are as good or Lord help me, even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I tried running the first example in this book using the CD that came with the book and followed the directions. I could not get it to run on Windows 2000. I could not return the book since I had used the CD. That's a catch-22.I went to Sun's web site and downloaded the J2EE tutorial, which is free. Of course there are several things to download to get a complete running environment, but if you follow their instructions very carefully, everything works! Perhaps Sun's instructions were more thorough than this book's.So if you don't already have a Windows 2000 J2EE environment up and running, don't start with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Temptation is smooth jazz at its best","review":"Bryan Savage plays some great sax and flute on this smooth jazz album.

Not to mention the fact that Savage is one very talented horn player."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is terrific -- definitely a don't miss!","review":"Be sure not to miss this CD or any of his earlier recordings (4 before this one).

A perfect companion for the second term of G Bush new moral conservatism, where safe is success and complexity is a dirty word.This is not to say the music here is not better then 90% of her mainstream peers. But on your next CD, Charlotte you need to hike-up those low-rider jeans, for your influences are showing a little to much, and create something uniquely yours to become a true artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Copy Protected","review":"It's funny.

I think an artist can go a little too far with imitating their influences. You must be in there somewhere Charlotte Martin. I just didn't hear it on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Tori, think twice about this one","review":"I bought this CD as a Tori fan, as I had heard from reviews that this album had the same rawness and piano style. What a letdown.While Charlotte's voice and piano playing should automatically put her in a rank above her competition, the lack of self-reflection, honesty or depth in her lyrics turned me off. Very little originality. Some have compared her lyrics to being as \\"quirky\\" as Tori's, and the only line in which I see that is, \\"Could lip gloss save a nation Mr. Powers?\\" which seems ripped off (she even lists Tori in her credits, and any fan knows about Tori's obsession with lip gloss). I agree with another review under this album: if I wanted to listen to superficial lyrics, there is a plethora of junk out there.On a positive note, I did enjoy \\"Wild Horses.\\" Oh wait, that is a cover of the Rolling Stones song. I read somewhere that Charlotte was an opera singer; so why is she cacaphonously pronouncing \\"horses\\" like \\"hors-iz\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"total Tory Amos clone","review":"I suppose if you are a Tory Amos fan you might like this because it sounds like a lip-sync of her stuff, but myself, I'm looking for individual style in each artist. I couldn't detect a style that was \\"Charlotte\\" in any of these songs. Musically competent but lacks innovation of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed-Down Version of Tori Amos","review":"Part of what makes Tori Amos so amazing is her obscure lyrics. If you can't handle that, then you should LOVE Charlotte Martin. Charlotte Martin seems more easily marketable. Good for her, but Tori sells millions without seeming all that marketable. Comparisons to Tori will probably kill Charlotte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic cd","review":"I saw this cd in Barnes And Nobles and was drawn to it immediately. I listened to a few of the cuts on their listening station and had to own it.On Your Shore, Parade On and Beautiful Life are wonderfully crafted songs. Something Like A Hero and Madman are thoughtfully wonderful. The best cut on the cd has to be Every Time It Rains. This was the real deal-maker for me to buy it. The lyrics are amazing and the soft start-driving beat-soft ending was a real masterwork. I highly support anyone buying this cd. I was not remorseful in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply gorgeous~","review":"I will readily admit that Charlotte Martin is one of my favourite artists of all time, ranking just below the Goddesses Tori Amos and Kate Bush. Charlotte has obviously been influenced by them, but is most certainly her own person. I can see her well on her way to becoming a Goddess herself. I absolutely love On Your Shore. I think it's incredible and a masterpiece. There is not a track on here I do not love. This is one of my top ten albums of all time, from the haunting and passionate On Your Shore, to the nostalgic, sensitive Wild Horses cover, this is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album","review":"Charlotte Martin really knows how to make an album, and \\"On Your Shore\\" proves it. I've followed her career for about a year, so I'm a little biased, but this album is beyond what I was anticipating. The lyrics and melodies of her songs are fantastic in their bare forms, but Charlotte uses layered vocals and instruments to make her songs rich and complex. However, she also knows exactly which songs to leave with just her voice, her piano, and another instrument; these tracks are powerful in their simplicity.If you have even the slightest interest in checking out a new artist, I definitely recommend getting this album. You will not regret it- I mean it. Also, if you ever come across the opportunity to see Charlotte perform live...TAKE IT. She is an amazing and engaging live performer, and I guarantee she will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long time coming but defintely worth the wait!","review":"If you liked \\"Come to Life\\" then you are really in for a treat!

He lets his father bully him, covers up one murder, and later commits another; he marries, goes to war, and gets a commission because other people tell him to, not through any will of his own. His wife warns him that she won't be faithful, and he clearly doesn't love her, but still gets angry when she does exactly what she told him she would. Worst of all, he treats his own sister like a hired hand. Near the end when she steals from him and emigrates I cheered for her.It wasn't helped by the lead actor looking like a deer caught in headlights in every scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I rented this purely for Catherine Zeta-Jones, and was dissapointed. The story is dull and depressing, with no redeeming qualities, bosting immorality (on both main characters' parts) and dryness. The guy does eventually get over his father's cruelty, but it doesn't change him for the better, while his wife sleeps with every soldier to come along. Overdrawn, and more of a guy's film than a girl's, with all the war sequences. Also, more than one character gets away with murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate","review":"Have loved all of Ms. Cookson's movies so far, and really enjoyed this one.

It's size is large enough to cook four or five 3 ounce pancakes.The grill does not heat evenly. Pancakes do not cook evenly, either individually or as a group. The pancake nearest the heating control overcooks and usually ends up nearly burnt. The other pancakes are cooked over the narrow heating element (look on the bottom and you will see the heating element). The griddle does not transfer the heat from the heating element adequately. The portion of the pancakes over the heating element is nicely brown but the rest of the pancake is white. Someone said striped. That is an accurate description.I like my pancakes to be evenly cooked and nicely brown. This griddle does neither. I do NOT recommend this griddle for cooking pancakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic prone to break in storage","review":"Cooking is ok, a bit akward to clean. We have used this for over two years.

Better material should have been used for the trim parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't heat evenly at all!","review":"I got this one as a gift and it looks nice, I like the tilt and drain feature and the non-stick surface works nicely. Unfortunately, it fails at the most important feature of a griddle: it doesn't heat at all evenly so cooking just doesn't work very well. I get bacon strips where one end is almost burnt while the other is barely cooked and I get pancakes where, again, one half is almost burnt while the other is barely cooked. This one is headed back to the store and I'll look for something that cooks evenly, or just resign myself to cooking pancakes in two pans over my stove's burners."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all right","review":"Had it for about 5 yrs now. Use it about once every 2 months. Was never impressed with the tilt feature as I still have to push the grease to the drain hole otherwise it goes nowhere. The outline of the heating coil can now be seen in the surface. This might say something about the thickness of the surface. Surface is showing wear, parts of it are brown. We've always used plastic spatulas and rags for cleaning. It does not heat evenly but that has never affected cooking time of pancakes, french toast and bacon. The corners may take 30-60 seconds longer, no biggie. The unit has also always stayed level. I do not have a previous griddle to compare this one to and I do not know what the lifespan of a griddle should be so am giving it a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto Electric Grill","review":"This electric grill makes breakfast so much easier than using the electric range.

We bought oversize to make more pancakes and thought the cool-touch edge was a great idea. The Tilt'N Drain sounds great, but a mere bump of the cool-touch edge and the griddle falls into the drain position. Not what you're looking for when pouring pancakes. First of all, it still only accommodates five normal size pancakes (four corners and one in the middle). The surface is not level, and all the pancakes run towards the center giving them a distinctive oval shape. The biggest disappointment is the heating element. I purposely pour the center one first, and the one closest to the heating source last. Despite my efforts the one closest to the heating element source turns dark brown in no time flat, and the one in the center is barely ready to flip. End result...I'm shopping for a new griddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't buy again","review":"The griddle was purchased in order to make enough pancakes for two at one time.

After that, not even a better smell.One Ionic breeze was in a small room, another in a big room. Didn't make any difference, regardless of the area that needed to be purified. I thought that, at least the one in an 11 x 10 room would have just COOKED! But the pollin, and pet smells were just the same as before the Ionic breeze! No improvement of any kind. Nothing.... I am really distressed that so many people are turning over a great deal of money for an eyesore that does nothing it claims....and I have a more recent model (new and improved) than this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so glad I bought this product","review":"I was reluctant to buy the Ionic Breeze Quadra because of the price. Dust allergies, two dogs, and a dislike of noisy appliances are the reasons I decided to purchase the product. I was really surprised because it is so quiet. Then, after two weeks I decided to clean the grid. Wow - where did all that dirt come from? I'm still amazed when I clean it every week at how much black stuff it collects. How could something so quiet clean the air so well? In the six months that I've had the product, I find myself moving it from room to room so I can keep them all clean. So I've decided to buy a second one so I can have them in multiple rooms. This product is really great - I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product. Wish it was a bit cheaper.","review":"I was hesitant to buy it because of the fairly high price tag but now that I did I'm very happy with my purchase. If it were cheaper I would get one for every room in the house. It is as advertised.There is no noise at all. I've put my ear right next to the unit and can't hear a thing. It is also very easy to clean and for me is best to be done once a week and takes about 3-5 minutes. If you have pets or very high traffic areas you probably will want to clean twice a week.It blends in very well and has a nice clean and modern look to it.I have also noticed a distinct reduction in the amount of dust around the house when I clean and it also keeps the air nice and fresh in the house. It used to get pretty stuffy when I closed the house up and was gone for an extended time, but it's much nicer now.I would very much recommend this product. I will buy more when I can afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flakey","review":"I advise you to look for a different one. This one flakes out and it cheaply made. RadioShak has better ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, funny, and perhaps the best","review":"It is difficult to say whether anything is the best, but Yes, Minister is perhaps deserving of consideration.It is perhaps the best written show from start to finish (all seasons), with no weaknesses apparent, and it addresses many subjects well.It does require one to know something about the Westminster system of government, but that would be a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"my eyes are burning","review":"I wanted to love this book. However, it was painfully boring to read and I found myself hating the characters. Actually, to hate them I would've actually had to really know who they were. The author doesn't develop these characters fully and the story reads flat as a result. I was hoping for way more of an effort out of this fellow Cardozo HS alumni turned gossip columnist/Howard Stern guest.**Redeeming value: Pages 24-33 are entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather flat & dull","review":"For a book that is to be about sex & drugs, it's not particularly sexy or wild. If there's anything more dull than boring people talking about their pathethic lives & sex & drugs, I can't think of it. I made myself read through to the end because I'd read a good review, but it must have been someone who owed the author a favor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone's Boring","review":"Spiegelman displays no understanding of scene, character, tone, plot, or structure. Instead, the novel skips from one unrelated episode to another, never bothering to develop its character or explore their dynamics and relying heavily on Denis Johnson's Jesus' Son and Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy for inspiration. Ultimately, it's fairly pointless and forgettable. At a mere 164 pages, it's still way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Party Time Poster","review":"Hollywood Monsters - LOVE IT!!

It was a hit!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Price is out of this world","review":"This looks to be interesting but there is NO WAY that I would ever pay that for a book. If it were such a great book the publisher could easily convert it to Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution - Runs Very small!","review":"I wanted tuxedos for our standard Goldendoodles to wear for Halloween and then have for other occasions. I order the extra large after carefully measuring. It didn't begin to fit our 16 month old, 65 lb doodle, let alone the 75 lb adult dog! It was cute and well made for a costume, but they are sizing these costumes for little dogs it seems. So the extra large might fit a boxer or a dog of about 40 lbs. To me that is a medium sized dog. Until those who make animal costumes and size them by girth, length and weight I won't buy one again. Amazon was great though and accepted my return. Super customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Success!!","review":"One can't help but love the writing style and presentation of the authors Father Trigilio and Father Brighenti! If you liked \\"Catholicism For Dummies\\" and \\"The Everything Bible Book\\" from these authors, then don't hesitate before picking up a copy of this one too. It's an easy and fun read, as well as a phenomenal resource for Religious Ed. teachers, Bible Study groups, prayer groups and everyone else who has questions from time-to-time about people in the Bible. If these two authors keep it up, a library of their books will be just about all one needs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious read!","review":"For all those who have complained that too many historical texts focus on \\"Dead White Men,\\" finally a hearty, full-bodied, whole world read. I was delighted to have received this as a \\"holiday season\\" present, and can barely put it down. Nothing quite like regaling the office dweebs with my knowledge of the world and its leaders.

Good Morning America was absolutely right to have them as guests."},{"rating":"2","title":"1,000 People Who Helped Shape the Past 1,000 Years","review":"This is a fascinating book. While it might be tempting to argue with the exact order of their rankings, reading about the 1,000 people they selected is the interesting part. While some are extremely well known, others are far more obscure but no less influential. The people featured in this book have affected every aspect of our lives today, whether it is through the invention of the printing press, the microprocessor or the cathode ray tube or through the development of seminal psychological, philosophical or political theories. This book will provide hours of interesting and informative reading and can be read one entry at a time if you have but one minute to spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is perfect for even lazy people like me. It ranks the people based on a point system and it gives one phrase summaries and 2 paragraph summaries. you can learn a helluva lot in 5 minutes. excellent for people of all ages. Also, the authors have an EXCELLENT SENSE OF HUMOR. You should definitely buy this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good way to start arguments that lead somewhere.","review":"Everything about their selection and ordering of the Top 1,000 is debatable, starting with their criteria, but that's the point. The authors are upfront about their thinking, wide-ranging in their selections and thought-provoking in making their cases. The rest is up to the reader and whoever is sitting across the dinner table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"I have nothing against the choices that the authors made, even if I disagree with some of them. But after the first 100 or so entries, I became very tired with the superior attitude and snide tone of the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book of Trash, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS PIECE OF CRAP!","review":"I bought this book and turned to who the top 10 people were and gosh, did I gripe. Come on, William Shakespeare as the top person of the millennium? Sure he did affect writing and the English language but how many lives did he affect DIRECTLY? Writers have had little effect on history compared to politicians, businesspeople and social activists.The authors exclude Bill Gates, saying he was only a salesman, when he helped to trigger one of the biggest increases in world growth in history. Gates helped to spark the IT revolution that boosted the incomes and living standards of millions across the globe. So did reading Hamlet ever feed or clothe anyone? NOT!The authors themselves admit to having a bias for writers in their book. So they do confess that they boo-booed.Take my advice and don't buy this complete piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pointless book.","review":"It is impossible to make an impartial account of the top people of the millenium, as well as absolutely impossible to make the choices. Many things rankled me. Not just the villification of Communism, especially Castro, people like to forget that he was a brilliant lawyer who defended penniless people and risked his life to free his country from the dictatorship of Bastista. Other reviewers show incredible jingoistic ignorance as to the choices, like one reviewer wondering why Karl Marx was ahead of Jefferson: its quite obvious why he is ahead of Jefferson, he was far more intelligent, and far more influential."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was interesting but it was too biased.","review":"A lot of this book was entertaining, but I disagreed with a lot of what was said. They should have put Karl Marx in the top ten. They give catro a bad review even though he brought democrasy and prosperity to the country and fought for human rights. They justified Trumans use of the atom bomb on Japan. They said he saved Turkey and Greece from communist domination, but all he did was keep right wing dictaterships in power. How can they accuse Marx of lining his pockets. He worked hard writing and lived and died in poverty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This arm band is absolute junk. The day I got it, the plastic screen cover started to pull away from the fabric. Over the next couple days the velcro tabs started to come un-glued from the fabric, yes that's right, they are GLUED onto the fabric. The band also does not stretch, so when your arm flexes it gets very tight around your arm. The plastic screen cover is frosted so it makes it very difficult to see the screen. DEFINITLY NOT worth $20.00, find another arm band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalism","review":"Save your money--this book is sensationalism.For example, in California people have been predicting bubble for the last generation (25 years).The reality is people prefer to live in Cali than in other places (anybody care to join me in Vladivostok? I didn't think so).The author is trying to scare you.I would not worry about it much."},{"rating":"2","title":"his predictions are dead on","review":"If a book like this was written in 2008, it would be a no surprise.But, writing this Jan 2006 was probably would not have been easy since, real estate market was still hot and many of so called 'experts' were suggesting us to buy homes as real estate prices will continue to rise for ever.Comparing the authors predictions back then with what is happening in real estate market now, the author is dead on.I think, this is book is still relevant today even after we know what is happening in real estate market currently.The author basically analyzes the fundamental factors that can cause the realestate appreciation and looks at how the boom of last few years was decoupled from fundamentals. He mainly draws parallels with similar boom-bust cycle in Japanese real estate market around 1990."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Now!: The End of the Housing Bubble","review":"The author did a good job in his first book, The Coming Crash in the Housing Market, to identify the housing bubble, to pinpoint its causes, and to predict the insuing crash. However, he is essentially repeating himself in this book and any additions are relatively minor. After reading through this manuscript, it looks to me that the main purpose of this book is to attack establishments and governments."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as it could be","review":"I liked his other housing boom book much better.

Since then houses in many places have doubled in value. I unfortunately listened to the advice of Talbott and others and held off purchasing. In the meantime, house values have doubled and my personal savings to buy a house are now worth 50 cents on the dollar. Thanks Mr. Talbott! In order for Talbott to be remotely creditable housing would first need to drop to 2003 levels, roughly 50%, and then it would need to fall more on top of that to account for what he argues in his first book.I am very unimpressed and disgusted that Talbott and his publisher would offer \\"Sell Now!\\" which essentially reiterates Talbott's dramatically wrong predictions from his 2003 book.

In most cases, these types of memoirs are usually written as part of the recovery - however, this book read more like a manifesto of all the men this person has gone through.There is no warmth, no explanations, no sympathy and NO honest attempt at recovery or even of really finding out what is happening to this woman.Also, this book is sooooo slow - every once in a while, an intersting tidbit, then back to boring again.The only saving grace is a look at the 12 steps.Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book","review":"I usually do not write book reviews, but I thought it was important to add a review of this book so that other people don't waste their money.

As published, you'll learn some of the ins and out or UltraDev (which seems to be an awesome tool!) but most likely end up frustrated when things simply don't work.The book gets a second star because there are some parts you can work through without having to chase your tail trying to figure out what mistake you may have made, when in fact, the error is in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to Read, but Got Errors","review":"Like all the The Training from Sources series, it is easy to read and follow the instructions.

The chapter on the believer's position in Christ should be read by all since it seems most believers aren't aware of these truths. Chafer points out a problem we see in the church today, the social gospel. Even in the 1920s churches were being lead astray to fix some problem in the world instead of just preaching the gospel to the lost. As I read these pages I couldn't help but think of Rick Warren's PEACE plan. The only negative I'd point out are two comments in chapter one which show his belief in the Gap Theory for creation.

Even though I had no previous knowledge of Jehovah's Witness other than the name, I felt myself identifying with several situations and feelings. She ties all of the events in her life to certain decisions made by her family and by herself.

I'm really impressed that she was able to overcome such a tainted past and be a successful person and wrote such a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I ordered this book anticipating a story of someone freeing themselves from a cult as the cover suggests. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover. The first six chapter are from age ten (intro. to JW's) to age eighteen (freedom). After that it is Brenda's life story, with the watchtower popping up every now and then. I have read many books regarding the watchtower, and have personally dealt with JWs. I was bored with the rut the book got into as she told her life story and forgot that her book was about leaving a cult. At times it seemed if anything bad happened it was the watchtowers fault (normal sruggles in life). Many things she went through lots of kids go through when they decide to leave their parents home. Some of the hardships she endured she put on herself. At one point I forgot that the book was about leaving a cult and listened to her complaints about struggles many Americans go through on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Cocoon","review":"Out of the Cocoon is only one more example of the pain which cults inflict on any member who decides to think for them self.

I recommend this book highly.Roy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a ghost writer, badly","review":"The book in itself is interesting, with regard to her family and this religion.

This is a simple pillow with catnip and it pleases them no end. Catnip apparently has a menthol-like compound that makes cats act as if they are either horny or drunk...or horny drunks.

Give'em a thrill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dense","review":"While this product offers an astounding quantity of catnip at an unbeatable price, buyers should be aware that this toy is so incredibly heavy that most cats will be physically unable to play with it. I don't know if my cats are unusually weak or what, but even when they work together they're unable to push the sack more than a few inches at a time. The low sale price is also offset by the cost of shipping such a massive brick of catnip across the country.

And yes indeed folks, this one has some very cool and out of this world music on it. Many tracks on here sound like that were snipped from some sort of 1950s noir soundtrack; left field jazz and bebop lounge tunes, that later swerve off into more of an electronic direction with beats and throbbing bass and more horns. Very hard to classify this, but the fact that you can't pigeonhole the style makes it all the more appealing, at least for me. One sentence in the liner notes sums things up fairly well, calling this \\"a smooth mix of chilled jazz, rumble-ass basslines, brassy outbursts and post-punk pop.\\" Intrigued? I was.

The director did a wonderful job portraying the hood in the projects of Watts, Calif. The harsh reality of growing up around violence and drugs was displayed in this movie by the actors great, seeing this movie when it first came out was like so hype because I'm from Los Angeles and when it was over it was like D@*%! Basically because that's how it is in the hood,so many young black men get caught up in that life and even though it's aviodable it's inevitable.

The supporting casts were better than the top cast any day. They had a lot of familiar faces that popped up. What ever happened to Tyrin Turner?

Though I grew up in the city, I now live in the county and sometimes that happens. The star Cain, is the typical inner city impovershed boy. So many social sciences are at play in him, everything from looking for confirmation from male peers, and needing the involvement of a father, to parenting and financial response. The Hughes Brothers made the film to explain these very items, to white America who always misunderstood us. The cherry on the cake was Caine dying. On Boyz in Da Hood, the star Trey lives and goes to college. The Hughes brothers frowned upon this, as it is not accurate to inner city boys. Instead, Cain, the star of Menace to Society dies, sharing with viewers the story of all of the other people who never make it. The sad ending was on purpose.

Instead the director Tyrin Turner has gone for a graphic and visual potrayal of living in South Central. The characters are one dimensional and there was no attachment towards them. Although it may have more violence than previous films of the same genre, Menace to Society is not a good justification of struggle. If you want a real Gangster film watch Boyz N the Hood or South Central LA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just can't relate...","review":"I'd heard about this movie from EVERYBODY about how good it was and how much of a classic it was.

Maybe I just need to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste!","review":"The Hughes Brothers have such potential that it disappoints me to see how awful Menace II Society was. Although it claims to be a clear portrayal of life in \\"stereotypical\\" ghetto in Los Angeles, I feel that it is such a copout to take the easiest thing to write about and turn it into film. It would be a greater accomplishment if they could successfully portray the lives of those who've managed to rise above rather than repeat the story of those who've failed to get out. Menace II Society just wastes your time by reiterating the same old stereotypes and puts them onto the faces of African-Americans in film. I definately recommend you DON'T waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake-O!","review":"What, am I the only one who thought this movie [wasn't good]? I had heard so many rave reviews about it but when I finally watched it, it was a total letdown. Everything was so fake, and you could see the ending coming 10 minutes into the movie. No doubt the story is believable (though you KNEW what was going to happen), but the acting was... well, acting. These guys try to sound tough but they're not. It comes off as very amateur acting. The story line is so-so, but having to sit through these guys reciting their lines just plain kills off whatever's left of the movie. I expected to feel terror looking at these guys, but the whole time I was just thinking, \\"Where'd you guys learn to speak like that? Gee, thanks for trying, but really, you should've spent some time listening to how real LA gangsters speak.\\" This whole movie is so watered down. The only good and realistic part is the opening scene of the shooting in the liquor store. Everything else just goes downhill after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gangster movie!!","review":"I have seen this movie a few times and it keeps getting better every time.

If you've seen **Boyz N the Hood** and felt relieved at the end by the uplifting aspect of the protagonist making it out of a dead end life, you're unlikely to have much patience for this comparatively darker and angrier picture, in which the characters seem to know that they're doomed from the start.But if this puts you off, you're missing out. As you probably know, this was brothers Allen and Albert Hughes's first feature. They direct with great self-assurance, in a style that is mostly invisible, matching the naturalistic, low-key acting of the principals-- Tyrin Turner as Cain, Larenz Tate as the sociopathic O-Dog,and Jada Pinkett[Smith] as Ronnie, Cain's lady friend, who just wants to escape and make a better life for her child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hood movie?!...Maybe so.","review":"I know,I know.

We are taken inside the lives of young men and women trying to survive in the badlands of Los Angeles- gang town, where your life can end at any given moment due to drive-bys or wrong-alley encounters. The racial message is strong- the blacks in America must do all they can to survive the ghettos, and climb out of the ugly pit white America has dug and thrown them in (historically).

For the heck of it I looked on Amazon and was pleasantly surprised to see a mini fan club singing the praise of this incredible film and pleading for a DVD release. Add my voice to the choir.

It's a well written first hand account of a U.S. Marine who was virtually forced, as well as deceived, into becoming part of what was intended by its American training officers to be a suicide commando group tasked with destroying a Chinese atomic bomb facility during the Korean War. The story is so incredible that it almost beggars belief, particularly their betrayal by their training officers.

It is still a good inspirational book, pass it on to a teenager because ITS FOR KIDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"obvious and done better by others","review":"The theories and ideas presented by this book are great, but the way they are presented completely turns me off to their ideas. It seems to be presented in a fantasy world and while the teacher in the book still struggles with how to implement these ideas, it does not feel like real experiences. The examples of how to respond to the kids don;t seem genuine and are in many cases impractical.If you still want to explore these ideas check outTeaching With Love and Logic: Taking Control of the Classroom, it does a much better job at presenting almost the same material in a much better way."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same from the authors in this excellent series","review":"This book was written in response to requests from educators, some of whom apparently experienced difficulty translating the principles from the authors' earlier work, \\"How to talk to kids will listen and listen so kids will talk.\\" The writing is clear and the supporting comics are very helpful. Like their earlier works, this is about how to get kids to open up and has useful tips about a variety of subjects. For example, when brainstorming, let them go first so that they are not initimidated by some great suggestion.As with the earlier works, the ideas apply similarly to adults. I don't think the book is necessary unless one wants more examples applied to primary education. Otherwise, I'd just get their first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of insights for teachers who deal with behavior issues","review":"As a middle school 6th grade teacher, I experience the gamut of behavoir issues from too much chatting, to rudeness to the occasional pushing/fighting. I found myself reverting to what this book suggests you don't do (but most teachers do) and that is to constantly say \\"Don't\\" and \\"because I said so\\". While I control out of punishment and consequences, I was not feeling I was controlling out of respect. I was searching for a book that could help me, and came across this one. I liked the simple concepts. I liked the actual examples used of typical classroom issues. This book made me \\"think\\" about how I am coming across to my kids now and how I SHOULD come across. The only part of the book that left me wondering was 'how do teachers have time to implement this'. I wish the author could have addressed that issue more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this book by accident...","review":"I was in a rush and thought it was about 'How to talk so kids can learn...TO TALK.' So as the non-educator mother of a 13 month-old, my opinion may not be the most valuable. However, I did find the book to be a little wishy-washy. Of course its better to open a dialogue rather than to lecture, but does an adult have the obligation to walk on eggshells when responding to poor behavior on the part of a child? And while I can see why gratuitous punishment might not work well, the advice to never punish seemed off base to me. It could easily be interpreted as 'never force a child to face the negative consequences of their actions.' I just don't think that works with kids. But, like I said, I'm not a teacher. It does seem like some of the advice in the book might create a better classroom environment in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous","review":"Should be called - how to give children permission to be in charge This book is for parents and teachers who want permission to let the children be in charge. If you are a firm believer that the parent calls the shots, this book is not for you. One of the suggestions in this book is to leave notes for the child, instead of confronting disciplinary issues head on. Part of our job, as parents, is to prepare children for the real world. If the child learns to write notes instead of dealing with issues face to face, she will be perceived as devious and spineless once she gets into the real world. I also found the dialog between the teachers to be contrived and very forced. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious ideas","review":"I had to read this book because of a teacher's request, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching - well, she obviously liked it, but not everybody has to agree with the \\"ideas\\" there. The things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher gave to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerated some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh.Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previous 5 star reviewers have ties to product manufacturer","review":"Beware 5 star reviews when all of the reviewers' past reviews are only for products from one manufacturer, as is the case here.

One of the great things about this book is that there are lines for personal notes so that each coupon can be personalized, perhaps by adding the names of restaurant suggestions, changing the content to better reflect your tastes(e.g. video rental date instead of going out)or giving intimate suggestions. The coupon ideas are inspiring and run the gamet of junk food to sexual fantasy fulfillment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes you need a Reminder","review":"Even though Valentine's Day may be a little corny, it still is a good opportunity to remember how much someone really matters to you. These little tokens of indebted affection are good reminders to show someone you care. They are particularly important because they don't just last for the odd holiday to remember this, but make you take time out to be together in an intimate way. While it may seem inconvenient at a hectic time, you'll realise that it's just the kind of stimulation you need to remember how much you love someone. It's a great reminder for busy people that aren't always able to show they care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its great if your spouse is shy","review":"These coupons are a nice way to probe your spouse in more romantic ventures than he/(normally she) indulges in.

I received the paper-back print of this book in the mail a few weeks ago and spent this week reading through it.

The synopsis sounded great and I love this genre. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed.The story itself is pretty good. It's romantic as well as erotic. However, this author needs to stop doing his or her own editing!!! Horrible grammatical errors abound. I'm talking basic English.I know this started out as an e-book and I've come to expect a little sloppiness in many of those. I imagine it's because they are released without as much proofing as print books. But this is beyond a few overlooked mistakes.The problem with grammatical errors is that they immediately take me out of what I'm reading.

Many of the songs live on today, for example, Frank Sinatra and many others have updated Makin' Whoopee.

It is a messege. A guide book. A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma. There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus. I loved the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"An excellent book. Everybody should read this book at least once! :-) Gibran was exposed to different philosophies and religions and had a great insight into life and the way it ought to be lived. Gibran was a great writer, philosopher, artist and a poet. I am lucky to have been able to visit his house in the mountains of Lebanon (now a museum). I brought back pictures. Feel free to email me(cedars_liban@hotmail.com) I don't mind sharing the photos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous writing","review":"The Prophet is a very thought-provoking and inspiring book. I purchased it after reading a few pages from a copy that my sister-in-law had, and I knew I had to have my own. An excellent collection of short stories and poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"when I order this book, I had no idea it would be a very small pocket size item. I thought I was ordering a regular size book, and I am disappointment with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the land of the blind...","review":"This piece of literature promises enlightenment but fails to deliver. Though the transient prophet indeed speaks eloquently and his words inspire deep reflection, they fail to impart true understanding. The initial discourse on love is riveting but what follows quickly descends into empty rhetorical musings which continue until the bitter end. The most entertaining aspect of this book is the artful use of language which almost masks the fact that the prophet indeed speaks but says nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eloquent","review":"I read this about a year ago and can't recall a great deal of the book. From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"I picked up this book after being inspired by some quotes from Kahlil Gibran. This is a brief text written in a flowery language that masks some simple points. I did not find this book inspiring or insightful, but it was a short read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wisdom and Truth","review":"I've always been wary of stories claiming ownership of principles of truth and wisdom, and attempting to package them in tidy, marketable portions for mass consumption. However, I found this novella unique and unpretentious in it's delivery of many truths that at first glance may appear intuitive, but in reality escape me in the daily practice of my life. It was a well-written, thought-provoking tale that helped me focus on the most important things of my daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read every once in a while","review":"Great little book full of (seemingly) common sense. Should be read by any judgemental person or religomanic. Should be cheaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift of Love and Wisdom.","review":"I recieved \\"The Prophet\\" as a gift from my best friend years ago.

This is the one gift I always give to those I truly care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I first read it as a senior in high school.

It is nuanced and timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, advanced reading.","review":"I read \\"The Prophet\\", by Khalil Gibran for a class assignment, and I found it an amazing piece of writing, even though it was a bit difficult to follow in some instances.Gibran's insights into the proper way to live, his wisdom, and his poetic ways with words, make it unlike anything I've ever seen. Very inspirational, and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOOK THAT ASWERS MANY UNASKED QUESTIONS","review":"Although the book was written a long time ago itstill applies to the present! It is easy to read and answeres many questions you might never ask anybody else but yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic & Beautiful Work of Literature","review":"This version of Khalil Gibran's book is a beautiful work and one I often give as a gift. The complementary artwork is fantastic. One of the most moving books I've read"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Prophet\\" is cool","review":"Cool book, I really like the quality of the production. Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag. I am proud to include it in my collection. Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life. The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus. I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter. Excellent for busy people or commuters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Outside the Box","review":"One of my greatest regrets is not reading my parents' copy in the 24 years of my life before I finally read \\"The Prophet\\". Kahlil Gibran has convincingly rebutted that sector of society that tells us to limit our horizons, to make prejudgements about others, and to confine our existence inside an asphyxiatingly narrow box, seeing nothing but black and white. In my humble opinion, the Prophet has declared that gray is the color of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Must Read!","review":"This is a book I wanted in my library. My original copy is yellowed and worn. This is the one book (other than the Bible) that I continue to re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prophet","review":"Love this book.

The book arrived on time and in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and Beautiful","review":"I've always been leery of books of this nature and do not follow any organized religon. But something magical happens when you read The Prophet. You feel as if Gibran's philosophy is an innate part of your being down to the core of your soul. The perfect spirtual elixir that leaves you buzzing with the feeling that this is spot on. If you need something to turn you insideout this is it. Seldom have i ever cried reading a book. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most classic, profound, timeless, eloquent pieces of literature of all time","review":"Seldom has there been a book that I have read time and time again as much as this one. I have given this book numerous times to people as a small gift. I have used this book in my son's christening when he was a baby and on numerous holidays. These words are every bit as relevant when they were written. For all time, this book still ranks in my top 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Table of Contents","review":"The book is fine. Yet, I would not have purchased this version if I had known that it lacks a table of contents. Particularly for The Prophet, most readers want to be able to jump quickly to a particular section.I want to \\"return\\" this version and buy a more expensive copy that includes a table of contents.Being brand new to the Kindle, I will now see if Amazon allows a Kindle item to be retruned for credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for a tiny printed novelty you'll love this","review":"I've always loved The Prophet and I've read it many times. I gave away my last copy and was looking for a replacement. I purchased this copy only to find that it was a tiny novelty version of the book. If you're looking for something tiny to keep in your purse then this is for you. If you're looking for a \\"real book\\" then this is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego, Get Away","review":"This book contains no new information; it does, however, express it in a unique fashion. To anyone who has read self-help, psychology, or spirituality books, this book will likely be disappointing.Mr. Tolle gets directly to each of his points. He has no elegance of languance, no nuance, no finesse. His language is authoritarian and professorial. He conveys his message that the ego runs our lives and that we can enrich our lives by getting beyond the ego's boundaries in an understandable manner. However, I found the book's efficiency of language actually to be a distraction from its message.I would not discourage anyone from reading the book. The message is important. I simply prefer to read the message written by a better author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worshippers soon to suffer buyers remorse.","review":"This is the latest cow-pucky slop sure to be the hot topic of conversation on the lips of the dullards. People need to learn to be honest with themselves and who they are.Mysticism and Jesus? No. You are just a mammal with self-awareness. Learn about yourself and your nature. Stop thinking that lying to yourself will somehow make you happy. The people gobbling up this book are the same that bought into the Secret. Turn off Oprah, turn off TV, and become responsible for yourself!Do you need help figuring out your existence? Try reading some actual literature likeCorpse of Freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn around your life!","review":"Whether you are religious, agnostic or just interested in your role in life, this book speaks to your most inner self. There is a message for everyone and a turn around of our current view of the world and us, as individuals and part of the human race. Do you want to know yourself or about yourself? The difference is explained in this book...Eckhart Tolle makes use of simple and clear language with many examples to convey his message of love, peace, free of ego and a new arising of consciousness. Truly, \\"A New Earth\\" is a book to read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Wisdom from the Critics than the Expert","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen who reviewed Tolle's latest with one star, just let me share that I gained more wisdom from your comments than anything of Tolle's I've read. You all sound like fine, balanced people and should get together and write your own book. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Newly awakened!","review":"This is an excellent book, very deep and what Oprah and the Author are doing is unprecedented. Very good at holding a mirror up to your life and if you are present and open, you can take a very good look at yourself, and if necessary...change who you are...for the better of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"Everyperson who reads this book may not be ready for it. But if it doesn't connect with you now, read it again in a year or so. It's a real life changing experience that can change the world one person at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Earth - Awakening to Your Life's Purpose","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I've read. But then it seems that everything that Oprah recommends for reading is. It is full of insights and yet easy to read. This book is for anybody that is looking to delve into a more \\"purposefull life\\". As the author himself says and I quote: \\"This book's main purpose is not to add new information or beliefs to your mind or to try to convince you of anything, but to bring about a shift in consciousness\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Earth Awakening by Eckhart Tolle","review":"As part of a Scripture study group, we decided to stretch in choosing this book. It is scriptural by reference as opposed to total content. In a group of twelve, two to three were put off itially because it didn't have the structure we had been used to, four to five have 'jumped in with both feet' and the remaining are gradually open to participating. I have a deep and cherished foundation and practice in my faith. As humans, we all have a foundation spiritality before alligning ourselves with organized religion and the discovery of this basic reality is where Tolle takes you. I do like the work and would recommend it to you if you are willing to be open to discovering the 'who' and 'what' of what it means to becoming fully human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent audio book","review":"Excellent audiobook of an excellent book. It is narrated by Echart himself. It's word for word dialog is a great way to get the teachings while driving or whenever reading is not convienient. If you're not familiar with Echart Tolle's teachings I highly recommend you read his work. It is certainly what mankind needs especially today. My self esteem has changed for the better dramatically. I'm at more ease with myself and I'm getting better as my understanding and application of these teachings increase. Life is so much better and problems are much easier to resolve. Get the book. Get the CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subject for a yogic/dharmic mens group...","review":"We used this book as the subject of discussion for one of our mens groups in Portland, OR and it was extremely powerful. Eckhart's discussion of the collective ego was right on and a great topic of conversation for our newly formed group.All of this information is inside of us of course... but this book does a great service by putting these concepts in terms that are easily expressed and taught.A very powerful work...Himat Singh Khalsa"},{"rating":"1","title":"All these was taught 2500 years ago","review":"What was mentioned in this book was taught 2500 years ago by the Buddha.

If you want to go back to the original source, I recommend that you read the teachings by the Buddha."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Earth","review":"Great thought-provoking book. Lots to read, lots to internalize. Found it helpful in gaining insight into what makes me tick. Found lots of applications in the real world.

It is worth it though - at least in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing","review":"A must read for those who have been seekers of the truth for many years! This way of life goes hand in hand with all religious beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Great","review":"I know that everybody knows that it is not possible to create a new earth...Mars is too cold, Venus is too hot, but Ecky Tolle lets us into a fresh way to interpret the old/current earth.Things like slow down, calm down, relax and calm down are all suggestions that he makes. For me this is tough, because if I slow down I will probably lose my job.Perhaps this book is better for people who have time to follow his steps. All to say, it is really good, and someday I really hope to nail all of my life's purpose by awakening.It would be interesting to see how this book would apply in war stricken or poverty stricken areas...I don't think it could.Anyways, this book is really good, and while I am having a hard time applying the lessons,or seeing how they apply, they are very intelligent and very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE NEW EARTH","review":"TOLLE IS DELIGHTFUL; ALTHOUGH THE SUBJECT MATTER CAN BE DAUNTING.

It is definitely worthwhile and a wonderful inspiration for tapping into the spiritual self. However, on a purely personal note -- it didn't speak to me as strongly as NOW. Also the entire premise of \\"Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\\" I found more than a bit misleading since this book primarily entails discovering the consciousness/being below all the SELF and MY labels. It's a hybrid of Zen/Power of Now. A beneficial read, some great ideas and food for thought, and yet somehow lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOES TO SHOW THE POWER OF OPRAH","review":"I read a lot of books and this one really threw me. Hard to understand and only purchased because of the Oprah show. Gave up after 30 pgs trying to figure out what all the excitement is all about?Am returning back to Amazon. Is this all it takes to write a book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, a self help book!","review":"How original. A new age, motivational help book. How many different ways can this package be wrapped up? If these books REALLY worked, why do they keep getting recycled? One word: permanancy. I bet the vast majority of people who read this book and \\"buy into\\" the \\"story\\" have done so before and will do again......just with different books. Break the addiction!! This book is just another quick fix....that wont last.Why only a quick fix? These books never provide tangible strategies for the reader to use to facilitate CHANGE (hence permanancy) so that they don't need to cling on to the next best thing when is pumped out by a publishing conglomerate. Want a book that gives you step by step, concrete instructions for changing your life? What to Say When you Talk to Yourself by Shad Helmstetter.

I've purchase 10 so far, given 9 away. As this book was passed along to me by a friend, so it goes. I refer to it quite often if I find myself getting off track and letting the ego take over, as well as stimulating its readers to share enriching conversations regarding it's knowledge. I've also found The Secret to be a fun addition to this book. If we all used this knowledge daily, made it part of who we are, it indeed would be a new earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolle's Masterpiece","review":"I can't recall reading a book that has had as huge an impact on my life as 'A New Earth'. Tolle has explained how we can reclaim control over our lives by understanding that most of us function under the control of our ego, which has an agenda of its own.

He has reduced what human beings need to do to get free of the insanity of our modern world to a very simple and compelling and easy to understand framework. I have purchased about a dozen copies and give them to people whenever I sense interest.

It gives logical reasons for our behaviours and of the behaviours of fellow man. But more than that there is guidance to help fulfil the destiny for which we have been sent to earth.

I know the concepts or realities of the book will be lost on some or seem too new age or deep for others. But for those who understand it and apply it, I am sure you will have the same result I had.

It's great information, but it's very repetitive, not very scholarly, and uses very little specific examples to illustrate points.Also, it's all just his opinions, written in a rambling style, without any reference to authority beyond himself, the Bible, and a few buddhist quotes.This wouldn't be so bad if it was a testimonial or a personal philosophy, but it's not. It's a treatise on how the world is, and how we operate, and how the terrible ego is to blame for everything from cancer to PMS.Maybe read his other book \\"power of now\\" first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a miss","review":"I was rather disappointed by this book after all the hype about it being profound and amazing. I didn't find that it contained much information that I didn't already know.The writing style was difficult to understand and did not flow well. I stopped and started many times with this book as I just could not get into it.I agree with many of the other reviewers that there were no practical or useful tools or tips on how to apply any of the knowledge - there was sort of this expectation that you should just be able to do everything he told you to do. If you want something with practical ideas - read the Dark Side of the Light Chasers by Debbie Ford."},{"rating":"1","title":"rambles on and on","review":"I give this book two stars because I agree with the basic premise that people should embrace the present moment. The problem is that the author repeats this basic idea over and over. While certainly some repitition is justified in order to get the point across, the repetition here rises to absurd levels. I think this book could've easily been written under 100 pages, but then, alas, it would be difficult to sell.

I makes sense that much of what damages us is that we believe our opinion of ourselves is who we are, but Eckhart Tolle makes it clear that we run much deeper than that.

Also, his implication that we should (and can) all just wake up by listening to his brilliant words seems to me to be a superficial fix to a subtle and thorny problem. Anyone can be mindful for an instant, staying mindful, though, can be the work of a lifetime. As several reviews have noted, his writings are largely warmed-over Buddhism.For those of you looking to wake up, I'd recommend reading Mindfulness in Plain English; it's getting at the same issue using a much more structured, time-tested approach, and best of all, it's free to download on the Web --just google it."},{"rating":"1","title":"McBuddhism","review":"As the title of my review indicates, this book is to philosophy what chicken nuggets are to fine dining. Tolle is an egotistic flake and his book is a cheap rip-off of Eastern philosophy. His dramatic pretenses at enlightenment, i.e. dead pan stare and drone-like speech, remind me of the scene inside a Buddhist monastery in Jim Carey's Ace Ventura.What a joke. Oprah has gone off the New Age deep end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what the hype is about.","review":"We read this for our book club, and were very disappointed in it. We were really looking forward to it, but it doesn't seem to \\"awaken\\" anything. We followed what Mr. Tolle is saying, but the repetitive nature of his writing made it difficult to get excited about surging forward. Most of us wouldn't have read it in its entirety if it wasn't for the book club. During the discussion, we all agreed that we shouldn't shoot the messenger when the message is a good one. However, it was unanimous that his writing style was pompous and difficult to engage with. He turned a lot of us off when he said that if you didn't get it, you weren't ready for it, i.e. smart enough or enlightened enough. Given the level of education and professional achievement in our book club (engineers, lawyers, doctors, published author, business owners and professors), we didn't think that his book was \\"above\\" our ability. It was just poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"After reading The Power of Now and listening to the book on CD several times, I greatly anticipated his subsequent books. I am very disappointed in his re-hashing the same information in his other books. In A New Earth, Tolle speaks with a strong disdain for his fellow humans. After a while I got tired of hearing about how \\"sick\\" and deranged we are. In Conversations with God, many of the same things are said, but you leave feeling uplifted and hopeful. Tolle's reading of his book leaves one feeling either depressed or irritated. Perhaps Tolle is so enlightened that he finds it difficult to be among his \\"unenlightened\\" brethren. To me, a sure sign of not being enlightened is judgment, and he seems full of that in this book. Not that I'm judging!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kindergarten philosophy","review":"Tolle's books are a collection of vague clichés and ambiguous platitudes; a combination of kindergarten philosophy and New Age mysticism. There are millions of books available, written by so-called enlightened individuals who all churn out the same stuff. Does this prove there must be something to them? Not at all. Billions of fast food joints doesn't prove that fast food has much nutritional value for the body. Similarly, thousands of self-described enlightened writers putting out books like these doesn't prove that fast-food spirituality has much nutritional value for the spirit. Eckhart Tolle admits that his enlightenment came spontaneously. Clearly he didn't need a book like his to become enlightened. Why should anyone else? I'm just going to wait until I become spontaneously enlightened too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle","review":"This is a life-changing and life-altering book!

It doesn't bother me that he is repackaging old ideas, but it does bother me that he misinterprets them to prove his weaker points. He constantly quotes Jesus out of context, which is enough to turn me off.Also, I think it's interesting that his strict adherents tend to criticize everyone who dislikes his message by insulting their intelligence. Truth is simple. You can dress it up, you can complicate and obfuscate it all you want, but underneath all that, the truth is what it is, and I promise you it doesn't take a 180 IQ to discern it. But this sense of superiority, to me, proves that this philosophy does not fly, because if it did it would engender love and humility among converts, not a pissing contest.Last thought, if you are looking for meaning, try 'The Ragamuffin Gospel' by Brennan Manning, it really hit home for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"more \\"I am a God\\" new age junk","review":"Let me save you some time and money.

Certainly no New earth. That is another fantasy, living in the future idea. The reincarnation idea is also not new and Hindus have practised this for centuries.

The explanations and examples are spot on and describes why people act the way they do, why they're always talking about the future or trying to identify with material. Once you understand and apply what he says you will feel as if a boulder has been lifted off your shoulders, and you'll be at peace.

This book is for people who are vulnerable and unstable...and he recognizes that. He is taking advantage of people who can't see through the B.S and making a profit from it. It's funny when you see people defend him, because they sound EXACTLY like him. Using the same phrases and words as him which is another sign of CULT behavior. In a cult there is usually someone running it. He tells you how to think and what to believe (brainwashing) tells you that your mind is insufficient (brainwashing) then takes your money.

The problem is that true Buddhism is many faceted and Tolle seems to have forgotten or has never known that fact. One of the problems in my opinion, with this book was that the author seemed to ramble on and on and on. He appeared to recant events and insights that didn't really pertain to anything except his belief in his own sense of self worth.

I'm glad this book exists if it helps even one person out there. I'm an atheist, but if faith helps some people, I'm all for that, too.

I painfully got through his drivel hoping there would be some moment of sense or that \\"A Ha!\\" moment from a profound statement but it just is not there. He spends 9 chapters talking about the ego, none of it based on fact or experience. Finally he mentions something practical of how a person can help themselves with this knowledge but that is all is was...a mention, and back to the mindless droning.

Eckhart Tolle's books always explore new spiritual terrain. Just as The Power of Now tempts you back into practicing the power of the moment, this new book impresses you with the urgency of personal commitment for global change.

I made a special trip to buy the book and took it home to read it -- and was very disappointed that I couldn't understand much of it.There is good stuff in there. The pages are sprinkled with references to Buddha, Jung, Sartre, Krishnamurti, et al, but here and there I had to go around sentences like \\"Any life-form in any realm--mineral, vegetable, animal or human--can be said to undergo 'enlightenment'\\". and just leave them behind like rock outcroppings in a plowed field.Part of my trouble, I think, is that Mr. Tolle makes up his own meanings for words. I get stubborn and refuse to change my original understanding of a word. Part of my problem may be that my expectation is that if I find \\"THE TRUTH\\" that it will be presented in a simple format, with a synopsis at the end of every chapter and an index and glossary at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the miracle it's touted to be","review":"If you're one to blindly believe whatever you read, this book is for you.

Maybe its because Im a bit older now but, I like books that come to a point. Get to meat of what you want to say, support it, and be done with it.

I have read past pop self-help books about people needing to \\"Lose the Ego already.\\"At times, the language is a bit hard to transfer to everyday language, as it speaks a bit \\"above the reader.\\" However, it's a good reminder what Jesus' beliefs were and how we can all be much kinder to each other.I just never got that \\"awakening\\" that Oprah and many are buzzing about.

There were eight members at our meeting to discuss the book - three had finished it, three had gotten part way through and given up, and two had read the first one or two chapters and weren't interested. I did get all the way through the book, and did not like it at all. I did not feel as though Mr. Tolle presented any new information, it has all been said differently before. His writing needed to be more succinct. While living in the NOW and overcoming past hurts is desirable, he made spirituality seem very complicated and difficult to obtain.

While I have found enlightenment in the work of Lama Surya Das and others, I find this book to be banal and anything but enlightening for myself. If others find enlightenment in this book, fantastic! The real me was not happy with the content of this book and I know that according to Mr Tolle that the content doesn't really matter anyway. I do agree you need to find a place in your life where you know yourself and 'who' you are. I just personally did not care for the style of the writing and much of the content.

If it is not to be a Utopia, then why believe at all? Everyone who reads this book needs to be \\"enlightened\\" to this - RELIGION can be defined as what sinful men do for a Holy God, but the Gospel of Jesus Christ is what a Holy God has done for sinful man (this means everyone, even Oprah and Tolle). We can never achieve acceptance by God outside of anything but this: That we receive His Son Jesus Christ as our Savior and God's sacrifice for our sins. Why is this so hard to swallow?

I hated the attitude this writer had about spirituality in general and felt he was talking down to the reader. I could only get through a few chapters before feeling physically ill by the author's spiritual arrogance. The ideas were not challenging to me at all and I felt no connection with the person behind the words. Save your money and see a good therapist before wasting your vaulable time on the planet reading this gibberish. Only you can know and create what your purpose is, and nobody else can tell you what that can be, not even this charlatan.

These ideas need to be tested and proved. Until then i would call this work a good essay, not a book.This good essay has also a 'hidden' dangerous side: It teachs you how to be OK with ANY situation. So why would you want, for example, to be wealthy or healthy since you learned to be OK even being poor and unhealthy. And even if you learned to be OK, would your, say, children feel the same way too? I dont think so.Bottom line: Read the book as a guide to help you overcome the hard path to the 'top', not as a guide to accept your present unpleasant situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last","review":"I know that I am in a different place than when I read the Power of Now but Eckhart's words are so fresh, I can't help but rave about this book.

What difference does it make whether Tolle's ideas are from Buddhist writings? The point for me and apparently for many others is that Tolle has made these useful ideas accessable. He's presented them in a way that resonates with many of us who would probably have never come around to this way of thinking otherwise.That's what writers do. They deliver ideas to us. Those of us who are wrapped up in ego can find countless ways to criticize. Feels good, doesn't it? Pumps up that ego and puts another layer of self-righteousness between you and the Now. Makes you think you exist. I'll take Eckhart's way any day. It works, bottom line. All else is superfluous.

No, it doesn't reflect my belief system. No, it isn't particularly original. Yes, it can be viewed as popularized and diluted Eastern thought. However, as one who spends about 90% of life in her head, I need constant reminders to come to my senses (literally). Tolle does a nice of reminding me of this and gives some specific and useful tips as to how to achieve and maintain awareness.I am a bit mystified by the perception that a single, childless man may not be credible as a writer on enlightenment.

I also didn't really identify with the pain body idea that -this is a sentinent organism that lives inside of you an seeks out absolute negativeity -or the idea that a women's pain body begins soon after \\"menstruation.\\" Makes me feel as if we are back in the 50's.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acceptance, Enjoyment, Enthusiasm","review":"The author's recommendations - acceptance, enjoyment, & enthusiasm - seem to diminish in that order in differentiating between someone who finds a new purpose in living and someone who is devoted to a selfish and materialistic lifestyle. Granted that \\"acceptance\\" is crucial at the gateway to a new inner self. But the latter two traits can be equally applicable to pursuing a materialistic lifestyle. Perhaps a more distinctive approach following acceptance would be \\"others-centeredness\\" and \\"personal satisfaction.\\" Acceptance seems the hardest challenge in a materialistic society. Once we accept our existence, we must realize that our purpose in life on earth is to care for others. In our materialistic society, an equally difficult challenge is to shift our focus to the welfare of others. But it is through this effort that we realize enjoyment, satisfaction of purpose, and self-worth.

That is so FUNNY! I love it. Tolle does a similar thing here - he explains how to awaken to your life's purpose, but then asserts that only you can really know how to do that for your particular journey. So basically he writes a book saying, \\"I am going to tell you how to do something that only you can know how to do for yourself.\\" If there is no \\"right way\\" or \\"wrong way\\", then what are we even talking about?

The 3 chapters that I did read were really good and many times find myself quoting him....

He very gently affirms the natural state of who we are and shows us how to reach it in the silence of the Observer, thus breaking bit by bit our connection with ego's unconsciousness.

There are only so many ways you can state the same claim and I felt those ways were exhaused in this book. You definitly do not need this book to awaken your life. It will only reiterate what is already obvious to any sensible person. I would NOT recommend this book. The author has not found the purpose and answer to life.

Much like the works of OSHO, the writing is simple, straightforward, and genuinely healing. The book says \\"Yes\\" to life, and gives to the reader the priceless gift of hope.

As a (striving to be) Christian each and every, I can't in all good conscience support such writings that make reference to Christ as if he is just \\"one of the boys\\" or equal, or less than Buddha, etc. Please know, fellow readers, the decision to throw this book out was not lightly made.

If you want to learn about yourself, read 'The Prophet' or anything by Kafka, not Mr. Tolle's mumbo jumbo. For reasons I now forget, I read Mr. Tolle's 'The Power of Now' and had to use all of my present moment energy to get through that one, which was at best a minor attempt at intellectual depth. I decided to give him another chance since, well, if it is in Oprah's bookclub, it must be brilliant. How could a greedy ego-maniac like her be wrong? Bottom line: 'A New Earth' is stupid. Don't waste your time or money. And if you want to learn about flowers, buy a book on Garden Design.

It is thought provoking, awakening one to feelings they might not know are in them. Reading this book, along with taking Oprah's online class is an adventure not to be missed. It is not a 'religious' book per say, but a book that takes you along paths you might not otherwise walk. It puts you in touch with the earth around you, things you see every day but don't really 'see'. Like being a child and watching an ant crawling along a blade of grass.

Shouldn't our lives be more satisfying as we age? By satisfying, I mean more joy, peace, purpose and freedom and less anxiety, stress and fear.

The author makes many references to God and the teachings of Jesus, but twists the meanings to suit his own purpose.

Whether he is or isn't is irrelevant to the messages he conveys.Yes, were I to think of myself as spiritually evolved, spending a week with my parents would promptly eliminate that self delusion.Read Ekhart's irrefutable proof of reincarnation. It's laughable.Yet there is wisdom in his constant rehashing of how we get lost in the dramas of our lives. Guilty!I wish Tolle had a better editor.

I didn't give it 5 stars just because sometimes in parts I would read and reread sections and think \\"Nope, not getting it.\\" That's okay, because for most of the time it was \\"Wow!\\" P.S. - It isn't a book to read at the gym or before bed.

However, this book allows the reader to look at life from the point of view of our own life experiences and behavior.

If man would apply the suggestions and mode of behavior described herein, if the reasoning explained would be acted upon, we would experience living and enjoying life at a completely different level.

I did find the pain-body concept extremely helpful in my own understanding and many of the issues related to how children grow from dysfunctional parents. So much of the book is written like a psychology text while other sections come off like a spiritual reading. Metaphorically, some images very much resonated with me and this is one of those books that I know I will re-read probably after I let it sink in a bit. I think the overall message is powerful, aside from the hype and if we all took the time to find out what is behind our anger, resentment and jealousy so that we can start living from our true Being, we would all be much happier as a society!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardto follow","review":"Inhad heard of Tolle from a number of friends.

I was impressed by all the hype this book had received and was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, after just a few pages, I knew I was in for a long read.I found Tolle to be arrogant, redundant, condescending, and very hard to read and understand. When he was not completely losing me in the vast majority of his verbose and overly-philosophical passages, he took a very obtuse and indirect approach to say many of the same things that others like Viktor Frankl, Stephen Covey, Rick Warren, and Stoic philosophers like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius have said very clearly and directly.While the book does discuss some important spiritual and philosophical perspectives, it was largely a waste of time for me and certainly not a book I will recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!","review":"I can see why a walking ego like Oprah would be drawn to a book that talks so much about the ego.

If you wake up in the middle of the night with intense pain and get caught up in a vortex like Mr. Tolle did, and then a little voice says \\"resist nothing\\" which is what happened to Mr. Tolle:PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASEdo not 'accept it', do not 'allow it', do not 'let go'.Resist it with everything you have because it's a demon entity trying to take root in your body!Mr. Tolle says that humanity is advancing into a new level of consciousness. What he wants is for humanity to become mindless zombies stuck in the present moment, allowing external circumstance to control it's destiny.Fight injustice, fight terror, fight immorality, fight the mind control and misinformation that the media, government, and religion perpetrate on us.Seek the truth vigilantly without just 'accepting your present' and 'letting go' of your past and future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had a hard time putting it down","review":"Eckhart Tolle's new book A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose is defenitly worth reading. I had a hard time putting it down once I began to read it, but after my eyes had enough I knew it was time to stop. Eckhart has opened my once closed eyes to a whole new world. I can't recommend this book highly enough!! I'd also recomend reading Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia by Elizabeth Gilbert if you missed it!Other recommended titles:Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"This was truly one of the most horrible books I have ever made the mistake of having paid to read.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Masterpiece of the 21st century!","review":"One of the very few most wonderful books I have ever read in my life! The points expressed by Tolle are extremely true, cutting down to the essence of ones soul if only one sincerely wants to understand. The essence of life is explained most clearly and in a very simple way. Throughout the book, I have admired the authors talant to express such sophisticated philosophical truths in such a simple and easy manner for everyone to understand. Also, the ordering of ideas is brilliant, and the style is impeccable. Its a true masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"- Just adding a vote - for something definitely worth hearing","review":"I recommend the CD set as I find it much easier to absorb than the book (but then again, I am not very good at reading written material).One comment expressed by many reviewers and that would like to echo is that Ekhart paints a powerful spiritual picture that may well help you understand enlightenment, and the obstacles and traps along the way, but it will not get you there. this book can set us on the path, but the rest is up to us and will NOT occur quickly or easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Can Make It So","review":"Anyone who has lost faith in humanity and the direction we appear to be going should read this book. Tolle is an extremely spiritual and intellectual man as well as a great writer. He has definitely captured my attention with this book and it should be a required read for all the people in power in this country. It's inspiring, challenging and a truly great read. If you've read Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, this is a MUST read for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"If you are a beginner in your spiritual path, this book might be ok but for most this will be a big waste of time. He spends the first half of the book talking about ego (could have done it in a few pages) and the second half he rewrote most of his points from the Power of Now. He gave Oprah a small % and the they are both taking advantage of the poor reader. My sugestion is buy Infinite Self 33 steps and the Power of Now and you will be very happy with both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting in line to be obtuse....","review":"THE NEW EARTH BUSINESS IS ONE OF A LONG LINE OF OBTUSE IDEAS, BORROWING FROM THE MAJOR RELIGIONS WHERE HANDY; USING SOME NEW WORDS TO SET THEIR IDEAS APART FROM THE NEXT THING COMING DOWN THE LINE.

However, I found that SHIFT: 12 Keys to Shift Your LifeSHIFT: 12 Keys to Shift Your Lifewas much more accessible and practical for me to use.

Each verb gets a whole page to itself. It is a valuable reference for the student learning French."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I don't understand why 501 French Verbs is so popular in the States. One reason I can think of is that the other verb tables are not so widely available. It is expensive. I have my students order Collin-Gem French Verb Tables or Barron's French Verb in group on Amazon.com. 501 is so big and heavy that it is inconvenient to bring to class. It is 50% more expensive than the other two verb tables. You will never need 501 verbs-- you just need 100-200 and a good index. There are not that many irregular verbs in French anyway. 501 is a paperback too... Barron's table has a nice plastic cover... Check out others before you buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est Magnificque... better than my French, anyway!","review":"Learning the various verb tenses is among the most difficult parts of mastering the French language. This book is very helpful: not only does it include the complete conjugations for 501 verbs, but also several appendices giving you a quick rundown of other fine points of French grammar. Combined with a good French/English dictionary, this book can help even a staunch Anglophone translate texts for research or other purposes.It's not enough in and of itself to teach you French, but it is a very useful guidebook and will get a good bit of use if you're seriously studying the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect structure - but some important verbs still missing!","review":"Actually I love this book. It is so easy to look up verbs in it. They are really fully conjugated in all the tenses you need to know. The only problem with the book is that there are simply more than 501 french verbs in reality! I was often frustrated when I looked for a verb and couldn't find it. However, I would still recommend this book as there is NO other choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable reference book for any French student","review":"This book is an absolute must for any student of the French language. It is not compact so cannot be carried around with great ease. This is more the book that is kept at home and used when writing a composition. However there is absolutely no substitute for this book for any student who wants to write well in French."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential for french learning!","review":"I would actually buy this book before I would buy a dictionary. This is the best reference book I've ever used for french! This book is completely indisposable. I've spoken french for years and there are verbs in there that I've never heard of!! It's absolutely great. I can't rave enough about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any student of French...","review":"Unlike the Bescherelle (the other \\"must\\" verb book I own), this book is excellent for the beginning French student simply because it's, well, simple. Each verb is conjugated separately (whereas the Besch. has verb \\"groups\\"), and although one is limited with the choice of verbs, it's a great guide for quick reference- when you don't want to think about if the verb is regular or irregular and guess at the endings. It's all right there. Sooner or later, you're gonna need a Bescherelle, but this is a wonderful starter kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Handy","review":"I use it all the time when doing my homework for my advanced class in French.

I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"501 French Verbs","review":"A well organized resource book of French verbs.

Very thorough - I used in for school for years and never had to buy an update."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for learning conjugations","review":"One of the hardest parts of learning French as an English speaker is that unless you've already learned another language with similar structure, keeping track of which conjugation or tense to use is a big pain. Although 501 verbs doesn't really have enough verbs to become useful as a dictionary for anyone who wants to really learn French, it is the perfect tool for learning to differentiate between imperfect, past perfect, subjunctive, past subjunctive, future, and everything else. Definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cute.....But What A Disappointment !!!","review":"I purchased this book knowing that my daughter would have loads of fun with the cute magnets.

The product looks as depicted and is what's expected.The one item to note is that the sizes seems to have shifted, a bit, since I last bought a 'Twins Enterprise' cap 2 years ago (the company now goes by '47 as their name). I got an XL, as, in the past, that's what has fitted me best. Always been a little big on me, but would eventually shrink down to my head size. Well, this one was a bit bigger than I recall, and hasn't shrunk to my head size yet (even after the trick of wearing it in the shower and letting it mostly dry on my head...yes, it does usually work). Not sure it will either. Is it too big to wear? No. But it doesn't sit snug to my head either, as I like caps to do.

The Magnum concept did propose using standard Shuttle SRBs, for boosters, not the liquid flyback boosters, as stated. Also Figure 9.1 is of a sidemount Shuttle Derived Vehicle (SDV), like Shuttle-C, and not a Magnum, as stated. The RS68 engines, referred to on Page 289, would not fit the pictured sidemount SDV configuration. The real proposed Magnum configuration is correctly identified in Figure 8.3.

The strong point of the set is Zombie Holocaust/Doctor Butcher M.D., which is a pretty good Italian style jungle romp, and the low point is the staggeringly awful Flesheater, which drags on for-freaking-ever.

Very poor customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album","review":"I bought this album months ago on cassette in amoeba records on a whim one weekday afternoon and I was blown away. the trouble with a lot of recordings from the eighties is that otherwise fantastic albums can be bogged down with cheesy, dated production quality. however, this album (production included) sounds just as fresh and vibrant today as it did when it first came out almost twenty years ago. the songs are excellent. two chords never sounded this good. some of the songs go on forever using the same basic chord structure. yet, somehow, it never gets dull. i have the feeling that if this band were to come out today instead of twenty years ago, they would be instatly popular with today's music scene. this is very original, timeless music.the wedding present were definitely one of the best bands to come outta england in the late eighties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, hard British pop","review":"I first heard Bizarro in my angry, young college days and it grabbed me and never let go, I still regularly listen to it today. The lyrics are full of love angst and confusion, great stuff!! A must CD for any fan of Bob Mould (Sugar and solo) and the early SubPop sound (Nirvana, Mudhoney, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"D'Arcangelo - Broken Toys' Corner","review":"D'Arcangelo's album BROKEN TOYS' CORNER jettisons some of their more noisy leanings (though not all), for better or worse, in favor of the latest genre du jour, braindance. That's not to say that they're following a trend -- their output continues to be varied and interesting: \\"All That J\\" is jazzy, while \\"In-Tower\\" has a more abstract melody over a complex rhythm line. The elegant and melancholic \\"Chair Theme\\" adds an element of emotion into the cerebral proceedings. \\"Tetax\\" injects a dreamy note into the album, one that's solidified by the rough edges of the beat. \\"No-Ia,\\" for all its beauty, sounds vaguely reminiscent of all the other melodic IDM floating around out there. And if anything hinders this album, it's that: a refusal to stake its own unique place. But with such distractions as the mellifluous \\"Mitrum 7\\" or the closing track, \\"Flatcalm,\\" the BROKEN TOYS' CORNER isn't a bad place to be, after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"student pilot perspective","review":"Excellent heads-up tips and insight not taught in all flight schools. Covers topics from basic flight theory to emergency procedures and how to avoid them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Biochemistry book","review":"I find the book consise and well written without a lot of the unecessary padding found in larger Clinical Chemistry texts. It gets straight to the point. Lists the Important facts, and has meaningful case studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two songs that Bowie never should have re-recorded","review":"The b-sides on this single are horrible. When Bowie wrote them in the 60's it was different, but these songs sound immature and don't show an ounce of talent that he has shown for so many years since. I really don't get why he chose to re-record them, considering all the old material that he could've used instead (how about some rereleases of songs from 'David Bowie'? That would've been great). Still, for a historical Bowie fan or simply any Bowiefile this is not one to miss, as I have it and I'm glad I do for my collection, but as far as listening I've tried to get into these songs a number of times but always to no avail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for","review":"I was looking for a night stand that I could have next to my rocking chair in my son's nursery, and this is perfect. It's not too big, and not too small. Comfortably holds everything I need and it's a good height. It's sturdy, too. Assembly was easy. Great product at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not fancy nightstand","review":"Product arrived without assembly instructions which they promptly provided over email. Assembly was easy for one person. Table is solid, but not fancy. It will scratch and dent easily so should be used in a low traffic area or it won't hold up. Very fair value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does the job","review":"Its a functional night stand, and is worth the price. It looks like a cheap night stand because it is a cheap night stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice nightstand","review":"I got two of these to use as night tables. They were just the right size. Decently made and worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned this today!","review":"Table is a lovely soft white! Had to return table today as there was an issue assembling it. The 2 sides could not be attached to table top! Either the \\"large screws\\" were too large or the holes drilled were too small. If forced the wood would split. A shame because this would have worked beautifully as a printer table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but not so nice","review":"This table comes with some assembly required. Some meaning a lot of assembly required. The drawer sticks and it is very cheap. Not the best table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bedside Table","review":"Exactly how it's described. Looks really nice and was easy to put together. My only complaint is that the drawer droops down when you pull it out. Still worth the price though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"I would not recommend this table. The screw holes didn't match up so we weren't even able to assemble it. The quality was very poor in general. We ended up returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to assemble because of holes not lined up","review":"Very frustrating situation to begin to assemble this product only to find that the holes for the top of the table did not line up with the ones to connect the legs! The hex \\"screw driver\\" was of little use as it did not work after a few turns. I had purchased two of these for guest quarters, and returned both of them. I will not purchase from this company again. b.f."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I was very disappointed in the quality of this table. The right hardware was not sent with the table. It was definitely not easy to assemble even after they sent the ''correct\\" hardware. The screws still don't fit properly. I don't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great table at great value","review":"I'm always nervous when purchasing a product that's so inexpensive, but in this case, I'm very pleased. We needed a simple side table for our nursery and this works just perfectly! It came perfectly packed with easy to understand instructions. All the pieces were there. No damage. There is a drawer stopper that comes with it that's somewhat superfluous, but we decided not to use it and I'm not worried about it at all. We purchased the white table, so I'm not sure how the other colors compare, but I'd definitely purchase this item again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little table!","review":"I purchased this piece as a nightstand for my 12-year old daughter's room. The original piece came damaged; therefore, I contacted Amazon to let them know, and their customer service department was exceptional! The return process was the easiest that I have ever experienced, and we received a replacement in just about 2 days. I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service -- and we're so pleased with the quality of this nightstand (especially for the value)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weight good rod","review":"This was a good rod to go fishin with. It wasn't too heavy, and was very sturdy. I felt like I could trust it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ankle High Stockings","review":"These wouldh ave been a great purchase if they were made for people who have skinny legs. They were also way too long for me. I am 5'3\\" and weigh about 135 lbs and could not keep these on my feet. I thought they would be perfect for wearing with slacks, but unfortunately, they are not one-size-fits-all as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book with a lot of decent information.","review":"This book had everything I wanted to know about huskies.
