Throughout the book, William Marks weaves his awe-inspiring adventures of life and love with water. While Marks makes the interconnectivity between mankind, water and the universe utterly clear; you get that his relationship with water is special. He is not just giving us information or telling the story of water; he loves it deeply. His commitment and passion is beautiful and it makes this book wholly unique and fascinating. I read this book in a day and I continue to go back to it for specific water-related facts, quotes, and information on people/places referenced in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I slogged my way through this book; and there are some interesting facts in there about water and the environment. But this turned out to be the author's personal story--a kind of alternative, visionary self-help book. The following is a typical excerpt along those lines from this book:\\"One common method for healing the body with dew is to kneel in the nude and brush the open fingers and palms of one's hands across dew-laden vegetation.... Another method for touching the body with dew is to lie down naked on soft dewy grass and roll about. This is especially cosmic when done under one's celestial birth sign or when the light of the Moon is smiling or in full bloom.\\"If this is what you're seeking, this is your book. If you were hoping for a discussion of environmental issues, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water's Significance Portrayed with Style","review":"The Holy Order Of Water is an amazing summary of water's significance throughout history and the importance it plays in most cultures, religions and all of life. William Marks' passion about water is evident in this remarkable book that shares the knowledge and experiences he has gathered during his 30 years of work and research with water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sized for a woman's foot?","review":"These shoes look great but slip on the heel making them very uncomfortable.

Don't get me wrong, I love Onelinedrawing, but it just didn't have the same edge that Far had. Well, New End Original, definitely brings back that edge full force. Every song, from start to finish, is catchy, witty, and emotional. Once again, Jonah and the boys have created the perfect album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sell your collection of Vagrant standbyes and grab yourself","review":"Anyone who has been following the career of Jonah for the last few years was surely excited to hear about this new band project. The first song shows us exactly what OneLineDrawing left us wanting: the rock. From there it is a mixed bag. From radiofriendly pop sounding songs that superglue themselves in your brain to a couple of redone O.L.D. songs, this album is worth owning for anyone who likes decent music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes...there is a secret conspiracy alright....","review":"And the conspiracy is that you can prove anything if you quote the right person. That the person quoted doesn't know what he or she is talking about is irrelevant. Okay, here's the truth. You are all genetically re-engineered mindless automatons created to serve me!!! (Now, if you can swallow that nonsense, you're ready to believe the stuff in this book, too). On the other hand, if you need a good laugh...give it five stars! But, if you really, really believe that this is all a conspiracy, send yourself back to kindergarten and grow up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One big pile of garbage","review":"Poorly written, amazingly contrite and if you like to leap, this book will be great for you because you are required to make so many leaps you'll need to give your legs a rest. I can't believe I wasted time reading this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WHO'S WHO OF THE INVISIBLE GLOBAL GOVERNMENT","review":"If you want to know the who, how, and why of current events, you must read this book. Pages 26-27 alone, lists 29 public figures and their titles, all of which are involved in the secret societies which dictate our governments policies. The ultimate goal of this global conspiracy,(beyond the creation of mega wealth and power,) is one world government. Marrs takes us on a journey backward in time from our modern secret societies, such as the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, and Federal Reserve System, to the evolution of century old organizations. His fact laden commentary on the hidden agenda's of the elite, makes futurist authors such as Furland all the more credible. This is the best and most thoroughly researched book on the subject I have found. Do your own due diligence. Read this book. I would also recommend Icke, whitaker, and Furland."},{"rating":"2","title":"All roads lead back to Sumer","review":"After I decided to learn the truth about who really runs the world and what not, I picked up this book since it seemed to tie together all the things I was wondering about, going back to the ancient mysteries. Jim Marrs really does an amazing job of compiling all this information and tracing it back through history to the Sumerian texts about the Anunnaki. If you are at all interested in shattering the false view of reality our society is conditioned to accept, then take the red pill, and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not credible theory","review":"Jim Marrs has some good points and definitely an interesting theory. The book was actually excellent for the first third part but the last two thirds the book turned out to be deceiving. At the end I almost felt like I was reading a sci-fi book similar to Star Trek. Frankly some of the theories Marrs advances look ok but after careful analysis one cannot but conclude that it is pure fallacy. I would not spend the money on this book and if you really want to read it I suggest going to your public library and flip through the pages especially for the first 100 or so pages - forget about the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dis-Information","review":"I was not aware of the history of Mr. Marrs if I was I never would have bought this book. I didn't understand that he put in many years with the Military and had an honorable discharge. I've read his views on chem trails which seems like PR for a Gov that is basically poisoning us. Very disturbing. I'll stick to Stephen Quayle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marrs flys out of orbit","review":"A weak hypothesis, backed by weak research and furthered along by weak circular logic leads to a weak, week-long read.

If \\"they\\" control the news do they not also control which books are published? Would they not at least eliminate the \\"enlightened\\" among us? Why are the books written by Marrs and his ilk allowed to sit on the shelves of our libraries?Or maybe this and similar works are actually written by The Establishment, but are full of false information to throw us off the track... Is \\"Jim Marrs\\" one of THEM?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good over view","review":"It presents a good overview of the various conspiracy theories and elite organizations, but I think it tries to crunch on too many at the same time and falls a little short of the mark in wrapping it all up in the end. I don't think anybody could wrap it all up at the end because it is just too big. But that doesn't detract from the individual sections before that. Jim Marrs is one of the best writers in the genre, and this another good read from the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those interested in the truth behind the scenes","review":"Jim Marrs has done a very good job in researching the true motivations behind various wars, as well as the causes for some famous political and financial crisis.A lot of things make more sense when seen under this different new light.The last part of the book (ETs, planet Nibiru and Annunaki) however does not seem to fit the main conspiracy theme. A bit far fetched."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to be brain-dead not to appreciate the wealth","review":"of Information in this book. One of the best I've ever read.

Maybe. Does his explanation make sense. Certainly.That's the problem. He is so logical and draws from so many sources that you have to really stop and think. He could be right.When I got to the last chapter which explains the teaching of the mystery schools, I was hoping I would not be treated to another \\"We desceneded from aliens\\" theory.But this time, what he says actually could be true. That's the trouble with this entire book.It could all be true.Beware, secret elite who rules the world. Your secret is out.This is a must read for any conpsiracy theory buff!Myke Feinman.

The last time i checked this book on amazon the readers comments were no longer there...Buy this one also before all copies are destroyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good overall information","review":"I was very surprised by the manyfold 'secret societies' there are. I thing the author did quite a good job in, sort of, putting them in chronological order! The information was detailed enough with many cross references if one wishes to pursue a certain chapter! It is amazing to find out that since the beginning of society, there has always someone been in the shadows trying to influence certain events! And one wonders why certain things have never been revealed and how much we are really controlled by the invisibles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the names, dates and facts are overwhelming.","review":"I give this book 4 stars because I found the first 2 parts cumbersome to read. As the book went back in history I found it got more and more interesting. I was disappointed that there was no bibliography. There was however a source list to back up facts and information.All in all the book gives a good overview of the \\"Big Picture\\". What you choose to belive and what you choose to ignore is an individual choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but not Factual and a little out there.","review":"If your into conspiracy theories, be my guest and read the book, I read the book at my local library, and Thought it was fun, entertaining, however amusing, it is NOT FACTUAL. and caters to people who believe we did not land on the moon, or that oswald did not act alone(oliver commie stone) etc. It's a book to pass the time, but not a serious book, read before you buy and see if it fits your mold?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Threatening to Deliver","review":"Marrs puts a lot into the title, and precious little into the content. The book meanders thru lists and brief bios of conspiracies without much of a point.So there are a bunch of people consipiring to promote their self interest? Whoopedy du! I was expecting a lot more, like are these people bad? Marrs tells us that they want \\"one world government\\", but neglects to describe how that is sinister, maybe it would be groovy!Marrs then stretches to tie every wacko outfit in history together with Sitchin's work on Summerian translations, (Read the 12th planet by Sitchin, its interesting, but widely disregarded by experts) to conclude that were all part of, may I say it, some \\"Alien Agenda\\".I guess as fiction goes, this could be turned into something impressive. As non-fiction, it only threatens to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Jim must live on Mars","review":"I love this type of book, however 90% of it is stolen from other conspiracy theory books and most of those theories have been flat out proven to be false. There was little to no actual investigation here. No new material, nothing to make my purchase worth while. First book in my life I threw in the trash where it belongs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book isn't even about Secret Societies","review":"He starts off talking about secret societies, with some interesting but dubious ideas. Then he goes into conspiracy theories trying to link Rockefellers and Rothchilds to everything. This takes many pages of useless backstory to set up.But by far the worst part of the book is the rant made about alien establishment of humanity. I get the feeling most reviewers didn't finish the book or didn't notice it slipping from historical analysis and links to secret socitietes to the recitation of the Alien-Earth Theory, with no links made at all. It is bizarre beyond belief, and the assurances of 'scientists' and 'experts' in this section makes it clear the other sections are most likely made up as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most thorough and \\"digestable\\" synopsis of the 'BIG LIE.'","review":"If only this concise, well-written, beautifully organized book had been published 20 years ago! I have long searched for a book to recommended to sqeaumish readers. This work represents the most thorough and \\"digestable\\" synopsis of what is happening in the world. If only booksellers would take it out of the occult section and place it in current affairs and government sections, more readers might be exposed to it. My favorite reads in the last year have been 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger and 'Unconventional Flying Objects' by Dr. Paul Hill. Really worth checking out.\\"You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!\\" If you consider yourself a thinking person, set your religion and your politics aside and BUY IT IMMEDIATELY! I highly recommend this book as well as \\"Alien Agenda,\\" also by Marrs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, here we go again!","review":"Thirty years ago - 30 years ago! - I would see pamphlets about this type of stuff, only it didn't have the luxery of three decades of evolution and growing sophistication. Quotes taken out of context, questionable sources, and most damaging of all, actual facts bootstrapped to prop up the preconceived notions of conspiracies and one world governments and secret cabals. No matter what HUGE event in civilization you point their nose at, Mr. Marrs and his ilk will tell you it's something else.The nadir of all of this is Mr. Marrs's mention - note, it's not an indictment, but for all intents and purposes it is - of some sort of John Hinkley/George Bush conspiracy to assasinate Ronald Reagan.Oh, for crying out loud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"I give the single star only because there is not an option to give no stars at all.

Touched on is a good phrase, because this book is really a hodgepodge of \\"resources\\" taken out of context (context, Mr. Marrs, look it up!) to support some very silly ideas. The final chapters dealing with the true \\"Ancient Mysteries\\" are laughable, and would make a very bad piece of fiction, even. This is not journalism, by any stretch, but, if truly believed by the author, a sign of encroaching dementia. The only reason I give this two stars is it is entertaining in stretches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rule by Secrecy","review":"It is very unfortunate that the Amazon rating system does not accomodate a \\"no-star\\" or better yet \\"a negative star\\" system. This book is \\"a joke\\"!!! At best the author got himself very confused as to which of the so-called secret societies is actually the most secret of them all and what their agenda is all about (I know it must have been difficult to try and figure out all these 'secrets'...) I was particularly amuzed by the author's suggestion re. Hitler's and Rothschild's common heritage!? It goes down hill from there...Save your time and money..

In fact, I find the story boring, and it had such possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice.","review":"If a film company had to chose one of the new line of Dr. Who books to make into a movie, this would be the one I would chose. There's suspence, a gripping story line and a massive alien structure which has to be could, hadn't it?

But I was unsure about spinors, and I hoped this book would help. It didn't.Much time is wasted is confusing and unnecessary quibbles. Each rotation can be represented by either of two quaternions. But which one? Far too much is made of this dilemma. Each rotation has two poles. Far too much is made of this too.The author's plan seems to be to create as much confusion as possible, and then show how quaternions can clean it all up, like a superhero at the end of a movie. Much better to *start* with quaternions and never let the confusion arise in the first place.Dismal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Story","review":"I have watched this film several times since first seeing it on Pay-per-View and subsequently ordering it on DVD.

Most of the programming we watched were in 4:3 format and the edges of these format burned these vertical marks which were readily seen when switched to 16:9 ratio. Finally, 3.5 years after purchasing, the TV died. I called Audiovox customer service dept and was told that there is now warranty on any parts including the light bulb which supposed to last 50,000 hours (which is equivalent to 5.7 years of non-stop work 24/365). I was also told that there are nor replacement parts available (without even asking which parts I may need) and suggested to call 4-6 weeks later (!) to find out about parts.I'd say steer away from this brand if you are looking for a new TV.

It will blank out as often as every 20 seconds, and doesn't stop.My father took it to the warranty service, and they gave him a new television. He hooked it up to our Comcast Digital Cable and... it did it again.

This noble profession certainly had no room for such a peasant! But the heavens were looking out for him and rise he did.

It has good strategy sections, but when it comes to facts, this book is full of errors. The fish and insect charts are simply wrong in many cases, saying certain species aren't available in some months when they really are and vice versa. Prices of housing additions are wrong. Information about store hours is wrong. Finding info on a specific item is extremely difficult, since nothing is in alphabetical, no pictures are supplied, and the name of the items is in small print. The calendar of events is wrong, with erroneous dates and missing events etc. What's even worse, the Prima website does not have an errata posted that corrects all these problems. Go for the Nintendo Power guide. You'll be a lot happier.

It also is much better organized and has pictures of everything. The Prima guide is hard to read due to it's four colum per page format and the item guide is horrible. The only thing that saves this book are the charts of when to catch bugs and fish, although there are some wrong information and it does not tell where they can be found.

Buy any other resident evil game but just don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a disgrace to the RE series","review":"In Resident Evil: Survivor, you play an amnesia stricken man wandering around a zombie infested town looking for clues to his past. The first thing you'll notice about the game is it's first person perspective and that the game was clearly meant to use a light gun prepheral but does not (yet it's Japanese counterpart does). That major drawback, combined with the choppy animation, muddy sound, poor controls, and near none replayability, make Resident Evil: Survivor one big disappointment of a game. It's worth playing if your a longtime fan of the Resident Evil series, but don't expect much out of it other than an intriguing side story to the saga. Capcom has once again made another first person light gun aimed Resident Evil game called Resident Evil: Dead Aim for the PS2, and that game is quite an improvement over this piece of crud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survivor?","review":"This game was the worst of all the resident evil games the only reason why i played the whole thing is to get to the end. i bought the game thinking it would be a cool resident evil game but it wasnt the aiming was hard to control and 2 hours later i beat the game and have never touched it again. if i were u id just read what people say about the game and let it stay like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"man this is soooooo dumb","review":"okay look to buy this game youed need to be on somthing this game is easy i beat it in a hour and 2 min dont waste your mony i only got it because it looked kool rent then buy but if you do be ready to laugh at it then beat it with no difrent ending (exsept for who dies at yhe end) I was dis aponted with the tirant so no buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few people actually liked this game.","review":"Yes, this game has it's problems having to beat it in one sitting is one, but you know what it takes only an hour and half to beat at max, and that's about as long as one gaming session; and due to the various multiple paths and difficulty settings it has quite a bit of replay value. The graphics are not that good though, I'll concede to that, but overall I find it to be a lot of fun. With thr success of the rail shooters of Resident Evil, I'd love to see this game get remade at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"I barely survived the graphics","review":"On the whole this game was a great disappointment. I found the graphics and backgrounds to be poor-(particularly when compared with \\"Quake\\" and \\"House of the Dead II\\").

Code Veronica is the best Resident Evil game I've ever played, and is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a real great game","review":"this RE game is by far the worst one. The controls are poor, the story really isn't that great, and doesn't add all that much to the actual RE plot. It's more of a Tangent to the storyline than anything else. It was also way too short, as it only took me about 2 hours to beat, and there are no save points. There are no real shocking or really really scary moments as in all the other RE games. It is also very easy to pass better weapons as I did on my 1st time through the game.

(SLAP)","review":"Well what can I say. This game doesnt really suck, but isnt that good. The idea of a first person view was a good idea but this game lacked in several areas. The plot wasnt very good at all. It seemed as if the game was just thrown together to just put something on the market. I'm a huge fan of the resident evil series, but this game was a real dissapointment. My advice is to definatly rent the game first (it isnt very hard. I beat it in one day).

If you like Resient Evil you'll like this, especially if you like first person view. And if you don't own any if the other Resident Evil game I suggest you start with the first one. If you can beat that you can beat this one. This one is pretty cool even though there aren't really any puzzles but the graphics are pretty cool.

I mean the puzzles weren't even difficult you didn't even have to back track like in the other games. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone due to the simpe fact that they put in no effort into this and simply let me as well as many other resident evil fans down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"If you like Resident Evil, or First Person Shooters, this is not the game for you. This one fails horribly on both fronts. There is no look around feature essential to any FPS, so you can be standing right in front of something, and not be able to see it because you can't look down! Not to mention the fact that the plot is weak, and has nothing to do with the continuity of the other games. Steer clear of this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down --> Can't save!","review":"The fact that you can not save your game is really a big draw back...you can save only if you die..."},{"rating":"2","title":"this would've been great","review":"This game would've been my favorite of all time if only they hadn't done the one thing that made this game bad, taking away the guncon support. this game is actually really good, but the reason evryone trashes it is because it is a guncon game withought guncon support. It was extremly difficult to move the target on those... dogs before they could hurt me. wihought a doubt, this game would've been better if they had kept the guncon support. another mistake they made was making you play through the whole thing withought saving. In doing this they had to make the game unbearibly short which adds to the badness. So i wouldn't reccomend the US version of this game , however, the japanese version is alot better because it supports the guncon. So if you can find it then get the japanese version, I highly recommend getting it. WARNING! If you get the US version, hoping to get a good lightgun game, you will be highly dissapionted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad...","review":"I bought this game shortly after it came out, went home and beat it in something like 2 hours, if i remember correctly. The game is completely linear with only 3 varying paths that meet up shortly there after.The items require no exploring to find as they sit a foot above the surface spin and flash.Also, the graphics are the same ones used in the previous games in the series but zoomed in/blown up making everything look so much more pixilated.Even though its the same graphics, enemies, and setting, this is not a Resident Evil game. Imagine it more as a terrible version of the original Doom.Skip this game! But, if you're really interested in it or need it to complete your RE collection, don't spend more that a couple bucks on it, or better yet, just pretend it doesn't exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"alright game","review":"Resident Evil Survivor is an arcade style game but the bad news it does not support the light gun if it did this would be a good game but still this game ain't the best but it can be worse i loved the storyline loved it the main character is named Ark Thomas, in the begining of the game there is a scene of a man on the helicoptor rails below his name is Vincent that did all these mass murders. he tryed to stop Ark from escaping the city why because Vincent wanted to kill him because Ark was spying on Vincent of his evil activity and Vincent stoled Ark's dog tag that had his name on it then they crashed Vincent got killed Ark survived Ark got up and did not know who he is or where he is he does not no his name or waht happened or does not know there's zombies and Vincent co workers are telling Ark that his name is Vincent. also this game improves your shooting skills that why i like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biohazard","review":"Residant Evil: Survivor or Biohazard: Survivor (Japanese name)is not at all like I had expected.

(I understand this is because of the recent school shootings. However, without this function the game looses it's apeal rather quickly.)This game has little varition between each senario. Other than two option choices at the very beginning the game is exactly the same through out. It rapidly looses it's challenge and gets completely boring after the you start the second senario.If you are trying to improve your first person shooter skills, rent this game, but I would not recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money on this one.","review":"A complete waste of time for any Resident Evil fan. I cant belive Capcom actually put this game out without light gun support. The game play is terrible, and zombies dont react to certain spots when you shoot them; I had to shoot one five times in the head just to bring it down.

The performance on sitar, on the other hand, was glorious, engaging and inspiring.

There doesn't seem to be a sense of focus; rather, it is a mish-mosh of collected pieces. Also, you have no feelings for the characters, since you do not spend enough time to get to know them.Lately, Margaret Weis and Tracey Hickman have sunk to second-tier sci-fi writers.

The price couldnt be better in my opinion. Overall, for the amount of money that i spent on it, it was a deal but there are some problems. Personally i feel that the shutter lag time is too great. Regardless of shutter speed, there is about a half second delay between when the button is pressed and when the camera acutally takes the picture. Other than that it is a great camera with tons of features. I also would have liked the screen to be bigger but what can you do when it was made in 2002. I give it two thumbs up for its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, but interesting photography","review":"This is an incredibly boring film, with lots of meaningless talk and talk. However, there are nice outdoor shots of Frankfurt in 1948, with all the post-war rubble all around. There were other films with scenes of Germany during this post-war period. One that comes to mind is Billy Wilder's \\"A Foreign Affair\\"; which is more interesting than this bland film, even though it is not one of Wilder's best. Another great film of this type is \\"The Third Man\\", but that has scenes of Vienna, not Germany."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the album version","review":"Why did 666 make a new radio version, when the album version was sooo much better? The start of the song is hugely annoying with the do-do-do-paradox chant wearing a little to thin after a while, and all of the catchiness of the album version is gone as one of the best synth lines I've ever heard is not on the track.I guess they tried to make up for it with the inclusion of the CD ROM component, which did cheer me up a bit, but alas the mixes are all strikingly familiar to each other which only adds salt to the wound.

In a twist of fate, the future of Vietnam is handed to a Vietnamese princess and her French husband. Along with the seduction and intrigue contained in this novel is horrible tragedy, these elements put together create a novel that is hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly Hollywood","review":"This movie should have won an award for being the most anticeptic and historically false presentation of an historical figure in the history of Hollywood.

If this book were written today, it would never sell. The fact that it's old and now an esoteric topic makes people feel like they're a more astute reader for being able to talk about it. I wrote this kind of stuff when I was in 5th grade! The characters have very little depth, nothing is explained, and the view of character's nobility changes. In addition, this story was copied down by christian monks and therefore has a christian tilt to it, which further clouds the morals of the story. In summary, it's not good; it's just old.

So put on those rose-colored glasses and read about Jimmy in third-person. I don't like the posturing, this book reads like it was written to impress rather than give the reader a glimpse of who Jimmy is. Seems to me the author was too close to the president to offer an objective viewpoint. His early life is glossed over and it's just the 'character building' traits which are revealed. I thought Colin Powell's \\"My American Journey\\" and Anderson's \\"Che\\" did a much better job of revealing the person, and telling the story.An odd part of this book was the long family history in the beginning. Maybe this was one facet Jimmy inserted, but it just went off on a long tangent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive Book","review":"I'm a Republican who nevertheless admired Jimmy Carter greatly, and I am saddened by his recent petulant rants agains President George W.

He totally ignores the internal aspect of Hsing-I which is the essence of the art and presents Hsing-I like it was some bad form of Karate. I originally purchased this book from Paladin press for [price] and I have to say that it was a ripoff. Also, Ive noticed that in the book Whitewood's forward stance is way too far forward which would throw him off balance and negate any kind of power he could generate. Maybe thats his problem.

The idea this is being taught to people is frightening. He is practically leaning over his front foot and just looks awkward and hardly smooth enough to actually be useful. Even from a Wushu/Kungfu perspective, the form is terrible and the body mechanics are just dangerously ineffective if ever used.

He talks about his white up bringing as well as his induction into the black community by way of his black wife and compares the two cultures. He also talks about the challenges of raising bi-racial children. Of course he exaggerates a little here and there but that is how it is done to get the point across.I think the funniest part was his comparison of the white church service and the black Southern Baptist Church.

I never read a better biography! *tee-hee*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy, say it ain't so!","review":"I have loved Cagney for years, and would have prefered not to know all the bubble bursting details brought out in this story. His early years, telling of his family of origin and bowery boy childhood was fascinating. I should have stopped reading there. When he marries the strong willed Billie early on, he is not the powerhouse man of his movies. She becomes an obstacle between his family and their adoptive children. If this is not disappointing enough, you will also plow through excessive analysis of every character Cagney ever played. I've seen most of those movies, haven't you? Having to imply deeper content to pure entertainment is a bore. If you love the magic of Cagney's film charisma, skip this read. Your Jimmy will be gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"INVASION OF MR CAGNEYS PRIVACY","review":"I think that Mr. McCabe betrayed Mr. Cagneys trust by submitting personal and private matters that Mr. Cagney worked so hard to conceal. I respect James Cagney b/c he was a wonderful actor and I'm always entertained by his movies. I stopped reading this book b/c it was so personal. This book is perfect for all the psycho tabloid readers who are too wrapped up in other peoples lives than their own. If there is any respectable people left in this world...there are few...I would recommend the book that Cagney wrote himself, Cagney by Cagney.

I was looking for a bright handy flashlight that was rechargeable. No easy task.There are not many on the market to choose from.The \\"Built in AC Charger\\" is a plug that sticks out of one end of the unit. It took a few tries, but eventually I found an extension cord that fit on the unit so I could charge it.The unit is bulky, the on/off switch is not intuitive or sensible.I gave it 2 stars because, well, the light is nice...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rechargeable lantern","review":"I don't particularly care for the charging procedure. You have to plug an extension cord into the back of the lantern. Another feature I don't particularly like is the way you lock the light on -- so the beam shines the full time. It basically takes two hands to turn the lantern on and to keep it on-- one to hold the button the other to push the little button in the lock position.I think it will last a good while. It is heavy duty. The weight is pretty heavy too-- I wouldn't want to take it on a backpacking trip.All in all I think it was a descent purchase-- only time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replaced","review":"After about year I could only get about 40 minutes run time out of the flashlight. It died when I needed it most!I felt as though it was always switching to charge mode to bring the battery up to capacity.

But hey- if it works for you, great! It's amazing thought to read these other reviews. These people are saying I pack my baby in a cage because I can't be bothered by him!?! Are you kidding? The comments for other books (with different parenting styles) do not have the rude comments found here- calling parents cruel for the way they choose to raise their baby. To me it seems these readers who agree are basically name-calling, to make themselves feel better. They all say they had to be reassured by others that their idea of co-sleeping is ok. If you feel it's ok, it's ok. It's your own choice. So don't make other people feel bad for what they choose to do, even if it's not what you prefer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent teaching on how to enjoy your child.","review":"After applying the priciples in this book, nighttimes at our home with our 6-month-old are no longer angry and stressful.

This book is an excellent resource for parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"modern parents","review":"The book is full of good intensions, but is not based on the reality that mothers work and fathers have more active roles than they did in the 70s/80s.

I refused to give up, and finally realized that letting her sleep with me (no comforters, pillows far away, all other SIDS preventions, etc.) gave me the sleep I needed and the mother's milk she needed.This book gives the practical aspects of this and helps confirm that I wasn't crazy or worse, negligent, in making this choice. In fact, this is what ALL moms did until recent history. I thank God for the Sears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supports the CO not the SLEEP!","review":"I am so glad I read this book because it helps me feel OK about our family bed. HOWEVER I was hoping for some ways to get our baby to sleep better but solutions are sorely lacking. For those I found another Sear's recommendation: The No-Cry Sleep Solution, which supports cosleeping but also offers ways for everyone to get better sleep. If you want your family bed validated this is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supportive of one parenting style ONLY","review":"This book is focused on breast feeding and co-sleeping. It starts out by advising parents to experiment to find the sleeping arrangement that works best for their family - an idea I agree with. However, it becomes increasingly narrow-mided and judgmental and refers to putting a baby in a crib as putting a baby in a lonely cage in the dark. It also suggests that if you were a GOOD mother, you wouldn't mind staying up all night with your baby. As you will see from the positive reviews, if you are already committed to the parenting style recommended by the book, you will find it supportive,but if you have a different style, it will seem critical and judgmental. It has little value for non-breastfeeding or non-co-sleeping parents or dads. As a pediatrician and a mom, I would hesitate to recommend this book to anyone other than a strict breast-feeding and co-sleeping stay-at-home mom, but for that person it would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but redundant","review":"Good information, but much of the same info is provided verbatim in the Sears' Baby Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for breastfeeding Moms","review":"This is a good book, but is written mainly for breastfeeding Mom's. If you're not breastfeeding, there is still some good information, but you'll have to wade through each chapter. If you are breastfeeding and you are condsidering having your child sleep in your room or in your bed, this book is excellent. Dr. Sears is kind, condsiderate and humorous at times. If however, you would prefer that your child sleep in their own room, you will probably get more out of Dr. Ferber's book - Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems. I bought both to compare approachs. You might benefit from the same strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind but too unstructured","review":"I liked that Sears supports nurturing and loving the baby rather than letting him cry it out as many books advocate, but I found that we needed some more structure in order to get our baby to fall asleep on his own and take proper naps. I liked the Baby Whisperer book and Dr. Weissbluth's book. Though I don't follow either to the letter, they enabled me to come up with a plan that got our baby to sleep through the night (and take great naps) without resorting to letting the baby cry it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't breastfeed, you are doomed","review":"I read this book before it had the LLL tag added, I guess it is now obvious that this is for breastfeeding mothers. I bought and read this book when my first child was 4 weeks old and still feel guilty 3 years later. I fully intended to breastfeed my son but couldn't. If you are unable to (or choose not to) breastfeed, don't even touch this book. Sears made me feel like I would never ever be a good parent because I wasn't able to breastfeed my baby. I also don't see how his suggestions work if you have more than one child and need to get your sleep at night. I hope that others can be spared the pain of being chastised for not breastfeeding -- especially when not being able to breastfeed was painful enough on its own. Thank goodness they added the part about LLL so that people like me would know not to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice for parents looking to solve sleep problem","review":"My husband and I purchased this book in the hopes that it would give us ideas on how to get our daughter to go to sleep. After moving our 6 month old could not get settled in to a routine. Before we moved she slept in her own bed, so we were looking for alternative ways to get her to go to sleep again on her own. This book was a huge disappointment because it made me feel guilty for even trying to get her to sleep in her own bed. This is a very unrealistic approach to night time parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we need more guilt?","review":"Dr. Sears tells us society makes us feel guilty if we do co-sleep, but he just makes us feel guilty if we dont. Very little of the articles quoted are recent. He gives very few practical tips besides put the kids in bed with you. The entire book pretty much assumes that mom's do not work, and when they do they never work at night! Let's find a book that offers helpful advice, not just pat the back of those who have easy enough lives to rearrange our entire lives to the whims of our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was put off from the start","review":"I purchased this book and several others because I wanted to decide on parenting style: demand feeding vs. scheduling, sleeping habits, etc. This book didn't make any sense to me at all. I think its methods will produce needy, clingy, whiny, dependent children. I have asked mothers of more than one child and they all said that they tried the methods this book advocated for the first child, failed miserably, then succeeded with a more structured approach with baby number 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing and not helpful","review":"Dr. Sears seems to espouse one solution to nightime problems, which is sleep with your child and breastfeed them constantly. Nowhere does he deal with the attendant problems of the family bed. Once my child grew used to my physical presence to fall asleep she was unable to fall asleep without me! This has gone on for years, while my friends who sleep separately from their children are all able to put their child to sleep with a happy 15 to 30 minute nightly routine of stories and songs. I also spend 15 minutes on stories, but then the hard part begins. As I wait for my daughter to fall asleep (sometimes a one hour wait) I fall asleep myself! When I wake up there is lots to do and I am sluggish and groggy. If family bed proponents were honest they would discuss this problem, but it is never mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Advice for \\"Easy\\" Babies Only","review":"I own eight books by Sears and this is the only one I would not highly recommend. There isn't much in here that isn't in The Baby Book, though it goes into slightly greater detail in some areas. It is lacking in good techniques that work for babies age 9 months to 18 months unless they are very \\"easy\\" children. If you have an easy or average baby it is a quick read and might be worth the time if you know little or nothing about normal infant sleep. If you have a child with a challenging temperment don't even bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Sears does it again!","review":"Once again, Dr. Sears is supportive of children and their parents. Parenting does NOT end at bedtime, nor should it! Babies and toddlers sleep differently from adults and we should respect that. Dr. Sears explains to us, in simple terms, how to parent at night: with respect and love. It's as easy as that. Who needs to sleep-train their baby? That's cruel. Babies need to know that they are loved and cherished 24 hours a day. Thank you, Dr. Sears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"marvellous","review":"i think the world would change if more read this book. if you love your baby and read this... you will surely learn to let your love flow naturally and that everyone feels easyier, more fulfilled more loving, with this attempt. that you could be loving and a good person at nighttimes too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to attach, easy to use the Little Giant Leg Leveler","review":"Purchased the Little Giant Ladder at a retail yard and found out pretty quickly with our yard (slopes considerably) that we needed two other attachments a leg extender or leveler, and a bracket to better distribute the weight.

I received a new unit with no problem from Radio Shack. The current unit was awesome until just after the warranty expired. Apparently the power input jack is not very durable and now makes poor contact. When I hit a bump or touch the unit it turns off and back on. I didn't buy the life time subscription plan for the simple fact that I didn't know how long the unit would last. Now I'm really glad I didn't. I would have had to buy a new unit and then pay Sirius $75 in order to keep the life time plan going. It's just a big crap shoot as to how long a unit will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this radio","review":"Do not buy this receiver. This model was redesigned to meet more restricted FCC radio emissions requirements. As a result the FM transmitter is underpowered. Unfortunately, I bought one of these. The transmitter is so weak that it cannot overpower local signal noise even when the receiver is only 1 foot away from the stereo antenna. I tried to exchange it through Sirius' warranty department, but getting through to them was difficult. Between the customer service department and the warranty department, Sirius gave me the run around so long that I can't even return this defective receiver for a refund. To add insult to injury, Sirius will not give me a refund for the defective receiver either. I ended up cancelling my Sirius subscription because I can't listen to the service with this defective radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2 months!

I was able to install it easily in my car using the car kit - so far so good - 2 stars for ease of installation using the car kit.After about a month I noticed the reception was not so great even when connected to the home-kit with the antenna in a good spot. I knew it was a problem with this radio because we had no problems and good reception with our other Sirius radio. Over the next week or two the reception got worse. Now the radio does not work at all.The worst part is customer service. I have spent a total of 3 hours on hold and talked to one sales rep. Once I got a service rep he gave me a bogus excuse about phone reception and hung up. I have not made any progress so far with hours logged on hold. Now that I reseach it, I see that many other people have the same problem!ST2 seems to be a model with reliability problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"FM Transmiter Sucks","review":"I love Sirius, and I have 2 units.

The thing worked fantastic for 4 months and then quit, displaying the \\" Acquiring Signal\\" message ad infinitum. I called Sirius to get an RMA, sent it back and we are still waiting for the replacement after 2 weeks. I really think the radio sucummed to the heat these things generate which is an inherent design flaw so I have no confidence in the replacement lasting more than a few months. There is no reason for these radios( all makes and models generate excessive heat ) to get as hot as they do. Also, if you are expecting high fidelity audio out of satelite radio be it Sirius or XM you will be disappointed. Well heck, they need to plow some of their revenues into improving the technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Starmates Produced After September 2006","review":"If you have a factory original car stereo without a casette deck it will be a lot of work to use the new Starmates. The built-in FM wireless transmitter that allows the Starmate to broadcast on an unused radio frequency is far too weak for use in the car - the static on the unused channel will be intermixed with the Sirius programming. Instead, you must connect a cable to the Starmate's headphone jack and splice it with the car stereo's antenna or auxiliary input.In June 2006 the FCC determined that the original Starmate generated far too powerful a signal and ordered it toned down. As a Sirius customer since January 2006, I've owned both versions of the Starmate, and the old version is deserving of the rave reviews it has received - I never once experienced any problems with static.

However, I don't like too many equations with only few explanations.

The quality of this film is so much lower than your average direct-to-video flick. One moment had me laughing though, but make no mistake this was unintentional. Steer clear at all costs, save yourself the money and watch a superior film like Weekend at Bernie's II or Cobra."},{"rating":"1","title":"4th Try","review":"This is the 4th time I've tried to read this book and still can't get through it. I first tried in the late 60s and have tried three times since. Got the Kindle addition and got further than I ever had before, but still didn't get through more than 1/3 of the book.I love fantasy and sci fi, but this is too dense for me. While the language is beautiful, the writing is ponderous and the plot incredibly slow moving.I'll just have to go through life never having read this book in its entirety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I've ever tried to read","review":"I just thought I had better post this to provide some balance to most of the other reviews. I found the writing style very tiring, the story was not engaging, and the setting was completely unbelievable. In short, I didn't think there was one good thing about the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old muckhills will bloom at last.","review":"I first read this book about twenty years ago for a class called \\"Philosophy of Fantasy and Science Fiction.\\" I talked with the professor a few years later and he said that he'd dropped the book because a lot of the students complained that the language was too difficult. If you're looking for a quick and easy read, look elsewhere.That said, \\"The Worm Oroborous\\" is heroic fantasy at its best, and it's told in language befitting the subject matter. The heros are truly heroic, and the villains are truly villainous, but worthy adversaries. And it does as good a job as I've seen of presenting the classical warrior ethic. It's a somewhat difficult book, but well worth the effort.On the down side, the names of the characters and the places tend to be silly and to detract from the overall presentation. It also probably wouldn't be a bad idea to start at chapter 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it","review":"I was interested because the book got some praise for its use of language, and I like anything with inventive, well-crafted prose. The beginning was interesting, but eventually I realized that the plot device used to introduce the story was not going to come back. All that was left was a seemingly endless tale of derring-do in a late-middle-english-sounding style that was confusing and not very compelling in and of itself. Maybe there are some people in the world who would like this book, but I couldn't stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"First off the Forgotten Books edition has many errors throughout the book. Editors need to actually read the book instead of just running it through a spell checker that does not check punctuation or style.Second it is a struggle to read. I have tried to read this book off and on over a 40 year period. It just does not get any easier each time. Heaps of praise on those that can stomach it."},{"rating":"1","title":"EC does Robert Johnson WRONG!","review":"I have been a long time fan of EC since the Yardbirds, and have enjoyed many of his contributions to rock, especially those made with Cream, Blind Faith, and Derek & the Dominoes.However, although I realize he is regarded as an elder statesman of the electric guitar, there are FAR better examples of blues guitarists worthy of carrying Robert Johnson's torch - John Hammond, Jr. for example, who has been doing it for years! Clapton's recent output (other than a few blues \\"tributes\\") is pretty much the same recycled commercial stuff he started with \\"461 Ocean Boulevard\\" (one of his faves, tellingly enough). To my ears, most of \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" is a cluttered mess - the stark, haunting beauty of the originals is gone, replaced by cacophonous, competing riffery.I think Clapton needs to get together with a few REAL young blues musicians out there so they can teach the ol' dog some new licks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE HELLHOUND MR. c?","review":"BLUES? Clapton never had 'em, and I suppose he never will!1 star for those who settle for \\"nice, easy listening\\".A sad corruption of the Johnson catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"With No Soul, He Got No Blues","review":"Eric Clapton's fascination with the blues is legendary and way past wearing thin. He may be a world's most informed blues scholar, but that's never translated into any semblance of actually being able to play the blues. While Clapton can play a Robert Johnson tune note for note, he will never be able to invest anything personal into this music. It's a little cliche, but he's got no soul. And isn't that the one ingredient essential to blues and soul music?I've never really understood Clapton's gigantic reputation. His guitar playing is mechanical, lacking any swagger or excitement. His singing is serviceable at best. In time, history is likely to revise Clapton's importance, with records like this offering ample proof of a hollow effigy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly you, and a little of Mr. Johnson","review":"My disdain starts with the cover photo. Give it a look. If you're a Robert Johnson fan, you'll see what I mean. This is more commercialized schlock from Eric Clapton. Another in a long line of attempts at currying favor with blues listeners. It's obvious that Eric has something else on his mind. I think it's time he got down to whatever it is, rather than take the easy way out in order to pump out another album. In short, this album has very little of Robert Johnson, and a whole lot of 'formula' music, designed to keep the public appeased. I see absolutely no reason to have released this album when Robert Johnson's collected works can be heard as they were intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will send your feets a tappin . . .","review":"I love this Cd. I am also an avid fan of Mr. Johnson and have studied his music extensivly, and I have always wondered what he would sound like with a full band.

I highly recommend this to any blues fan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"What could have been an awesome CD is pretty lame. As several reviewers have stated, the cover art and even the title of the disc, implies that this was a disc with just EC and his guitar playing Robert Johnson tunes.

What happened to EC?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"I have to thank Eric for such a wonderful record. To revisit Johnson's mythical work must be not an easy task .

This is somehow more eggregious, as it is a direct lift from perhaps the greatest blues player of all time. Clapton has no shame. The singing is horrid. If there is anything that the blues community agrees on is that Robert Johnson was the seminal figure in Mississippi Delta blues. Sure Clapton has the chops on the axe. But is nowhere near Buddy Guy, Albert King, B. B. King, Freddie King, Jimmy Reed and great Muddy Waters. NO. Not even close. Don't buy this !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection gives me the blues","review":"How ironic!!! Clapton doesn't mind copying Robert Johnson but he copy protects the CD.

The original is much better than this anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful, sad and a total waste of money","review":"eric clapton has no balls and he proves it on this sad attempt at ripping off robert johnsonanyone who thinks this remotely resembles the blues is either a fool or plain dumbthe only thing that this would be useful for would be the cd booklet in case you ran out of toilet paper, if that"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"Some reviewers have called this CD \\"blues-zak,\\" and I completely agree! The rhythym is unvaried and annoying, and Clapton is just trying too hard! He's thinking about it too much--not \\"feeling it.\\" He did some great stuff with Cream, and he's obviously a great guitarist. But this album is way over-produced and IS NOT THE BLUES, outside of 12-bar structure, etc. Robert Johnson is great, of course, but he is not the only great blues guy. I would advise to check out some other old blues, like Skip James. If you are more of a rock person and have to get your Clapton fill, stick with Cream. Therefore, this album is totally pointless--unless you own every blues CD ever made. And then it's just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"An effort to boost his retirement fund...","review":"If you want to help Mr. Clapton's \\"Golden Years\\", buy this emasculated crap... otherwise buy for half the price the original Robert Johnson recordings!Instead of signing a deal with the Devil (as Johnson reportedly did), Mr. Clapton signed a deal with his record company (maybe it's always the Devil, but the corporate Devil - of the 21st Century...).Do yourself a favor... waste your money for something else... more exciting!Robert Johnson, Tommy Johnson, Son House, Blind Blake, Charlie Patton, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Muddy Waters... those were the \\"real thing\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love both Clapton and Johnson, but ...","review":"This album is very disappointing. Clapton could have done Johnson pure. Robert Johnson himself was one man with a guitar; I'd hoped for that with this album, Clapton channelling Johnson, if you will. What we get instead is a very muddily produced ensemble, little of the Clapton magic, and the worst version of Come On In My Kitchen I've heard in a long while. I hate that I don't like this: it combines Clapton with Johnson, two of the best blues artists of all time. But, frankly, it's mostly bad. I gave it 2* just because it's Clapton playing the blues, and how bad can that be? But get Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings if you want to hear this as it should be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus Eric, focus","review":"Clapton is one of the most erratic rock/blues stars ever. He could make a masterpiece and then release the worst flop. He could play the guitar like a god, and then sound like his own bad imitator. Clapton credentials as a bluesman cannot be argued: he has been hailed as a master by every blues icon that ever listened to him: From Muddy and Wolf, to Hendrix and SRV. I think what Eric needed here was a good producer, a guy that would be able to stand up to him and say 'excuse me, Mr Clapton, lets try again, and now do it like you mean it'. And for the other musicians, they sound bored as hell. Eric usually plays better when he is challenged, and this band has been playing with him for so long that he is as excited as having lunch with his grandmother. This is such a missed opportunity. Robert Johnson deserves better. Check out the recent tributes by Peter Green and see the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Love Robert Johnson.Listened to this album every day for almost a week.Tried to like it.Can't do it...it's just too flat and bland, no grit, no feeling.Clapton himself has done better Robert Johnson-covers than these lifeless songs. And Peter Green's two RJ-albums blow this one out of the water and into the stratosphere.What's the opposite of memorable? Oh, right. Forgettable. This album is thoroughly forgettable. Take your man Ron's word for it and pick up some REAL RJ instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Clapton superfans and completists only","review":"If you want to hear Robert Johnson songs, get Robert Johnson.While there are some good versions of his songs by other people, a whole album of them by anyone else is boring and pedantic. This effort is not horrible, but it isn't particularly compelling for a lot of reasons. Eric Clapton's only claim to greatness is as a blues guitarist, and the guitar work here is good but not great.The vast majority of the people who buy this, at least in the US, are going to be people that not only do not own the originals, but may have never heard them. It's a ridiculous situation. Don't be ridiculous-get the real thing first. If you don't love them, you'd be utterly wasting your money on this anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely mediocre","review":"This is the most disappointing Clapton album I've ever purchased. I agree with the reviewer who noted the lack of energy and enthusiasm in these recordings. There's just no fire, no spark of passion, no synergy among the band members. It's like they're playing the part of revivalist blues musicians in a B movie, making a handwaving attempt to play the songs in some \\"authentic\\" way but never quite pulling it off. This is especially disappointing, given that Clapton has recorded numerous Robert Johnson songs over the years that do have the kind of energy and creativity I was hoping (in vain) to find here. I bought this CD the first week it came out, listened to parts of it three or four times, then put it back in the case, where it will probably stay. If you want to hear really outstanding but not derivative versions of Johnson's songs, order the two Peter Green CDs, which are much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.","review":"Clapton's recipe for disaster:- Take some of the most haunting, soulful, expressive songs ever written.- Remove any element of blues, emotion, expression or intelligence.- Add an unnecessary number of musicians, and instruct them to play in the style of airport muzac.- Repeat. Fourteen times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slick = Boring","review":"First off, I liked EC's \\"From The Cradle\\" cd and would rate that one 4 stars, on the other hand I was debating between 1 or 2 stars for this one, and decided on 2 because it's not terrible. The problem I have with this one is it just sounds way too slick and the songs seem to have no passion in them at all, to me it just sounds like a waste of time. I had to force my self to listen to it several times hoping I was missing something and it would grow on me, but that didn't happen. If your'e gonna do Robert Johnson stuff at least sing it/play it like you mean it. This cd reminds me of the \\"paint by numbers\\" art I did as a kid. A VERY disappointing effort by someone that should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton isn't God--he's Jesus to Johnson! What's wrong with these people??","review":"I have a lingering suspicion that many of the 'reviewers' don't have the life experiences to back up their vapid opinions. As a middle-aged man with divorce, AA and countless personaal demons in MY past, this album spoke to me like nothing E.C. has done since Behind The Sun, a record some of you kids could use a dose of. I have waited since the Bluesbreakers for a full-length treatment of Johnson by Clapton, and I was nothing less than exhilarated by this all-too-brief disc. Like those old Johnson discs, these tunes are not intended as easy listening!! These guys, who are ten times the men you're likely to be...are singing to themselves, and to GOD! So bend an ear and listen to their version of the really solid spiritual excursion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"How dare Eric Clapton! What is up with Clapton appearing on the same cd cover with Robert Johnson? it is completelly absurd. What is the point? A rich Englishman with absolutely no life experience beyond garden parties, drinking tea and eating crumpets, pretending to have some kind of connection to Robert Johnson..........I say again.........Absurd! What is the point? Eric Clapton has got to be the most over rated musician of all time.p.s. Why is Eric Clapton so big on the cover and Robert Johnson so Small?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I grew up a huge EC. fan but over the last few years I cant evenlisten to his newer stuff. The old fire is gone! I was hoping with another blues recording it might stir up some of the old flame.Well Im sorry to say it didnt. These old Robert Johnson songs all sound very much alike and are very boring with the main focus on EC's voice and very little good guitar to speak of.The passion of EC has changed, no more Eric Clapton is God.Good night now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I like the blues. I like Robert Johnson. I like Eric Clapton. If you share these likes, don't buy this CD. It is spiritless. Get Clapton's \\"Unplugged\\" if you like acoustic blues. Get him teamed up B.B. King on \\"Riding with the King\\" if you like your blues electric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Fresh about this!","review":"Eric should have listened to Peter Green's \\"Hotfoot Powder\\" and \\"Robert Johnsons Songbook\\". Peter sheds a fresh light on well known, often covered and certainly revered material. Eric sounds uninspired. I wish he could have just been happy that someone in the blues community had honored Mr. Johnson and put new life in his wonderful songs without thinking it had to be himself. Eric certainly has a marvelous catalog to his credit, this isn't among the marvelous."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make the blues sound - mauve.","review":"An interesting experiment that did not work. The album is spoiled mostly by the overslick production and the plodding, boring musicianship and arrangements. The end result is bland muzak versions of some of the most powerful songs ever written. If this had not been a famous artist, it would never have been released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight Clapton not finding the roots","review":"Anyone that records Robert Johnson is setting themselves a task - there's a certain feel to his music that cannot be mucked around with. Here Clapton mostly loses the plot. The cover seems to indicate the album might be another unplugged set which could have been wonderful, but the big bass and drum sound behind a heavily distorted guitar on many tracks just doesn't get to the soul of the music. A couple of songs like Me and the Devil Blues and Last Fair Deal Gone Down come off OK, but all in all this pales alongside the two Johnson albums made by his old associate Peter Green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty weak effort","review":"Don't expect to hear amazing blues guitar, or much guitar playing of any sort, on this misleadingly titled CD. A more descriptive title would have been \\"Clapton sings Johnson\\". What little guitar playing there is, is obscured by the piano & rest of the band. I was pretty disappointed. Seems like Clapton has regressed back to the 70s when he rarely played on his albums. Maybe his legend has surpassed his ability & he's afraid to let us find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the song writing of Robert Johnson.","review":"This entire album sounds flat and uninspired. The guitar playing is just okay. The rhythms Clapton chooses for many of these Johnson gems seems off and further detracts from their impact on the listener. Some cuts seem to drag and sound somber, others are played too fast when they should be done slower, with more feeling.If you want to hear some terrific covers of Robert Johnson songs try Peter Green's; Hot Foot Powder (his Robert Johnson Songbook is also pretty good). Or you can always go straight to the master himself with The Complete Works of Robert Johnson.This CD does nothing to change my opinion that Clapton's best blues playing is past. Clapton sites Johnson as his main inspiration, but here he doesn't do justice to Johnson's songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE HIM STOP!!!","review":"Hasn't the guy made enough money hamming up the blues for some time now? This takes the cake and is about as silly as Bush dressing up like a cowboy on his Texas ranch...actually this is worse. He should be smacked across the face for this stupid suit. If he's going to keep reliving the past why can't he just relive his own past and go back to Cream. That was the only time he did anything worth a crap-the new dvd is about as painful as this so I guess he should just stop recording period.This guy ONLY cares about a paycheck, or his manager is just shoving him into these stupid recording sessions. Either way it's still his fault for doing this cheesy blues-zak.This album should make the whitest man sick to his stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Delta Blues","review":"Only Eric Clapton would feel comfortable enough to return to his inspiration and explore his \\"blues roots.\\" Don't listen to any negative reviews. Those fans just want to hear their \\"guitar god \\" scatter notes like confetti at a wedding. Yet Clapton is so much more. He perhaps the most versitile artist of our day. Though I loved \\"From the Cradle,\\" this is an entirely different body of work. Eric Clapton is happiest when playing the blues. Is it any wonder that he would return to the Delta and do just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD RECORD","review":"When I heard this I couldn't believe my ears : YIKES!!!!This is really BAD BAD music, very BAD and UNINSPIRED.It is just a bunch of UGLY DUMB sounds and the guitarrists can't even play and the drummer sounds like Terry from my class who had ADHD and the girl who sings sounds like she has to go potty all the time.I like music but this is oreful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER BLUES COVER CD - WHAT A SURPRISE!!!!","review":"Another shallow attempt to cash in on his history ( about 35 years ago now since he produced something worthwhile ) WHO BUYS THIS CRAP????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton is a great player but something is missing","review":"Listening to this reminds of the part in the movie Ghost World where a woman is talking to the blues collector and says \\"If you want to hear real blues you have to hear 'Blues Hammer'\\" and this cheesy electric guitar playing white boy comes out singing about picking cotton. EC is not that bad but there is no way for ANYONE to tackle the original material of Robert Johnson. But don't take my word for it, just listen to the complete recordings of Johnson and then this back to back. I give EC credit for possibly getting more people interested in Johnson's work though."},{"rating":"1","title":"not clapton","review":"this is not the eric clapton i know. when he does blues that is clapton. i wish he would do another blues like \\"from the cradle.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"You must see the live versions to fully appreciate","review":"I do agree with most reviewers below re: the studio versions (the versions on this CD) being lifeless and lacking the intensity that Robert Johnson's songs require. However, you must hear the EC 2004 tour live versions of Me And The Devil, They're Red Hot, Milkcow Calf Blues, If I Had Possession Over Judgment Day, and Kind Hearted Woman Blues. Clapton coverning the blues needs to be heard live - most of Eric's classic performances of the great blues songs are best heard live. (exception: Derek and the Dominos studio versions of Key To the Highway and Have You Ever Loved a Woman).I give this CD 2 stars due to the lame production. However, it was a great concept. They just needed to perform these 14 songs in front of a live audience and recorded the result!!Go see Eric if he is plays your hometown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Tepid, Yet Bland","review":"Eric Clapton has been introducing the \\"Blues\\" to new audiences for almost his entire life. Early in his career, he could take an obsure blues song like \\"Crossroads\\" and make it into a rock hit. A number of Robert Johnson's songs were recorded in the corner of a hotel room on ancient equipment. These harsh sounding, yet powerful performances can send chills up your spine. Sadly, \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" is just plain boring to listen to. The song arrangements stay mostly faithful to the original recordings, but there are too many instruments on them. The band contains some fine musicians, but they sound so polished and lifeless. Clapton's playing is competent as usual, but it lacks the enthusiam that used to set him apart from all his peers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to admit it","review":"Hate to admit it but this just isn't very good. Been a fan since 'Slowhand' so i've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by Clapton, but this is just amazing. This has everything going for it but it just doesn't come together. The featured review by 'Woomer' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'From the Cradle' has been worthwhile barring 'Riding with the King' and that was helped immensely by King himself.Toss this onto the heap along with 'Reptile' and 'Pilgrim'."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK - and very repetitious","review":"I admit that I'm an Eric Clapton fan from forty-some-odd years back, before Cream. But I'm disappointed. This is an OK album, worth about 2-1/2 stars.The biggest problem is that this album is that it doesn't offer much variety. I go way back on the blues, but it the songs on this album all start sounding the same to me.And isn't this deja vu all over again?

The station was playing a cut from the CD when my eight-year-old son asked what it was. I explained to him that it was an old blues number that was a sort of precursor to much of the music we listen to now. He inquired how old the song was and I replied it was almost fifty years old. My son then asked: \\"If it's so old why are they playing it?\\"I'm afraid that is how most people will react to some degree to this album. \\"It's all nice and all that Clapton loves this music; but why inflict it on us?\\" This will come from those who think Clapton matters. I sense among the younger artists Clapton ceased to matter years ago.This all too bad. This is an excellent CD and bears repeated spins in the old CD player. Unfortunately, much like In The Cradle, it will be more honored than listened to"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Knowing how Eric has been a long-term Robert Johnson disciple, I was expecting this to be one of the crown jewels of his recording career. I was let down, which is not to say that it's at all a BAD CD, just that it's not very bluesy and hardly delta at all. It's more like party music. I was hoping for voice and acoustic guitar, but this reminds me of a 40's or 50's era juke joint R&B; band. Piano, drums, harmonica, bass, electric guitar. The playing is excellent, the singing is fine, but the songs were given sort of a modern pop gloss. What happened to the haunting edge and desperation that made these songs famous in the first place? Where is the gut-wrenching pain?I've given this 4 stars and had to stretch a ways to get there. It's really closer to 3 in my mind right now, but I'm hoping it makes it to 4 after I get conditioned by repeated listenings. so far, it sounds like EC's hellhound is named \\"Muffy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I'm a big fan of EC and RJ but I wish this would have been more of an acoustic album and some of the song choices were ones that could have been better.Macwoodusa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton plays the blues","review":"This cd is very well done, the songs are great to listen to, the music is well played and I have it in my car player, listen to it often"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Money","review":"Mr. Clapton or who should be refered to as Mr. CRAPton, after listing to this CD should personaly refund everyone's money.

Where is the hot-riffed kid I saw on stage at the Filmore East when I was far too young to get in who blew me away with riffs that - to this day - no one has been able to match? The solos in Crossroads are some of the very best in rock history. So I go back to my original question. Who is Clapton? A guy who died 30 years ago with the old gang, including Winwood, Bruce, Baker, Mayal and the rest of the late 60's greats? Where did that unbelievably inspired young guitarist who set the world on fire go? To this day, I have never quite understood his path, with the the exception that heroine was kicked...along with the riffs. This tribute album is yet another in a series of attempts to recapture the essence of a past that continues to eluded him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't see how this is called the blues...","review":"I agree with many fellow reviewers that say that this is one of EC's better releases in a while, but let's not confuse this with real blues. This CD lacks soul and depth. It is worth casual listening, but after the fourth or fifth playing it feels stale and mediocre. After listening to John Lee Hooker, Son House & Elmore James continuously for the past month, you'll find this recording as bland as I did. I just didn't feel the music. If Buddy Guy is your flavor, this might work. Otherwise, stay away and spend your money on any John Lee Hooker.

Clapton's approach to the material is reverent; perhaps too reverent to be enjoyable. If you're familiar with Robert Johnson, you know that the blues isn't all about being miserable and sad. Often, it's about having fun (perhaps in spite of being miserable and sad). These are all competent covers, but there's no sense of exuberance or excitement.Comparing these versions to Johnson's originals is beside the point. However, it's only fair to compare Clapton's contemporary interpretations with those of the Peter Green/Nigel Watson Splinter Group, whose superb, award-winning \\"Robert Johnson Songbook\\" is warm, seductive, delightful, smooth, and yes, exuberant in places.True-blue Clapton fans will want to pick this one up, but most listeners will have more fun with the Splinter Group disc. (Also highly recommended: \\"Hot Foot Powder\\", Splinter Group's equally fine second collection of Robert Johnson songs.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets one star, because I can't give it a black hole","review":"I can't believe that this jerk sells his crap.

I think not, Eric.You know, when you see this CD on the shelf and are a fan of \\"EC\\" then you pick it up. I looked this CD over several times and sure enough, it looks like Clapton finally sat down solo with his guitar and slide - and played the Robert Johnson classics! I couldn't wait to get home.Alas, after opening the CD packaging I find a paper listing the piano players, bass players, drummer and two other guitarists.To put it simply, this is really weak - don't even fool with a $5 used one.Eric, if you plan to record the remainder of the Johnson songs then please, sit down by yourself with guitar, slide and microphone and give it your best shot. Forget the band.This isn't even a good blues cd. Weak, weak, weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Johnson's band","review":"Robert Johnson never had a band. It was just him and his guitar. I think that is one thing that stands out the most about Robert Johnson. If Clapton wanted to do a great Johnson album it would have been just him and his guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Make Money","review":"Now don't get me wrong, I love Robert Johnson Covers, but to devote a whole album to it is just insane. There is barley even any artistic expresion on this album, its just trying to make Robert Johnson sound modern, but there is only one Robert Johnson. Now when Clapton did Crossroads, it was cool because it actually sounded like he put some work into that Johnson song, but the songs on this album is just what Johnson did with a Chicago/British blues feel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Eric Clapton....","review":"I returned this immediately. Its a shame. Its like taking the luminiscent Robert Johnson and adding muzak. If you like white bread- all of the basic elements of blues (pain, suffering, poverty, joy...) bleached out, this is the record for you. For all of you folks that limit children from harmful records, this is the record to buy. For all others, please steer clear of this clamity and buy Robert Johnson or other blues masters if you want to explore blues.JLPierce"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where god came from...","review":"In the beginning, there was Robert Johnson. And he was great. He wrote some of the tastiest blues songs ever put down on tape.In the sixties, Eric Clapton rose to guitar divinity with John Mayall and a band named 'Cream. He became one of the most respected in a long line of guitar hero's.Me and Mr. Johnson is Clapton's homage to his mentor. It is a reworking of the primitive original delta sound of Robert Johnson into the smoother interpretations of ERic Clapton. But the result is, in my opinion, the best Eric Clapton album since From The Cradle.This album will grow on you. Listen to it at least five times before you make up your mind.It is, in its own way, a masterpiece. Traveling Riverside Blues and Milkcow Blues are especially delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapton : looter of tomb","review":"Really Clapton need an other life to understand the blues (he had the money in that one).

I looked forward to the release of this cd, especially after what I felt was the fine job Clapton did on \\"From the Cradle\\".But the true charm of Johnson's 28 recordings was not that they were original, which they weren't, but that it was the work of one man and one guitar. And I doubt that Clapton lost sight of that, he was just intimidated by it, and I think he was wrong. A fresh interpretation would not have been as bad as this cd is.To get a better idea of Johnson's influence on Blues music, read Elijah Wald's 'Escaping the Delta:Robert Johnson and the Invention of The Blues' it gives you a good perspective on the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced, under delivered","review":"This is really about Eric cashing in. The CD is delivered in a cheesy paper cover rather than plastic jewel box. The recording quality is sub-standard. The songs are slick and polished, and don't sound very genuine. I am a Clapton fan, but the standard he set with \\"Unplugged\\" was not met with this release. In fact, it speaks to why the mass music business is in trouble. It is overpriced and sub-par effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"too polished&too Predictable","review":"Eric clapton long ago cemented Himself as one of the Best Guitarist Ever especially back in the 60's,but after a while he found a way to play it safe&He does it here again as He has been doing for many years now.Robert Johnson was Raw&wicked.Eric Clapton has displayed some of that Element Before but it's been so long that after a while He is basically a Vegas Lounge Act with Talent but who hasn't mattered in so long.this Album will keep him safe&in place to where he is but He didn't bring any Light to the Rawness that was Robert Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as much fun as the bubonic plague","review":"Eric, Eric, Eric - what WERE you thinking? This album is like paying to be in a plane crash; Thomas Eddison is no doubt turning in his grave!!! The albums one and only saving grace is that those who have heard it, through bitter personal experience can honestly claim to know what the blues is all about - unlike Mr Clapton, who evidently HAS no soul, and is therefore completely unable to produce passionate music. I've experienced greater levels of emotional resonance in the lift going up to the car park!Somewhere up in heaven, Son House, Henry Thomas, Charley Patton, Fred Mcdowell, Blind Lemon and Leadbelly etc are no doubt already sharpening their knives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed...","review":"I like both EC and Robert Johnson, but this collection just does not work. Many years ago EC did a great job interpreting Crossroads in a modern rock/blues cover, but these new arrangements are light-hearted versions of some very heavy, soulful songs. I'm sure Mr. Clapton could have done a better job. Save your money and get the original recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Tripe","review":"Bland soulless crap. A technically fabulous guitarist but boring as all get out when it comes to this album. There is no reason to buy this when you can buy the real thing for less. Perhaps if Mr. Clapton would try to do something original with the material it would be better. If you have to own a Clapton blues record, buy \\"From The Cradle\\". It's much better than this. For the record....Eric Clapton is not a blues guitarist. He's a rock guitarist who plays with a bluesy style. This isn't the blues.

The beat is so fresh and so clean, and it shows how talented Timbaland is as a producer.The rest of the cd shines by letting Bubba Sparxxx rip up the tracks laid down for him. Get over the skin color: This man can rap. His country influenced lyrics and southern sounding beats are a perfect fit for his personality. My personal favorite song is \\"Bubba Talk.\\" The banjo-like sounding beat is so original and tight sounding you can't help but like it.Only a few songs are lackluster, like the soon-to-be-next-single \\"Lovely.\\" I wish they would not put this out as the next single. \\"Betty, Betty\\" is a perfect single type of song.

At best, his rhyming is merely adequate, nothing to get excited about.Very few rhymers in the history of rap (dating back to the late 1970s and up through the present) can grab you with a few words and their vocal tone. Bubba Sparxxx. He just doesn't compare to even the best rhymers of today, nevermind the best lyricists of the past 20-plus years.But perhaps like Eminem, fans are going to buy into his album as they usually do when a novelty rapper who at least shows an average level of skills surfaces.But for a better overall album with sound production (and a variety of styles) and stronger lyrical delivery, check out Petey Pablo's \\"Diary of a Sinner: 1st Entry.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the hook","review":"Bubba Sparxxx how can i say hmmmm a great change from your basic white rapper.

He gets into the race thing but he's not as obsessed as Eminem. Its mostly about chicks and Bubba, he was killin me with the punchlines.

I have watched this movie 100's of time from a ripped dvd. Now I purchased the Blu-Ray and I promise you my son and I will watch it at least another 100 times or more. It is hard to explain. It will make you laugh, cry, get angry, you name it. This is directing at it's absolute best, a phenomenal achievement in film. It has Santa Clause with an Assault Rifle.

The ***** hit me with a toaster......:) YOUL GET IT, YOUL LOVE IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern Christmas classic","review":"The perfect antidote to treacly festive moviemaking, this is a triumph of Bill Murray's sardonic wit. Richard Donner conjures up a wonderfully chilly eighties New York, where a modern day Scrooge's demeanour is the only thing frostier than the weather. All of the jokes are beautifully judged, especially when told at the expense of the ratings-chasing TV industry, and the whole production has its tongue firmly lodged in its cheek. Everything about this movie works, from the radiant Karen Allen to the slow-motion meltdown of Bobcat Goldthwait's unfortunate programming exec. And even if you find that Murray's one-liners aren't your thing, the line-up of his network's surreal production of A Christmas Carol is bound to raise a smile. Scrooged may not be quite the story that Dickens had in mind all those years ago, but it's certainly a bold retelling of the old tale that you won't forget in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the time","review":"hey if you are looking for an usual take on a classic this is worth a viewing. sit back and enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas comedy","review":"I nice past time I've had since I was a kid.

What was funny about it? Oh and what about the whole disgustingly rushed Ghost of Xmas Past scenes, I know 14 year olds who can do a better job at creating that Ghost and how unoriginal, I mean really. So far so original, but, those scenes, just deplorable. Ahhh with more Bill Murray's over acting in nearly everything he does, or the fact that the only really PURE Gem, was Carol Kane playing the fairy as Ghost of Christmas Present, she was just stellar. But sadly, nearly everyone's career in this movie went nowhere and for a reason, and if you think Karen Allen doing Indy stuff was stellar, well, I will give you that...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy movie with crude humor and just simply disgusting!

Could he have read the script before agreeing to be in this? It was horrible. It literally makes me feel sad that anyone could have found humor in this....mess, this disastrous mess of a movie. And yet it had so many good reviews on Amazon. Seriously people? I would give it a more thorough analysis, but it pains me to ponder it. There was little to redeem it. OK maybe the first ghost, the Christmas-Past ghost was interesting. Mostly though, it was utterly poorly done and the exact opposite of funny. If you want to see Bill Murray at his best, watch Groundhog Day or Caddyshack or Stripes. Avoid this one. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Good","review":"I haven't watched this film in awhile but after watching it again it really isn't too good. I might have given it a two and a half rating but certainly no more than that. Technically it is a professionally filmed movie but that is not where the problems lie.I almost can't believe that there is a bad Richard Donner film out there because so many of his films are of a very high quality. Such as,Ladyhawke,Conspiracy Theory (Keepcase)andLethal Weapon: The Complete Series. But this one is lacking on story and execution. The characters are a mixed bag. I couldn't stand the ghosts or spirits and how they were carried out.Much of the comedy seems forced and Bill Murray, whom I enjoy very much in movies likeQuick Changeand the modern classicThe Man Who Knew Too Little, was at times, too over the top and his performance was uneven. There are some funny moments, but not enough and with all the flaws and uneveness I can only rate this 2 STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrooged","review":"We love this movie.

Granted, you shouldn't closely compare it to the original Dickens, but if you just look at it on its own, as a comedy loosely based on the classic, you will split your sides at times. Bill Murray is wonderful, Carol Kane, an absolute gem, Alfre Woodard, perfect as the Cratchit take off, and all the rest are terrific, as well. This truly is a must in your holiday movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did they take out this scene?

A very humorous twist to the classic Dickens tale, Bill Murray offers his talents to make this version come alive. With a star studded supporting cast of comic and veterans actors, SCROOGED will be a family favorite for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Movie","review":"Scrooged is a 1988 American comedy film, a modernization of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The film was produced and directed by Richard Donner, and the cinematography was by Michael Chapman. The screenplay was written by Mitch Glazer and Michael O'Donoghue. The original music score was composed by Danny Elfman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern-day Christmas Carol","review":"Imagine Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol set in the modern world. That's what director Richard Donner and writers Mitch Glazer & Michael O'Donoghue have brought us. Instead of 19th-Century Britain, it's now 20th-Century New York City. Instead of Ebenezer Scrooge, we get Bill Murray as Frank Cross. Instead of sentimental drama, we get some satirical and verbal comedy. The only things that stays the same are the three ghosts, the Scrooge personality, and the definition of Christmas. I wouldn't consider this one of the greatest films of the holidays, but I will say that it works well as a Bill Murry comedy. There are dozens of funny jokes and plentiful sight gags that you can enjoy watching again and again. Overall, I'd say that this is a very good Christmas film and I did enjoy watching it, but please not that it may not be appropriate for little kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I got Scrooged on the purchase","review":"Liked this movie as a kid 15+ years ago.

The so-called \\"Purple Vergil.\\"What a beautiful thing! I imagine this book is wonderful for teachers in a Latin classroom setting; I have no idea, as I have never taken a class in Latin. For those who study Latin on their own, like me, this book is absolutely necessary. Each page contains its own textual commentary and also definitions of all but the most common vocabulary words employed on the page. Flipping to the back of the book is minimalized. Vergil becomes easy to read, and his powerful Latin comes through undiminished by translation, however skilled. Buy it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good copy","review":"I previously started with another copy from my university library. The reason I now change to this edition is that it defines all of the common words in a fold-out paper at the back, and ALL of the uncommon ones on the present page; in addition, where the word is defined, the declension or conjugation is always given, so that there is no need to go to the dictionary for more information!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best value of anything I've ever bought?","review":"Exaggeration?

The best verses on this album come from new cats like Cassidy, J. Hood, and Joe Buddens (50's joint is good too). Those three did they thing.

Before this item, I was confused on how the drain kept getting stopped up despite my usage of plunger and draino-like chemicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I'm not impressed by this item at all. it looks cheaper than other drains at the same price. it basically looks like a stainless mesh circle that was bent into a drain shape. prospective buyers should look to see if oxo makes tub drains. i LOVE my oxo kitchen sink drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Small....","review":"Warning.....This is a very small strainer....measurements are stated but only use is for a tub drain and will have to empty it every day or even twice a day...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holes very very small","review":"It is my fault I didn't take the reviews about the holes being tiny very seriously. I thought- what's the big deal? Well, for me it turned out I had to throw the show one out. It was so disgusting with the soap scum and slime - and having to rinse it out and clean with finger every day was not worth it. The product does do what it says - it catches EVERYTHING. I think I'll go for one with larger holes next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP!","review":"No buy but stop losing everything else.

This product works great to keep the hair from clogging up the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waster your time !","review":"Don't waste your time with this mesh strainer. In less than 3 weeks, not only was it covered in rust, but it also stained the rim of the bath drain with rust too!On top of that, it's difficult to remove the hair as the mesh is so thinly spaced out and the catcher is quite small - oh, and because the mesh is so small/thin, soap scum gets in there and then the water in the shower drains slowly! Argghhh!!All in all, I was very frustrated with this purchase :(Save yourself some time and get the \\"Fox Run Sink and Tub Strainer\\". Works very well, water flows through nicely, and it's super easy to remove the hair!Hope this review was helpful :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit and yea.. this thang does the work.","review":"Our bathtub is clog-free FOREVER and ever and ever...

The holes in the mesh are too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"First of all, this screen was way too concave to fit in my standard-sized sink. The 2.75\\" diameter was right, but I didn't expect the screen to be so tall. So I had to use it upside-down.Second, the screen rusted after just 3 weeks of use.Time to try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh x 2.","review":"I should have taken better note of other reviewers' complaints. This strainer will, indeed, prevent absolutely everything from entering your drain: hair, soap, shampoo, and water. I just tossed mine, after a few months of use, when it started discoloring. If, however, you're looking to protect your drain while soaking your feet in slightly used bathroom products, then this is your huckleberry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, clean every few days.","review":"This strainer fits perfectly in our tub drain. It catches everything (and that is it's job). It does require cleaning every few days. If you wait too long to clean it the water will not be able to run through it. I've found that using a toothbrush to clean it helps. I've had mine for a few months now and it is rusting a little bit on the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great strainer for the tub","review":"My wife has very long and curly hair which wrecks havoc on our tub's drain. We've used different plastic strainers from bed bath and beyond and nothing seemed to work. Those strainers would get clogged and force you to remove them just to allow the tub to properly drain while showering (thus defeating the purpose!). I selected the Danco strainer because it had great reviews on Amazon, and after a few weeks, it's been working great. The strainer catches long hair but still allows proper water drainage."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh!","review":"A couple of decent songs and the rest is just plain boring.

This other \\"nothinface\\" band could be good.... at dance music, I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Underrated, Relatively-Unknown Noir","review":"Intense actors like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this modern-day film noir a winner. Of the three, I don't know who was most interesting as all offer good performances and intriguing characters.Patric does the narration in this noir, playing an ex-boxer and mental patient. Wow, that alone makes for an interesting guy! He looks dumb, but he isn't. Ward is the slinky, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co- conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes bad. Bruce Dern also is in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate in about any film.The movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer, but I found it fascinating....and I don't like depressing movies normally. What I found was a kind of quirky crime film. Take a look and see if you agree. This is pretty unknown film that shouldn't have that status because it's simply a good story and well-done."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, SUPRISING, WELL ACTED NOIR","review":"This is one of the better mysteries/thrillers out there. Perfectly executed through and through. Great direction (probably the best James Foley has ever done). Great cast (likewise,probably the best Jason Patric has ever done). Great script. Should be held in high regard with all movie lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"pulp fiction","review":"Jason Patric is memorable as a drifting, washed up boxer who gets caught up as the patsy in a disasterous kidnapping scheme. Patric's only fault could be that he's a bit too pretty as he's a good actor and like others have said below it's a shame that he hasn't been seen in more films. Rachel Ward makes a believable alcoholic femme fatale but I couldn't help but think of Jessica Lange playing the part as the role seems tailor-made for her.Over-all this was a great little film, very film-noir, so much so that it almost seemed strange to be watching it in color, so it didn't surprise me at all to learn from the other reviews that the story was actually from a 50's pulp novel of the same name. I can't speak for the novel but in the films case this title doesn't fit at all but it's good to see that it's not being forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense dark drama.","review":"When a moody, wandering Ex-Boxer (Jason Partic) who may or may not be as punch drunk as he seems.

Jason Partic gives a terrific outstanding performance in this one. Fine Performances by Ward and Dern. Super 35.

The the pearls of wisdom on the vintage guitar marketplace are great....Kind of like listening to industry research analysts discuss their unique views on the vintage guitar marketplace.Anyway, thanks to Larry Meiners for doing this CD.How about a book on the vintage guitar industry, the movers and shakers - with some guitar dealer stories. You know, the one where an old guy comes with his deceased brothers mint 57 Strat thats been sitting in the closet for 4 decades...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Vlad novel","review":"I always enjoy reading Steven Brust, especially his Vlad Taltos stories. Orca is no exception, being a fairly basic straightforward story. However, I enjoyed the earlier Vlad stories better. I look forward to him finally rejoining his wife and resolving his many problems. It's a mistake to send him off basically alone against the entire Jhereg organisation, especially in such a multi-book setting. That said, this is still a good story and worth anyone's time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vlad's Guide to Financial Swindles","review":"In this plodding tale of Vlad, much talking is done about a banking financial swindle happening. Like Vlad investigates Enron, but not that much fun. In order to help Savn, who saved Vlad previously Vlad must help out an old lady with the power to possibly heal Savn. This leads to the investigation of the financial swindle.Vlad and Kiera play Joe Hardy and Nancy Drew, except again, it really isn't that fun. The book is dialog heavy and as exciting as my accounting textbook, maybe less so.As others have said, the revelation in the last 10 pages is the only payoff for reading the book. Not worth it in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've seen this before","review":"I liked this story the first time when Vlad was called Drizzt, and he was a dark elf saving villages in the Forgotten Realms.Brust can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't stop now","review":"Only a few words need be said about this book. The story just keeps getting better and better. Steven Brust has been and is a master storyteller. This is not light and airy fantasy but good old fashion fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Another good book by Steven B rust. Good characterizing and a major surprise at the end. I can not wait until the next one comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not too happy with this...","review":"I think the Vlad Taltos series is going downhill somewhat. I didn't much care for Athyra, and this one wasn't so great either. The return to first-person narration is a plus, even if it's only actually narrated by Vlad in bits, but overall the book REALLY dragged, with a horribly convoluted and dull plot that never really led anywhere. Only the most ardent Brust fans need check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vlad and Kiera investigate a business scandal","review":"In this novel, Vlad (assisted by Kiera the Thief)tries to help an old lady so she won't get kicked off her lands; a financial scam artist named Fyres has just died and suddenly everyone is panicking to sell their land. Vlad suspects that the Imperial investigators only pretend to investigate Fyres's death, and he tries to find out why. Vlad and Kiera take turns at telling the story. Reading about this financial tangle isn't very exciting...until you get to the last few pages - the final revelation will make you jump, I promise !"},{"rating":"1","title":"King Lounger? King Dumper is more like it.","review":"Actually, this product gave me a good laugh today, although I wouldn't want to see a YouTube video of me trying to get on it in my pool. It looks cushy and stable, right? Like you could just settle in for the afternoon? Maybe if you're 18 years old, 5'1\\" and weigh 95 lb you can. But not if you're an old lady like me--79 years old, 5'6\\" and overweight. It took me about ten attempts just to get seated without being bounced off into the pool. Once I figured out how to mount the beast, I had to position myself VERY carefully in the middle, not shifting even an inch to the right or the left. Otherwise I'd get dumped again.I'll admit, it tickled me. But only because I was alone, in my own pool, with no one to witness the performance. And also because although it was money thrown away, it wasn't a LOT of money thrown away.How they can manufacture something so magnificent looking and yet so totally unreliable is beyond me.Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome album","review":"This is one of my favorite albums ever. I love singing along with all the songs...so I'm especially glad that lyrics were included with this reissue. Del Amitri really conjure up a Scottish village of lovelorn souls in these sweet, complex, conflicted tunes. Now if only they'd reissue their second album with extra tracks...no, all of 'em...and tour again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Where It's At","review":"Hate to be the lone dissenter but I'm gonna be honest here. I became a Dels fan around the time of Twisted and Some Other Sucker's Parade. I'm sure I'm far from the only one in that camp. I picked up this album long ago (I've long since sold off the CD). When I gave it a listen, I thought it was a different band!I can't say the album's bad, it's just a completely different genre of music. More Elvis Costello-ish than the melodic alt-rock balladry of sorts that filled the later releases.If you're like me, a word of caution, this disc may not be for you. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"top book - rethink your way of management","review":"I have the full audio version of this book and have listened to it several times.

Not only does Mounce go into incredible detail in discussing the Greek of the Pastoral Epistles, he shows the reader the various viewpoints regarding controversial passages as well as listing the strengths and weaknesses of each. One can tell that his research is exhaustive and accurate. Although the sheer amount of information can be daunting (I won't be able to read if cover to cover for quite a while), this book can be a great asset to a Bible student, whether he is writing a paper or simply studying the Word of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"PlIers are of good quality and work well.

So right off the bat I obviously know how to use it. Though I think it's simple enough so that anyone with a brain could do it. I bought one for myself and I constantly use it for espresso. It is a bit pricey but it makes up for it after a while considering all the money I save on coffee. Definitely recommended if you dig iced coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!! Fantastic Coffee, easy to use","review":"I love my Filtron coffee maker. I experimented with a homemade cold brewer and it worked okay, but this is so much easier and more efficient. The coffee tastes fantastic, I've drunk it several times and not realized I forgot to add sweetener until I was half through, that is how good the coffee is. I always put a lot of sweetener in my coffee and for me to drink it without means it is very mellow and not bitter. The Filtron makes it very easy and very clean to make coffee - and the \\"syrup\\" is thick, rich and dark. It makes amazing iced coffee and great hot coffee as well. I will never go back to hot brewed coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ice coffee","review":"The Filtron coffee maker produces a smooth and tasty extract that is perfect for ice coffee. Great product! Easy and neat setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully challenging","review":"Crush is a fabulous game that creates puzzles that require both 2D and 3D space to solve. Why? Crush puzzles, live in 3-D. You can move around in 3-D but eventually you will run out of 3-D paths through the maze. To make the leap - you have to \\"Crush\\" the world into 2-D. Now the platform that was way-off in the distance, is directly in front of you. Simply walk onto the next platform and un-Crush (go back to 3D). Viola - you are now on the distant platform you coluld not reach in 3-D. ....Cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"original and uniquely challenging","review":"This game is as original as they get; combine that with it being fun to play and incredibly challenging to beat (90% problem solving, 10% platformer skills), and you have a classic. It's HARD - I'm less than halfway through the game, with many completed levels having required many repeated attempts and much thought. I don't see this as a downside, though, because in hindsight there were no tricks or cheats required to complete levels, just solid insights into how to solve the puzzles. Thus you have a singularly original, deep and challenging puzzle game that is geared for your moments of highest mental acuity.Buy this game - not just to play it, but to send the message that there's a market for highly original and highly challenging puzzle games."},{"rating":"2","title":"kickin'","review":"great song, great single. this song is really exciting. listen to the b-sides, sweet alcohol and midget in a nightclub. they are fantastic songs too. how does tim rogers write so many good songs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"Not only were we told who and what everyone did as the up front, but the 'everyones' were numerous with more and more being added as the story went on.

I've heard about this {strictly for completists} later day Electric Prunes release, but I never thought any record company would bother to reissue it on CD. It's not all that terrible, just the very idea of tagging this disc as an official Electric Prunes record. Tunes here that I could possibly coax myself into sitting through again are \\"Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers\\", maybe \\"Violent Rose\\" and the semi-uplifting \\"Sing To Me\\".

The owner of the company who produced the chemical now wants to find her (Alex manages to escape before being apprehended) so Alex has to deal with this on top of learning about and managing her newfound superpowers. She also has to deal with her sister, who sometimes treats her like a lab rat because of her powers. It's not easy being a kid who has to hide her powers from everyone else, huh?

You might want to upgrade the ram to speed up Vista. This laptop is so tiny and fairly light weight. I bought this after my 12 inch G4 powerbook died. It is much lighter then the powerbook. Great for travel. I wanted a cheap laptop to surf the web and do my music on. This laptop works great! It doesn't have the built in webcam that most toshibas have, but it has a fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes me feel all futuristic. I have had no problems with this computer. It is not worth $1300, but if you can find it cheap like me, it is a great buy. My advice if looking for a laptop is buy a Mac if you have the money. If you are poor like me then shop around for a cheap PC that does what you want. If you shop around or look online you can find some great PC bargains! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a dud","review":"this was the first unit I got -it was returned because the bed was warpedThe second unit came from j&r; it was returned as part of hard drive was corruptj&r; were very professional -I gave them the Toshiba i.d. service number and they credit my account shortly after they received the unit it their facility.

There's no reason why this album couldn't have been sequenced without breaks, because the songs largely sound the same. With the loss of their UK label and all the trappings of London's corporate identity, the Bananas sound like they're out on a limb, trying to re-prove themselves as performers. The group has always been at the mercy of their production team, but instead of infusing the songs with their trademark bounce and pop hooks, the material on Ultra Violet is methodical and tiresome. And with the exception of their loyal fans, I doubt that this album will be remembered by anyone ten years hence.

I read it through first, then I read it a second time using a high lighter to mark the interesting passages and then I read it again and was just as excited about managing and learning as I was the first time. This book teaches you to look at life as intersecting systems instead of isolated events and occurrences and fully explains why certain activities produce the outcomes that result from the choices that are made.

I couldn't help feel like I was reading some lame new-age self help book.If you are already in middle management or above, you will probably think this book is fantastic as it reads just like you talk.But if you are in lower management or below and you see what's wrong with most company's mid and upper management, then you will find this book worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic Babble","review":"I'm glad I actually borrowed instead of buying this book. The approach was enough to keep me involved for a couple of chapters, but when I went to browse the appendices, I quickly found out what the ultimate drive was. In a nutshell,in problem solving, one should look for underlying barriers and dynamics. Treating symptoms does not necessarily solve the problem . . . No kidding? Anyone with half a brain can figure that out, it's the \\"what do we do now\\" problem that I believe is more important. This is where the meat is and where this book is woefully lacking. One either decides to engage their corporate culture, or merely go with the flow to their own peril in either case. Those that figure it out rise to the top, those that don't continue to kick against the goads until they figure it out. It really is a bottom line issue.

With the Colour of Silence Tiffany has improved on that album with self-expression, mature lyrics, and plain old-fashioned good music. The sad part is such an excellent album won't be heard by a majority of the people because of non-existent marketing and distribution. I only knew about this album because of VH1's Behind the Music.

Let's hope this gets distributed to the airwaves before it fades away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good CD","review":"I have been listening to Tiffany since her Debut album came out. I have to say that this album is by far my favorite from her. I've read a couple of critics compare this album to Alanis' Jagged Little Pill and I do agree. This album is defiantly more edgy than her squeaky clean albums. I wish she would stick to the more rock than pop side. I think it suits her voice so much better. I recommended this album to all the fans that followed her career and those that liked Jagged Little Pill. I was kind of surprise that this album did not take off like it should have. I'm not Sleeping, I will not breakdown, Piss U off, Silence, All the Talking, Good enough for me, and Butterfly hare my favorites on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of all time!!","review":"Honestly: stunning and breathtaking. I kept tabs on Tiffany all these years hoping she would be able to prove herself. This album was everything I hoped for and more. Truly unique and nothing like the songs she released as a teenager. Each song takes you on a little journey: bouncing from soft to rough, from vulnerable to tough. Very eclectic. Some songs sound like old rock (Janis Joplin) others mellow and catchy (Fleetwood Mac) and several like Alanis Morrisette: lyrics profound and witty and music that catches you off guard. Take a listen. My favorite tracks: All The Talking, Good Enough for Me, Betty, Silence, Open My Eyes, Butterfly and I Will Not Breakdown. So sooo good.

I especially like her early work and that's what most of my collection is. When I saw this CD last year I put it on my wish list because it was a fairly new release and I wanted to hear how she sounded now. This CD does not disappoint! Every track has meaning and is sung with the emotion it promises. I really like all the songs. some of my favorites are \\"You Can Do Anything\\", \\"I Wasn't Gonna Fall In Love\\", \\"It could Have been Anyone\\", \\"Monday Without You\\", \\"You will Find Me There\\", \\"Safe Again\\" and \\"This Time\\". The others are pretty good, too! She takes on some difficult subjects with some of her songs, like marital abuse with \\"Safe Again\\", fear of trying new things with \\"You Can do Anything\\" and an affair with a married man with \\"Monday without You\\".

Each song is a beautifully written gem. No one out there now writes better songs than \\"An Uncommon Love\\" and \\"This Time\\". The arrangements are imaginative and oh so tasty. Check out the amazing vocals on \\"I Wasn't Going to Fall\\" and the hypnotic track on \\"You Will Find Me There\\". Some songs are just plain fun (if you don't tap your feet to \\"I Don't Know\\" you're probably dead) ... others are emotional and moving (\\"Safe Again\\"). Miss King has never sung better. Her simple, almost rehearsal-sounding version of \\"Oh No Not My Baby\\" should be required listening to everyone who wants to sing honestly and soulfully.\\"Love Makes the World\\" could only have been created by a master, and Miss King has proven herself that once more. This is a must-have CD. Run, don't walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd!","review":"I love this cd! The songs are beautiful, and Carole King's voice sounds as good as ever. This special edition with the dvd is amazing.

As long as you press it together well, it holds well. My daughters pull on them, but quickly stop when they can't rip them off. The problem is they have long hair and no matter how hard we try, we end up pulling their hair. We put the bibs on in front (under their chins,) then twist the bib around. After they eat, we rip the bib to remove on the side, rather than trying to open the seal. This has reduced the hair pulling, but we cannot seem to keep it from happening completely. Overall these are my favorites. We have not had any issue with food leaking through the bib."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool CD - When's the album out?","review":"Heard this guy on an internet radio station that you build yourself, called \\"Pandora\\" (it's an excellent concept).

There is little if anything in the way of practical information I was able to use. Most of it consisted of \\"this-is-how-I-got-a-job-and-you-can-too!\\" Very petty and poor writing style.

When she meets Michael at a New Year's party they hit it off and they start going out. Katherine is deeply in love with him and once she's sure the love is real, they make love. It is not as perfect as Hollywood movies would have you believe but Katherine and Michael keep sleeping together. Of course they are always responsible, there seems to be no question about it. As the book was first published in 1975, taking precautions meant avoiding pregnancy; now it means also avoiding STDs such as Hepatitis and AIDS. Therefore some of the advice Katherine is given when she goes to the family planning clinic would not apply to now. However the book is excellent and a wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"Blume merely shows one side of a first love. In the book, there is very little description, particularly of deep emotion. Katherine and Michael have no heart-to-heart talks, and it's difficult for the reader to see why they all of the sudden love each other. Mainly the book focuses on the sexual aspect, which is NOT what first love is all about. I went into this book thinking it would show the emotional side of a first love, the scary leap that one takes when they give themself to someone else emotionally. Blume only tells of the leap of giving themselves away sexually, and it was not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I simply couldn't stop reading..","review":"The first time I read this book I was in 7th or 8th grade and its been a favorite of mine for years.

When I first picked up this book I was 11 thinking that it was another one of her fun and cute \\"Fudge\\" books. However I was horrified that the book was centered around sex. Now when I go back reading the book, I think that it is perfectly fine, but I think back when I was reading the book and realized how unsuitable it is to read at that age. Children pick their own children authors they like, just like adults.

This book has all my feelings about this situation... even eerier is that my boyfriend has the same name as Catherine's boyfriend, plus the name \\"Kat\\" used to be my nickname too...

Blume doesn't write this like some of the other books that always go how the reader wants. This was very, probably more than I liked realistic. It went into detail about things most other books shy away from. It talked about everything a teenager wanted to hear. This was graded down because of its ending. It was satisfying, but too realistic and didn't have enough hope. Still, I strongly recomend this book to everyone because of its strong point and great relations to kids our age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a teenager I loved this book....","review":"I am a teenager and I read this book beacuse for an english project we did a research paper on an auther.

I can remember being an impressionable, and curious teen, when this book was placed in my hands some 20 years ago. I can tell you that many young women I knew became sexually active at a very young age, due in large part to this book. It made sex seem 'hip' and 'cool'. The saddest part of all is what this book says about our culture...which has cheapened a beautiful act between a husband and wife into a poor imitation.I would not recommend this book to any teen, especially ones who lack parental involvement in their lives. I believe that all parents should pre-read this book before allowing their teens to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't happen in real life.","review":"The basic idea of the book was okay. In fact, it was a good idea. Judy Blume attempted to capture and put into words the life of a \\"normal\\" teenage girl.Katherine is supposedly a normal teenage girl who falls in love with Michael, a guy that is her age. They get closer and they become more active - mentally and physically. Eventually, they have a sexual relationship that they believe will go on forever. Often there are sexual and very graphic scenes introduced in this book.Yes, people, especially today's teenagers need to get a proper sexual education. However, I do not believe this is the way to do that. This book shows people that it is okay to have sex as long as there is protection. This is not a book to be taken seriously. It doesn't happen in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid Entertainment","review":"This book has and had one goal: to sell copies. The author exploits teenage curiosity about sexual matters in a way that validates the \\"feelings\\" of most young teens -- feelings that they want to have sex, to be physically intimate. But guess what, folks, following your \\"feelings\\" isn't the right way to live. Somebody cuts you off in traffic -- what do your \\"feelings\\" tell you to do? RUN 'EM OFF THE ROAD. Should you do that? No. A teacher gives you a bad grade and kids at school pick on you. \\"Feelings\\" say: blow up the school and kill the teachers (remember Columbine?). Should you do that?

I was totally unprepared, however, for the very unappealing, graphic, almost clinical manner Ms. Blume uses to describe the sexual encounters of this teen couple. Surely the issues and the emotions could have been explored without subjecting the reader to the sticky details of a \\"manually induced\\" orgasm!

I sent my copy back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay....","review":"I like that this book tackles teenage sex, because parents, like it or not...if you're teenager is in love, they're probably doing it. However, the author fails to write about the more romantic aspects of a relationship (i.e. dinners together, long deep talks, similar interests). These two kids may love each other, but it's a physical love, nothing more. Without sex, I wonder what these kids would be doing?????The idea of them using birth control is wonderful. However, it does fail to mention the use of condoms after she gets the pill. They still need to safe-guard against stds, she may be a virgin. But he did say he had VD last summer. You never know.All in all, if I had a teenage daughter, I wouldn't mind her reading about sex, as long as it was related to a true love relationship with birth control. This book does not present a well-balanced relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"um...","review":"OK...this book is really disgusting. I'm 14 and I cant believe how graphic it is. I guess its a good book, but read it when you are older. Don't let your kids read it because it is the most graphic book I have ever read and really sick. They really describe things in great detail and it is just kind of gross. So don't read this book until you are old enough, which would probably be at least 16. Or make sure that you are really mature. I gave it a 4 because it is a good book though, just really graphic and...gross i guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is trash","review":"I am a 23yr old SAHM, This book is about a teenage girl who has very graphic sex with a guy she hardly knows, goes to planned parenthood to get birth control & then starts sexually fantasizing about another guy she doesn't know. Saying this book encourages promiscuity is an understatement. This is an awful book that overly emotional, hormonal teenage girls should not read.

No one was writing on this subject for teens in the 1970's . Known for her controversial books, I have found most of Judy Blumes's books to be exceptional. Forever lacks a strong ending, the story builds and builds then fizzles, and for that I must give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Interest Here","review":"This book just didn't have a lot to recommend itself. It's the kind of book I would have read as a young teenager, purely for the sex. Katherine is a bland, lifeless character, and Michael is nothing but a desperate for sex loser. I kept wishing Katherine would tell him to back off. What's so romantic about a guy pushing a girl to go farther than she's comfortable with? Didn't he have any feelings of tenderness or consideration for her? Any respect? That's not \\"love,\\" it's a typical horny teenage boy. The bottom line is that aside from the sex, there's really not much of a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOREVER IS GREAT!!!","review":"Forever is a excellent bok by Judy Blume.

It talks about your first love.I read this book when I was 121/2, I think this was a pretty good age to read it(probably 13). It talked about things that could happen when your 18 or younger or even older, I really enjoyed this book and I bet you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent account of a first sexual encounter","review":"This book has been a favorite of mine since I was 10 and wasn't sure what I was getting into when I first read it. Katherine and Micheal have something very amazing and I get choked up at those parts where their communication is lost. It is very easy to read and I really recommend it to those who like Judy Blume and want to read about first time sex"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute.","review":"Michael and Katherine meet at a New Year's party and start dating. Their innocent dating turns into a sex life. Even though Katherine claims she loves Michael, I and even if he does care for her too, I think he pushes her into sex too much. Every time they go out, it's always feeling as if he wants to sleep with her. He makes highly suggestive moves, until finally she agrees. When their parents command they separate for the summer, Katherine is distraught until she \\"gets the hots\\" for a tennis player in her camp. Will the love Katherine and Michael share last forever?I gave this book four stars because the characters in it are a bit bland and some of the descriptions are a bit vague and you are expected to assume things, or so it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction to High School Love and Sex","review":"This book is perfect for a teenager just starting to think about falling in love and \\"going all the way.\\" It's an important coming-of-age novel because it disproves all the myths of marrying your high school sweetheart, and how sex can really change a relationship, especially when you're young. The book is a little racy, but not too graphic. Rather than an instruction book on first love and losing your virginity, Judy Blume wrote an emotional story that's easy to realte to, and learn from. Mothers, pick this up for your teenage girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like New!!","review":"I wouldn't of cared.. but when a product says like new, that's what you're expecting. The book showed up with nail polish on the cover, big spills of liquid foundation on the pages, and marker written and highlighted on multiple pages. I don't think the seller should be able to put like new, when the book is in that kind of condition.However I did receive the book in a timely manner and my daughter did love the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Some people say that sex and young adults(ages11-14) don't mix. People of this age should not hear so much graphic information. I feel totally opposite to that statement. I won't lie, I am 12 years old. And I have read that book. I have seen those \\"how i was made\\" books and all that kind of stuff, but in a comparison, Forever really tells all. I mean, I never knew about more of the in-depth stuff, such as the love, love, love for each other, the commitment, and all decisions needed for sex. I would say that I really enjoyed this book and all people, young adults, teens, adults, should read this book. I thought it was awesome and really told all."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think this is another RAMONA, think again!","review":"This book is graphic, almost explicit, but has a steady story line surrounding the main character and her boyfriend. It vividly illustrates all landmarks in young love from the first shared glance to the first kiss to the first...time. Beverly Cleary writes with an informal, but not nearly slang, tone that makes the reader relive the memories (this book recaptures) all over again. Not for children under 13, to be sure, but still a very good, strong read with good messages about safety, honesty, and most of all...love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever","review":"I absoulty loved the book, I couldn't even put it down, and I can't read more novels from Ms.Blume, but I hope to write a continues to Forever, they only thing I didn't like was the ending it kind of mad me a little upset, but then again I'm the type of person who likes happy endings. But other than that I loved the book, and I'm going to get Summer Sister pretty soon. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Review","review":"Okay, so I am a 17 year old senior in High School and I thought this book was terrible. Forever by Judy Blume is written in the style of a 10 year old, yet deals with sexual situations that belong in porn movies. The storyline was weak, and the relationship between the two main characters was strange and unhealthy. I do NOT recommend this book and I literally (no actually) threw it out after I read it. It was that bad, and I didn't want anyone to know that I had read it. ( i just want to prepare you because it had no story or relationship, and was mainly about awkward sex, written for middle school level readers (which did not make sense))"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I used to love Judy Blume","review":"Oh, Judy...you sure did pull the wool over my eyes. As a middle-schooler, I read almost all of your YA novels and loved them. Now, as a more experienced reader, I realize just how mediocre your writing is. Please forgive me for this review, but, seriously, this is not literature. Plus, it's rather outdated, and I can't believe people are still shocked by the contents...Seriously, your kids see worse things in the corridors in-between classes. Anyways, I say steer clear of this seventies throwback and read Doing It by Melvin Burgess or Blankets by Craig Thompson instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is Generous","review":"I read this book maybe 15 years ago, and I remember it as being Judy Blume's worst. Every girl in my junior high was carrying around dog-eared copies of it and enjoying the \\"racy\\" parts; I can remember being in grade school and clustering in a circle with other little girls, titillating each other by reading the sexual scenes aloud. It was the equivalent of little boys sneaking a look at their dad's \\"Playboy\\" magazines. There are no redeeming qualities to the book; the writing isn't good, and there is no underlying message and no character development to speak of. I suspect Blume wrote this one just to make money. I would not recommend this book to anyone, least of all pre-sexual girls, as it won't teach them anything about literature, and it won't teach them anything very worthwhile about sex either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Read","review":"That's about the only positive thing I have to say about this book... It really was one of the worst books that I have ever read. Stereotypes of slutty characters being fat (I wrote a paper over this for my juvenile lit class) and supposedly \\"in love\\" characters and a false sense of resolution really ruined this book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I thought this book was truely amazing. it really taught you the true meaning of love, lust, and passion all wrapped in one. I couldnt put it down. However, if i were to change one thing, it would be to put more detail into the physical characteristics of the characters in the book. I loved this book, and hope to read more just like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this go to print..?!","review":"Poorly written, zero story line, full of awkward sex, an absolute nothing of a book. So disappointed I actually tossed it after reading (and I never do that to a book)! Do not waste your time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to think it was great...not anymore","review":"Judy Blume IS a terrific author so don't all the sudden think she hasn't written any great novels because she has. It's just that 'Forever' is not the greatest book in the world. I'm actually quite surprised to see that many people gave it five stars. When I read this book a couple of years ago I thought it was the coolest book and now I know why. The sex caught my attention. Sure there IS some great sex in this book but I hardly see a plot. It no longer gets me hooked like it used to. But PLEASE do read some other books that Judy Blume has written. Many of them are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"my opinion","review":"this book is a good book and apropriate if u r starting highschool or older, it says 12 and up but it should be like 14 and up because like the scenes in it are worse then u could see in some movies and i am 15 and i just barely felt that it wasnt wrong to read it. it has a good bunch of explicit senarios that u minght not want a younger person to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read","review":"This is one of the best books I've read because of so many reasons. It portrays a teenagers true feelings and emotions and Im amazed that Judy Blume can relate so much to the character \\"Kathryn\\". Other reviews gave it a lower number of stars because they claimed that the story was really well written but the end just cut you off. I disagree with that. I think it was written that way purposely and it shows that there aren't always happy endings to evrything in life, and just like this book, sometimes, everything goes great for a while (bulids up) and then suddenly it's over and if your dissapointed you can't go back and change it. There are so many moments in this book that make you want to cry when you realize how cruel the world can be and that things like the situation in this book happen every single day...this book is must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the morals?","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. As a young educator, I am fairly liberal when it comes to banning books, but I agree that this book should be banned from school libraries. Katherine and Michael's sexual relationship is detailed in unnecessary graphic terms. Instead of illustrating the beauty of sexual abstinence and restraint, Blume offers the alternative with Katherine's visit to Planned Parenthood for birth control pills. Michael was domineering and, though patient, pushed Katherine sexually. I do not recommend this book to anyone, but if you want your children to read it, don't offer it to them any younger than age 16."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird","review":"so im on my brothers account just so you know. im a girl. i hated the book. i didn't know it was about sex and did not enjoy the book at all. i didnt even finish. the whole book was boring and not real. by the way im 15. ugh. hated this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child Abuse","review":"One of my daughters unsuspectingly brought this book home from the misleadingly named \\"Young Adult\\" section of our library, where children as young as twelve are encouraged to browse. This particular edition was the one with the front cover that makes it appear to be a harmless adolescent romance, but the book inside turned out to be a cross between a pornographic novel and an advertisement for Planned Parenthood.If you want to get an idea of what this book is like without supporting it financially, and you're over 18 and have a strong stomach, just go to Amazon's \\"Search inside this book\\" feature and search for \\"ralph\\". If you still want to read the book, please don't move to my town. We've got enough weirdos and perverts here already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Loved it!

I realize some might be shocked and think that was too young. Of course the \\"dirty\\" parts were titilating and mysterious, but I certainly the book did not corrupt me in ANY WAY. I sailed safely through adolescence and eventually had a mature intimate relationship when I was ready. This book is wonderful. It may seem \\"shallow\\" to some (see other reviews), but I found it realistic for the young teenage viewpoint. You cannot expect teenagers to think the same way as adults. However, I've never forgotten Katherine's anguished question, \\"Can't you be in love with someone and be attracted to another?\\" Like it or not, that is a reality of life that people do not want to discuss. Bravo to Judy Blume for her bravery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Judy Blume tells the wounderful story of young love. In Forever... you go through journey of Kath and Michel's love at eighteen. A wonderful story and an extremely fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"unique subject matter does not buy artistic merit","review":"I'll keep this short. Yes, this is a fairly unique book; in my experience, I have yet to come across another. The writing, however, is truely dreadful. It reads like a typical high school student wrote it. Some things mentioned, like preferences to lox on bagels, are amazingly tedious and quite inconsequential to the story as a whole. As a work of art, it is sub-par. As a ground-breaking subject for an adolescent novel, it does well. Most innocence-lost books are much more dramatic, but atypical drama would defeat the purpose here. Read it if you want to hear of an everyday, ho-hum, teenager dealing with her first relationship and loosing her virginity. It will sound very much like your own, perhaps, and very much like all the stories you've heard from your friends. Don't read it if you prefer depth in plot & exploration of character, for that's not the point of this book's existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read overall","review":"Overall this was a good book. It was a very easy read. The language was simple but the content was mature. Although at a glance it seems the entire book is about sex, the underlying story was a very good message and I think any teenage girl will be able to relate in some way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Blume does it once again in this classic tale about first love and going all the way. She puts you right in the mind of her teen characters, and doesn't disappoint with this one.That said, I'm shocked by how many people are so appalled by the book's \\"lack or morals.\\" Come on, we don't live in the dark ages. Teens have sex. That's just a fact. So I applaud Blume for accurately conveying what it's like for someone during her first experience. I agree that younger teens should not be reading this book, but I don't see anything wrong with her writing about something that happens in real life. She's not telling other teens to have sex, she's just telling a realistic story. To think that all tales should be about fluffy bunnies holding hands and skipping is insane. But wait, bunnies are known for having sex, too, so maybe they shouldn't be written about either, those immoral creatures...."},{"rating":"1","title":"book quality","review":"in all the years i've been ordering books from amazon, i was so disappointed to get this book made with cheap 'newspaper' quality paper. i bought two, one for my daughter and one to gift and i'm embarrassed to gift ... not the cost, but the quality. it's so cheaply made, it must have cost a nickle to reproduce. i am seriously considering going to local vendors only and avoiding amazon all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"graphic","review":"this was a very inapproprit book.blume used very graphic terms and imigis in this book i read it when i was twelve and found it to informitivewait till you are 14"},{"rating":"1","title":"FOREVER","review":"First, I want to say that I read most of the reviews. All the reviewers who said \\"Forever\\" was a great book are wrong. Sex is special. It is something that should be saved for marrige. Sure, go ahead, have it before marrige but in the end all you gain is bad memories and regret. Kathy can like Theo and maybe even marry him, but she'll still have that memory of her time with Micheal. I know Kathy is a fictional character, but there are a lot of Kathys in the world. Judy? Are you trying to make millions of girls end up like Kathy? Many of girls are making Kathy their role model. It says in the Bible to not have sex before marrige. Maybe some people would say I'm making too big of a deal of this, but there are thousands of girls affected by this book. I'm not immature or old fashioned. Not every girl in the world can afford to be like Kathy. I am sure many parents do not want a book teaching their girl how to have sex. Judy Blume should be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trisha's Book Blog Review","review":"What a great book, I finished it in a couple of hours. This book cut right to the point of sex. There was no sugar coating what Katherine and Michael were up to. In novels nowadays it seems like sex is put into YA novels, but after reading the book you ask, so did they do anything or not? There is no mistake what went on in Judy Blume's book Forever.She really seems to hit teen relationships head on as well. Katherine and Michael swore they would be together forever and Judy Blume really shows how a teenagers mind works. I remember being in love with one guy one week, then the next week I had moved on.And because the book was published in 1975, let's just say things have changed. No way were my parents allowing me to go away with a boy for the weekend, or inviting them to my house after my parents were to sleep.This was just an all out amazing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't actually that good","review":"This book was recommended to me and therefore I was very surprised that it wasn't very good. I don't care about the explicit nature of it. In fact, sex scenes were the only ones that kept me remotely interested in the story. Book just wasn't written that well. Language is overly simplistic, there is no depth to the story. Even at 17 there is more to a teenager's emotions than: I like the guy, he is nice, I want to have sex with him, I love him, etc. Plus, the relationship described fell flat, too. There was nothing to it, no love, no infatution, just sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's okay, but disappointing.","review":"I expected it to be a MUCH deeper book, but it's actually quite...shallow. It's just like everything in the story revolves on Katherine and Michael being together. yes, the story is supposed to focus on that, but it revolves on that almost too much, plus the fact that the story develops too fast. It's an okay book, but not the kind worth raving about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Forever was one of the best books I've read.","review":"Forever is one of those books that you pick up and you're never sure of the ending. Kathrine, had lots to learn from her senior year in high school, and unlike a fairy tale everything didn't end happily. I wish they'd have written a sequel to this book to see how her life turned out in college, but if you like love stories this is definitely a book you should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Excellent.","review":"Forever by Judy Blume is an excellent book. I first read it about 3 years ago, and I even read a few more times after that.. yes.. that's how much I liked it. The ending was, in a way, a slight disappointment. Katherine's and Michael's love for one another was beautiful and seemed almost untouchable. In a way I hated the ending because I wanted it to be a happy one.. but it does make the book a lot more interesting and realistic the way it turned out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going all the way","review":"Great book. It teaches the basic morals of the first love. Teens should read this. I mean, Judy really expresses what goes on in a teens life through this book...let me tell you something...it aint all rainbows and unicorns in the real \\"puppy love world\\". Sure there are some explanatory parts, but they also state that it is good to get urself checked out at a clinic...the grandmother had the right idea....im not sure if it made n e sense, but its a really good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy Blume has readers entertained with great book for Y.A.","review":"I was very satisfied with the book \\"Forever. . .\\" by Judy Blume. I am a romance novel lover, and this was just the book to keep me entertained. It is about two high school seniors named Katherine (Kath) and Michael. They fall madly in love very soon, and they end up always having sex. kath was not ready for that at first, but then she decides that since they love each other they should do it. I read the book in about one day. I am a fast reader, but I just couldn't put the book down. The book can get very graphic at times (whenever \\"Ralph\\" comes into the picture..) but it is raelly very enjoyable. I would not reccomend this to young teens. It is suitable for high school students and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not shocking","review":"I read this book for the first time @ 15.

I usually read books of Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler variety, but I was bored and it was there. As I started to read I was immediatly brought into a world where, at least for one man, the whole world changes in a second. So it's a desperate struggle for him to try and discover who he really is, and where he is really from. Along the way he encounters aliens, ghosts, other versions of himself (including a female one), and even a world occupied entirely by versions of himself!!! I enjoyed the small bits of humour thrown in and the actual science was kept to minimum. I highly suggest this book, no matter what you usually read, you will enjoy it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I must honestly say that, while this book wasn't waht I expected, I still loved it. Foster mixes humor, science fiction, and an engaging, story to make a great book that is fun to read without becoming too complicated. The main character, Max, is a tabloid reporter who gets a dose of his own medicine, and eventually sees what a scumpot he is. The writing, as with all Foster, is great. I can't reccommend this highly enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I saw this book and was ecstatic! Parallel universes _and_ Alan Dean Foster, what a promising combination. There's one problem. It's pure fluff, completely disconnected. You're better off watching some old Sliders episodes. My big conclusion after reading this book is that I can't trust name recognition anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is probably the worst book I have ever read by Foster","review":"This book is slow, boring and definitely not up to Mister Foster's past accomplishments. The main reason I find this so frustating is that I have read every thing else he has written at least five or six times. This one only well... In fact, on three separate occasions I have tried to finish the book and couldn't..... Did I say it was boring??? Let me make that clear.... THIS BOOK IS ONE YOU WILL WANT TO PUT DOWN!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw preview of Jonah for CD-ROM-it's GREAT!!!","review":"I saw a preview for this game for kids.

Very high quality!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the kids","review":"We don't buy many games, but this one's a keeper. It has the same great look as the Veggie Tales videos and, just as important, the same hilarious voices. Though it tells the story of Jonah, this is not really an educational or instructional video: kids play games (such as shooting cheese curls at pirates) to earn progress on Jonah's voyage to Nineveh. This game is just right for my six year old; the box recommends the game for ages five and up. Parents can set an internal \\"egg timer\\" which tells the kids when time is up--30 minutes on this game is great reward for chores or school work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational CD-rom","review":"Great game.

Ray Malbrough has written this book claiming to reveal the ways of hoodoo and conjure, he is sadly mistaken. I can't caution you enough to not waste your time and money on this book. Visit the lucky mojo website if its hoodoo information your after. I will say in Ray Malbroughs defense however that his other 2 books, also published by Llewyllyn arent all bad, still, they are llewyllyn so draw your own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book is full of false information and it is very flighty. The only reviewer who gave it five stars seems to think the other reviewers are unfairly attacking the author personally, but it is in fact the author's responsibility to research what he writes and the publisher's duty to make sure the material they are publishing is correct. This book is supposed to be about Hoodoo. Hoodoo is not a religion. It is a folk magic practice. It is not voodoo, but this book seems to have more information about voodoo in it - and it is inaccurate information at that. I shudder to think of anyone picking this book up and taking it at face value.It is honestly not worth the paper it was printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"Being a fan of Ray Malbroughs other two books I half to say that I was utterly dissapointed with this one. None of the information seems to be correct, its filled with what appears to be alot of made up \\"new age\\" nonsense. The author seems to make alot of silly and outrageous claims in this book and even attempts in a lengthy chapter to combine HooDoo and the Cabala.....this is rediculous. There are alot better books out there than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad waste of time and money","review":"I went out and bought this book after seeing the reviews posted here and on other discussion lists. This is probably the worst book I have ever read on the subject. Anna Riva has more credibility than this guy! Llewyllyn Publishing House certainly does not seem to be bothered by the fact that they are marketing false information to the public. Who ever wrote in last and commented on the harmful effectd of combining traditions is correct. Hoodoo is not new age fantasy like the wiccan \\"religion\\" its a tried and true folk practice. The author seems to believe that he can mix Haitian Loa with hoodoo and blend in a bit of jewish mysticism for kicks. This book and the other Llewyllyn mistake, Sticks Stones Roots and Bones are both just plain fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Sad, Really.","review":"I normally wouldn't write anything about this silly little litter-box liner, but hoodoo is so misunderstood that I felt like I had to. The only thing he writes about hoodoo that is actually true is that it is NOT Voodoo. Then he proceeds to write about Voodoo pretty much nonstop, and manages to get most of that wrong, too. The book is a part of this whole neo-pagan idea that you can take X from one tradition and Y from another and it's all good. If you're interested in learning more about hoodoo, listen to the other single-star reviewers, and stick to Cat Yronwode."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way","review":"Sorry this just aint Hoodoo. This guy took all sorts of fluffy new age nonsense and made a book. I understand he wrote two others, Im afraid to even look at em. The book is useless, useless that is unless you want to be confused and made a fool of. No, if you wanna read hoodoo check out the very well written book by Cat Yronwode, thats hoodoo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I dont believe I have ever read a more dissapointing book on Hoodoo and conjure. I have read many of the other reviews and I certainly agree that this book must have been written just to make some money from those who are unaware. Not only does this book present inaccurate information but the author has taken much poetic license with his \\"view\\" of hoodoo. I wonder if he just copied a bunch of things from other llewyllyn books and made this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bunk - nothing but bunk","review":"I have studied many of the religions he is talkign about here and nothing he writes is accurate.

What it seems to be is a mixture of a little Hoodoo, Santeria and New Orleans-style Voodoo. There is workable magick here, but if it's Hoodoo you want, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This book is horrible. Any HooDoo worker worth their salt would laugh at this silly thing. I read all the reviews before going out to the book store myself, and though many were unfavorable I thought I might as well give it a chance. All I had to do was spend about a half hour looking through it at the store, all the while in dismay that this was published. I have to say that I would side with those who said they felt this book was only published to fulfill a contract. I have lived in new orleans for many many years and noone I have ever met, worked with, or had any contact with at all practices HooDoo as related in this complete tragedy of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Awful Just Awful","review":"i am confounded that any publisher, even lewylyn would allow this book to be put on the street.

Do yourself a favor and dont buy this tragic waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think 53 used copies for sale is proof enough","review":"What can I say about this thing called a book.

If you are serious at all about respecting those who practice hoodoo then don't insult them by purchasing this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper its on","review":"This is a complete fabrication of new orleans hoodoo. I know quite a few people from the new orleans area, most of which were raised with hoodoo in their families and none of them could agree with this book. Ray Malbrough is a typical Llewyllyn author who writes trash to full fill contracts for books. Anyone who thinks that this book is authentic hoodoo is not worth their salt. If its hoodoo your after then look at books from Origional Publications and stay clear of Llewyllyn garbage,"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just rediculous","review":"I read this book all the way through and have never been so disgusted with a book in my life. I agree with the person who wrote in saying they believed this book was written to simply fill a contract. Typical Llewyllyn garbage. This book doesent even deserve a one star rating. If you are looking for a book on Hoodoo I suggest the one by Cat Yarowande. Whatever you do please don't support this book by wasting and cash on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so many bad reviews?","review":"This book has a low star rating but is worth owning if you are interested in Southern Hoodoo. Why I feel it has bad reviews is people don't like paying for books on any subject they want to know more about and the book claims to be of some expertise about the subject but, when you get to a serious topical point.... in the next sentence is something like ' but im not going to tell you how to do or make that '. Book's are either novels with mystery intended or topical which you expect information given on all topics mentioned in the book. Secrets are secrets and in total should not be talked about at all, otherwise that could be called ' waving the cherry '.Other than the mystery interjection into this topical book on Hoodoo it really is quite a good book if you can read past the secrecy irritation."},{"rating":"1","title":"AGREED!","review":"I deffintly agree with each reviewer that wrote in saying this book is terible. I was skeptical when I saw the little half moon on the spine which hallmarks Llewyllyn publication. I picked the book up at Barnes and Noble and sat down to read. I spent a good hour and a half looking through the book, reading parts and laughing. This book is almost total nonsense. The author either has no idea what he is talking about or he has decided to dupe people into buying nonsense. Ya wanna learn about hoodoo then read mules and men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"This is the worst book I have ever seen written on \\"Hoodoo\\" he should have just kept his day job, a writer he is definately not!!!!!

Last night it was so bad that it ached to sit up in bed or lay down on either side. My friend rubbed Pain Buster along my shoulder and massaged it in really well. I felt a burning sensation and it stinks like I remember Ben Gay smelling. But shortly, I felt complete relief and fell soundly asleep pain-free. I feel like an old lady going to buy this but it worked so well that I have no choice. Because of the smell, I'll only be applying it at night (which should be fine because the pain relief lasted nearly 24 hours for me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Cream? Who are you kidding!

The outside weather has been very cold going way below zero so even when sun hits the window it is way to cold to keep the plants there . We set up the Hydrofarm Dayspot and put the plants on their own shelf and have this light trained on them and they are doing well with only this light as their source this winter. Putting it together was easy , it clamps well onto the ledge and you can move it up and down directionally slightly to have its light hit where you want it. The bulb is lasting so far and is the original bulb that came with the unit . Very happy with this units performance to date ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 3 months","review":"Lamp and bulb are as advertised. However, the fixture blew after 3 months of use. Would have expected it to last at least a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked","review":"I purchased this to try and help save my kitchen garden.

Unfortunately, this never worked so I have no idea if it would have saved my plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working great!","review":"By all means, I am not a master gardener. I bought this for a few plants (like my night blooming jasmine) that were in large pots and I was afraid the winter cold would kill them. I hung it from a curtain rod, and turn it on for extra sunlight. I have a bright kitchen, however my windows do have a uv coating and I was afraid it would keep essential light from my plants that love sunlight. I keep it on all day, and off at night, using a timer. It is working well. My plants are still in great shape. I did need an extension cord - the cord attached is not very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light!","review":"I bought this since i needed another grow light and this one can be mounted in a lot of different locations depending on lighting needs.

It is not expensive but getting something that refuses to work makes this product a rip off. Basicly, this is junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works decently for the price","review":"I had to order a replacement for this after I assembled it. The lightbulb that came with it was not working. The replacement worked out of the box, but the light was very dim for what I wanted. This would work well for a single plant that does not require a lot of light, which unfortunately was not what I was looking for. I had to buy another lightbulb that produced the light I needed. The rest of the product however works well. It was easy to put together and easy to move and adjust. I don't think it is particularly attractive for a light but it doesn't stand out as a sore thumb. The clamp allows me to stick this light just about anywhere and the actual lamp is adjustable to any angle, which is a plus. You can set this and adjust till the light is where you need it. For the price it is a quick and easy solution for a plant light. As other reviewers said, this does get very hot and should be kept at away from anyone and anything who/that may get burnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set up, get replacement bulb ASAP!","review":"I really like this grow light. The spring clamp is very strong and will fit onto anything no more than 2 inches wide. The light bulb that came with it only lasted two months but was able to germinate several green chile seeds. I recommend buying a replacement bulb with the product as several other reviewers have also commented on the short life of the light bulb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light bulb burned out","review":"I guess this was a good product for maybe 2-3 days.

I enjoyed the dual perspectives of the Japanese wife and the Amerasian director. It clearly presents some real problems with the way food is processed in this country. I think some of the information is presented in a very biased way (the beef industry obviously did not have a chance to respond). However, I rethought my own approach to nutrition after reflecting on this book, particularly beef consumption.I enjoyed the numerous characters with which Ms. Ozeki peopled her story. They came from all walks of life and had varied and interesting backgrounds and lives.

Adding to that, the plot traverses the US and shows how different women and their values are across the country, and how very different life really is, but how, underneath it all, we're just women.Certain parts of the book were so descriptive, that I really considered vegetarianism fo a while, if this novel is based on what is really going on in American farms today. Quite disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentary in a work of fiction","review":"I found this book to be well-written and its environmental, documentary-style was fantastic! The book definitely raised my consciousness about the food we eat and how it gets to the dining table. Also the facets of American families and lives which were \\"documented\\" seemed very real. One of the best books I've read this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too heavyhanded","review":"This novel is part of a disturbing trend in recent fiction, in which the characters are nothing but cardboard cutouts groaning under the weight of the political (in some cases, theoretical) issues they represent. I'm sorry, but Jane Takagi-Little is nothing more than a collage of positions on an ethnic and political spectrum. She just never comes alive. I agree with the criticisms of the meat industry here (and yes, wife beating is bad... not too challenging a conclusion there), but without the convincing characters (or comic relief of any kind) to engage skeptical readers, books like this are just taking easy potshots for the pleasure of the converted. A shame... this book could have been really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a (medium) rare treat.","review":"As fleshy and tender as the name implies, with diverse characters and several complex intertwining messages. To say they are \\"PC\\" is to be a true victim of the term. Does being a lesbian make you PC? A vegetarian? These are real choices that real people make for good reasons, and this book touches on just a few. This book also has balls (literally. read it, you'll see...) for touching on a myriad of subjects such as adoption, slaughter, abuse, infidelity, love and many more in a single plotline and doing it well. Ozeki's use of Shonagon within the narrative is fabulous. As a fan of the timeless Shonagon myself, it was a nice surprise to see her in a modern, American story and how she continues to touch the lives of the women who read her thousand year old text. In her debut novel Ozeki has produced an emotional, exceptional work not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a chance on this and was pleasantly surprised!","review":"I surprised myself at how well I enjoyed this book about the production of a television program bringing American culture, values and, yes, meat into Japanese households.

What a surprise. This cute, quick read had me laughing out loud, and reading through my tears. The connection between the two \\"heroines\\" on either side of the ocean was remarkable, and the faxes across the ocean were a wonderful bridge. This is an important book.

It's called \\"My Year of Meats,\\" but don't let that make you think that means the story is limited to food. It covers the dangers of our industrialized food system yes, but beyond that it can be seen as a cultural study as well in that it covers so many different types of families and dynamics. Maybe the author was a little exaggerative in places, but it didn't really bother me (that being said, I know little about the Japanese culture and I might have felt differently if my experience was different). Overall, very interesting and thought provoking work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good dance compilation, though getting dated","review":"Got this CD because I wanted the 'James Brown is Dead' cut on CD, and you can't find L.A Style's CD new anymore.

This isn't cutting edge stuff, but it IS stuff you still hear, and which will definitely sound familiar and get you moving.'Rhythm is a Dancer' is probably the most widely heard track on the CD, followed by 'James Brown Is Dead' which is a classic. Some of the others are more obscure though, and I suspect Arista started grasping for straws to fill the entire CD up.Recommended if you want just one CD of dance music that you can pop in the player when you need some high energy.

Having used the Ionic Breeze before, this ineffectiveness of this air purifier was immediately obvious. Nonetheless, I continued to use it until one day, after three months of usage, I noticed it wasn't working at all.I contacted customer support at Surround Air, with the understanding that I would send in the unit. No, instead, they sent ME the pieces to replace... because I was responsible for shoddy manufacturing? The disassembly of the purifier was extremely difficult as tiny screws were initially machine torqued in. After much frustration, I ended up replacing the pieces and it worked again...for another couple of weeks and then the same problem occurred.Stay away from this one-- it's not worth the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy it","review":"I bought this thinking it would be just what I needed.

Many poems in the book you will be amazed by how far his honesty goes. He shares in depth topics that many people in this world would not share nor discuss. But, why keep these thoughts bottled up inside? Fortunately, this author took a chance and let himself free to alleviate his soul in these poems.As you read along, Peter Hargitai's poems carry an energy making you feel comfortable.

The emotions displayed through the poetry seem to be a method of therapeutic escape from his troubled childhood.The Poem \\"Mother's A Racist\\" best depicts his torn feelings for his mother, as a loving endearing mother and also, as an ignorant bigot.This collection of poetry is unique and unlike modern day watered down poetry, it is strong and remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex's reveiw","review":"This book could simply be described as Peter's emotions on pages.

Through this work you actually feel the pain and bitterness the author feels towards his mother.Oddly enough though certain points of the writing he is both building her up and criticizing her for the person she was. This collection of poems displays how much a mother's love influences a child's life. I admire the author for being so honest and revealing through this work. You are able to understand exactly what he is expressing. On completing this book,you are left with a definite feeling of partialness towards the author. I would recommend this book to others because it is a definite display of how healing can occur through writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Tongue (A Broken Hungarian Love Song)","review":"Reading mother tounge has left me with new insights on life. It describes the relationship between mother and son, from the son's point of view. His struggles were due to his mother's critical, cold, and bitter personality. This depiction of the author's real life events gives readers a look into his deepest, darkest feelings and the struggles he grew up with. This book of poems takes the reader through a cavalcade of thoughts, worries, fears, and anger. It shows how the author overcame these enormous obstacles and in the end, came to forgive those that trespassed him and even more importantly, himself. I rate this book with four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Whistler's Mother' in words","review":"In this book of selected poems by Peter Hargitai, he provides us with a small glimpse at his earlier life and the trails and tribulations he faced with his mother. Throughout his life Hagitai has never had a fantastic relationship with his mother. She tended to not show him much affection as a child, which troubled Hargitai most of his life. In Mother Tongue: A Broken Hungarian Love Song, Hagitai recounts standout moments that left a mark on him and formed him into the person he is today. In the book at times, it seems as if Hargatai is resentful or bitter towards his mother, which is not true. As much as he laments his mother's emotional detachment from him, he also praises her and finds time to speak fondly of her. In the end, the book is an unorthodox praise to one's mother, but Hargitai's use of words and overall emotion displayed in the poems makes this one to pick up and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapeutic writing","review":"\\"Mother Tounge:A Broken Hungarian Love Song\\" is a collection of poems written by Peter Hargitai towards his mother.

This book is full of honesty that a man has toward life, and his experiences. Hargitai had expressed himself directly, holding nothing back. If you enjoy learning about a person and are not judgmental this book is for you. He uses powerful words that create powerful images in ones head, and allow the reader to feel as though they are experiencing these feeling with him. This is a great book full of good, and depressing experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw","review":"Peter Hargitai's original and personal record of life is fiercely captured in the pages of Mother Tongue. These cluttered, reminiscent poems of tribulation and acceptance give a unique chance to peer into another world of the malcontent and ephemeral, social denial. He gives a shockingly realistic account of personal demons leave a long standing impression of a hauntingly distant life. Embedded in all his pieces are passion and fiery rage.Cryptic descriptions of past events leave you with lingering questions that beg further inquiries. He evokes raw, earthy images to capture the scenes of traumatic early childhood, and tumultuous post pubescent turmoil's. The random outbursts of Hungarian culture though out blend the pain and acceptance into a balanced account of his life.It is an extremely imaginative compilation full of personal reflections and new shades of the human condition.

You can tell he suffered a lot during his life and he took it all out on paper. All the anger and disappointment was seen in his poems, most of them although were about his mom.

The \\"Mother Tongue\\" book is a book of poems bases on the author's life. It details his many trials, tribulations and experiences which he faced, especially during a troubled childhood, throughout his life. This book was much more focused on Hargitai's childhood than his \\"Attila\\" book which was equally incredible. \\"Mother Tongue\\" is a much deeper and detailed version of his story. It is not for the novice reader though. Only intellects can grasp the dark and personal thoughts only Hargitai can put on paper. Nothing is what it seems in this metaphor filled tell all book of poems. His open sexuality and crude humor is trademark Hargitai which makes this another must have for those who dare.

From anger to forgiveness, there are always at least a couple poems one person can relate to. All of these poems deal with Hargitai's feelings towards his mother and how he overcomes the hatred and is able to forgive before she passed away, as clearly expressed in the last poem La Pietá. When one reads these poems, it is easy to interpret since it written in a form where anyone can read understands what the poet is trying to express. Although Hargitai uses rough language, but without it his poems will not have the effect on people that it currently has, where one can sometimes feel the real emotions within the poems. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys poems, and is looking for poems that can be used alongside those poems of the great poets such as Robert Frost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Tongue","review":"Mother Tongue: A Broken Hungarian Love Song by Peter Hargitai is a collection of poems based on the author's life. Through these poems you feel all of his emotions that he kept to himself, but was able to express them through writing. He used writing as his healing process, an outlet for all the thoughts he had stored up inside of him. The poem \\"Mother's Racist\\" was a very shocking poem. It tells you how racist his mother was and how she made that known to her son. The book is full of raw poetry that can be frightening at times, along with his word choice which show his hate and anger mostly toward his mother, but once you get to know his background they become clearer and it allows you to understand where all his emotions come from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom and 5 year old loved the movie","review":"I rented this movie.

I find it absolutely AMAZING that the photographers found two separate species at birth that come together in a specific life or death struggle against each other...years later.

There is a lot of noise & grain throughout the movie which detracts from what detail there is.3. It's a documentary, but I question the validity of the material presented.

Not recommended for dads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Bought this for my wife for Christmas and spent time pre-loading photos only to have the keychain break and the frame got lost within 2 weeks!

I can't even return it because when it broke it got lost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"Got it for Christmas, software was easy to load and pictures are easy to download to keychain.

No answer at Tao customer service. I returned the first one to Amazon, who graciously overnighted another in time for Christmas at no cost.

Thanks to Amazon for easy returns because I have a feeling that I would never see my money again if I bought directly from TAO. And oh another thing, I have a sneaky suspicion that the positive reviews that this junk receives come directly from the TAO marketing team. Look into it Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...multiple failures","review":"I purchased four of these for Christmas, and 3 of the 4 tested so far do not work out of the box...the displays are gray and washed out, and the units only work when plugged in.

Did run on AC, but not on the battery. Colors were pretty washed out anyway and lines running through it. I know it's more of a cheap, novelty, but the quality was even poorer than I expected.

As for myself, I found the graphic design very confusing: the point of view shifts with every word, from hands alone, to face, to head and above, to chest, as well as from the side to the front.Furthermore, the book is most useful to learn Signed English (or as this book calls it, Pidgin Sign English). I am more interested in learning American Sign Language, because I have an interest in the grammatical structure of other languages and because it's a more dominant form of communication between deaf persons.The information content is dense and presented in complete sentences, so if you can get past the graphic presentation and if learning ASL isn't important to you, this could be a good book for your purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for learning ASL","review":"This is definitely not a book I would ever recommend for teaching or learning ASL!

Here is someone joking about American and English culture in a way that seems sharp, but is really so smooth it offends nobody (I assume. I'm not British or American, so I'm just guessing). I love it. It's most educational. I especially like the part where he describes M. Thatcher and the way she treats American senators. Ah yes, what a woman! Towards the end, he describes his fall from grace with the American president. It was kind of glossed over, but since I was expecting nothing of the kind from the former ambassador to London, it seemed to be fairly honest bitterness. Overall, I really liked this book. It was funny, and it was a glimpse into the lives of the privileged. Nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good!!","review":"I have had several detectors but this one picks up radar siginals before you can find the police.

On its own, I wouldn't particularly like the color scheme, but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield. I can't believe they'd think this was a good idea.For some reason, I was getting false laser alerts like crazy -- empty subdivisions, on the expressway without a police car in sight, parking lots... At first, I thought my phone might be interfering with the detector, but I was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off.I'd expect this with a Cobra detector that cost half as much, but this is pretty terrible.

After using this product for the first week and passing by police cars almost twice a day and nothing going off, i came to the conclusion thag i haf a defect. So i sent it back and they replaced it with a brand new one but still after continueously passing up cop cars and even messing with settings, i came to the convlusion that the beltronivs v995 is not a \\"police scanner\\" but rather a store alarm scanner..

I did get the same unit back that I had sent in.Though I am content with the radar detector's performance I feel that I was forced to pay too much for repairs too soon after purchasing the item. It is not a cheap instrument. I paid aprox $150+ for it and could not afford to replace it when it broke.I think Beltronics should be more reasonable with repairs that are not the fault of the owner.

I own this unit since 2008. In the first year it was repaired three times, for three different issues, under warranty. I asked Beltronics to provide a replacement unit, since this one seems quite problematic, but they refused. In 2010 the unit started with a fourth problem, intermittently turning itself off and on. This could be one bad unit, but others on amazon seem to have quality issues as well, and Beltronics did not replace it after three in-warranty repairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!

One month later the detector stopped working and would not turn on. I verified it was not the power source or the cable; the unit was receiving power but would not turn on. Well I wasn't too happy but I knew it was covered by a 1 Year warranty. I called up Beltronics only to find out that they DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY CLAIMS for products purchased from Amazon.com!!! Even worse, they wanted $79.99 + shipping to fix the unit. Needless-to-say, I find their level of customer service inadequate and disconcerting given the volume of product they sell through this site.

The one con I have is when you turn the volume down on it it still comes across as loud and then after a few chirps ti will return to the volume setting that I had it on, don't know why it does it, it can be a little annoying.

My advice to someone that is not familiar with radar detecting is, If you are being picked up by a chp coming at you slow down don't waste time. It didn't come with the smart cord that amazon claimed it did. I really don't have a problem with the cord it came with so it doesn't bother me. I also advise disconnecting the power cord when not in use and plug it in after your car is started. My Mercedes did some weird things when I started it and the radar detector was plugged into power.

When it played out, I looked for a utilitarian replacement at a fair price. I bought two of these V955s, one for my car and one for my wife's car. While the default settings were very obtrusive, loud both in audio and LED display, after some setting adjustments, they now are as much a part of my instrument array as is my speedometer. I like that the audio auto-diminishes after the first alert. I can glance at the visual display to see the radar signal strength; I do not need a blaring noise to remind me that I am being scanned. Still, these detectors have a wide array of settings, so they should serve everyone's taste. They also alert me to every speed trap with very few false positives."},{"rating":"2","title":"bel v955 vector","review":"works great for the price. there hasnt been a situation where it has saved me from a ticket yet but i have picked up Ka signals long before i saw the cop. only downside is it has random laser alerts such as in a residential area. i havent been able figure out whats setting it off but it seems to go off more at night. and i know there is only 1 undercover officer in the area that uses lidar. overall great product, id recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"Firstly, this is a great device. Secondly, this device needs to be reviewed in context. Of course this is not a Valentine, it is only $140! With that said, it's a great buy for the price.

That was 10 for the wire and 35 for the install. Overall, my confidence in speeding has risen. I now average about 13 MPH over the limit. The warnings come with enough time to slow down, but the driver has to be paying attention. There are a great amount of false alarms, but these are low level warnings and you come to learn them.

I couldn't wait to get another Bel, but this one is worse than that old cheap one. Sorry I threw it out the day the Bel came. This was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Laser Alarms in Sun","review":"This radar detector gave me false alarms for laser when I was driving toward the sun. It is very bad early in the morning or in the evening as the sun is near the horizon. I returned it and got a replacement... same problem. False laser alarms which are very annoying.I also have the V995. This is a much better model. I don't get nearly as many false alarms (laser or radar) with this model. In addition, you can turn X band off (I haven't seen a cop use x band in 10 years) on the V995 while still leaving it set to highway. Thus you get the best detection ability with minimum false alarms."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"This is by far the worst detector I have ever had.Does not detect even close signals.

Others work also but Autoscan is bestGuys i recommend this detector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent detector for under $150","review":"I recently bought the Bell V955 and must say it works excellent for the price. Yes, you can find ones with more features and questionable longer range, But not anywhere near $150.00. My only complaint is the voice announce of the radar band, which is quite annoying. Thankfully, I found you can turn it off. Buy this if you want a inexpensive, quality detector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable at best.","review":"I bought the unit to replace a 40 dollar Cobra unit that failed after a year. Tested the unit with a 2000 mile road trip right off the bat, and have been using it in the city for the last month.1. The range is poor, I would say no more than 1000 yards when set on highway, even less when set to auto detect. At any rate it doesn't inspire confidence as it generally doesn't pick up a speed trap until maybe a second before it is in view.2. The window mount is ok, not great, and the power cord is short and coiled, very overt.Overall I regret buying it, poor performer compared to my old Cobra and cost 3x as much. I would have been better of buying a new 40 dollar unit every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Ok......","review":"Worked great for a few weeks but out of no were it stoped picking up K and X bands and it only detects LAZIER now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beltronics...Juck radar detector.","review":"Got 3 tickets with this detector, not because I didn't react quick enough...because the detector didn't even detect the radar and didn't do its job. Don't waste your money! The first one I returned due to calibration failure. That one got me a ticket. The second detector...the officer said he got me with Lazer. That didn't work either. 2 detectors...2 tickets, you make the call.

Unfortunately, in the Texas heat, these detectors do not work at all. One would not do anything unless I brought it in out of the car and put it into the house to cool off. The other detector would just beep erroneously, even parked in my driveway. Beltronics answer to this was not to put them in the car windshield when it is hot. Duh, I guess in Texas I can only use it 2 months out of the year. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price Value equation is right on","review":"I bought this detector to mount to a Honda 599 motorcycle for the most part. It performs flawlessly when detecting radar but often falses on X band when encountering alarm systems. If you ride uphill into the setting sun it also falses for laser alert. I'm not sure if the more expensive detectors false less but you can usually tell if it's a false alert depending on the band. If it's KA band they are using instant on further ahead and you should slow down. I'm not sure what you are gaining by going with the $300 plus models."},{"rating":"2","title":"radar","review":"Got it for the girl friend who loves it took it out for a test and found alot of smoky's hiding places,worked very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not send product","review":"Hydrofarm failed to ship the product.

The bulb didn't just die mind you, nope, the cheap fixture with loose fittings allowed the bulb housing to rotate and loosen further.

I'd bother asking for a replacement only - now that I'm reading the reviews for the actual bulb - it's a quality issue & the replacements don't last, either.

When I contacted Hydrofarm to claim under the guarantee, their initial position was that the bulbs were from a defective batch, so all they'd do is \\"replace\\" them--but with a different product.After some back and forth they are sending me new set of Dayspots, allegedly a new and improved version. I'm looking forward to finding out of the improvements are real, because my plants loved the first set of bulbs (while they worked).Update: One of the replacement bulbs burned out after 12 days.

It moves very quickly, even in the introduction of the move. She does it slowly one time and then moves into doing it quickly. It is NOT for beginners.

It's not as though Afroman has had any other singles out since last summer...kind of like another one-hit wonder. Afroman is an okay rapper, but I wish he'd write more intelligent songs...something that people could take him seriously by. Plus, they played this on the radio so much that it's gotten very annoying! All Afroman raps about on his album, 'The Good Times', are drugs, drinking, sex, and violence. A very crude album and song.

Unfortunately, I didn't know there was a warranty, and I recycled my receipt after about 30 days, and they need a dated receipt to fix it.

I, like other viewers, did my research too late. If I had read more of the reviews on Coby products, I probably would not have purchased anything from them.

Not worth the problems!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't ask for more for its price...maybe a bit more","review":"Good product. the feature set in this for its price is amazing. the down side to this item is that it comes with a really gawky headset. and if you plan on watching a movie on it be prepare to have the battery go dead on you real quick. as an MP3 player and a USB storage this works great. id recommend you buy this. it looks nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made. Not sure how it passed QC","review":"This is one of the worst mp3 players I have seen. The first unit I purchased arrived doa. The replacement worked, but the battery only holds a charge of about 10 minutes (appx length of 3 songs). The second unit that I had purchased at the same time works while plugged into a computer, but will not hold a charge at all.The touch pad is a nice feature but only works about half the time. However, this is just \\"glitter & effects\\" to mask how poorly made this mp3 player is. I made the mistake of researching this brand after purchasing it and it seems that there is definitely a problem with their batteries, among other things. I would recommend purchasing another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent sound but poor design","review":"decent sound but poor design. sometimes you need a pin to reset it. sometimes some songs are skipped with no reason. anyway it has a decent sound, better than sandisk sansa."},{"rating":"2","title":"best overall album from Therapy? since troublegum","review":"I had high expectations from the boys from Ireland when I heard this album was coming out. I was not let down. This is the most solid album they have released in years. Suicide Pact had some [poor] songs on it, and lets face it, tramline and the boy's asleep are downright awful songs that keep semi-detached from being perfect. Not since troublegum has an album this good been released. It has no [lousy] songs on it. Every song is solid, although there are a few that are just run of the mill therapy? and don't really impress me much. Andy and company have given up trying to please the mainstream, and are making whatever they want to. Considering most of their fans are diehard(aka people like me), we are no longer surprised by anything they do. Everything is a new and original work. This album impresses me for it's diversity. Overall, this is the best album from the best band nobody has ever heard in years, and will be hard to top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapy? provides the rock like no other","review":"Therapy? reorganizes after a slightly disorganized album (Suicide Pact- You First) to deliver a pretty straight forward rock album. The thing is, they know how rock should be and they deliver here. With their slightly off brand of humor and ability to create some interesting melodies this album just is plain great. One of the most underrated bands in the world deliver again. When will these guys be huge? SOOOOOON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this album","review":"While I like Frank Chacksfield, and had several of his ablums on old 33.3 RPM records, this album (CD) was a disapointment because most of the songs were not his usual recognizable hits. Several other available (on Amazon) albums of his contain many long time favorites, and I would recomend them instead. There is nothing wrong with the album, just the music was not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dry","review":"It started out pretty good but then got boring. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. The cover made it look like it would be a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parallel to Old Testament Falls Short","review":"The topic of angels in Venice, presented on this fascinating book cover immediately grabbed my attention. I was also intrigued by the parallels drawn between this story and the Old Testament book, Tobias. However, although the writer was faithful to the Bible throughout most of this novel, she eventually lost the innocence of the Bible story, paricularly at the end of her book. I will never understand why writers, such as Ms. Vickers insist on sullying such innocence with unnecessary nudity and voyerism."},{"rating":"1","title":"One can do better elsewhere","review":"It is terribly misleading to categorize this book as insightful about Venice. It really offers very little substantive information about the city. Other than the storyline revolving around a stone carving that happens to be in Venice, the story could as well be sitused in any other city. If one wishes to learn of the charm of Venice, try The World of Venice by Jan Morris or Venice for Pleasure by J.G. Links. The only interesting element of the book is its focus on an ancient folktale and its inter-weaving with a current repetition of the same story. While the author may deserve some credit for this inter-weaving, the characters are generally so one-dimensional and the dialogue in places so trite that it is difficult to see the novel through to its finish. For one seeking the same type of structure, read Possession by A.S. Byatt to see what a truly creative and professional writer can accomplish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I read \\"Instances of the Number 3\\" by Vickers before I read this book. I thought maybe \\"Miss Garnet's\\" wouldn't be as good, but I was wrong! The interweaving of the two stories is well done and the shift from the one to the other does not interupt the flow. If you haven't \\"discovered\\" this author yet, you have a treat in store. I recommend her books highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raphael, the angel and Miss Julia, the teacher","review":"I read this novel with the Book of Tobit in my Oxford Bible beside me. The other novel that I'd done this with was On the Road with the Archangel by Frederick Buechner. I'd suggest that to readers also. Miss Julia's Angel was well written but not nearly as well done as Possession which several reviewers have compared it to. I found some of the parts about Tobe and Sarah to be confusing and not much in line with the Aprocrophal book. And their wedding really didn't make sense to me. I read the novel in one day so I really did enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The world is a shopping mall.","review":"The book is written in rhyme with a cadence closely resembling \\"One, two, buckle my shoe.\\" It protrays a happy girl's life (Barbi's) revolving entirely around shopping, getting dressed and going out with boys. Ken has the presence of a manikin. There are many children's book that teach counting through rhyme and rhythm. Most that I have seen are more substantive, more human, and more fun than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of postpartum needs","review":"As a new mom and as a therapist specializing in postpartum issues, I highly recommend this book. It's an excellent resource for families expecting a baby, covering important topics such as postpartum depression and anxiety, building a support network, and how to plan for the postpartum period in order to make a smooth transition into parenthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly graceful history","review":"Jonathan Spence's approach here is so effortlessly engaging, so like a work of historically informed fiction, that you can easily lose sight of just how responsible and convincing it is at the same time. Framing the book with Ricci's own mnemonic imagery gives Spence a complex but perfectly coherent lens through which to write. Spence deftly allows Ricci's own images to define the scope of the narrative as well, so he isn't burdened with scholarly asides attempting to fill in the gaps with a general history.This is a book of simple genius. I've reviewed several books on Amazon, and seldom given a five star rating. This wonderful book rates a five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible insights into the art of memory.","review":"This book is worth reading for the account of Ricci's memory system alone. The way the Jesuits used the power of the sensory imagination to remember texts or chinese characters is inspirational. Spence explains the secrets of creating such a system, though this ain't no self-help book. But more interesting still was the way that Ricci used his imaginative interpretations of chinese pictograms to convey Christian images and ideas to the Chinese; and the way that he performed memory feats to impress and gain access to high chinese circles for his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matters of great moment","review":"Spence's masterfully written book, a touching story of one man's devotion to a cause greater than himself, is a must read for all historians, especially those who want to learn more about the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, and their missions around the world. \\"The Memory Palace\\" is engaging--it reads like a mystery novel. I was unable to put it down until I was done for the book was an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biography? History? Memory Improvement?","review":"Jonathan D. Spence has written a book which can fall into a number of categories. On one level, it is a biography of a Jesuit who worked as a missionary in China during the Post-Reformation period. On another, it is an examination of his remarkable memory. On yet another, it vividly describes the China of this era and the efforts to bring Christianity to this closed society. The structure of the book is unusual for the genre, but is surprisingly successful. Ultimately, the book becomes a sort of psycho-historical account of a most remarkable man in a most remarkable place in a most remarkable time. Images from this book will linger in your mind for some time to come. Recommended for those interested in religious history, missions, the Jesuits, China, or artificial memory. A more technical companion piece is Francis Yates' _The Art of Memory_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Train of Consciousness...","review":"This book had some wonderful nuggets about Ricci and China, but there were so many tangents and mind-numbing details that it was challenging to read. The main issue is that the book is thematic in nature rather than chronological. On one page Spence is talking in detail about China in 1582 and the next he's talking in detail about Portugal in 1567. He flips back and forth across the decades and the continents enough that it's very difficult to get a picture of Ricci's life. A lot of Spence's content seems pulled from history books on Europe, having little or nothing to do with either Ricci or China. If you want a random, panoramic view of life in the late 1500's this book is for you. If you're looking for a comprehensive, orderly look at Ricci or China or his memory system you may be disappointed. It's worth the read, but with appropriate expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would tell the story of how Matteo Ricci got to present Christianity to the very top echelons of China: how he got to China in the first place, the imaginative ways in which he presented Christ to the Chinese, and the reactions of others - both Christian and non-Christian - to his preaching and his accomplishments. As it is, the story presented in this book covers only a few of these topics, and then in no logical order. I just don't think that what is undoubtedly a fascinating story is well told! I don't recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room 101","review":"Gregory MacNamee's average mind is very annoying, this book is about a precursor of PSYOPS the \\"psychological operations\\" of the U.S. military and Madison Avenue.

If you like getting fancy with your train setups, these are a reasonably priced and fun addition.

I removed the Tool Set box from the bag, suspiciously, to find that the case as well as the impact tool itself were clearly in \\"USED\\" condition....far from new. Smudges, scrapes and dirt could be seen everywhere, inside and out. To confirm the fact that I was not receiving a \\"NEW\\" item, the 3/8\\" drive bit holder (which is a separate peice that mounts on the wrench) was not even present in the box.

Only reason I am giving \\"4\\" stars instead of \\"5\\" is because adjusting the work platform to the \\"right\\" height can be a hassle since the individual \\"guesses\\" the right height, climbs on the ladder, stands on the platform, and then determines if the platform needs to move up or down in height."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product!!!!!!!","review":"First of all, this product is compatible with only little giant ladder, not with the other brand, which are usually a lot cheaper.With their suggestion that this one is compatible with the other brand, I bought, but found out it's not safe with other brand.

A beautiful keepsake that seems to do justice to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"exhilerating","review":"The book is well written, easy reading, and most of all enjoyable as a novel about four relationships that go through trials, pain, love, and emotional challenges that we as normal people have possibly experienced in our own lives. I guess this is what touched me the most about the book of which I read after seeing the wonderful movie first. The reading only made the story better, for one, the book itself caries your imagination further into the emotional depths of the characters of Annie, her daughter, Robert, Tom Booker, and the horse. Much Deeper. Once you begin to read this novel you will not want to put it down. The best book I have read in many years. Go for it, the book will bring out your own feelings, emotions, and caring for whatever or whoever your love lies with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect blisters and painful experience","review":"This shoe peeled my heel's skin off and it gives me blisters.

The album begins with a fun, danceable pop song in pure late sixties style, \\"Comment te dire adieu\\". Afterwards, Hardy veers to slower songs, making beautiful renditions of Leonard Cohen's \\"Suzanne\\", Georges Brassens' classic \\"Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux\\" (A mas-ter-piece, with incredible piano arrangements) and Jobim's bossa nova \\"Sabiá\\" (in French \\"Le mésange\\"), as well as singing a couple of very sweet own compositions, \\"A quoi a sert?\\" and \\"La mer, les étoiles et le vent\\", which demonstrate her talent as a songwriter.

Perhaps, but this was the wrong starting point. Kit I purchased relies on aeration alone to get water and nutrients to the seedlings. No drip irrigation was included. Now I know you really need that. Clay pebbles were too large to cover the seedling w/o damage and did not absorb water. Pump was very noisy and the drain worked until you attempted to lower it into a position to drain the water, at which point it leaked.

The lid is dripping condensate which can not be fixed.4. The pots are to tall like some one else mentioned. I had to buy some rope and make wicks..5. The pump is loud.

Instead, I was disgusted to find most of the decorative themes could best be described as industrial. One suggested setup had a tank with eggbeaters stuck into the gravel, instead of plants! Others are just as attrocious. If you want a book about aquariums with style, buy any of Amano's _Nature Aquarium World_ series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, Imaginative, but Some Dangerous Ideas Too","review":"I gave this book 4 stars to reflect the authors imaginative approach and his originality. There are some truly beautiful aquariums represented in this book.The dangerous ideas all fall under the category of placing unsafe (for the fish) items in the tank. The author glosses over the precautions which must be taken for many of the items, such as metal objects and sedimentary rocks.However, I was truly inspired by the fossil aquarium design, and have created an improved version myself. I DID have to coat the limestone fossil plates with aquarium-safe marine epoxy, but the results were spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful ideas","review":"Many aquarists have already reviewed this book in great detail, so I'll skip that part and just say that this is a truly inspiring book. The aquariums in this book are themed aquariums, some just fun using bird and hamster toys as the decor and there is one beautiful tank that is monochromatic, all the substrate is white as well as all the decor with blue colored fish.There are also several river system setups as well as pool setups. And this book shows you step-by-step how the achieve each display including appropriate fish species.I have adapted five of the tank setups for my own aquariums systems and they are beautiful and thriving. This is a magnificent book for the beginner as well as a more experienced aquarist. I highly recommend this.

The final story arc on this volume does manage to provide an interesting spark with the new character but with how easily and haphazardly the series moved past the last two story arcs, it seems easy to predict that this one won't get much better treatment on volume three.

Clara is bothered by the vague feeling that there is more to life than she has. Her mother is about to embark on husband number four, she bungles an important interview, and she is confronted by the body that has aged and borne two children. She tries to engage her husband in serious conversation about their marriage and love life. She tries to keep her two boys from killing each other, or just saying something too wildly inappropiate. She has a real life. Never whining, or morose, our Clara forges on, and discovers she still has plenty to offer. India Knight makes Clara and her life come alive with very believable dialog,( the book is worth a read just to experience Sammy, the two year old or the bikini wax appointment)and laugh out loud moments. I really enjoyed this book, found it a jolly good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just hilarious","review":"A hilarious book, and not just for mothers and wives. I read it in one sitting.

Anyway, this story about Claire's life and her attempts to balance her marriage, children, and career rings very true and doesn't resort to cliches or whiny behavior on her part. It gets major points for unpredictability as well. I especially loved \\"What would Madonna do?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"My Life on A Plate","review":"One star was generous! The author spent 204 pages building a character, 3 pages ripping apart and the ending was so up in the air-did she finish writing the book or did she go out for coffee and forgot to finish?

I am no prude, but I am already sick of Clara's references to number two, and farting. She is extremely petty, judgemental and shallow. So far, I haven't been able to identify any redeeming qualities in Clara that will make the book worth finishing. Frankly, I can see why her husband has tuned her out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I expected to love this book. I am a big fan of Bridget Jones, etc. and thought that this book would be a similar, fun read - only even better because it was about a married woman.Unfortunately, I was wrong. I found the book boring. I also didn't care to read about Clara's husband's secretive bathroom habits, her children's nits, etc. At times the book seemed senselessly crude.Bottom line: A total waste of time.For a FUN read, try ASKING FOR TROUBLE by Elizabeth Young, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off-not labeled correctly","review":"The product information was not helpful-it turned out to be only volume 2 out of 3 volume set.Returned to Amazon-nice as always-so just waiting for my refund.We will never buy another OCR book-you don't know what you are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faerie Tale Theatre on DVD!","review":"After years of waiting, Faerie Tale Theatre fans can finally own the series on DVD.

I have tons and tons of ideas, but you can never have too many. I definitely agree with the other reviewer who said to check out the book before buying it- because like her, I didn't care for the book AT ALL- I actually HATED it! In all honesty, it was a book of crap- they did nothing with the finds to make them more appealing (they are ugly) and it still looks like crap in their house next to all the other garbage they got from flea markets. I didn't bother reading any of the text because the pictures spoke 1,000 horrible words.I love the better homes and gardens magazines called \\"100 decorating ideas under $100\\".

I am glad I checked it out of the library before I bought it. It went a little to over the top on the shabby chic/flea market look for me not very elegant. The pictures are good because of professional photos but I bet if you were in a home filled with some of this stuff it could end up looking a little too flea-ish. Check it out first at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I should have checked this out at a bookstore before I ordered it - I saw the 5 stars and went by that.This book has nothing new to offer.

I come from an Italian family, my parents from Italy and the only subject I could mildly relate to with any humor was the Italian funeral. I wonder what she was thinking writing this book and who ever critqued it and told her it was any good at all? She babbles on about nonsense and who give a darn about any of the subjects.

I realize that she is almost 70 and probably feels she is entitled to act the way she wants, but this book reads like it was written in one hour. I usually pass books to my friends to keep them in circulation, but I am burning this book in the fireplace this winter. Making fun of funerals?

It must weigh in around 20 pounds..I don't remember, but it's big. The cable is, I believe, 3/8\\" (maybe 5/16\\"), and the handle uses compound leverage to obtain the required amount of force necessary for the 3 ton capacity. It has a relatively short length of cable. The use of a snatch/pulley to double the pulling force, as can be used on smaller pullers, probably wouldn't be used with this, unless you're pulling a house off it's foundation. It works quite well, although somewhat stiff (maybe just new), and the retrieval rate is somewhat slow. It is very well built (Maasdam is), and will last a lifetime. Not something you would have in your trunk for emergencies, unless you didn't want much of anything else in there as well. An excellent puller for the big big jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"First item was defective. Amazon replaced immediately. Second Maasdam 600S arrived within a few days. Problem with this cable puller is it only pulls in cable one click at at time. Spoke with manufacturer to ask about this issue, the response is that this model only ratchets 1\\" at a time. Even though you swing the handle at full rotation, the drum only catches one knotch link. Bear in mind that pulling in line will take many wasteful and time consuming swings, let alone you will be exhausted by just pulling in a few feet of line.Did I mention how heavy this brute is. Returned item immediately and found a much better replacement for a similar price.

I bought it because my three-year olds love to watch Irish dancing, but there was so much talking and singing that we all grew bored and turned it off. I never got to the part about Flatley's ego. The only advantage to the spliced dance numbers is that you get to see how ridiculous Flatley looks with his shirt open to his navel, as compared to the other male leads. Overall, don't bother with this unless you have everything else made by Riverdance and you need that one CD more."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I had high hopes on this and was very disappointed after watching the pieces.

It was well put-together. Other buyers have complained that the narration by female lead Jean Butler upsets the flow but that's certainly not the case. It's not like she's talking during the numbers. She's there to introduce the clips from the show and provide some background on them. Her part in this dvd is quite necessary. In addition, her behind-the-scenes insight proves to be interesting.It's hard to believe it's been 10 years since the show's inception.

I had to get more of it. So I ordered these 2 DVD. I put \\"The Best of...\\" in my DVD player and all I got was the music, no picture. My unit plays every kind of DVD, including dts. I thought it was my TV, but then it played every other DVD I put in. I tried the DVD on two other TV/DVD compo TVs. Neither of them could even play the DVD.

I will take both books along with me as I will go back 6 January, 2002, to take turn to be with her for a period of time. I felt I got to be educated about this desease before I would be of any help.As we left she was already committed in the hospital in Los Angeles. She is willing to be helped.One thing though, I wish Bob Wilson would have been a woman, because I read, there can also be Hormonal Disorders. But then I thought the 3 steps are all the same in either case.Wish me and her the best. I believe your book will help her and me. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winning the Battle?","review":"I found this book misleading, it makes the reader believe that Bipolar Disorder is easy to cure if you follow a few simple steps. For those of us, who have close relatives who suffer the disease and have to endure it, this book is an insult. Where is the maelstrom where the whole family is thrown during the manic pahses? Where is the dispair of the patient during the depressive periods? Where is the fight to convince the patient, who is either a god or scum, to seek help? There is nothing \\"romantic\\" in this illness, bad wheather brings depression, good whether brings mania, with short intervals in between. And the solution is not around the corner for everyone.This comment is also a criticism to the lack of responsibility of the editors, who chose to publish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Needed","review":"This book really made me realize that my symptoms and behavior related to my depression are not my fault. It also made me see that I am following the correct path toward getting well, and that is comforting. Plus, it taught me that it may not be easy, but finding a solution is possible, and you don't have to be a doctor to understand this illness.I can't believe anyone would write anything negative about this book because it brought me such hope for my future. Don't listen to anyone who is so pessimistic about life that they can't appreciate the value of a simple, yet powerful, message of hope. This Is A Great Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty basic","review":"This is an educational book that provides the basic information of bipolar. It is very easy read.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and comprehendably put.","review":"This book helped me in many ways. Although, I had to fight at the bad things inside of me, I survived and feel so much better about myself. I've been through bipolar disorder for 8 years now and while they were trying to find a treatment for me throught the last year, I read this book and bought it over then internet and it helped me cope with my troubles. I'd give this 5 stars for many reasons and one reason would be because I have read many books in the past and this one would be the most easy to read and understand at the same time.I am very greatful that I found this book for I have no idea what I would have done without some of these books...but especially this book. Thank you Bob Olson for your experience and inteligence in writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree nothing new here","review":"recently diagnosed bipolar I started reading all the books I could get my hands on. This book really offered me nothing. He kept talking about steps but, when you're stuck way deep in a depression some just can't take those steps, and the same is true if you're on a manic high..I do have a question though...if he was so depressed how was it that he could get up, take his wife to work, go back and get her for lunch, then go back to pick her up after she got off. when I'm depressed I can't even take my daughter to school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, egocentric, poorly written","review":"My prior review of this book was more current than many included here, but is now missing. Perhaps negative reviews of books hurts sales for Amazon.com.? Also, the \\"editorial reviews\\" for this book were written by the author and the publisher. Real objective! By the way, it was the correct medicine that cured Olson's depression, not \\"his steps.\\" He says so himself in the book. Incidently, I've suffered from severe depression for five years, and I know the difference the right medication can make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not truly new information","review":"The message of the book, to keep persevering no matter what, is not new. Nor does he address the point of fact about bi-polar people tend to stop taking their medications when they feel better, which has nothing to do with perseverance.Also, his arrogance is astounding. It's as if he says, \\"I did it, so you should be able to as well!\\" Bully for him! It's called bi-polar disorder and sometimes the disease manifests itself in such a way that what he touts in his book is not immediately possible"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK FOR THE YOUNG READER ON THE AMAZON","review":"This book is aimed at giving a brief picture of the Amazon to a young reader. It focuses on a few aspects, such as: the indians living in the Amazon, the gold rush around the southern Amazon, the river and its dolphins, and the rubber boom and the railroad built to transport rubber.The book is written as a travelogue, describing the author's trip chronologically. It is simplistic, of course, as any book for children should be, but it provides some vivid pictures of the region. About half of the pictures are very good, the rest should have been reconsidered.My main criticism is that he associates the colonists as being evil doers destroying the forest; it is hardly ever an evil vs good fight. Anyways, I would recommend it especially to a family with children planning a trip to the Amazon as a way to wet the appetite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other china adoption books","review":"My daughter really did not get this one.

Very sensitive portral of abandonment and adoption issues for a young child. My grandaughter loved it. Hard to read without getting a lump in your throat though."},{"rating":"2","title":"More top quality melodic hard rock","review":"Westworld is a melodic hard rock project featuring TNT vocalist Tony Harnell, Riot guitarist Mark Reale, and Danger Danger bassist Bruno Ravel. Given the players involved, you can pretty much guess the kind of music Westworld has to offer.Much like the band's debut, Skin is first-class melodic hard rock album. Tony Harnell's very distinctive voice dominates the album, which is a good thing since he continues to improve with each album. Skin edges a bit more towards metal than its predecessor, but remains a very melodic album. The album's surprise is the inclusion of a cover version of the Alanis Morissette hit Uninvited, which oddly enough seems perfect for Tony Harnell's vocal style.TNT, Riot, and Danger Danger fans should eat this one up. It's one of the best modern AOR/melodic hard rock albums out there. Westworld's self-titled album andCyberdreamsare just as good, as is Tony Harnell's latest projectStarbreaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"hidden delight","review":"Just a note for those of you who know the album as it was : the extra track 'Godspeed' is even better than the original songs. Really really excellent bonus if you've worn out the vinyl original."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Patti Smith I've Listened To, and It's Pretty Good","review":"This is the first Patti Smith album I've listened to and it's pretty good. Because the Night is a really good version of course, and I still like the power that song has. Other versions I've heard our so obviously an attempt to imitate this one, so why not go with the original. I also really like the song Ghost Dance. It's very soulful and has a lot of feeling to it. Overall this album has enough variety to be interesting, but all of it seems to be very good at evoking emotions within me which makes it a truly loveable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme A Break","review":"So I hear Patti Smith is the forerunner to such female vocalist/musician/poets as Ani DiFranco, PJ Harvey and Liz Phair - all I can say is Vive Evolution! I'd take any of those three exceptional artists over Patti Smith any day.I'm glad I didn't waste my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Patti Smith Album","review":"I really dig this album. Patti explores some Biblical themes here and there, or to put it in another way, she explores the language and the atmosphere of the sacred writing, quoting the 23rd Psalm in one place, and toying with certain values in the laying down of her words. It's not as stark or as sweaty as \\"Horses\\", though it is well worth having, I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant surprise","review":"some very strong tracks, worth buying. early mats sound, but i also here some cheap trick and other various influences. whos going to burn down the house, stay away, and crazy anymore burn.for a first release, it doesnt get much better than this and i highly recommend this cd for those who miss that 80's indy sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several Hoodoos harmed in the making of this CD","review":"I rushed out to buy this after reading Entertainment Weekly's glowing review, which dropped all the references you'd want to hear -- Ramones, Chuck Berry, Johnny Thunders, Replacements, Cheap Trick.Sadly, the album is flat-out awful. Sure, it's jam-packed with musical nods to all of above, but this record is surprisingly devoid of any real hooks.It's really got an identity crisis. Is it power pop? Not melodic or catchy enough. Is it punk? Uh, no attitude. Does it rock? It's actually kinda wimpy. Loud guitars and over-production doesn't guarantee you that your band will ROCK.Maybe these guys are OK in concert, but this record is going nowhere. They're young, so they may very well improve in time.From track 1, I didn't like the album, but I really lost it when they butchered the Hoodoo Gurus' best song. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"is this it?","review":"There's a joke in New York City: who is the worst band? The Star Spangles have been around for years and have been obsessed with Johnny Thunders and The Ramones and the like. They revived the career of Leee Black Childers, because no one else was alive. They had to endure the popularity of The Strokes. Now two years later, they have finally released their first album. Now we have fifty new bands from NYC. Can we truly follow all of them? They have a more punk energy. They are The Heartbreakers as The Strokes are The Velvets. Their subject matter is more adolescent. Their sound is grittier. They cover a Thunder/Kramer song. They probably have more drugs addictions. Some groups play in New York City for years at the bottom of the bill at CBGB's and go nowhere. I have to admire The Star Spangles for getting out of the house a little bit. It's up to the girls of America and elsewhere to decide if they like them. Is this it? Another boy band?"},{"rating":"2","title":"southern California","review":"Not a bad track on this CD..Really, really good rock n roll..been waiting for something like this for a long time.Each track gets better and better. Hope these guys make it and stick around for a long time, hope they don't fade away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh man....","review":"this album is cool. How shall I explain this album. It is filled with pop songs that mostly sound the same from each other but are stripped down until they are nothing but vocals, a guitar onslaught, and amazing, amazing white noise. This album even goes further with The Velvet Underground's ideas that they founded and makes it a bit more glossier and beautiful. You can slightly sense more of The Velvet Underground with the lyrics, they are both dark and about drugs and dying. But it isn't completely devoid of songs with cheer in them. The album starts out with the amazing Just Like Honey and this sort set the playbook for the rest of the album. This album is practically flawless and you should buy this and let is set in, and you won't be let down at all, if it hits you right it will become one of your favorite albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Noise? Just great songs!","review":"Why you should bother: Most pop really sets me on edge. I get agitated, irritated and crankier than usual. A listen to Psycho Candy will set things right - I calm down, relax, all becomes well with the world.The songs: These are beautifully crafted pop songs, that are seemingly simple and yet very compelling. They make it look easy, almost, but not quite too easy.The sound: The J&MC have a great and distinctive sound. Real feedback, a sound that has been often imitated but never replicated. I can listen over and over again and get more out of that great sound! It adds complexity to the songs, but won't distract unless you let it.The recording: I saw their first US tour, I think it was '85 or '86. They were great. The sound and production of this CD do them justice.Can you take it?: There may be those who think the J&MC is noise. They probably don't get out much, perhaps even less than I do. So, if you haven't heard or just don't like any punk rock you may not get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's where MBV begins then...","review":"This is a great album, this is where shoegazing begins, this is the future...only MBV'Loveless sounds so fearless and timeless.You must feel something in your soul when you listen to \\"Just Like Honey\\", if you don't, you probably have no heart at all.I strongly recomend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"I just can't understand the low ratings this album gets. I remember buying this album as a teenage girl on vinyl, bought it on cassette, and then on CD. It was as relevant 20 years ago as it is today. I can still remember hearing \\"Psychocandy\\" for the first time and, man, it made me feel alive. Like they knew the secret to life and I had somehow discovered music for the first time. And I gotta tell you, I still feel like that 20 years later, every single time I listen to this record. Without a doubt, this is by far my favorite album of all time.A ton of bands today have ripped of J&MC;'s sound and I bet we all have a few of those albums in our collection. But you have to give J&MC; their dues. This is a BRILLIANT album and it's had a MAJOR influence on what we now call alternative music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Pressing","review":"The original master for this album contained, as my brother remarked, \\"...oceans of sound, rivers of noise.\\" That was in 1985, after listening to the 12\\" of \\"You Trip Me Up\\". I convinced a friend to buy the $13.95 British pressing of the album by insisting it would change his life. Nearly a year after the UK release of *Psychocandy*, Warner/Reprise released the \\"re-engineered\\" version. Warner's US release was a disgraceful butchering of J&MC's original. All the peaks were shaved off. Every valley was filled with silence. This innovative music was ablated and watered down like old soap...in the hands of some very unimaginitive sound engineers and a few completely misguided executives.The availability of this version is important, but not enough to balance the fact that this was not put on US vinyl in '85."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album ever?","review":"i bought this cd a while ago and its one of my absolute favourite albums along with nirvanas nevermind,pearl jams ten and mary chains darklands.the guitars are fuzzy and noisy, and with the reid brothers relaxed,cool(call it whatever you like)voices and lyrics this is got to be a fantastic album.the music are original,i have never heard something like this.this album is so cool. my favourite songs are in a hole,never understand and you trip me up.if youre a true mary chain fan this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great then, but. . .","review":"Back in the early days - before shoe gaze, these were the guys. The Hardest Walk debuted in the John Hughes film Pretty in Pink and kind of made this guys almost big when the song showed up on that best selling soundtrack. Sadly, they never had the legs of Echo and the Bunnymen or OMD - but this album is still a great piece of work. The most accessible of the J.A.M.C. albums - these guys knew how to write a song that had that \\"wall of noise\\" sound that defined the group. \\"Just Like Honey\\" is a gem and still sounds good, but it seems that their time has passed. While the kids today listen to \\"The White Stripes\\" and call it punk, its funny to see the bands that were trying something different in the 80s and managed to fall through the cracks. If you've been here before - its nice to revisit. If you haven't, its too late to start listening to this band - move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"I'll give credit to the Jesus and Mary Chain for coming up with something relatively novel in 1985. They combined early-60s melodies and song structures with crushing feedback, a la everybody's favorite name-check band, the Velvet Underground. OK, that's neat. Except that they repeated this concept song after song, again and again. In other words, this is a very repetitive album. Other than the memorable opening tune, Just Like Honey, the songs sound virtually the same. They did inspire My Bloody Valentine, one of my favorite bands, but MBV were much more creative in their shoegazing feedback, using different textures, whereas this album is just a sheet of noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outsiders View Inside","review":"heres 2 cents:I listened to 6-7 tracks from this band and i gotta say i would not get this CD, i think \\"Black Rebel Motorcycle Club\\" is way better than these guys despite having more or less cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs to be remastered!","review":"This album is probably one of the greatest ever made. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the production (at least on my cd copy) is too quiet. These guys were known for being one of the loudest bands around. They caused riots back in the '80s, but the sound quality doesn't show it. If they ever get around to remastering this highly influential album, I'll be first in line to buy it. I had to pay extra just to buy it, as it's no longer availabe in the states. As for the music, it's incredible. Velvet Underground-esque pop songs laced with the raunchiest distortion and feedback you're ever likely to hear. These guys were 10 times wilder and noisier than their predecessors, the Velvet Underground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, what can I say.....","review":"I bought this album when it came out. I'm 33 now and I still listen to it constantly, and NEVER get bored of it, or of any J&M Chain songs. I have all of their vinyl, still in pristine condition, and I will cherish their songs forever.All I have to do is listen to \\"Just Like Honey\\", and I am 14 again.They are the most underrated band on the planet, and thank God, because that is why we love them.

Pop songs with nails-on-chalkboard guitars. The guitars are all over the place, lots of echo, way up in the mix. The vocals sound good and the lyrics are about all the best stuff in life: girls and drugs. They could have been huge stars, the songs are ridiculously catchy. Maybe it was too abrasive to be a massive hit. If people were smarter that wouldn't matter.

I'll keep it short and sweet by telling you that you'd be better off buying the first three mythology sets (abduction, black oil and colinization)and skipping this one; it will save you a huge dissapointment. Aside from the fact that Mulder is only in the final episode of season 9 (the same goes for the minute and a half of total screen time we get to see the smoking man) this chapter of the mythology is a total let down. Very little is addressed regarding colinization and the the aliens; instead they focus the remainder of the mythology on the \\"super soldier\\" concept, which becomes very tiresome after about 2 episodes. What was Chris Carter thinking?! As I said previously, my advice is to watch the the first 3 sets and leave the this fourth \\"Super Soldiers\\" installment where it belongs - on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll go a step further than the other reviewers...

It really confirmed to me that all this time I was simply doing the best I could with the ways I new...which is absolutely true...and that there was a reason why all those normal methods didn't work. And better yet there is a way that works. The approach makes total sense. It's so easy and so powerful. This should be required reading for all new parents. Well, so much for my child's ADHD...It's disappeared and been replaced by this loving and cooperative child. They should make it required reading for all the doctors who prescribe medications ten minutes after meeting a child (like they did with mine) so that they can have another way to truly help children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift and easy to incorporate tips.....","review":"I bought this book for my little sister. Her son is 9, overweight and was born with an arm deformity, therefore teased alot by other kids. He is tempramental is extremely hard to manage.

I have the book version, but as a parent of a difficult child, we all know how hard it is to find the time to read a book. I thought the tape would be just the ticket. I could listen to it in the car on the way to work. Wrong!! The tape was aweful. The sound quality is so poor it is nearly impossible to hear in parts. Also, there was so little information in the tape. It didn't get any more in depth than reading the first chapter or two of the book and didn't deal at all with intervention. There are so many books out there that help us to understand our difficult children, but noone to say what helps! I would like to see an unabridged version of the book on tape!! That would be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Every Parent and Teacher","review":"This book absolutely transformed my relationship with my difficult teenager.

I've tried every child raising system I can find, and although some helped a bit, none worked long term, or showed continuous improvement. This approach, based on the concept of giving pizazz for the positive, and holding a child accountable (in a non-energy giving way) for misdeeds, really works for my son. It is a slow go, but worth the effort. Also see his website and discussion boards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"Finally I have found a method that makes a difference. My child has responded instantly to these strategies. The book truly makes the points so clearly and all the examples are perfect. Thank you for this book. I couldn't be more pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd been raised this way.","review":"Howard Glasser isn't really a miracle-worker, but his ideas appear magical when you start using them. He uses a behavior-modification approach that emphasizes the use of \\"relentless\\" positive attention (not vague or empty praise) to bolster the spirit of intense children. Once parents, or teachers, begin to see the change in their child's attitude sparked by their own change in attitude, they will be more likely to implement the rest of his program. It's not about ignoring or wishing away misbehavior, but about giving young people the power to choose for themselves how many privileges they want in their lives. Glasser has taught this approach in Tucson schools with remarkable success, and not just with the \\"problem\\" kids. I can vouch for this method with adult family members, friends and co-workers as well as with children. There is a good reason Glasser calls this \\"the nurtured heart\\" approach. Really, you'll wish you'd been raised this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time","review":"I was a little dubious about this book when it was suggested that I read it, but I respect the co-worker who suggested it and decided to give it a try. It is an informative and emotionally challenging read. The book offers a different perspective about parenting, without passing negative judgements as many subject-related books do. The most useful component of this book is that it suggests small changes and shifts in focus to help families support a child who struggles emotionally and socially. These small changes do bring some measure of peace for parents who have been struggling to help their children become productive and successful people in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busymomof4","review":"My oldest son is 17 and has been displaying defiant and baffling behavior since he was in 2nd grade. We have been to numerous counselors and psychologists, and no one could ever explain his behavior to me. He is an under-energized kid with Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and now in drug treatment. THANK YOU HOWARD GLASSER, for the first time I feel like I understand my kid and I have a direction to go in when he finishes treatment. I have three other children, who are not currently experiencing any difficulty, but are all highly energetic. My 4-yr old is eerily similar in lots of ways to his big brother. I am using the positive remarks and it has worked tremendously in the last few days to help reduce bad habits like screaming in the car, leaving the dinner table continuously, and ignoring directions.

It is hard to keep at for me, but it's harder to see him grumpy and miserable when this system is not in place. That being said he was not a complete terror when we started. My husband is in sales and they say, \\"Feed your eagles, starve your turkies!\\" That is exactly what this book perscribes. No parental attention for \\"turkey\\" behavior, but lots of \\"food\\" (parental recognition) for eagle behavior. As an added benefit, my daughter (10) now thinks her brother is pretty great too. Interesting how siblings take a parents point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most effective approach I've found!","review":"Howard Glasser's insight on what feeds a childs behavior has given me back my son! I was a parent at wit's end - dreading coming home at the end of the day. There were constant power struggles and \\"incidents\\" that made me want to runaway from home! But after reading \\"Transforming the Difficult Child\\" and later viewing the video, I found the motivation that caused my son to behave the way that he did. In the very first week of trying Dr. Glasser's method, I saw immediate improvement. Now I look forward to spending time with my son because I know how NOT to respond and discipline.This book is a must for any parent who finds that the 'traditional' discipline methods only make things worse. It's a loving, nurturing, and best of all, effective alternative that will net you results.

You can do just as well, if not better, with several other lower-priced database design books (e.g. Fleming and von Halle, Halpin, etc.).

I could not put the book down and will probably read it over and over. As the product of an alcoholic family growing up in the 50s and 60s, I emphathize with the signs, denial, guilt and despair. The actions and reactions depicted in the novel are truly true to life.

My pro said this is the worst system setup he's ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance","review":"I've had the unit in operation for about 3 weeks, with minimal impact on the humidity level in my house. Based on the size of the house, this unit should be more than adequate. However, using the humidistat as an indicator, the humidity level (the point at which the humidistat energizes the humidifier) is unchanged. The unit is operational, the filter is installed as instructed, and water flows from the drain, so I'm not sure why the poor performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell HE360A Whole House Powered Humidifier","review":"I wanted the humidifier to run any time the blower was on and decided to use a current sensing switch for an additional $35.

I have digital humudity meter in the house and with the Honeywell set to 60% we only get up to 33% in the winter. The house without the humidifier was around 25% humidity. We had a different system in our old house and when we turned that up to 60% it would fog the windows. The old system was an Aprilaire, but it was also a diferent type that got installed on the exhaust side of the furnace, the Honeywell installs in the ductwork before the furnace. I even ran hot water from the water heater to the Honeywell hoping it would evaporate faster, but I didn't see any changes in the humidity. If I had to do it over I would buy a unit that mounts on the exhaust side again. In the meantime I am back to running room humidifiers in the kids rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Computer Board issues","review":"Went through 3 units and each one had an issue with the motherboard and did not work.

The plot has an intriguing premise, with three unrelated events tied together. The opening sizzles with a beautiful woman thrown from a balcony in Hong Kong. The chapters also set up the plot quickly, with wife of CIA operations chief Carrie McNeil being interviewed after her husband Drum has disappeared.This novel runs at 370 pages yet the action could have been boiled down to about 100. Nothing really happens. Smith does a good job establishing the few characters there are in this novel, perhaps too good. Many pages ramble on and on about day to day activities of Carrie and her son Jonah and their life. Sure, the ending has some action and few \\"twists\\". But absolutely nothing happens before that. This book has a beginning and an end but no middle. I recommend this book to no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long for nothing","review":"I found that this book had a promising start, but then fizzled.

This album is nothing but pop crap with corny lyrics and dull strumming backed by electronice beeps and bops. Two OK songs: \\"Carvel\\" and \\"Song To Sing When I'm Lonely\\". To hear John at his best pick up the album TO RECORD ONLY WATER FOR TEN DAYS. Almost every song on that album is truely genius (see \\"Rampart\\" and \\"Murderers\\"). To Record Water For Only Ten Days is so good that when people heard Shadows they made themselves believe it is good even though it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"John delivers on a new frontier with this album","review":"Some have disputed whether or not John Frusciante is a genious or just a junkie being given too much credit because of his association with one of the biggest bands ever. This album sways from his usual experimental methodology and gives the listener something a little more concrete, without losing the artistic qualitiy that we have all come to know and respect from this solo artist with a conscience.One poigniant moment in the album comes with a track titled \\"Song to sing when I'm lonely\\", a heartbreaking tale of society's two-faced hidden agenda ways and the way each of us hides who we truly are.John Frusciante will forever be a shining example of what indie music should be and what someone can create if they get away from the same benign rut which the music scene seems to have fallen into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Wow, I've been a Frusciante fan for so long, and this album really let me down. As someone who has preferred John's solo work over the Chili Peppers through the years--even if an album yielded only one or two listenable tracks (e.g., Smile From The Streets That You Hold)--many of these new songs sound bland and uninteresting to me. For one thing, the production is completely different. Where previous albums were recorded entirely by John on home-recording equipment, this album was engineered in a studio, with live drums and more of a standard band sound. Sadly, the music in this format sounds homogenized and very average, including most of the guitar-work, strangely. The strength of the songwriting is undone by too much production--a striking contrast from the minimalism of prior albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry guy but this isn't that great","review":"I Love John Frusciante, but i hate people who use their love for J.F. as an excuse to love all his music. this CD is disapointing, i really did think that it would be good. there are many problem with it:1)the drums sound like a metronome2)everything has been so overly produced and digitalized that for most of the songs you can barely hear the musicthis sound like something John Frusciante threw together late at night on his computer and decided to produce itthere are however 3 very good songs (but ONLY 3!) and they are1)Carvel2)Song To Sing When Im Lonly3)The Slaughter"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn..........","review":"The trouble is with artists like John Frusciante is that they have a very loyal, cult following. Fans who will support them no matter what. I think this is what is going on here judging by the ridiculously generous reviews........ I also consider myself to be a big Frusciante fan but I also like to remain objective about the way I view his output.I haven't been this dissapointed with an album for a long time. It contains mediocre, boring songs that drag on and on and on and on.........I think John has got lost somewhere along the way in his quest for artistic fulfillment and experimentation; resulting in an album which seems to be unremarkable, formulaic, banal and lacking the usual edge that is expected of his work.Worse than Coldplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant","review":"Seriously, one of the most brilliant albums in the past 20 years.

This is the first one of his that I bought, and it's not the last. John Frusciante is an artist within everthing he hold to himself, no matter what media he's doing it in. Every song on this album is a bit of that indiviual, beautiful and sad side about him. I have heard nothing like this album and thats why I keep it close within me. He has gone through a lot in life and he expresses that in some of the songs. I loved this album. So if you are willing to try something different without listening to Anthony Kiedis's voice but John Frusciante...believe me, you won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the J Fru solo CD with which to start","review":"\\"Shadows Collide With People\\" is the first CD Frusciante did solo while being clean, I believe. It's also the best produced, and most accessible of his solo works. After listening to this I can clearly hear the Frusciante influence in every subsequent RHCP release. The Chilis used to be Kiedis and Flea's band---now they are definitely Frusicante's band. I like this CD. I think if it had been pushed there are definitely radio friendly songs there. Buy this one first, and if you like it you should try his other solo works. Just be warned, some of them (Niandra Lades, especially) are pretty weird.Another reviewer compared John Frusciante to Brian Wilson. I believe that is an accurate comparison. One day, people will look back at JF's solo work and wonder why more people didn't \\"get it\\". Brilliant musician, brilliant songwriter, genius in the studio. Buy this CD, buy all his other CDs, buy all the RCHP albums, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"rocket launcher","review":"My 6 year old really loves this toy. Close supervision is needed for safety as the rocket launches with a lot of force. It really goes up high which is very exciting. As long as the launcher is level (as it should be) the rocket will come down close to where it is launched and lands safely- it wouldn't hurt you if it bumped into you and it is easy enough to move out of the way any way. If the plastic tube is not connected just right, you will not be able to pump it up to full pressure and therefore, the rocket won't launch as high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Soldier: A Novel","review":"This was an excellent spy and war story.

Even giving it a one-star rating is too kind. The sheer number of inaccuracies in this book is staggering. Like a poor student, Mr Furst is easily confused with events, places and names. Other reviewers have noted some of the errors, which are indeed too numerous to list. Most of those could have been avoided with simple fact-checking -- or at least common sense. Mr. Furst, write what you know about. It seems that the author didn't bother when he wrote the book -- neither will I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book - Shame about the Spanish","review":"This an excellent novel as are others by the same auhtor, most notably Dark Star.However, in the section of the novel that takes place in Spain, there is some dialogue (a radio broadcast) supposedly in Spanish. Unfortunately, the author doesn't speak the language and did not take the trouble to have the text checked by someone who does, which doesn't reflect very well on him or his editor. As a native spanish speaker I found it really off-putting as it breaks the spell completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"The earth according to Furst","review":"Ambler, LeCarre and Furst are, in my opinion, the Holy Trinity of spy novelists. In Furst the ultimate in spy novels has continued. Not to forget Follet and Deighton who should be added to this pantheon of great authors. All are highly recommended and read together in rough historical sequence would give the young reader a world perspective of some of the events leading up to and including WW2 not to be found elsewhere. I literally could not put down this book and all the others of Furst's I've read.For those unfamiliar with the geography of Europe and the area surrounding the Mediterranean I would highly recommend following Furst's various protagonist's travels with Google Earth. The adventures come more alive and vibrant when the actual locations and geographical juxtapositions are arrayed on your screen. I started this practice with Dark Voyages and may re-read earlier books just to get a better feel for the settings of the novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Furst at his best","review":"I've read and own quite a lot of Furst books and this one was my favorite.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard read","review":"I have read every one of the Ludlum novels, which are long and involved but ultimately interesting. I found this book to be very difficult to read. There were many scenes in which new characters were introduced and not tied in to the story of the protagonist until far later. I'm not a student of history, and could barely keep up with the historical framework. I read the entire book, but wished that I had put it down (which I NEVER do) before wasting so much time on it.

The book is suitable for at home use with pre-K through 3rd grade. The book has adequate print size and medium interest.However, I do think the focus of the illustrations should have been more bug related. The bugs are so small and you have difficulty seeing their characteristics.Because of the strict criteria outlined for curriculum related trade books, this particular book would be somewhat difficult to use in this respect.The illustrations can be somewhat confusing, and the bug theme is not adequately obvious. Early learners need appropriate visual aides that are easy to recognize and obvious.The people illustrations are too oversized. The bug illustrations could also be a bit more prominent--size, color, features, etc.I recommend this book for home use for younger children.

(along with Heather Forbes) includes a chapter on \\"Reactive Attachment Disorder\\" (RAD), but gives the disorder a different definition than is found in the DSM-IV-TR. The authors rather give RAD the definition used by a fringe group of practitioners -- \\"Attachment (Holding) Therapists\\" -- which is a catch-all laundry list of signs that would label ANY child as RAD. If this isn't bad enough, the authors then prescribe Holding Therapy, an unvalidated practice denounced as abusive (see the journal *Child Maltreatment* Feb 2006) by APSAC and the APA's Division on Child Maltreatment. Holding Therapy uses hours of coercive restraint and other aversives to mold adoptees into unquestioningly obedient little Stepford Children.The second edition of this book (2010) excises the chapter on RAD, but has other problems, such as the endorsement of EMDR."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful read","review":"I found this book repetitious, wordy, and poorly written. Here's an example of what I mean: \\"The concept of formulating and completing a diagnostic assessment is richly embedded in the history of mental health practice. Furthermore, for many practitioners, the desire to master this process has been emphasized by compelling demands to address practice reimbursement.\\" (p. 29) Fortunately, there are \\"Quick Reference\\" boxes that summarize the main points; I found that reading these summaries gave me almost as much useful information as slogging through the main text. If you *have* to read this book, I recommend utilizing these summary boxes. It's unfortunate the text is written so badly, because there is good information in here.

I have been especially impressed with the language that is used and the tools the book makes available, such as the Daily Body Satisfaction Log in the Eating Disorders Chapter.

The problem is that it only has the English dubbed audio track. This dubbing sucks. I can't believe how much it ruins the movie just because of the audio. The action is fantastic but if you can't sit through the rest of the movie it makes it hard to get to those scenes. I can't believe that anyone would make a DVD with only one audio track (not the original) these days. How difficult could it be to include the Chinese/Japanese audio and some English subtitles.

This is one of Jet li good movies.... but I am told it lacks the ability to show some of the language difficulties shown in the original cantonese/japanese version which is essential to the original version and has been done no justice in this one.

After hearing and reading about Fist of Legend being a remake of Bruce Lee's classic Fist of Fury, I had some reservations about seeing it. However, after just watching it today, I was very pleased with the film. The fight scenes were well choreographed, as one would expect from a fight director like Yuen Woo Ping. As always, Jet Li was very impressive with his awesome martial arts skills. I truly feel that this is one of his best films and stands on its own in comparison to Fist of Fury. However, I wish that the DVD gave the option of being in its original Chinese Language with English subtitles. Nonetheless,I highly recommend this film to any Jet Li or martial arts film fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth buying if you like HK action flicks","review":"I bought the laserdisc version about 4 years ago. It was subtitled but I prefer to watch a movie in it's original language. I recently purchased the DVD version just because of the better transfer. It did annoy me that they had to change some of the dialogue which made the Jet Li and the old Japanese master seem more aggressive than they were with the original dialogue and the ending in which they cut out telling the viewer the future of the Jing Wu school. Other than that the picture was great--way better than my old LD.

Jet Li's master's son is the guy from Tai Chi Master aka Twin Warriror. that guy is pretty good too.anywayz, this movie is very good but kinda short. fighting scenes were off the hook fa sho.but i recommend watchin \\" sholin temple' and ' iron monekey' first to get really into this genre"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Li meets high quality video","review":"To begin with, I am only a luke warm fan of modern Hong Kong action.

Sharply focused visuals, superb action shots, great color, good transitions, almost no distracting jumps and zooms, etc., etc. I cannot add anything to other's comments about Jet Li, he is remarkable. However, this video places him in a fantastic new (for me) context where he looks even better. Few were the rough spots, obvious speedups, obscure references, and strictly regional idioms that I find so distracting or confusing. There were only a couple abrupt transitions and most of the story flowed smoothly through realistic sets and backgrounds.

I am giving this movie one star because Dimension changed it from the original. If you can get a copy of the original (it's not easy. I had a friend ship me one from Hong Kong), you'd realize when Dimension dubbed over the audio with english, they made big changes from the original. This has the overall effect of changing the plot and the ending (they cut footage and changed the ending). The DVD does add huge improvements to the quality of the picture (if all you want is to watch the fighting then get the DVD), but it's not worth the lamer plot (Imagine if Morpeous and Neo were always angry at each other when you switched the language setting over to Spanish).

This was not the first time I've seen this excellent film. I own the video tape, VCD, and LaserDisc versions of the movie and enjoy watching it over and over. A lot is lost in the translations in the English-Only DVD version and the new soundtrack ruins everything further. With DVD's ability for multiple language tracks, it is apparent that someone got the idea to cut corners to dump this hacked film on the Western audience for a fast buck. My advice... Get the ORIGINAL video, VCD or LD of this great movie if you can find it. You can always rewind back to read the subtitles you missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, horrible DVD","review":"This DVD is very inexpensive, and in this case you get what you pay for.Just by looking at the box and DVD itself you can easily see the lack of quality. The menu is static and completely silent. There are NO special features whatsoever, instead just some crummy advertisements for other Dimension Film DVDs.The biggest problem: NO ORIGINAL AUDIO TRACK. This movie is dubbed, and that's the only way you can watch it.With all that said, the quality of the picture is very good, which is the only redeeming quality of this DVD.This movie needs to be re-released desperately in a more polished product, and definitely bundled with subtitles and the original audio track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadows of Bruce","review":"There are way too many reviews for this movie, but one thing that most didn't mention is the Jeet Kune Do/Bruce Lee-ish element to the fighting. Jet-Li really seemed to have set out to move like Lee in this movie, and I was impressed by how well he pulled that off. Yes, there's a lot of 'arms flailing' showy technique, but there are little gems here and there that are definate tips of the hat to Bruce. From the over-riding theme of adaptability in combat (as taught to Jet's character by Funakoshi), to Jet's footwork, to the very opening punch of the movie (an interception if i ever saw one) bits of JKD can be seen in this movie. If i'm not mistaken, there's even a Muay Thai-style clinch-and-knee in one scene, which is rare for a Gung Fu movie.Anyway, as a big fan of Bruce Lee (and decidedly not a fan of the usual Jet Li fare), it was a delight to see this ressurection of Fists of Fury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor production value was a let down","review":"The production value on this movie was quite poor compared to its HK cousins & that's saying alot?

If you are just looking for epic fight scenes then this movie is great, but considering the prowess of Bruce Lee I'd say that the only things that came close were Jet Li's ability and the fight choreography.

It's a story of a martial arts master who is poisoned by Japanese militia who see his academy as an obstacle in their conspiracy to take over China. Jet plays the dead master's top pupil who vows to investigate and settle the score?...Jet does not really shows his vengeful side as good as Bruce in Chinese Connection (I like this title better than Fist of Legend) and not as funny as Bruce, but his display of martial arts kicks and punches really satisfy even the most jaded action fans! The film could be toned down a bit to get rid of some unnecessary boring scenes like they did to Rumble in the Bronx. Nevertheless, Jet Li is the star to watch in this film just like he was in Lethal Weapon 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"best final fight ever","review":"I've watched this movie a million times and still love it. I've seen too many weak bad guys that ruin movie climax. The general is not one of them. Great fights and great fighting music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad decisions are out there.","review":"Buying this is one of them.However that's nothing compared to the bad decision the jokers at dimension made when they put together this dvd. Yeah, they thought, let's take this great movie, with fantastic choreography, interesting storyline etc, and ruin it by dubbing it in English so the oh so Japanese girlfriend sounds like a dumb American high school bimbo. Good idea champs. Great idea. Now, put the icing on the cake you've baked and don't bother putting the cantonese audio anywhere close. Sure, dvds can handle more than one audio track, but hey, who needs em?Oh yeah, let's cut three minutes from it too. Just for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fight Scenes","review":"The fight scenes remind me of Matrix, but are much more elaborate and complex.

And the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed. Buy it, trust me, this is no \\"Crouching Boredom, Hidden Movie\\".."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest martial arts movie EVER!!!","review":"This movie is a must-see for any martial arts fan. In fact, you don't need to be a kung-fu buff to appreciate this flick. It has an excellent plot, great cast and, of course, unparalleled martial arts sequences delivered by the superlative JET LI. I have seen this movie 8 times and counting. Jet Li is simply AWESOME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"add me to the other 44 folks who this it's great!","review":"I decided to become one with 44 of my fellow men and tell the world how fine this movie is. The fight scenes are more realistic than in other Jet Li movies (another awesome one, though, is My Father is a Hero). The final fight in which Jet has to fight a guy that's stronger, taller, and doesn't fight fair is great--how does he do it? Watch and find out! A sympathetic and thoughtful telling of a story that seems like it really could have happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fist Of Legend - Jet Li At His BEST!","review":"Fist of Legend was definately Jet Li at his best!!! I don't care what that Sydney guy thinks, but this truly is one of the greatest if not the greatest martial arts film! The action was spectacular, and all the characters were unique in their own way. You have got to see the villian of this movie!!! I don't know about you but he was certainly very entertaining! Once again the fight scenes are spectacular and Li's remake of Fists Of Fury/Chinese Connection is very much indeed better than the original! Overall, a 5 star film definately worth seeing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fist of Legend Lands its Blow!","review":"This movie, Fist of Legend, is still one of my favorite movies staring the honorable Jet Li as Chen Zen. It presents the tensions of Japanese/Chinese culture in the early twentieth century well and tries to stymie prejudice on either side by Chen Zen's unaccepted romance with a Japanese woman Mitsuku. Chen Zen fights with honor as well as his Japanese adversary Akutagawa and the Mitsuku's uncle the esteemed Japanese master. My favorite scene is when Chen and the Japanese master fight blindfolded and later talk of philosophically adapting to another's fighting...This is a true martial arts movie! This is the movie that inspired me to train more in the martial arts. Check this one out...You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Li, undeafeated","review":"Chinese vs Japanese.In fist of fury, we see bruce lee. in fist of legend, we see jet li. i am in love with bruce lee, but i would say that fist of legend is the best film i have watched in the whole of my life.five stars is not enough for this movie. i love to watch this movie that i shared it with all of my goods friends. so paying a huge sum of money for this movie is worth it. it is nice to see two best martial arts (kung fu and karate)in the challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Li's Greatest Film","review":"An absolute must own. A remake of Bruce Lee's \\"Fist of Fury,\\" I actually prefer the story and action of this rendition. The anti-Japanese sentiment seen in the original is thankfully toned down while not sacrificing any feeling of tension so important to this story.

Known for his long sustained notes on electric axe, Mac is fast and fleeting on the nylon strings. There is added bounce in his step as he glides through beautiful melodies with solid back-up from his band. This music will stick with you and is great to listen to at the end of a tough day. The cover of Egberto Gismont's \\"Loro\\" is my favorite. I would love to hear John make another recording like this - it puts a smile on my face.

Agatha Cristie who has often been dubbed the \\"Queen of Mystery\\" uses one of her best characters, Hercule Poirot who closes this suspenseful case in a great way, in this great mystery.

I taped the LP and played it often on my car's casette player. Now I can play the CD on my current car's CD player. Although some would taq her as a country singer, she is not.

My purchase of this CD was sparked by a recent visit to a Wendy's restaurant. They were playing \\"Right Time of the Night\\" on the radio, and so many memories of my childhood began to flow back to me. I remembered how much I loved that song then, and how I never knew who sang it. So, I went to my local CD store the same day and looked up the song--only to find out that Jennifer Warnes sang it. I rushed to her section in the store, but the bin was empty. So, I ordered the CD from Amazon--and when it arrived, I practically tripped on the way to the CD player. What shocked me was all of the beautiful songs on this CD...songs that I had been missing all these years.

My son is 19 months. He loves breastfeeding, but I am ready to wean. I was hoping this book would provide examples and strategies on how to wean. It did not. This book is for the mom who wants to continue to breastfeed until her child weans naturally. It gives wonderful examples of families that have gone this route. But if you buy this book for the same reason I did, you will be very disappointed and frustrated as you get further into the book. The book seems to be written to encourage moms to breastfeed until their child weans naturally. It gives examples of other moms that have done it and explains why you should too. Not the book I thought it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent aid for nursing mothers","review":"This book is a must-read as mothers reach that supposedly 'magical' first birthday, and are wondering how/when/if they'll be weaning their child.

It had plenty of anecdotes about mothers who continued nursing their children until the child was four, five, six, and if I remember correctly, seven years old. Even for a mother who has nursed three children for over two years each, it was a little weird and also just plain funny. I shared it with some friends and we all became like snickering teenagers. It was not helpful with my plan to gradually wean my toddler. If you are looking for support for very extended breastfeeding, here it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT about weaning at all","review":"I checked this book out from the library hoping it would provide pointers and support for weaning my 12-month-old daughter. After reading it, I left feeling guilty and selfish. This book is NOT about weaning. In fact, it is about why you shouldn't wean. This title is a diatribe listing every reason you should not wean your child and all the reasons you should feel like a terrible parent for wanting to. It even has the gall to suggest the desire to wean is simply a sign of other stress in one's life, a contention I find particularly condescending as an intelligent, concerned parent. It's too bad La Leche League, from whom I found wonderful support when establishing breastfeeding, can't get past its political motivation to help women move on to another stage in the mother-child relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"How whaning happens","review":"If the purpose for purchasing this book is to wean you child in the least troumatic way, for whatever reason, do not bother. You will only learn how not to wean. But if you don't really have to wean, you might feel stronger about continueing nursing. After 25 months of nursing I have so many reasons to wean I can't even beging to list them. I don't think La Leche Legue will ever help anyone wean. It would be like a catholic preaching buddism.

So if you wanted to record something from the HDD to a supervid cd, you cant. You can only copy from the HDD to a DVD. The remote is a joke. You can not watch a DVD or a HDD recording while recording or watching another. The DVD player is terrible. It locks up on me at least once a week.

Tech email support sent a return email several days after I had already taken the NCLEX.So neither the book nor the CD is as Kaplan advertised and the CD doesnt work and tech support in awful.

The laughable moments continued with another character getting bitten on the right side of his neck in one scene - and then he is shown in the hospital with a bandage on the left side of his neck. Nobody was paying attention to the writing, the acting or editing it seems.Maybe it is because I'm spoiled with great television entertainment like BTVS Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel and Tru Calling. Did Lair make it beyond season one? I saw mention of Season Two being scheduled to air. I'm very surprised. If it makes it further than Tru Calling did, I'll be very upset.

Cute and creative like all of the Veggie Tales products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating & disappointed","review":"I was dissappointed that the game did not function on our computer. The computer meets the system requirements, yet things like the bumper cars and roller coaster don't work. My daughter loves veggie tales, but becomes very frustrated with this game. I also agree that it would have been nice to have some of the spiritual values taught in this game as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissapointed","review":"I'm a big Strait fan, I own all his other CD's and I like both his old stuff and his new stuff, but I thought this album was lacking something. It seemed like in a lot of the songs he was trying to go back to the way he used to sound, but something was missing. In more than one song the rhythm and rhyming sounded akward or stretched, and most of the songs were not something you could easily sing along with. And maybe he was doing it on purpose or maybe it's becasue he is getting older but his voice didn't sound as strong as it usually does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album...but not great","review":"I agree with Tyler. This album is good...but when comparing George to the standards George has made for himself...this album falls short. Sure there are a couple of really good songs on here, but this CD is not in the same league with Right or Wrong, Strait from the Heart, Strait Country, and a couple others. Some people love George just for George...which is great, but if you judge the style of songs and albums you see this CD is not as good as a lot of them.Scott J."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is one of George Strait's most emotionally charged albums. Some followers may do a good job with making his kind of neo-traditional country, but George still does it top notch. Part of it is George Strait's hands on approach in the studio. George has a great ear for arrangements and a keen ability to spot well-written songs. The album may have the same kind of approach as past albums, but you can't get too much of a great thing. With George, you wouldn't want it any other way. There's the thoughtful \\"Which Side Of The Glass.\\" And there is the story song \\"She Took The Wind From His Sails,\\" which has the same basic theme as \\"Don't Take The Girl\\" from Tim McGraw. It is just as well written and beautiful, creating the same heartwrenching affect as Tim's song does. The ending of George's song is not open in the same way, though. Rompers such as \\"Don't Make Me Come Over There And Love You\\" and \\"Home Improvement\\" rank among his best faster songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I've been a long time fan of George Strait, and maybe that's why I blindly buy every George Strait album that comes out. But I have to say, that this one is not up to par. George Strait has a huge fan following, and maybe that's why every now and then he puts out complete junk. He must be on to the fact that we buy his albums without even thinking; he therefore makes albums without even thinking. This album is one of the \\"poppiest\\" that George has ever put out. Kind of odd considering, he just put out a song about the death of country music, \\"Murder on Music Row.\\" Sure, George puts out more true country songs on each of his albums, but this one has the fewest. How are we supposed to feel as George Strait fans? He now has condensed his concert tour to one big mega festival with very few dates in very few cities. He's a smart guy, he knows we will still show up. So when George puts out another album and goes on another super-duty festival tour, we will once again be lining up to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"GEORGE NEEDED (HOME) IMPROVEMENT","review":"This CD is without QUESTION his worst CD, and the only song that makes a top FIFTY GS list is \\"Home Improvement\\" (Which is actually a top 10 song). I give it two stars for that song and \\"Don't Let Me Come Over There And Love You\\". And that is the best I can say about this GS major misfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Strait' off the road and in the ditch..his only bad album","review":"My god, George Strait...he;s never even mildly dissapointed me, well, except my fav album of his 'One Step At A Time', has such a mundane song on it the silly 'That's The Breaks'...(haha...and it's on my favourite Strait album...how ironic)With titles like 'Looking Through My Window Through The Pain' ??!! Owch...what a cheeeesy title. George, what were you thinking? And all of these songs here, minus the fairly happy \\"Don't Make Me Come Over There And Love You', that's not bad. THis album was probably rushed, or done out of the fact he might be on contract to do an album every nine months...and this was just a mud pie of the group. Boring, musically flat, and silly titles.

I RECEIVED a RH (passenger side) window regulator w/ motor. The company tried to make me pay for shipping to return the part, and only agreed to pay shipping when I refused. They then claimed it was in fact the correct part, which it obviously was not. I took several pictures of both the replacement and original parts, side by side, and the motor is on the wrong side of the device, meaning it is for the passenger side. The company then proceeded to give me a PARTIAL refund. After paying $76 dollars and wading through a sea of support personnel that speak broken english I received a $45 refund and am still without a driver side window. This was a terrible experience and I caution anyone against buying products from Auto Parts Train. Awful experience. Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent aftermarket solultion","review":"After buying the Metra kit for my ES300, I pretty much immediately looked around for another aftermarket solution. The Metra kit is flimsy and poorly designed. The Metra kit pretty much fell apart after being installed in my car for two weeks and never sat flush with the climate controls and the rest of the dash. The only thing the Metra kit had going for it was the it matched the existing black plastic in the car. This kit is designed very well and sits flush in the dash. Everything that the Metra kit does not do this kit does. The only thing this kit does not do is match the existing black plastic. It has a different texture (-1 star) but it is a fair trade off for something that actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIE HARD WHITNEY FAN","review":"When I was growing up, I listened to Whitney Houston alot.

She forfeited the opportunity of portraying Sabrina LeBeauf's character,Sondra Huxtable on NBC's The Cosby Show in favor of her singing career. Hits from this best-seller include SAVING ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU,HOW WILL I KNOW,ALL AT ONCE and YOU GIVE GOOD LOVE. She sings a duet with Jermaine Jackson entitled NOBODY LOVES ME LIKE YOU DO,previously recorded by Dave Loggins and Anne Murray. I guess this was a reciprocation from when Whitney sang a duet with Jackson on his 1984 self-titled album. Other female artists to have a smash debut album include Carole King(TAPESTRY,1971),Alanis Morrissette(JAGGED LITTLE PILL,1995),Mariah Carey(her 1990 self-titled) and Sheryl Crow(TUESDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB,1993). Whitney took home a handful of Grammys for this album. Her second album WHITNEY,released in 1987,sold like hotcakes also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney Houston's first","review":"4 1/2 starsThis album is noteworthy. 3 No. 1's came from it.

The version of Feel Like a Stranger has no jamin like it did later on. Songs like Alabama Getaway, Lost Sailor, and Easy to Love You, just are plain boring.

Concerned about sterility of product as one has to ingest it. Beware with glass product folks what you save you might lose in loss of product and time lost trying to correct it. Vendor did contact me via email as I did complain, said they would replace but were out of stock, three to four weeks later, still no product or update from vendor, and now Amazon asked me for a review.

Unfortunately, Phil Collins applies his tried and true 80s gloss production on this record, and it ends up sounding fairly dated as a result. If you dig John's more ambient stuff, like Solid Air and Bless The Weather, you probably won't like this record a whole lot.Previous reviewers note that the first track, \\"Couldn't Love You More\\", with Eric Clapton on guitar, is great. But if you want to hear a truly brilliant version of this song, pick up the reissue of John's album \\"One World\\" and listen to the live 1978 version of this track, which is on the bonus disc. It's just Martyn and his guitar, pouring his heart out in front of a stunned crowd. After you hear that version, you'll realize how \\"Diet Coke\\" this version of John Martyn is.But hey, if you wanna hear Phil Collins sing backup vocals, and play drums (without touching his cymbals much) then by all means...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eighties slick","review":"Being a huge fan of John Martyn I love practically all his work - especially his seventies output from 'Bless the Weather' to 'Grace and Danger'. In recent years I've come to really appreciate his more recent work as well, like 'The church with one bell' , 'Cooltide' and 'Heaven and Earth'. One of the missing pieces though was 'Glorious Fool'.I can't hide the fact that I was really disappointed, exemplified by the version of 'Couldn't love you more': a pale shadow of the glorious song it is on 'One World'. All tracks on 'Glorious Fool' suffer greatly from the slick production they've been subjected to, and to me it seems that this record sounds so much more dated than anything John Martyn did before or after.So, just two stars - I would probably bestow more stars on it had it been by anybody else, but this is by the great man himself. As you may have gathered, this is by far my least favourite John Martyn cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"tastee","review":"Even Phil Collins, at the height of his popularity, and Eric Clapton throwing in some really tasty licks, couldn't help bring John to the masses and that is a shame. \\"Glorious Fool\\" is one of Martyn's easier albums to listen to for someone that is not familiar with his work. \\"Couldn't Love You More\\" is worth the price of the lp.

Kenny's first three albums, Kenny G, G Force, and Gravity all show some very faint signs of quality music.

After 5 months of using it I found all of those things to be true. However, after the buckle for the bench seat got too easily pulled apart, I don't trust this product. Now, I have no way to secure my curious child in. It's very difficult to steer as well. The wheels are super easy for the child sitting/standing on the bench to try to 'help' you brake. Storage is very small and hard to get to. If you do store anything in the basket underneath, it can easily hit the wheels. It got us through till now, but I'm disappointed I'm going to have to find something else.

Its too long and this causes it to be really hard to turn. And the frame is a little delicate. With ours the right side got pushed forward a little and the whole thing pulled to the right so hard that it was a HUGE chore to push it. We called them and they told us to switch the front wheels which did not work. I finally laid it on its side and pushed the right side forward while bracing the other front wheel and that helped a little but its still really hard to push. The wheels are also small and make it difficult to get over cracks etc. in the sidewalk.

I didn't believe for a minute that I was \\"IN\\" the story. Rachel was not my friend and I wasn't totally in love with Adam.

Unfortunately it's tattooed on a woman. Of course you want to save the woman, but why can't they send the list by some other means. Chris Tucker's character has a nice car and nice clothes, but he doesn't have a camera on his cell phone?And Jackie Chan's character still works for the Chinese government, but he can't just write down the 13 names (they're in Chinese) and send them off to a couple of people??Ughh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Misses","review":"This film is nowhere near as entertaining as the first two in the series.The weakest link in the first two films was always Chris Tucker, who is just embarrassing. It seems like he is trying to be a low-budget Eddie Murphy, and fails.Fortunately in Rush Hour 3 he is older and a bit less hyper. Age perhaps is also showing in Jackie Chan, who is always fun to watch, but his stunts are less impressive this time around.The problem here is either in the writing or the directing. The film just seems to be a series of (not very funny) comedy sketches strung together, with the actors just doing through the motions. Max von Sydow delivers his usual quality, but the resolution of his character is just a repeat from the first film and not a surprise.The most original element seems to be the fighting on the Eiffel Tower.The absolute high point is the collection of bloopers at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"After loving both prior Rush Hour's I could not wait for this one!

The Most Hilarious \\"Rush Hour\\" Yet.","review":"This third entry in the \\"Rush Hour\\" franchise is by far the best. Chris Tucker is funnier than ever and Jackie Chan shows he can still kick butt. There are a few surprises in store. By far, the most hilarious sequence is the one involving a zealous French cab driver. I choked on my popcorn several times during the film. Very funny.Rated PG for action-violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang it Up Guys","review":"We really enjoyed Rush Hours 1&2 and with that in mind went into RH3 hoping for more of the same. Disappointment bigtime. Rehash, retread, boring, the series has worn out its welcome. The disk doesn't even contain an outake real, the staple (and often best part) of any Jackie Chan movie. Hang it up guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nice - in several ways","review":"First, I agree with the critics who say there's an element of nastiness in this film. Racism, for example. I'm kinda surprised Chris Tucker let himself be cast this way. He starts out as a traffic cop instead of a detective, against Chan's now being an ambassador's bodyguard. Throughout most of the film, it seems he's the one who makes most of the blunders, and Chan is the one who does most of the bailing out and serious work.Second, I think the film crosses the line into indecency. It should be R-rated, not PG-13.This may as well be the last Rush Hour film. I enjoyed 1 and 2, but after seeing this, I'll probably not buy any more, unless I have reason to think there's been a big improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment after Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2","review":"In this movie, in our opinion, the movie makers made Jackie Chan's character out to be a real loser in his role of law enforcement officer. He pursued and caught the man who had just shot the ambassador, and then let him walk away. The fact he considered this man to be like a brother should not have interfered with him performing his duty. Later in the film, Lee tells this man that the reason he had not shot him was because he (Lee) is not an assassin. What a bunch of hooey! My husband and I really enjoyed Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2, so we thought 3 would be at least as good. Wrong! Overall, this movie was a huge disappointment for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY!","review":"I love this movie. It is the best Rush Hour movie made. It is so funny.

In the end i really enjoyed viewing the movie. Chris tucker never ceases to make me laugh with his delivery, antics and facial expressions. This rush hour lives up to the previous ones, good story line with the usual craziness that puts a smile on your face. This is a movie to just sit back and enjoy the fun, no need to get your brain involved in this one. There are a few stupid scenes, however overall i found this motion picture very pleasing to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush hour 3","review":"Wonderful movie, relax and enjoyed the movie after a hard day.I saw this movie before but it still good to see again.

Quality wise I would have to say the ending fight scene was the most beautiful!!!! Great sound too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I come not to praise but to bury this sucker!","review":"Let's get one thng clear the plot is so thin that it only two plages long. You know who the bad guy is the second time you see him. The scene in th dojo with the BIG guy is totally not needed. The big song and dance number is totally not needed. Why didn't someone take a picture of the girl's head and give it to the cops? Think about this one.... The heros finally figure out who the bad guy is and over power him in his office. The second bad guy, the brother, calls and tells Jackie he has the girl and will trade the letter for her. Now the very next scene Jackie shows up at the killer's place with a girl, but the girl is Tucker in a wig. The big fight happens, which is copy of Rush Hour1 and Shanghi Knights. After the fight, Tucker and Jackie are confront by the head bad guy that they had over powered in the office. How did he get here? Whay wasn't he locked up? Who knows? Who cares? Even the out takes weren't funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush Hour 3 Delivers...","review":"I decided not to be swayed by the incredible number of lousy reviews I read by the critics and went to see Rush Hour 3. I'm glad that I did as I found myself doubling over with laughter throughout the entire film. Yes we were made to wait an exceptionally long time for this one and clearly Chan & Tucker are older but this film STILL delivers the comedy and moments of action that have made this series what it is. This is easily one of my favorites in the installment. A reviewer here mentioned that the public had certified this one D.O.A. which is funny because this film spent six weeks in the top 10 and took in more than $140 million at the box office. This after taking in $49 million in the opening week - obviously the word got out as to just how hilarious this film is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad,not bad at all (3.5/5)","review":"from all the negative things i had heard about this movie,i expected itto be awful.thankfully,that wasn't the case.this movie is actually notbad.i didn't find it as funny as either the first or second one,butthere were still some pretty funny moments.Jackie Chan gets to loosenup and show a bit of his silly side.Chris Tucker is funny,as usual.again there's lots of action of course.the fights are pretty good.ChrisTucker displays some good martial arts moves in this one.and JackieChan has his usual great movies,although he seems a bit restrained inthis one.there is one mild scene of female nudity,but very brief andnothing tasteless.i didn't quite like it as much as the previous twomovies,but i still enjoyed it.for me,Rush Hour 3 is a 3.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Tucker Is A Nut","review":"This movie was hilarious and Chris Tucker is crazy. \\"Black people can't fly!\\" I crack up whenever I think about the scene where he says that. Noémie Lenoir is more beautiful on screen than she is in print. Other than that, this movie is just fun to watch and isn't that deep.

It starts off strong, giving you alot of atmosphere, and then it gives you more atmosphere. And then it gives you more atmosphere. There isn't any real meat to this book. The character creation section is limited telling you that creating a Mafia character is pretty much like making a vampire minus the powers. And while there is several references to Vampire and Werewolf Mafia guys, there is not short bio's of any, like you'd find in a clan book. I was hoping that it would cover some other types of gangs, Yakuza, Tongs, ect. Instead it confined it's to the Mafia during it's heyday. Long story short. If you've seen The Godfather, Goodfellas, ect. you don't need this book. If you haven't seen these moves you'd have a better time watching the movies than reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great novel of the original BG series","review":"You could almost call this book: \\"The Return of Baltar\\" since it's story line is different in that he \\"comes back\\" with the I.L.

Hawke and his best friend, Mackenzie Riggs, accompany Mac's mom, the coroner, to the crime scene. When Mrs. Riggs discovers Ivan Allen died because he was given a lethal transfusion of gorilla blood, P.C. and Mac make it their mission to find out the killer, and are thrilled when the police agree to let them help out on the case. But searching for the truth can be dangerous. As P.C. and Mac dig deeper, they discover some disturbing facts that lead them to believe that Ivan Allen's murder was an act of revenge for a tragedy fourteen years ago.

This made me seriously doubt the integrity of the author, as any true cat lover would NEVER do such a thing. It made me wonder whether she saw them as living beings and members of the family, as my cats are to me, or just ornaments that can be cast aside if they become inconvenient. Perhaps I'm cynical, but the book just smacked of a means to make money for an author whose work is fairly pedestrian. In regards to the content, it covered such mundane matters as history, naming your cat and the like. If you want books written by apparently genuine cat lovers, I would suggest Patricia Telesco's book Cat Magic and Daisy Pepper's Spells For Cats. They cover pretty much the same content and seem to come from a place of genuine care and concern for our feline friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for Amazon reviews!","review":"I was planning on buying this book, but decided not to after reading a few reviews which revealed that the author had given away at least ten cats of her own, using the old \\"moving away\\" excuse.

By the time they are two, children can easily memorize it and begin to distinguish words on the page.It is particularly delightful for young children, who can identify both with the peddler's nap and his anger at the monkeys in a tree, who have stolen his caps.Altogether, the story is pure joy. Your copy is sure to wear out before your children reach the age of five, as ours did. Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL EDITION TO AN OLD, OLD CLASSIC","review":"I hate to admit it, but I can remember this story being read to me by my mother shortly after it was first published. I loved it as a child and love it now. The story, at first glance is simple, well told and an absolute delight. The illustrations are \\"old world,\\" and the type I grew up on. Even though the story has been around for years and years, it is certainly no worse for the wear. What delighted me as a child seems to delight the kids of today. I read this one to my various classes and the kids all seem to love it. Actually, there is not much to not like about this one. Recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood favorite is now my child's favorite","review":"This is one of the few books I remember my elementary school librarian reading to us during my childhood. I loved the story of the multi colored caps balancing on the peddler's head as he walked through town yelling \\"caps for sale!\\" Then to find that as he napped, his caps disappeared. Looking around for them post-nap, he discovers a band of monkeys in the tree wearing them. He tries to get the caps back but each time he yells at the monkeys, they just ape his actions. Finally they throw the caps down and he continues on his way selling his multi-colored caps. I highly recommend this book for all children. My daughter is 2, almost 3, and she also LOVES this story. She finds the monkeys funny - especially how I imitate their actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a child I didn't care for this book","review":"I remember my teacher reading this book to the class in Elementary school. It was fine for passing the time at school but looking back I remember not being attracted to the illustrations or the story. It basically did nothing for me as a child. As an adult I looked at it the other day and still could not understand the appeal for this book. Of course, that is just my opinion and it seems a lot of people seem to be attracted to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"One of the greatest children's books of all times...I'd only recommend the board book version for very small children as some of the illustrations seem to loose some of their wow factor because they are smaller than in the standard size book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed book!","review":"The book was pieced together wrong. It turned out to be a board book. The pages were upside down at times. I have this book at school, and it's not supposed to look like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"This book is well loved by my son and myself.I love books that have simple pictures that add to the text rather than distract. I like the simple story line. I particularly like that this book can be used as a stepping stone to other activities (acting like a monkey, balancing hats on your head etc.)The repetitive nature and sing songy words are wonderful for prereading skills. My son loves to act like a monkey stealing my hat as we read this book.A true classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged! No where near as good as the classic!","review":"I purchased this board book for my 2-year-old daughter who had fallen in LOVE with my mother's 1966 paperback edition, in an interest to preserve its delicate pages.You can imagine my disappointment as I read it to her, discovering that important phrases, entire pages, and key details were left out of this edition, especially the rhythmic phrasing, and some of the low points of the book, completely flattening what had been a dynamic and suspenseful story. Even she noticed the difference and asked for the old book back.I would love to be able to get a new copy of the original story, however this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming book","review":"I remember this book from when I was a child and loved it.

The repetition of words and the copycat element (when the monkeys imitate the peddler's actions)is entertaining for very young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pezzo the Cap Peddler is Excellent!","review":"An ingenious plot that I remember from my childhood. Now I am enjoying it again with my children. I was always fascinated by how he balanced those hats. The illustrations are quite simple but intriguing. Just looking at Pezzo with all those hats piled one on top of another is more interesting than many of the high tech special effects I have seen in today's movies. Sometimes the simple way is the best.Pezzo's situation looks bleak as the monkeys that stole his caps are scattered high in the tree. His act of frustration actually serves to get his stolen caps back from the playful monkeys. It shows a child that no matter how impossible a situation is, if you think you can find a solution.If you can find it, I also recommend Pezzo the Peddler. In that one he goes to a circus carnival and his hats fall off and the circus performers mistakenly take them. This book has a lot more text but also a more intricate plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic book","review":"Its so cute I remember it when I was young, a great classic story to read to an older child like 3 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent condition, prompt delivery","review":"This is a sweet book and arrived promptly and in reasonable condition.

He can start something with great promise but after a few minutes sounds as if he's lost interest in his composition. To shore up this challenge to his inspiration, he moves from theme to theme, never developing anything substantial, often dallying and meandering uselessly. He employs novel \\"modern\\" effects to divert attention to the fact that nothing is happening. Naxos makes a big deal about his use of \\"folk\\" material, but Balada implements these poorly. They sound like sketches for a 40s travelogue with a pinch of Ives and a glissando of \\"modern\\" effects here and there.As insubstantial as Balada is, the Barcelona Symphony is well below even Naxos standards. They have an overly tart reed and string sound lending an unpleasantly nasal atmosphere to each work. Aeschgbacher's tempos are suitable aimless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conocoan","review":"I have been a Conocoan for 27 years now. I originally purchased this book for my library many years ago.

This book, dated 1981 is so out-of-date as to be irrelevant. Typical chapters cover one and one-half pages; mostly of material sent in to Hayduke from contributors to his Paladin Press magazine columns. Most of that material so obviously points the \\"mark\\" in the direction of the perpurtrator (you) that retaliation is almost a certainty. I'll be reviewing the 1999 Hayduke book, but so far most of his stuff is a rehash of the magazine material and seriously lacking on high tech mayhem - which is ultimately so more deadly and anonymous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"real\\" writer.","review":"This book is totaly worthless. Most of the writing is either illegal and punishable by real jail time or stupid pipe dreams. The author, who gets his material from submissions from \\"who knows who\\" writes of breaking into someones property and damaging their vehicle by tampering with the engine. First this is very dangerous, illegal, not funny, and you would need a key to get inside the car to open the hood in modern cars.He writes of re-wiring an elevator to make it go to different floors when the buttons are pushed. How many people could really do this and even if they could when?

It deals with important health aspects (safe sex & hygiene), how to approach anal sex practically, fisting, stress, douching, and many other important aspects. He does of course include both hetro- and homosexual perspectives. But what I particularly appreciate is his integrated mind-body take on this topic. He deals sensitively with attitudes, issues of power, how to open up a dialogue with your partner, and how to introduce the topic to a new partner. A non-dual mind-body perspective is always important in sex, but especially when it comes to anal sex.

It is easy to read and has a lot of good ideas that you can put to use immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It took me about 30 minutes to read through this book and glean whatever original material the author had to offer. The most useful bit of \\"practical\\" advice I found was to use post-it notes stuck inside of a manila folder for organizing web page topics. Somehow I expected more from a book with \\"Information Architecture\\" in the title. This is a light-weight book, possibly for someone who has had little or no exposure to the web. It is more about corporate project management than website structure. The architecture of the book itself is disorganized and confusing; it rambles for seven chapters on various disparate topics before launching into the purported subject of the book, and even then it amounts pretty much to restating fairly obvious, common-sense techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no there there","review":"I've never given below three stars in a review. This book was worthless to me. There is no useful framework or process described. There are no helpful implementation tips. There is no help on tools to use. There are no checklists. It's all just generic information with no real context, flow, or underlying structure tying it together.About me: I'm neither an expert nor a total novice in this area.

They weren't even Bicycle brand as depicted. They were from some generic brand company. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who likes things with quality or like getting the item they ordered. All in all, they were cheaply made, not the product shown, and highly overpriced.

Only recently have I gained just a slight appreciation for the music of Family. To me they are just not an easy or very rewarding band to listen to. Roger Chapman may be the most annoying singer in the history of British rock. The songwriting isn't there and the arrangements are beyond clumsy. Family is for die hard 70's British rock fans only; and this is in my opinion the 2nd best album that I've heard by them.

While the acting, empathy and photography are exemplary, the storyline itself is comprised of an unfortunate mix of farce, silliness and reality which actually detracts from one's viewing enjoyment. Had this production maintained a more serious tone throughout, I believe it would have drawn more favorable attention and pleased a greater number of viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the bedpan, please.","review":"The show seems roughly inspired by Paddy Chayefsky's movie \\"Hospital,\\" a brilliant satire. Unlike that movie, however, this show is lousy . It is just a manipulative and sentimental drug propaganda show. The characters are presumptuous hipper-than-thou types: O so self aware that they are not aware of anything else. Even long suffering Nurse Jackie uses her delusion of professionalism as an excuse to use drugs because she's so concerned but no one else is: so what else is one to do? And the relationships range from inane to simply dopey. It would have to improve to be bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a single likeable character in the whole show","review":"This show is painful to watch. Not in that it is poorly written or acted, but just in the fact that I began to hate every single charater in this show. Most of the main charaters should be in jail.

She also has an oxycodone addiction which causes her to sleep with the hospital pharmacist and break her finger and hide the fact she is married with children. The season is well laid out with Edie as a character who is really likable but also disturbing for her addiction and lies. The rest of the cast is made up of some of New York's best actors and actresses. As the season goes on, Edie's life becomes more visible to her coworkers and family. But just enough.

I also wasn't aware that it was originally printed in Great Britain. I found this book overly simplistic and also much of the terminology unfamiliar. Building supplies that are commonplace in Great Britain are not necessarily so in the U.S. This book did not answer a single question that I have about housing a horse or pony. The author states that concrete is an optional stable floor and every other book I've read states that concrete is not an acceptable flooring option. When presenting chalk as a well-draining surface over a clay shed floor the author fails to state how much chalk a person should use, not to mention I have no idea if chalk is available here. Is it the same as lime? I have no idea.

If one had read the book Total Recall/Blade Runner was based on or any other of Phillip K. Dick's works, one would Know that. I do Know the movie, Blade Runner, intimately, word for word, and find Arnold's Total Recall an exciting action oriented movie and Harrison's work impeccable.

See that quote on the casing, \\"Total action?\\" That comes from the Canadian edition of TV Guide. If any more impressive source could have been cited, I assume the makers would have used that quote instead.This could be a made-for-TV effort. Instead of acting, this relies on stereotypes, like sneering bad-guy, maverick cop, and don't-make-waves boss of the maverick. Then there's that cop's partner, the one with a secret that you'll pretty much guess in the first few seconds of his appearance. In fact, when it came time to out that guy in a big dramatic scene, I had long since forgotten that his secret was secret at all.The big bad corporation theme still works, especially after the recent implosion of the financial corporations. That's about it, though. Maybe this was watchable after a few beers, when nothing else was on, but its sell-by date came and the day it was aired.

It is filled with characters that the story line gives you little reason to care about, but yet the ominous attempt at dialog would have you have you believe there is great meaning to every word. I'm sorry I even rented it. I'm certainly glad I didn't buy it! The photography is reminiscent of Blade Runner and had the script not been do bad it might have been a good movie.

To be fair, he's an honest character, a modern (2013) young man who has learned to survive in a failed world, who certainly isn't going to accept dragons and magic as readily as the tenth century heroine of the first book. Maybe it was the switch to present tense every time we go to his POV -- yeah, yeah, I know it's a technique to show his mindset, but it jarred me. And, darn it, I like medieval fantasy, and my favorite scenes were those that flashed back to Erde's home time.

At first I was a little confused at the style of writing. The writing is that of an adult and not a small child. Once I realized that Dorcas was a young women by the time she managed to put her story on paper, it all fell into place.

I have had mine for more than a week now and I can honestly say that it has exceeded my expectations.For only $140 I have a decent zoom lens for my D50. I love this product.Now, while the lens is great, it does have some problems. It is loud, heavy and slow to focus. This is not an ED (extra low dispersion) lens so some of your pictures may not be as sharp as they would be with your top-end kit lens. However, again, look at that price!

It's the perfect compliment to the stock 18-70mm zoom2. It's really cheap.This lens will not resolve as many lines, or deliver as much contrast as a kilobuck Nikkor zoom. But it will deliver surprisingly good results in a 6 Mpixel D-70. Between this lens and the 18-70 supplied with the D-70, you'll be set until you decide you must have that exotic 12mm or 600m/2.8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great zoom lens for the average user","review":"Premium Nikkor optics in a budget priced lens make this one a winner. Having a polycarbonate body, the lens doesn't feel as solid as the old metal framed ones some of us had gotten used to, but for the price difference, it's fully acceptable. If you're used to lenses with a aperature ring then it might take some time to get used to the lack of one on this lens. The quality optics really show with this lens, with no real noticable distrtion or vignetting. What is noticable is the zoom tends to creep when when the camera is pointed nearly straight up or down. This is unacceptable if you want to use the lens for long exposures as the zoom creep will be noticable on the final image, and that's the only reason I'm knocking this lens' rating down to 4 stars for my review. Overall, this is a fine lens for the average photographer on a budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for Manual pics, AF doesn't work in 5100","review":"AF doesn't work on 5100. I may not have read the fine print. Be sure you read exactly what camera bodies work with this lense. Works fine on manual focus. What I foind out was most of the time I was taking pictures at great distances and even with action (grandson's football game) and the autofocus doesn't really work so the manual focus works better. Good value. Shipped quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"70 - 300 Nikon zoom","review":"I did not care for theNikon 70-300mm f/4-5.6G AF Nikkor SLR Camera Lens. The focus ring was at the end of the lens and didn't make for easy focusing with a moving subject. I returned it and got the Nikon 55 - 300 DX zoom lens. Although it cost a bit more, it was absolutely worth the price, no question. I LOVE the new lens. The return was hassle free and I received very good service from both providers."},{"rating":"2","title":"a super value","review":"I am a hobbyist, and wanted a far reaching lens for taking pictures of hawks. This lens is PERFECT for what I want it for. Is the lens itself perfect...of course not. It's got a plastic mount, feels fairly cheap etc. But, look at the price! You get what you pay for, and for barely over $100 (I got an import version from B&H to save even more money), this is fantastic. If you NEED more light, or if the pictures you're taking are important, then maybe you should be looking at more costly lenses. I suggest using a tripod at longer lengths, of course. It really is a great value, depending on what you're needing the lens for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manual Focus.","review":"If you do not have inbuilt motor in your SLR then don't even think of this one.

Not recommended at all, no matter what you would like to use it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't NEED an expensive DX or DX VR zoom lens to get great action shots.","review":"This SLR Zoom lens came with my Nikon D80 package. It's a lens that I actually had and was using on my N65 for years, but I sold that one when I sold my N65. Now that I'm using it again, but on my D80 I'm absolutely amazed by what it allows me to capture. I can shoot sports during the day or at well lit night venue from as far away as 40 yards and get results that are magazine worthy. It freezes action and focuses so fast that it makes shooting sports effortless. It's very light and quiet too. I'm sure the modern DX VR version is better, but it's also 7x the price. Unless you're a pro, just get this lens and call it a day. I guarantee you'll have some great shots of your kid's soccer games to frame and cherish forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good companion for a D50","review":"For the price, ($138 including shipping from BuyAccesories) this lens is hard to beat. Works very well with the D50. On overcast days at 200 - 300mm a monopod or tripod give the best results. Other reviewers have mentioned the bokeh quality of this lens and I agree, very appealing. Auto focus can be a little noisy and may tend to hunt before locking in. Manual focus and zoom operation is very smooth and feels right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the price","review":"This lens far exceeded my expectations. I was a bit worried reading some less-than stellar comments online, especially about build quality, but decided to take a chance. I wouldn't call this lens pro-quality by any streach of the imagination but for the casual user or moderate use pro-sumer, I would highly recommend this bargain of a lens. It's ideal to get up and close to the action and fairly light to hold; this make it easier to hold and compose longer without your arms getting tired. I use this lens with a F100 and focus is much faster than expected. It has a tendency to \\"hunt\\" more as you zoom in, but not so much when it is zoomed out. It is D compatible to communicate distance information for matrix metering and flash use, there seems to be some confusion about this online... In short, great lens and a fantastic value. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fully functional with Digital SLR cameras","review":"This lens is described in the product description as an auto-focus that will work on digital SLR cameras. While the lens is technically an \\"auto-focus lens\\" it is misleading. If you have a digital SLR camera youR lens has a switch on the side that allows the camera to focus the lens when you press the photo button. This lens does not do that. On a digital SLR camera it is just a manual focus lens. I called the seller and they wanted to argue that the lens was auto-focus but did agree to allow me to return the lens. So while the lens was new and the size specified, my complaint is that the description misleads you into thinking that this is a fully autofocus lens compatible and fully functional on digital SLR cameras such as my Nikon D40 it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, Poor service from Amazon","review":"The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon's poor service, otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product. I placed this order more than 30 days ago. Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J&R. If Amazon did not have the item in stock, they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect entry level lens","review":"This is a perfect entry level lens for the beginner photographer, or even the novice. I bought it for my son as a grad gift with my old D200 body. I had to test it first, of course, and the photos were tack sharp. It focuses fast and accurate, lightweight and comfortable. I don't think that if you're looking for a good, inexpensive model of an all-around lens, you can't go wrong with this choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"No AF function on Nikon D40","review":"I bought this lens but never stated that does not work on AF on the Nikon D40X. It said it was a full AF lens. Anyway is so cheap that you can livew with that. Otherwise, is a good buy for the price. Tamron is offering a full workinf AF lens with the same speed, so you might consider it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great lense- I really didn't know much about lenses when I purchased it but learned a few things just by playing with this one. If you are looking for a lense that zooms AND has a wide angle then you might want to keep looking. This has an AWESOME zoom but is not very widescreen (when I shoot objects, I have to stand really far back to capture it- not very suitable for standard shots- in the future, I will try to get an all in one lense- 18-300 would be great if they even make them!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive quality lens","review":"this is an inexpensive and quality zoom lens. It is amazing to me that I ordered it and the following day it arrived. This lens does need a fair amount of light but it was bought for outdoors shooting. A good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"best bang for the buck","review":"Would love to have purchased a similar lens for 5x the price of this lens but not right now.For the price this is hard to beat. I wanted a \\"long\\" lens to take bird pictures and the occasional distant animal/sunset/silhouette shot that I happen onto now and then.If you use a tripod (or a beanbag over a car window)and keep the settings on f8 or even better at f11, the pictures are remarkably sharp.The auto focus seems to hunt a bit but is better than I expected considering the bargain basement cost for the lens.An interesting note is that it appears the lens is often sold used for at or above the cost of a new lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"great addition to the d70s kit","review":"This lens was the perfect add on for the d70s kit. I got this for my girlfriend for a birthday present, and she has loved her camera even more since receiving it. It has allowed her to take several shots that were impossible without a zoom (animals, etc) and allows her to take people photos without being distracting to the subject. It has a really low weight (slightly less than the dx non-telephoto lens that comes with the D70s) and is well designed for quick focus. One thing to note about this lens - it does not use the same size lens cap that the dx lens does - just thought that was odd. This is definitely not the best telephoto lens on the market, but its got to be the best for price to performance ratio. Do not buy a d70, d70s, or d50 without one!Now if I could just find a good CHEAP wide angle for a nikon d-slr I'd be all set for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"300mm lens","review":"I received the lens very quickly, which was greatly appreciated. I have used it several times on my Nikon D90 camera, and it really reaches out there and gets excellent closeups. Is very easy to use, works seamlessly with my camera, exactly as I'd hoped.

It has a classic smooth jazz feel with the right mixture of foot stomping songs vs. ballads. Later Kenny G CD's had too many ballads with way too much over-playing by Kenny. He lost his jazz feel and gave in to the pop $$. The only negative is the synthisized drum & bass. It's so 80's. It's still worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor still has no clothes","review":"A friend swore by everything holy that this album of Kenny G's [was not weak]; in fact, he swore that it was rather good.Nope.I've given this two stars, which is one more than I have given any other albums of his that I've heard (as I cannot give the \\"Classics in the Key of G\\" album 0 stars), because the pieces here are a slight variation from the standard instrumental pop he writes. However, I still find his phrasing and his tone abominable and laughable.I don't understand the Kenny G fans. They argue that it is hypocritical to compare Kenny G to the \\"jazz masters\\" (against which he falls down somewhat), and claim that he is not trying to be jazz. And yet, when they think of jazz, they think of Kenny G, something he has backed up by attempting to play jazz standards.So I go back to this idea.

This album is true rock n roll all the way! If you like this i highly recommend LIVE ACID that is their self produced lp that came out in 99. Pesonally, I like that album a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding! Extraordinary!","review":"I had to listen to this CD three times in a row before I could believe it was real.

The nearly century-long history of Tiger Stadium, and the bitter battle to try to save it, is one of the great sports stories of our time, and Betzold and Casey make every moment of it come alive, from Ty Cobb's violent outbursts to the infamous \\"rusty girder\\" speech of Tigers president Bo Schembechler. Highly recommended for anyone who cares about baseball, our national heritage, or life in America's cities."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Master of Ceremonies\\" has to calm down!","review":"Overall, this blu-ray is okay. It's just hard to sit and watch the main sponsor (which is the only reason I can guess that he's allowed to stay there; he also introduces each song) spaz out for the entirety of the concert. He's given a baton to seem somewhat worthwhile, but the real conductor can be seen in his official chambers. Besides that, this is close to 4 hours (you heard me!) long. Also, most songs played are from obscure Sony PS1 titles that only the guy and the 2 people each in the audience who said, \\"Whoo!\\" for had ever heard of. The origional LEGEND OF ZELDA theme is there, so I can't discredit it totally; but I can't recommend it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed at the lack of Final Fantasy finale","review":"The disc is good overall except Square Enix did not let them put Final Fantasy music at the end (which is actually advertised on the disc label sticker) which really ruined the climax of the concert.

People love it would like to get all related items as they are totally different good experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable","review":"it was fun listining to the music. been trying to go see it \\"live\\" but wife wouldnt go because its video games but it caught her attention and is willing to go if it ever makes its rounds again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family game","review":"We played this at a family party with lots of people of various ages.

If you don't know what the game is all about, let me tell you. Three or more people play, and the object is to guess what's written on a card. When it's your turn, everyone but you knows the answer. Everyone else's job is to give you really obscure clues and giggle like idiots while you sit there and look confused. Let me give you an example. These are some clues I received one time:-Mine is scary-Mine is wet-Mine needs sugar-Mine is yours-Mine never works-I got mine from my momIf you guessed hiccup remedy, then you must be the smartest person alive, and should probably buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of better games out there","review":"I bought this and Say Anything because they both had 4+ stars at the time with good review comments, but I'm disappointed with both. I love playing games like Apples to Apples, Mad Gab, Pictionary, Gestures, etc, these 2 games just didn't hold a candle to either. Everyone was bored within a few minutes.

Within three days of starting the 3 a day dose, I felt like myself again. I had energy, normal energy, I was sleeping great, I felt cheerful and NORMAL.Then the side effects kicked in. How do I put this delicately? The supplement gave me much intestinal discomfort and burning when passing stool. It was very uncomfortable and inconvenient. They I began getting floaters...you know when you \\"see\\" little spots floating around?I stopped the supplement and in 36 hours the side effects went away, but my exhaustion came back. I decided to try again, but reduce the dose to 1/3 the recommended, taking only one a day, I thought I could get my body used to it in a more gradual way.

I am not a wussie either, I regularly eat a handful of pills in one swallow, but these are not only HUGE but the coating is bad.

I'm not someone who's a casual supplement taker, I've taken some pretty large pills before, but these........well, they're huge. I managed to get two down, with a ton of water, gagging and near choking. I tried to cut them in half, but they were still too thick and became lodged in my throat. A really uncomfortable feeling and it took forever to get them down. I ended up throwing them out because there is no way I am going through that on a daily basis. Hats off to you if you can down them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle in a Bottle!","review":"I have had Fibromyalgia for many many years, & other than perscription meds, this product works miracles as far as I am concerned! It greatly reduced my pain level & that makes my daily life easier. I get breakthru pain at times, but if I wasn't taking Fibro-Response, they would most likely be full-blown Fibro flare-ups! The only problem I have with this product is the HUGE size of the pills...and you have to take 3 a day! I tried to split them in two & four and sometimes they crumble-splittng them does not even make them easier to swallow, the jagged edges still scratch my throat. HOWEVER, it's worth it to have that much pain relief, so I'll swallow my BIG pills like a big girl & hope the company, Source Naturals, decides to make this gem of a product in liquid form eventually!

However, it is not for me. 20 minutes after taking it, my entire body started to itch terribly, which is apparently an allergic reaction to the malic acid. I called my allergist to ask if I could take a smaller dose and perhaps desensitize myself to it over time, but she advised me to avoid it completely, that I might risk a more severe reaction next time. So the bottle goes in the garbage.What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up Oprah!","review":"Coetzee has proven himself worthy of a second Booker Prize with \\"Disgrace.\\" His language is detailed and specific, his tones layered with a plethora of moods. Specifically, his dialogue in reaction to the setting; the rural South African scenes in particular. Coetzee is not afraid to deal with the down-trodden thoughts of his characters nor the brutal realities of modern displacement. The main character, David, is both the protagonist and antagonist. He seeks to defy old age and the connotations that hinder it. A brilliant effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Full Impact of this Book Hit Me the Next Day","review":"I was so gripped by the crisis the characters were going thru while reading that the reality of this book didnt hit me...and hard...until I was driving down the street the next day. This is a brutal, powerful, beautiful, frustrating story that I expect will stay with me forever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I finished this book in a weekend. It is written in plain, simple language, and presents the life of a middle aged professor essentially going through a mid-life crisis in Cape Town, South Africa. Following an affair with a student at school, Lurie visits his daughter in the country to get away from the scandal. However, trouble follows, as Lurie and his daughter are subject to a racially motivated crime on her small farm. The crime leaves Lurie floundering, as he tries to pick up the pieces of his life.I thought this was a thought provoking book, and a very engrossing read. It raises questions and thoughts about the political and social atmosphere in South Africa today. Very worthy of the Booker Prize!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgrace indeed!","review":"I like the book because the uncontrollable lust, the nonchalence, the moral abandonment, and the callousness the old Professor shows in all his sexual encounters is met with severe punishment suffered by his own daughter. Retribution indeed. Disgrace on all sides indeed. I like the thought that \\"what goes around comes around\\".( )The book is definitely thought provoking. I thank the author for granting me a view of the modern African psyche. I am now reading another one of Coetzee's books - Boyhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read !","review":"One of the most realistic presentations of post-apartheid life in South Africa. We find the story of David Lurie and his daughter, Lucy, entwined with academic boredom, moralism, racial issues, rape and family dysfunctionality. There is something for everyone in this book. Particularly those who yearn for good literature. You won't be able to put this book down ! I couldn't.You may not not grow to like the characters, yet you will certainly get to know them in this powerful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Depressing","review":"In my quest to acquaint myself with well-regarded contemporary authors, I chose this particular work because it was a winner of the Mann Booker prize several years ago. What a disappointment. The reader is forced to follow the main character through a series of slimy encounters with the underside of South African life-prostitutes, rapists, family members in angst, caged dogs, and gangs of disaffected natives. The work begins and ends on sour notes and I was quite sour by the end.It will be a long time, if ever, before I attempt another novel by this author. There are numerous beautifully written works out there, many of which deal with angst in one form or another, and I am sorry that I wasted my time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader beware","review":"A very good book - but be advised that the subject matter is quite disturbing. The first time around, I was unprepared and had to put the book away for another day. I did pick it up later and finish - and it was definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, overrated book","review":"Let me first say that I love J.M. Coetzee, I think that Waiting for the Barbarians is one of the finest books I've ever read, and I think he is one of the finest living writers around, fully deserving of the Nobel prize.However, I hated Disgrace. I can appreciate the writing at times, but all I remember of the book is a disgusting, morally bankrupt main character, his fat daughter, pointless, unsatisfying sex and violence, and the fact that the book has a non-ending. It is all gloom and doom and misery, and we're supposed to accept this as a masterpiece. Ridiculous.I think this book is terrible and I'd encourage readers to explore his other books before they read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Yes, the book is beautifully written, but the subject matter is at best depressing: brutal rape, seemy sex, and bad family relationships. The characters are unlikable, and their realtionships frustratingly strained. There is nothing redeeming in this novel. One look at the number or used copies available will tell you that this book is very hard to love. As a Booker prize winner, this was a BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much worth reading","review":"The characters here are very intriguing - even though the main character (Lurie) isn't likeable you still are interested in his thoughts. Also shows the logic of non-Western attitudes and insights. The writing complements the emotions of the characters very well, and also allows the reader to empathize with each character's development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it, then sit, then think about it a few days later","review":"I picked up Disgrace because of its distinction as a Booker Prize winner, and like all winners of that award it is excellent. Coetzee has used a simple story, and a bare minimum of words to compose an extraordinarily thoughtful work. Because it is so subtle (and a very quick read) you're best served by reading straight through, putting it aside, and then revisiting the book a few days later when, as will surely happen, you are unable to put its haunting story out of your mind and you've developed a more pronounced emotional response to its warm notes and tragedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgrace","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book and I'm glad I read the book as my opinion on the main charater changed after reading the book. My impression of the main character....in the book....was of a man deeply flawed but not to the extent that Malkovitch portrayed him in the movie. I think that the South African accent came across as very stilted and this influenced my opinion of the man. In the book this was not so.I rate the book highly because it deals with a problem that is two-sided and does not seem ...to me ....to take a side one way or the other. A very introspective look at black/white relations in South Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and Beautiful","review":"\\"Disgrace\\" is a complicated, rich and disturbing book. It also challenges what we already know which, in my mind, is what literature (and art) should do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like spiders in a bottle","review":"A vibrant and many facetted story by one of todays most gifted authors. Coetzee offers several opportunities to deal with the delicate situation in South Africa a decade after the abolishment of apartheid. The reader can chose from a variety of methaporical images in order to accompolish his favourite solution. The self-absorbed and burnt-out scholar David Lurie shows no sensibility towards the mentality of the black population and gives in to the temptation of displacing his and the white mans disgrace by just leaving the country. The younger generation represented by his daughter Lucy seems to show more tolerance and stamina but has to make many sacrifices in order to establish a peaceful relationship between blacks and whites.The period of redistribution has begun."},{"rating":"1","title":"dirty old men","review":"It's kind of hard to feel sympathy for the protagonist of this novel, an old man who likes to bed young girls and worries that his status as a grandfather will make him unattractive.If dirty old men were exterminated, the world would be a better place. They should foist their sagging, decaying flesh on women their own age. I'm sorry I spent money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderfully Unappreciative","review":"Well, on a lark I purchased this book and read it quickly. I wasn't sure what to expect but forced myself through it. Definately not my element; I'm used to wizards and dragons and such--this sort of fiction to me I have not a whit of appreciaton for. Maybe I need to become more educated to apprecaite this work, but good lord I think I just wasted a solid 6 hours of my life reading that. Please, Mr. Coetzee, I know you're winning awards and all, but deliver us from this dreary reality and write about some dragons and wizards! I'm thinking in my blissful ignorance that the only people who would enjoy this book have to be the most boring old fossils this earth has produced. Anyway, back to being juvenile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do believe the hype.","review":"Disgrace is about a man who refuses to quench his desires in his relations to others, and then learns what happens when others refuse to quench their desires in relation to him. This novel has in some quarters been deemed \\"too bleak\\", but that's not the whole story. Even if it predicts a sad future for South Africa it is also saying that is never too late to mend. David Lurie's fall from grace is actually a blessing, and Disgrace could be described as a morality tale on how to find redemption and grace in a state of disgrace. Coetzee, although always the minimalist, has never written anything so precise, never been more to the point. Worth every award imaginable. Note the implicit refrences, among many, to literary meisterwerks as Kafka's The Trial and Thomas Mann's Death in Venice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer's Promise Unfulfilled","review":"In \\"Disgrace\\" David Lurie and his daughter Lucy were given realistic breath of life by Mr. Coetzee. I found the book masterfully written until the last few chapters. I believe the reader was cheated by the incomprehensible ending. I couldn't help thinking that Mr. Coetzee was under deadline and ended this once compelling, enlightening, unsettling study of a man, his daughter, and a changing world in the careless, unintelligible, and \\"too neat\\" manner that he did. I was very disappointed. I wanted to snatch away his \\"Booker Prize\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterly written pointless depression","review":"My first impression with this book was that it was extremely well written, everything that Coetzee choses to describe gives an extra dimension to the scene.After reading it though I was left with one feeling: Hate. I hated that the book left me with a lessened faith in humanity, feeling powerless to the evil things that go on in this world and the pathetic apathy, in lack of a better word, of the main person.Although masterly written, I deeply regret reading this book to such an extent that I want to prevent others from reading it. I wish I could say it gave me nothing, but it ruined some beautiful days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish but depressing","review":"The writing is beautiful, stylish and spare, edited to within an inch of it's life. The characterisation is in depth and achingly portrayed. His writing is indeed rich, but the subject matter could not have been more depressing. It's almost as if he went in search of the dark corners of life with a halogen lamp. Enough with the hopelessness, it wastes the glory of the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC'd into greatness","review":"This novel tackles an \\"important\\" subject -- race relations in South Africa. Somehow because of that, it gets elevated into greatness. It's a good novel, albeit a depressing one, with not very sympathetic characters. It seems to flow naturally, if depressingly along. But only the PC crowd, or those fascinated by train wrecks, will sing its praises."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"Disgraced Prof. Lurie, seeking respite in his daughter's rural homestead was victimized by a violent crime that shook his grasp of human relationships to the foundation. Coetzee's concise prose and understated plot of self discovery in the backdrop of racially conflicted S. Africa is a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of humanity","review":"Coetzee's Disgrace is about relationships in post-apartheid South Africa. Relationships that are viewed amoral by society yet happens frequently cross globe, relationships between man and his dog (the unconditional kind) and the very touching father-daughter relationship on which Coetzee focuses much of the book. It is deeply riveting more so because it is about us, the world we live in where sometimes it is not about finding solutions to problems but just letting it be. And what can I say about the prose...magical, a true treasure indeed. I have to add this part- Disgrace teaches you about the problem of conduct and governance in relation to western thought and philosophy. Contrast this with Hesse's Siddhartha that drives at the same problem in relation to eastern philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Spectacular But Though-Provoking","review":"A college professor is accused of seducing one of his students, and is resigns his position in disgrace. With his life somewhat out of control, he moves in with his daughter on her farm in a rural - and tumultuous - part of South Africa. There they are brutally attacked and each must come to terms with what has happened to them. This book is strangely disturbing and thought-provoking. The characters are not given much depth. In fact, it is difficult to say whether they are truly known or not. The ends without an ending as well. However, it is a story that stays with a reader. It is also an interesting study into life as a white person in South Africa and how the balance and blatant racism - on both sides - is prevelant. Not a book for those interested in pure entertainment, but for deeper reading, I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking, though painful \\"mid-life crisis\\" story...","review":"Very interesting story that follows a man in his mid-life. With youth slipping away the main character faces a number of rather sad (though note he is seeing it from a negative perspective) realizations.The book's actually a bit of a downer (I read it recenlt while on holiday in Bali. We rented a home there, and it included a small library. \\"Take or leave a book,\\" the owner of the house instructed, but, he wrote, do not remove \\"Disgrace\\").Naturally I was curious and read Disgrace. Not coincidentally, the owner of thes house where I stayed is about the same age as the lead character David (in the book), with a daughter (similar to David's daughter) about the same age as well.Read it (it is worth it and beautifully/thoughtfully written) but don't expect it to cheer you, especially the ending....darn, so easily it could have gone another way, allowing the reader to let out a breath of relief. Inside, you close the book and sadly wonder....."},{"rating":"2","title":"a chilling look at S.Africa today","review":"'Disgrace'by J.M.Coetze held me from the first page.At times horrified I couldn't put it down and will buy it.At first I was sympathetic to David and perhaps remained slightly so,but on rereading the book saw him as arrogant and insolent,The book was frightening in its revelation of the deep hatred felt by the blacks for the whites and I could see why so many of them have fled the country.I found the quality of the writing superb,spare,fast paced and beautiful in its depiction of the harshness of the land."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Disgrace\\" was my disgrace","review":"This book is interesting on the one hand, but in the whole the reading has been an agony. Contents are very controversial in addition, excitingly. In a very aggressive way J.M. Coetzee represents the situation in the today's south Africa. Throughout the novel the characters represent certain issues, South Africa has to deal with nowadays. Therefore \\"Disgrace\\" is a recommendation to those who are interrested in the present South Africa and its time after the abolishment of apartheid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 'Dsgrace, but pretty Awful'","review":"This author can write, but he wastes his talent by making characters act in a non credible way(and I mean non credible even for the character). I do not beleive an intelligent man would not read the charges at his university tribuneral, even if he is going to plead guilty (they could say anything). I do not beleive once he saw the people who had gang raped his daughter he did not call the police. His daughter, originally a strong minded individual turns into a pathetic punchbag. This might be understandable if she was in denial about the rape, but she chooses to embrace the event, staying in the same place, WITh the the people who did it. Im fine with a book that does not have a happy ending or discusses the just transfer of powers in South Africa, but this book was a mess and just not creidble"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detatched and a little pompous","review":"This book certainly makes sense in its own terms. Like all his fiction it deals with South African politics through contemporary philosophy. But it feels like the events aren't unfolding as they do in real life, which is not always in accordance with philosophical literary theoretical models.The book therefore feels somewhat pompous as a result.The characters never approach anything that is substantial. This is probably why he is able to create such a purely philosophical novel.The author clearly has a very detatched perspective on the world and perhaps prefers the safety of books and ideas to real events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgust","review":"Nobel Prize (...). They picked Yassir Arafat too, and then nominated George Bush Jr. This depressing, tedious tale plods through a joyless life of joyless sex and academic constipation. The dramatic thrust, if you can call it that, comes at the end, with our \\"hero's\\" final realization that it's okay to kill dogs, or maybe it's only necessary, or maybe killing dogs represents his liberation from something or other. I think a better ending could have occurred on page 2, with Professor Lurie hanging himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booker Badly","review":"A very disappointing while extraordinary depressing Novel. As an Ex-South African Coetzee's Book is a constant reminder to me that all to often Critic's award rubbish with accolades. I am not entirely sure how these Booker Prizes are handed out but perhaps the Educators are the same dim-wits that give the likes of Desmond Tutu a Nobel Peace Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a Bad Taste, Read This","review":"There must be redemeeming material in this novel, as it is esteemed already. However, I could not find it. More simply, it left me with a bad taste. All characters are pathetic and in my eye, found no redemption. This is based on gut feeling alone, obviously: ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"I found this book very depressing. The storyline was very poor, nothing really happens in the end - and the main character David Lurie i had nothing in common with. How it won the Booker prize prize i'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgrace Book Review","review":"An interesting book dealing with an alienated man and his conflicts and understandings of the social structures and objectives of different groups of South African society as well as his struggles with his own personality issues. Not an entertaining book, rather a book of conflict and understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Africa - what a nice place to stay","review":"The novel \\"Disgrace\\" by J.M.Coetzee is set in South Africa. It is about the fall of David Lurie, a university professor,who fell for and then fell because of his sinful conduct to women. \\"Disgrace\\" deals with life in the time after apartheid, the conflict between black and white, between guilt and responsibility. It is also about the conflict between the sexes and asks implictly the question if a peaceful communication between the sexes is possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly disturbing","review":"This is a story of a society that has fallen apart at the seams--if you have ever visited South Africal (I have) and been impressed by its seeming progress, good roads, Western style hotels, etc., read this book for a very different view. It is hard to understand what motivates the daughter in this book--perhaps in the end it's survival instincts, or atonement. If you're looking for a standard \\"good read\\"--this isn't it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will put you in a bad mood and crush your spirit.","review":"Another example of \\"literature\\" that gets that moniker by virtue of being dark, depressing, anxiety producing and pointless. It has the most flagrantly negative ending since Romeo and Juliet which is a roaring comedy in comparison. If you enjoy that, you may get off on reading this annoying, condescending, purposefully grim little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"J M Coetzee provides amazing insight.He engages you in a downhill journey of a middle age protaganist who is quickly going to seed. He deals with the moral issue with finesse, where you end up empathising with the protaganist for his courage. He pays fully for his sins, and that in a way is his redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Read","review":"It is the frist time I read a book as bleak as this,the characters so despondent,so helpless ,so complex and above all so human. The author portrays how easy it is to fall in the rut, to give up fighting and to resign to our fate.He makes us face facts and facets of human character we are not comfortable with.The book haunts long after we have finished reading it.A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change brings pain, loss...","review":"Curious to know about life in the 'new' South Africa, and still eager to read those books that transport me to a form of life not my own, I sat down to read this recent Booker Prize-winning novel; it made a deep and abiding impression on me, because it is so replete with moments of exquisite pain and almost bridegroom tenderness. Other reviewers have supplied a synopsis of the plot, so I will resist the lure to summarize for the umpteenth time, but I do want to say that the protagonist is a complex man with complex motives, making him one of the most fascinating and engaging characters I have \\"encountered\\" in a very long time -- moody, introspective, seemingly recalcitrant, capable of love and concern, even if at a distance, and not at all unaffected by the momentous societal shifts taking place all around his fragile frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly simplistic work from a master writer","review":"I think Coetzee is a brilliant writer and Michael K is an astonishing book but few books have ever disappointed me as much as this one. As an allegory of post apartheid South Africa this book is a nasty mess. It is not reasonable to ask Coetzee to present an optimistic or hopeful vision but for readers who don't know South Africa and cannot put this book's racial politics into some kind of context, this will only reinforce the sense that the new government/social order is no better than the old one--just new masters exacting revenge from the old ones in the most sickening ways. In spite of all the real problems that South Africa has, that is not a fair conclusion. If you find this book compelling, ask yourself why that is. Does it provide a comforting sort of message that everyone is racist and that only animals really deserve our love and concern?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace a typo for Despair?","review":"I was deeply disturbed by this novel. I dislike David for he \\"never got it.\\" He rationalized his actions in lofty romantic Byronic terms, and he never once realizes that he too has committed rape because he mislabels it as desire. He even goes on to say how it enriched his life and \\"hers\\"? Yet that line of reasoning is left behind when his own daughter experiences rape by three black men because of the \\"violent\\" overtones. There is no redemption even though he has opportunities to redeem himself. His daughter Lucy also makes extremely bad choices that are not redemptive in any way. I realize many people never \\"get it\\", but I thought the reason literature existed is to show us those moments of illumination in the human psyche. This was too despairing for me. His life is empty because he is unable to see the richness, and he has passed on that inability to his daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to modern literature","review":"How disgraceful it is for this book to have received a Booker. The Lurie character's blatant lack of regard for women and his utter misunderstanding of sexuality is a disgrace. If such a book can receive such high acclaim today, then feminism still has far to go. I am saddened that other reviewers failed to express any concern for the portrayal of women in this book. Even the charater Lucy was troubling. Her actions did not seem consistent with her ideals. Further, I did not find the prose compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing - don't bother","review":"At first this book shows geat potential with the possibilty of an interesting plot.... which goes nowhere. David goes from one depressing situation to another and learns nothing from his past mistakes. Don't bother reading this for fun. I kept reading hoping that something interesting would happen. It was like sitting through a bad movie hoping that something good was going to unfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain, echoing, repetitive.","review":"Plain, echoing, repetitive. Anyone familiar with recent events in South Africa would not be surprised by the story. Poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkable","review":"Remarkable.Remarkable that this book won a Booker Prize.I've been meaning to read Coetzee for some time, after seeing the prizes he's won, and had high expectations. Perhaps this is not considered one of his better works, but based on other reviews, I see that inexplicably, some people actually liked this book.The characters were not only dislikeable, but completely unrealistic.We're to believe that Lucy after being gang-raped, would continue to live on her farm, even though she acknowledges that in so doing, she is likely to be attacked again.The lectures on English literature made the novel even harder to bear.I find it a Disgrace that such a novel wins the Booker Prize, when other greater novels such as Rohinton Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\" or Margaret Atwood's \\"Oryx and Crake\\" do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Buzz?","review":"I heard a lot about this book and felt that I was missing something by not reading it. I don't get it. I found the protagonist to be difficult to identify with. I found other characters not well developed--so I could not \\"feel\\" for them. The topic of rape was touched on--but there was no resolution for me the reader. I understand that part of the story was a documentary on life in South Africa--so in that I can appreciate some of the plot and conflict within the story. Perhaps you will enjoy the story more if you have visited the area. The one saving grace for the book was the fact that it had a theme regarding the dangerous consequences of bad judgement. We have all been in situations that didn't seem to \\"be a big deal\\" but later ended up being ordeals. This is a good example of a bad decision costing much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"This arch, posturing novel is bloodless, unaffecting, prissy-pants, and reeks of falsity. No fictional reality is created; instead, there is a haphazard, tossed-off quality. Most of the events are drained white of any drama or power, presumably purposely. I need to reread Tom Sharpe's big-hearted South Africa books, Riotous Assembly and Indecent Exposure, to cleanse my palate of this pinched, fussy thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally depressing","review":"I found this book to be totally depressing. The killing of dogs left me with nightmares. This book may have been well written but I was depressed for days after I read it. If you want to be depressed by all means read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with \\"a reader\\" from Albuquerque NM...","review":"who says that this book is \\"a time bomb of nastiness.\\"Hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reflections of a middle-aged white man in South Africa","review":"Disgrace can only be viewed as reflections of a middle aged white man(disgraced and alienated) in modern South Africa. As a South African I thought it one long whinge that shows the character (authors?) sense of displacement and inability to understand the plight of women, animals and black people. An unreediming inferiority trip dressed up in pretty words still remains only that. It should appeal to all other white middle aged men experiencing a whane in popularity and power. Why it won the Booker raises some questions about the age and skin colour of the judges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewilderingly overrated.","review":"I'm sorry. I don't understand this man's standing. He has won more Bookers than anyone else, which means he's better than Rushdie, MacEwan, Byatt, right? I have to be missing something - the prose is determinedly mediocre, the treatment of violence and its effects is crass, the analysis of modern South Africa unenlightening. The main character is less offensive than a bore. It's not all bad - the university showtrial is genuinely frightening, and the passages about the dogs, with their mixture of horror, tenderness and emotional blankness are almost moving. More of this and it could have been a tolerable novel, but, once again vast social and gender issues are reduced to the self-pity of a middle-class white male."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgrace","review":"Disgrace is not a new book, but I had never read it. Although it is quite a short novel, it is a fascinating story. It takes place in South Africa shortly after the end of apartheid. The story begins with the disgraceful behavior of a professor and end with violence against his daughter. The atmosphere in which these things happen is filled with a sense of longing for the past, which, although filled with bad decision, was ordered and predictable. I would,(and have) recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This is a classic. Dramatic and entertaining. The cast includes Marlon Brando and the rest of the cast do an excellent job. The acting, the sets, and the story are superbly done. The movie is very accurate historically.This movie is truly legendary. What I can't stand is people criticizing it for reasons that are not true. If you are going to criticize a movie, at least get your facts straight. Surely this is one of the greatest movies ever made about Christopher Columbus, like a fine wine it seems to get better with age. I look forward to watching it every year during Columbus day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad the Earth Wasn't Flat After All....","review":"because then, if Columbus had indeed fallen over the edge, we could all have been spared this miserable movie.Poor me, I knew things were going to be bad before the opening credits had ended, because only then did I learn that Tom Selleck was going to be in it. And guess as whom? Ferdinand of Aragon! This odd casting brought to mind episodes of Fantasy Island. But there was a Big Name included too; Marlon Brando as Torquemada, Spanish Inquisitor and Advisor to Ferdinand and Isabella. More prostitution of his talent for Brando.I guess it takes some talent to make one of the most important events in history seem so boring and hackneyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I was asked to watch this movie over the summer for my AP US History class. Basically, I was watching it for the historical aspect. However, historical it was not. I'd say this movie was written by a romance novelist, rather than a historian.Lucky me, I was treated to Columbus banging his wife and what not on several occasions. How about the men fighting over the Indian women...that was nice too.What I failed to see was the actual effects of the voyage. Where was the disease? I mean come on, this wasn't a Carnaval Cruise, traveling across the ocean in 1492 is some serious stuff. I also loved how they had guys fighting each other on the ships with their little plots. Thats realistic... Hmmmm, lets kill Columbus because um, it, um, adds drama and suspense.Give me a break. I'd hate to be the one that paid $7.50 to see this in the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch at your own risk","review":"Most people at some point or another catch the drift that Columbus landed in San Salvador and is credited with dicovering the Americas. Now comes this movie to show us how. For some reason certain historical events do not translate onto the screen, and this is one of them. The problem with this movie is that it takes an already difficult subject matter and makes it even worse. I give it two stars because it is barable to a comic level. If you understand that it is bad you could enjoy certain parts, such as Tom Sellick as the King of Spain. Brando fans should stay clear of this one because his role is small and of no consequese and leaves you then with just a bad flick. If this historical event intrests you, I recommend 1492, it is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely nothing to recommend here......","review":"The historical equivalent of a comic book, this incomprehensible waste of time is bound to be seen as Brando's worst ever screen appearance (it might also be said of Tom Selleck, but when has he had a good one?) Boring, inaccurate (the streets of the 15th century have never looked so clean), and acted with all the fire of a high school play, the film never escapes its lamebrained script. Okay, let's get back to Brando: what was he thinking? Does he need to remind us of how far he has fallen since his glory days in the 1950s?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost laughable if it weren&#65533;t so bad.","review":"I've walked out on two films during my lifetime, and this was the first. The only other film I ran from was \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\". Ridiculously cast with horrible direction and an awful script (hey, you new screenwriters out there, if this thing can hit the big screen there has to be hope in selling yours) Chris, and his discovery, should have stayed undiscovered. Painfully, I sat in my seat in utter disbelief for almost an hour (historical accuracy or not). I turned to my lady friend and asked her if she wanted to leave. Turns out she was just as miserable as I and accepted readily. Between 1 and 10, this turkey gets the lowest possible mark, a 1. Stay away from this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful ridiculous and even embarrising","review":"Marlon Brando is terrible. He makes me sick when I watch his late work.

That's an excellent description of what type film this is. It's too bad this film is so misunderstood, but I'm glad somebody other than me enjoyed it. This is a very entertaining film that perfectly captures the spirit of classic adventure movies of the past. It's really far better than it's reputation suggests. I enjoyed it from start to finish and look forward to seeing it again. Just don't expect a documentary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Christopher Columbus: The Disaster\\"","review":"Mind-numbingly awful \\"historical drama\\" recommended only to Marlon Brando completists. In his 1994 autobiography, Brando had no qualms admitting that he earned $5 million for \\"an embarrassingly bad performance\\" as Torquemada.

With almost 500 pages devoted to defining accounting terminology out of a 1,000 page book, Siegel/Schim should have titled it \\"An Accounting Dictionary with some shallow chapters on Accounting.\\" The remaining 500 pages gave only a shallow review of accounting procedures. Space dedicated to business accounting is lost because there is a chapter on doing personal tax returns and one on personal financial planning. This personal aspect doesn't belong since the book's title, \\"Accounting Handbook\\" implies business accounting. Now if the authors are trying to connect a business owner's decisionmaking with his personal planning, than why were there no chapters on partnership and corporate tax planning or income tax preparation? The chapter on non-profits was a terribly short 15 pages long.

The first 19 pages have some useful information with the exception of a slightly misleading table of Paris arrondissements on page 11. The rest of the book consists in lists of tours, stores, cafes, etc that most good guide books cover. I didn't check all of the lists, but the book mentioned Felix Potin as a local supermarket chain. When I was last in Paris in 1998 Felix Potin had closed all of its stores in Paris. Since this book was published in 1999, I would carefully check any information before depending on its accuracy.

After she read prophetic words from a Charismatic conference in the 1970s, she witnessed these words resurfacing again and again over the years. Joyce shares her interpretation of these words by relating many of her own personal experiences, as well as the experiences of others she interviewed as part of her research. Having come from a dysfunctional home where alcohol was the norm, Joyce takes these words seriously. Joyce has learned that personal challenges in her life have afforded her the opportunity be become better, not bitter. She offers the reader the same opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defend Clinton?","review":"Man, this is tough. I am not a fan of recent presidents, Clinton included. However, this is a bit over the top. Why in this country can we not accept that things like a center fuel tank exploding, as heartbreakingly ordinary as it sounds, could be the cause of a jet crashing into the sea? Yes, I did read this book, but even though the information is presented in a compelling way (hence 2 stars as opposed to one) it is , as far as I can tell, an example of the authors believing something to be so going in, and interpreting certain things to prove it. I would never say that the authors are cynical and mindless and lying to prove a point. They seem passionate in their beliefs and I have no doubt they are concerned what the ramifications of what they believe happened would be going forward. I just don't believe that what they believed happened happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage in Garbage out.","review":"This is another attempt to try and profit from tragedy.First it was the Navy who supposedly shot down TWA Flight 800 and tried to cover it up.

If you are just starting out in tile-making it would be an excellent choice. There are a LOT of different decorating techniques, and a very wide range of applications. The book is laid out well, with plenty of photos, so you can see finished examples of the techniques being described in the text below on the page. It would be an excellent beginner-to-novice book.Personally, I prefer Frank Giorgini's \\"Handmade Tiles\\", because it has more technical information, glaze recipes, firing information, etc., but if I were starting out to make tiles on my own and taking them elsewhere for firing, I think Pozo's book would be a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY nice, overall primer to tile making. BEGINNERS will love this book!","review":"I have been accumulating ceramic tile books for some time, and this one is very good as a beginner volume showing several differing techniques on how to make your own tiles, as well as paint and fire existing tiles. It shows how to make differing shapes, how to glaze & carve, as well as how to properly install what you've created.

Not just for making tiles or mosaics... what this book teaches could be expanded into making jewelry, table tops, one of a find mosaics, walk ways, counter tops and more. Great step by step teaching and filled with photos to make learning easier, A great reference book if you are new to clay or wanting to add something different in your jewelry making. Worth every dime I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making and Installing Handmade Tiles","review":"Very good info, and enough of it was unique enough to make it well worth purchasing over some of the other Tile How-to books.

She covers the process from beginning to end, explaining the basics of each step very well. There are lots of photos -- and in good quality -- to follow each step. The book covers how to avoid common tile problems, such as warping. Pozo's techniques are not always dependent on having lots of equipment to make tiles. She shows how to make tiles using a rolling pin, as well as on a slab roller. Bullnose tile can be made with an extruder or by bending the clay over wood forms. Pozo also describes mosaic installation, using a detailed numbering system.

Spike Lee is not a brilliant filmmaker. He clearly has racist views that he feels the need to display on film. Jungle Fever is the story of a black man who has an affair with an Italian woman. When their affair is found out, everyone is up in arms. The woman is accused of stealing the Black Man. Black women sit around dissing her when Flipper's (Snipes) wife needs to be questioning her husband. Last I checked, the ring was on Flipper's finger. The very idea that these women can sit around dogging white people and it be deemed ok is deplorable to me. As a young black female, I was disgusted at this image. Queen Latifah's portrayal of that waitress was even worse.This movie is disgusting and it is a very good example of irresponsible filmmaking.

And I admire Spike for having the guts to do something like this. But there was some truly overt racism in this film. The candy-shop guys you'd expect. But the little \\"sistuh-fest\\" was every bit as racist as Annabelle's father was, and maybe more so. The weak link here was Lonette; she was WAY too into hystronics, exaggeration and over-reaction.

Yet as fine as they may be, this film is hardly convincing. The romance between Snipes and Sciorra is not particulary invigorating, the premise is contrived, the metaphorical, two-dimensional atmosphere Spike tries to create is really farcical, and the whole thing is handled rather uncharismatically. Not to mention, it's doggedly overlong and pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"The part I Hated the most in this dumb movie was when one of the brothers she was staying with said F--- all born again christians.

No cliche is beneath it, even eating chinese take out from the box with chopsticks so you know it's New York. The male lead is, are you ready? an architect. Uh huh, Hi Honey, I'm home from \\"the office\\".This is the kind of laziness where the artist claims to be turning the cliches on their head, ironically. That's enough of an insult to our intelligence but Spike goes further, claiming to challenge our attitudes about race by, you guessed it, employing racial stereotypes."},{"rating":"2","title":"this film be slammin!","review":"This movie is a classic- one of my favorite modern films.

This widely considered the best of the four stories released in the Brave Archer series. There are fantasticasl moments that really provide the escapism some viewers so desperately crave. Then there are the extremely well crafted hand to hand choreographed fights eg. the fight initial between Lee Yi Min and fu Sheng is great. Then there are touching moments eg. when Fu Sheng offers his only protection against the cold winter climate to a young beggar. The fantastical, with Fan Mei Sheng as snake lord, and the blind witch who is justifiably feared by ALMOST everyone. Peach Blossom Forest is a tribute to true escapism and the three fingered drunken monk played by the immortal, Ku Feng is perfect. You actually sense the air of respect the duo have for him through fear of uncertainty. This is a wonderful film and a must have for any self respecting kung fu fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACE to Shaw Brother & All Other Kungfu Movies!!!","review":"This movie deserves 0 stars but unfortuanitly i have to put 1 (-_-)THIS IS NOT A KUNGFU MOVIE!!!its a Corny-Ass love story(on sum Titanic iSh)with [...] characters,a stupid plot(that totally switches up!OMGosh the moviestarts off with a decent(martial arts)story but as soon as this guymeets a girl EVERYTHING CHANGES!& the original story is abandoned.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"This sander is fine!","review":"I read some of the reviews stating how bad this sander was... do you know how cheap this is for a Makita Belt Sander?

I've always been happy with Makita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Sander","review":"Ordinarily you use a belt sander to remove a fair amount of stock otherwise you would use a random orbital or finish sander.

Spend the bucks for a better quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about an hour - sparks were flying!","review":"I purchased this sander to do some medium duty sanding/stripping on doors and woodwork. Overall, it was a tight little sander, very comfortable to hold and operate. The belts, like on the other Makita models, were easy to load and use. Material removal was decent, but the 5.6 A motor may be too small for the weekend wannabe contractor. The 5 belts that came with it were a good selling point, too.But after only an 45 min to an hour of use, the motor began to spark at high rpm and no load. White sparks were visible through the motor vent on the side, and there was a definite loss of motor torque. This went along with a popping sound coming from the sander (and my lights flickering in my house). I'm guessing the motor was shorting to the brushes at high speed.Needless to say, I was very disappointed in this tool and luckily was able to return it. I would opt for a higher amp motor and a different brand sander like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job","review":". No problems, quick delivery. Book was as promised, it was in good condition.

I still love No Sweeter Love, Gotta Good Thing, the title song and Good Old Days, which he wishes things now would be like then, even in this modern Internet crazy world we're in now. Gerald brought soulful vocals on every song here, even the more uptempo songs. I still think that his best moments are in the ballads.

Not just awful - amateurish. Superman's face is often mis-shapen - not in any creative way - it looks just sloppily drawn.

It turned out to be a lot more than I expected. It shows us why Superman won't finish off the vilians for good. Why he can't be judge and jury and passing final judgement on crooks. It was the classic good vs. evil story with lots of twists and turns I didn't expect. This movie is not for small kids, but more for teenagers or adults who appreciate the genre. It was well written and the conflict was very well thought out. It's from a story that was a graphic novel. The story is condensed quite a bit. That doesn't make it any less entertaining.

Through the whole torturous event I kept hoping another masked crusader would come to the aide of Superman, if only to save him from this dragging dialog. My son, who loves this stuff was asleep before the first action scenes. Which was lucky, since the antagonist decided to start spewing his unnecessary expletives as soon as the violence ramped up. There is a feel to comics, when they leap from page to screen, or from mental concept to visual experience. Unfortunately, this film never even came close, starting with the hard edged art work.

As a believer in \\"simple is best\\" when it comes to real-life self-defense, I found this book to be refreshing. This text deals with how to use the body's natural weapons for practical self-defense. I agree with the author's point that it is easier to learn practical self-defense than it is to learn a formal martial art like Karate. This text focuses only on defending yourself when unarmed. It is important to realize that nothing takes the place of learning from an competent self-defense instructor; however, this book would be of value when combined with actual hands-on training.Rating: 5 stars.

For the Basics","review":"I would suggest this book, along with the others of the Black Medicine series, to anyone interested in self-defense. However, I would also point out that self-defense is a way of life, and not just something that can be simply picked up from a book.

Pure disaster.Certainly the most disappointing album by Ms. Warwick. Not even the great Cole Porter save the disc. One may say she is great as always, I cannot disagree.Maybe the budget was small and so the producers gave birth to this completely neglectable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre to poor Cole Porter renditions","review":"The better songs on this collection are, at best, mediocre. The lesser ones are truly poor. The production sounds much too slick, synthesized, and contrived. I'm not sure why Ms. Warwick decided to take this too often travelled road of covering Cole Porter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embrassingly Bad!","review":"This must be one of the worst albums of all times. It truly makes some of Nancy Wilson's Japanese market recordings from the 80's look positively artistic. The Oompah-pah orchestrations make the Cole Porter tunes sound like German polkas. As for Dionne's \\"interpretations\\", she sings Cole Porter as she has never ever heard these songs before. Not only does she lack any feeling for singing Broadway tunes, but her delivery is shockingly bad. She sings these songs as if she doesn't understand English, and is simply phoneticizing a foreign tongue. Her version of \\"I got you under my skin\\" is destined to be a cult classic. She has obviously never heard this song before, and her delivery is so horrible, that it made me laugh out loud. Only buy this CD if you really enjoy truly trashy music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dionne's tribute to Cole Porter.","review":"This is a very fine (if at times misguided) concept album. Dionne's renditions of these all-time classics may not be as mind-blowing or as timeless as those of Ella Fitzgerald or Sarah Vaughan but Dionne was never a Jazz singer. That aside, most of these songs are definitely enjoyable and straddle the fence between Smooth Jazz and MOR-Pop and it's obvious that both Dionne and her producer Arif Mardin did the best they could. Sadly, this album was very poorly promoted by Arista Records and failed to get greater exposure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This book was simply wonderful.

In comparison, I prefer the original 3M Scotch brand. Performance-wise, I would give it 3 stars, however considering it is more expensive than the Scotch brand which I think performs better, I knock it down to 2 stars. For general-purpose work, I prefer Scotch, which I would give 4 stars, and if I'm really worried about performance and a tight seal/bleeding, I would use Frog tape which I think is also cheaper (depending on where you buy it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I am an artist, so I need tape to hold down my paper when I'm painting, as well as for masking areas. The Intertape 91400 worked beautifully for both purposes. It is easy to dispense by hand, and I could cut it to various shapes for masking purposes. When I finished painting, I was able to take it off without any problems, and it left the crisp line that I had masked without any residue. I also tested it on my wall, as recommended on the package, and it worked beautifully. In addition, it is made in the USA - Yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked well for what I needed it for.","review":"I did not use this as tape for painting. Instead, I used it to tape liquids personal hygiene products to prevent spilling during our holiday trip. Even though certain bottles have caps or locking mechanisms to prevent spillage, I always find that I have to tape them for better protection. The downside to that is that removing really sticky tape is annoying and often strips the writing on some bottles. This painting tape worked perfectly. For some bottles I had to put plastic over the top of them (small Ziploc bags) and then put the tape around that, taping the bag tightly to the bottle. For others I just put the tape directly onto the bottle. It is easy to tear, it stayed in place during the trip, and was easily removed. Best of all, it didn't strip any of my plastic or glass bottles of any writing or paper labels. Very nice tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonably Decent Masking Tape","review":"As an amateur, I only occasionally use masking tape. For years I used the beige garbage that only marginally worked. Now I have been using the \\"green\\" (from another company) tape, and it works very well. This tape has medium adhesion, maybe a bit on the light side, but it works reasonably well (as in the title of this review). The tape seems a bit thin, but it doesn't snap or tear all that easily (in fact, you really need scissors to cut it right, doing it by hand is an off/on experience). It does come off relatively easily if you get to it in a day or two. I don't know how it would be if left on for weeks. In sum it works satisfactorily, and it is not overly expensive. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cadillac of tapes","review":"I know how to get good masking performance out of cheap painters tape. gently feather the edge of the tape with the slightest amount of tape and let it dry and seal the edge of the tape for a few minutes.But you still have to deal with tape that tears wrong or tends to bleed anyway; that does not stick or sticks too much.This tape is thin and adheres closely to fairly uneven surfaces. It comes off after days, even when stuck to metal. It is as good as Frog tape for preventing bleeds, but sticks better. Its thinness allows for precision.Price is a different matter. I would use this tape for difficult surfaces and situations, and use the cheap stuff elsewhere.Update: Not the purpose for which it is intended, but I used some of this tape to seal plastic sheeting against an exterior wall to protect some electric timers for the Christmas lights. A month later it peeled away smoothly in one piece from the paint having maintained a good seal and still sticky. Pretty good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great painter's tape","review":"I find a lot of uses for this stuff around the house. It of course excels at its intended purpose (masking edges while painting) but it also works well as an alternative to duct tape when you want to simply secure a plastic painter's tarp, hang a note on the wall, label something temporarily, or attach anything light to something else in a manner that will not leave a mark or sticky residue. This tape is sticky enough to do its job without being gummy. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a hostage to fortune","review":"this is, with out a doubt, one of the best non-fiction adventure books ever written.

I do understand physics, which does. Kuhn was not really a working scientist, and cannot describe what scientists do (see, however, the beautiful essays on creativity by Einstein, Hadamaard, and Poincare).

I say it shouldn't, but YOU have to say one way or the other; you can't have it BOTH ways.We are also admonished to make allowances for its age: \\"You had to be there.\\" Possibly, but it seems to me after a certain elapsed time, you can pretty much get away with saying this about anything.As it happens, I am not at all impressed by this book's content. Its ideas seem to me stale, simple-minded, and just plain wrong-headed. That isn't why I've given it one star only though. I've given it one star only because it is very, very, very clumsily written.

In actuality, Jared is the son of an earl and he's interested in a diary Olympia's uncle has sent her, but it's his interest in Olympia that has him pretending to be a tutor.Deception is an enjoyable read. Jared and Olympia are likable, fully rounded characters. The plot is full with so many events, it's difficult to sum up. It's not the most exciting book--nor is it the dullest. Unique characters and a full plot make it worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time for US developers","review":"I completely agree with the reviewer that mentions the book is very Euro-centric.

A semi-technical proofreader could see that there are many discrepancies, which by chapter 3 had me second-guessing nearly everything that was said. Even worse, the software that comes with this book seems to require a license which is not provided, which makes it useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Native American rights a wrong.","review":"Charles Bronson is the best at what he does - get revenge.

This is a serious look into a world of blinded cruel men that meets their fate appropriately.Bronson prescence makes the stoic half-apache a hunter instead of the hunted seem very real.Palance plays a ex-civil war officer wrapped in all the glory of the confederate army. The only thing is they lost and his blinders stay on until it's too late.If you like dark westerns, this is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising complex \\"old\\" western","review":"If you like stoic Bronsonesque action movies, you will enjoy Chato's Land. There is surprisingly good character development which shows how much trouble you can create by blind hatred combined with arrogance. The movie presents Bronson at his best in great physical condition manipulating the posse obsessed with killing him. The supporting cast is excellent with Richard Basehart, Jack Palance and James Whitmore. This movie is well worth your time and deserves being listed as a Classic Western."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chato's Land DVD","review":"Excellent film if you think the indians were grossly mistreated by us, and I do. Here they got some much deserved revenge, and justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feedback from Real Apache \\"Calculus Wiz\\"","review":"I saw a few scenes and couldn't even continue watching. I like a lot of Charles Bronson's movies. Examples include \\"Death Hunt,\\" the 80s \\"Death Wish\\" series, and \\"the White Buffalo.\\" But his acting in this movie is unrealistic. He does not act like a real Apache. Bronson seems to overdo it on being \\"stoic.\\" A relative and I watched a few scenes and just switched channels. Bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real Apache. Paul Newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an Apache-raised white man in \\"Hombre,\\" which I purchased on Amazon. I do applaud Bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the Apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the 1880s. Given the time period, perhaps Bronson should have hired Roman Gabriel instead. He does a realistic job of portraying a Cherokee Indian in the \\"Undefeated,\\" which was also released around the same time (give or take a couple of years)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is indeed, Chato's Land","review":"Excellent western which follows a posse on the trail of an Apache halfbreed (Bronson). While he is an omnipresent aspect of the story, Bronson has few lines, and is not on-screen for more than a few minutes in the entire film. The story is primarily about the posse, a mixed bag of local citizens, civil war veterans, and sadistic racists. Their steady deterioration into basal chaos is the real crux of the movie. There are both good and bad men among them, and their interactions make the film compelling, in spite of a few flaws. The skilled cast includes Jack Palance, Simon Oakland, Richard Basehart, Ralph Waite, Victor French, Richard Jordan and James Whitmore. Strongly recommended for fans of gritty action and well-drawn characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review of the DVD not the Movie!","review":"Very disappointing transfer! It was very badly washed out, grainy, overly dark and looked like an old VHS recording off the TV. It played VERY badly on my blu-ray player (the picture quality). This DVD reminds me of the movies small stations buy from the studios on the cheap and used to broadcast late at night. There's also the fact that this movie was badly censored.

Her atonal venue seems to try to mask her poetic words. As I listened, I felt as though I were the acrobat feeling the highs and lows of the circus swing. That she not only composed the music, but also the poetry, is more than commendable. Nyro and Schoenberg must smile when they hear her work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the tonedeaf","review":"I'm warning anyone who can distinguish notes off-key: DO NOT PLAY THIS CD.As many as 50% of the notes sung by Peacock are flat (the rest are mediocre), and you don't need to have perfect pitch for a painful experience of listening to \\"an acrobat's heart\\".It doesn't help that the instrumental accompaniment is sparse, but at least there was no attempt made to cover up the monotones with flashy cadenzas and jazz riffs.If you're tone deaf, then go ahead and buy it. The lyrics aren't that bad, and the atmosphere created is rather ethereal, in a droning sort of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Students of Czech history: read this book now!","review":"This highly readable book is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in the roots of the dissident movement in communist Czechoslovakia. Tucker describes the philosophical heritage of key members of Charter 77 with amazing clarity. He also does a great job of explaining the political and historical context of their thoughts.Please note that the book is not an encyclopedic account of Czech dissident thought. \\"From Patocka to Havel\\" in the title might better be phrased \\"OF Patocka AND Havel,\\" since the work of other Czech dissidents are mentioned mostly in reference to these two men's theories.

You want to laugh with them or cry with them. When they get mad you are ready to do battle to save the world.

Clive Cussler brings the old struggle back to life with Dirk Pitt on a dangerous treasure hunt of ancient riches. Great reading. Why? Mr. Cussler is a master of the English language and it is delightful to read his style of language not to mention his art of suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed Cussler more in my teens","review":"I was an avid Cussler fan until I turned about sixteen. Now, at 28, I realize that I was too young to know any better! Cussler writes the most awkward, stilted dialogue imaginable. The historical diatribes by the archaeologists Kelsey and Rodgers, while interesting, read more like an encyclopedia article than a piece of dialogue. And the ubiquitous English/metric conversions throughout the book become tiresome in the extreme. (Pitt: \\"That boat is about 200 feet away.\\" Giordino: \\"Gee, Dirk, that's over 60 meters!\\") Good escapism/bathroom reading type stuff.

I had to put the book away when a cia team of anthropologists entered the plot. Give me a break, people with PhDs being foreign spies. That's so laughable.

This book was given to me in its unabridged audio version, and I now believe that you get a different perspective by listening, rather than reading, this man's books. It now seems obvious to me that he he leads (how shall I put this without upsetting the younger readers), an 'alternative lifestyle' that lets him see men from a position outside the norm. His descriptions of Pitt; piercing eyes, broad shoulders, animal grace, etc., etc. are all things that you might hear on Castro Street in San Francisco. He may want to start writing gourmet cookbooks, travelogue brochures, and/or style and wardrobe articles. He appears to know more about all of these things than he does about the relationships between men and women.

What a waste of time. I can't believe I kept with it and finished it. Parts of it were so badly written that it was funny.

The action continues on throughout the whole novel, with some very silly violence thrown in when Dirk Pitt meets Tupac Amaru.

If you only look for entertainment and your expectations are not too high you will have a good time reading one of his books. The problem arises when you pick up a second one. You will have the impression of having read the book already. You'll find a prologue set in the past telling some maritime disaster, and will encounter Pitt, Giordino ,Admiral Sandecker and one resourceful woman (not necessarily Loren Smith) in the future. Between incredible rescues and unbelievable chases you will have a break in between to visit Dirk's hangar in Washington DC and enjoy a ride on one of the models of his car collection. The car is different each time as well as the villain or evil corporation our heroes fight against. But that's it!. Inca Gold is no different than the others. But highly enjoyable if this is your first Cussler novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile writing style","review":"I kept looking for the illustrations to go along with the prose in this Hardy Boy's style children's adventure book.

Dirk Pitt and side-kick Al perfectly fit the stereotypical wise-cracking, swash-buckling, untouchable heros that were first introduced to us by Indiana Jones.

This could have been more effectively done the first couple of times measurements were a requirement and then simply give the measurement in whatever discipline he wants to, or have an appendix with the conversions at the back of the book.

Mix this with the uptempo drive of \\"Spark\\" and the rock edge of \\"Reptile\\", plus the wistful mourning of \\"Lost\\" and you already have a 4+ star album.When \\"Terra Nova Cain\\" drives you under or \\"A New Season\\" lifts your spirits you realise that you truly are listening to one of the greatest collections of songs ever produced.There really isn't a dead spot on the album. I can not rate this any less than 5-star. Get this or you are truly \\"Lost\\".A genuine classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"I loved this one, better than the 1st and 3rd album.

I bought it on an impulse, thinking it would be like their first cd, but better. At least their first CD had an edge of seriousness. This just sounds like someone wrote it for a children's TV show.

Their initial release, \\"Exposure\\" was a hit, but this album actually has better songs. The title track is ok, but I prefer their mellow ballads, \\"Your Baby Never Looked Good In Blue\\" and \\"When I Looked At Him\\". Both are sweet tunes with a bit of sentimentality, and sorrow as well. Jeannette Jurado definitely has a knack for singing ballads, and she has to be my favorite member of the group. However, all three do a fairly good job of harmonizing in their tracks, and the album as a whole is solid. It's a few more hits shy of making it a five-star album for me, but then again, I think I tend to be more critical about scoring albums on Amazon than many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre album","review":"I have to admit that when the title song came out in 1989, I really loved it.

The subject matter is appropriate for the book. I feel that I should be able to face the certification test after reading this book and a little practice with the exam simulations. My one problem with this book is the DVD. The DVD feature is one of the main reasons I was swayed to purchase this book instead of others in the category. The DVD leaves a lot to be desired. The DVD is basically the instructor going over the book material while flipping through power point slides. You can get the same information in more detail from the book. If the vendors really wanted to make this a 5 star product they would include the exercises from the book on the DVD. Give us something more than we can get from the book. If you guys just wanted to play with DVD authoring, do it at home!

God, i wonder if they actually ever do listen to the albums. Well I truely do love this album. It was the first album by Rebbie that i bought, probably cause it was the easiest to find. I first heard Rebbie on 2300 Jackson Street, and I immediatly fell in love with her voice. so i went and picked up this album, and i was suprised. I had never really had a cd where i loved every song like i did this one. Centipede, Reaction, and R U Tuff Enuff, are so hard to find. Anyway, this is a great album and shouldn't be overlooked just cause of the critics or because \\"it's just another Jackson trying to make it in the music business\\", cuz it's not, she truely has talent. and if u do like this album, i suggest you get the rest of Rebbie's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infantry Aces: The German Soldier in Combat in WWII (Stackpole Military History Series)","review":"Great insight to the hardships faced by the common soldier who sill went on to perform outstanding acts of bravery"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read, period.

This is not another cash in on the 70's disaster craze. Rollercoaster is a first rate suspense thriller with crisp dialoge, assured direction and some nail-biting suspense scenes. The plot concerns an extortionist's (Timothy Bottoms)plans to blow up rides in the worlds most famous amusement parks, and a safety inspectors (George Segal)attempts to stop him. This film is marred only by the dated soundtrack and some hideous leisure suits. It all comes together in one of the most suspenseful climaxes in film history. If you have a Dolby Digital home stereo with a subwoofer, you'll have the added bonus of being able to watch the film in \\"Sensurround\\". It's too bad they didn't remaster the rest of the sound in discrete 5.1 channel.

Amateurs who want to use pro gear in the newly popular media production ring will just have to get used to using professional tools.Professionals who don't like it are certainly aware of alternatives which they can use. In any case, pro software in multimedia, on air programming, and accounting, tends to use TSRs or dongles to run. Too bad.Really, using it is no more problematic than registering for a lot of other services or products that you already use, and the key makes transferring your licenses from one machine to another as needed a breeze. It is cheap, too.

Last night, at 3:00 AM, our 6.5' tree fell over with a crash. My wife bolted from bed and I found her in tears by the tree. Eight ornaments were broken. This is the *second* (and last) year in-a-row this has happened. I believe the problem is two-fold. Conventional stands have a small spike on the bottom of the bowl to prevent the tree trunk from \\"kicking-out\\" to the side. Since this one is plastic, it doesn't offer this feature. Second, when you really reef down on the screws, the plastic tends to distort a bit and the screws tend to wander out of position - i.e., they aren't centered on the trunk anymore. I am here on Amazon this morning to find a metal stand that holds a good supply of water; has a wide base; and has that little spike in the bottom of the bowl to which I referred.

Even with the two level screw system it is difficult to keep a larger tree - say, anything 6 feet and up, from tilting in the stand. I noticed over the past couple of days the tree leaning ever so slightly, and this evening, CRASH there it went. The tree didn't come out of the stand, the whole stand tipped over with it. The stand has a wide base, but something is missing, maybe it's too short or something.

Now this morning, the tree toppled over, all by itself. We put it back up, made a lot of adjustments on the screws. It toppled over again.If you read this prior to buying a tree stand, this would be one I would stay well away from.

I understand that the writer was trying to keep you confused, just as the characters were, about what exactly is going on until the explanation at the end, but the solution for how people are infected with the ability to never die doesn't satisfy.

I'm using the book for the included software and its explanation of non-linear editing, but it is also a good refresher for my students on shooting and lighting.Anyone that teaches digital video production should give this book a second look as a text.

The \\"hero\\" is a strong negative example that is meant to show the emptyness of a materialist existence and the quest for power. I was fairly far into the book before I realized that magic was an irrelevent sideshow, unimportant to the plot.

Eyepieces may not be aligned properly. I have to bend the binoculars to a very specific angle to get a circular field of view. The hubby can't get a circular field of view.- Not so good for viewing objects less than 20 feet away.

But, its 100% The Grateful Dead; their sound and their attitudes. Especially during a time when glam-rock and ...pop were so big, this album stands out.The album is very produced, such that it has the sound of the technical edge that the Dead have always loved to play with, and include in their improvisation.Every song on this short album is great, and great to hear live.

All the songs on this album later became key tunes in their live performances (A Touch of grey, Hell in a bucket, West L.A. ..). Aside from the excellent production that went into this record, it sounds beautiful every time I hear it on my stereo.For some Heads who thought they were veering into a redundant sort of musical territory (were the fan would be bored w/ what the band would put out), I think this album only made even stronger the commitment one had as a fan to and for this band.May you enjoy this classic Cd made by some of the best musicians the United States had and still has.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Dead's hit album","review":"This one is probably easier for some to digest as it has a more accessible sound than some of the other albums by the band. This was the album that put the band on the map commercially speaking. Those of us who were already fans at the time found it a little hard to take due to the fact that it has such a radio friendly feel. This new version has bonus tracks but some of them are only so-so. One of the songs \\"My Brother Esau\\" was a bonus track on the cassette when the album was first released. The cassette had slightly different sequencing and was arranged better.

Every voice is heard. The performance is dead, dead, dead. For the good of music, Harononcourt should remove the key that winds his clockwork heart and throw it away. This is the most lifeless performance of the Mozart Requiem on disk.

When I purchased this disc, I was simply looking for my first copy of Mozart's Requiem, and preferably, one equipped for playback in my SACD player. I have been very, very pleased. I find the performances here to be powerful and exciting, and the recording itself to be nothing short of an amazing sonic experience (with the right equipment, of course). I find the CD (which includes a copy of Mozart's score) and the materials that come with it to be particularly interesting, and I strongly encourage those of less than high-brow appetites - like me - to pick up a copy for serious listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"Everyone here has said something I wanted to say so I'll just add something here.

This doesn't. Orchestra ordinary, choir sound like the average age is 75, soloists poor (as usual ridiculously balanced), interpretation earth-bound. Schreier - despite slightly (but only slightly!) inferior sound - still streets ahead. The CD-Rom of the score, however, might just make the CD worthwhile if you find it for cheap. Don't buy it for the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your kitschy Mozart","review":"Mozart is a composer whose music was drenched in kitsch and schmaltzy sound for the longest time.

First, the book itself did a poor job in covering the many aspects of Windows NT 4. It barely covered the most basic aspects and left out a great deal of NT. The CD-ROM included had some decent labs for beginners but there were not enough of them. If you are looking for a book to purchase for preparation of a Microsoft exam for MCP or MCSE this one should be left out. Everything covered in this book can be easily found in just about any other book dealing with NT4.

In comparison to the original motor, it was about 2/3 heavier and longer but about the same in circumference. The replacement fit perfectly in the bracket in the attic.The new motor quality appears far superior to the original I replaced. Also, it has sealed bearings and brushless in design.

I've read the reviews about the \\"surprising\\" ending. Maybe I missed something but the ending meant nothing to me and it didn't really have any significance on the main story. Anyway, even if I ignore everything I've mentioned so far, the story is quite weak and too much like a Hollywood blockbuster movie. The only thing missing is a car chase on a busy highway where the main character escapes from a horrific crash... wait, it does have that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This is in my top 5 SF books ever, period.Anyone who doesn't think this is Banks' best book has not understood it.This book takes the premise from 'Complicity' and examines it from about 3 times as many angles. Buy this book, read this book, and then, please, really THINK about this book - it expanded my mind by linking together threads about morality, mortality, kantian ethics, and authority.It can also be read as a simple space opera, and it's not a bad read on that level either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable and Unforgettable","review":"Enough has been said about this book, but briefly: All books, not just sci-fi novels, should aspire to the level of scale, intelligence, and introspection that Banks displays in Use of Weapons. The story stayed with me for a long time after I finished it. It is truly wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"This book was really disappointing, compared to the rest of the Culture novels I have read. Disjointed, jumping all over the place, and enough to even be somewhat confusing at times, not a good thing. The book hasn't enough focus on the childhood issues that ended up being at the heart of the matter. Worst Culture novel by far. When the best character is a drone robot, perhaps a little bit of a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been a hard core SiFi reader for over 40 years and I have read some novels I have been disappointed with, but this one is at the top of my list. Since I only paid a dollar to download it to my Kindle I guess I should not complain too much, but this is not a very good book. Disjointed is mild in describing the flow of the story,the ending was terrible and did not seem to be confirmed by the story itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Trick: Slow and Confusing","review":"Not worth the dollar nor especially the time I spent reading it to the end. Written in non-chronological order as a guise for poor plot construction. Confusing to follow. No action, and less adventure. No visible central conflict between antagonist (minor character) and the protagonist. No character development. I did not care about any of the characters' feelings or situations. Character names impossible to pronounce, even sub-vocally. Somebody tell Mr. Banks that mis-leading the reader (poorly done) into character mis-identification does not work in a novel, only in a movie. In a book, it's a cheap trick. At what point this mistaken identity switch is supposed to have ocurred is unclear. As is the entire story."},{"rating":"1","title":"As the Galaxy Turns","review":"USE OF WEAPONS (1990 - reprinted 2008) is a \\"Space Opera\\" far-future SciFi novel, that is part of the Bank's \\"Culture\\" series.I found the book to be exceedingly dull... it reminded me of watching TV Soap Operas - which I simply don't have any use for either. I couldn't care less about the characters, nor the story.The story and style of writing reminds me of Asimov's \\"Foundation Trilogy\\" series from the 1950's, but updated to be more \\"sexually racy\\" for the 1990's audience. Asimov was breaking new ground in the 50's... but this novel adds nothing new, technology-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this book zero stars if i could","review":"I bought this book because it was highly reviewed on amazon. What a complete waste of money. The book makes no sense at all and is very boring. I love scifi but this book was very disapointing. A good book should really hook you in within the first fifty pages and should be something you do not want to put down. This book does neither.I forced myself through twenty percent of this book hoping it would get better which it did not. do not waste your time and money too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing but good","review":"If you like Ian M Banks you like this book. But it takes some work to figure out what is going on. I liked it but it was not my favorite Culture novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubtedly a work of SF genius","review":"Mr. Banks is surely one of the greatest SF writers writing today and this must be one of his greatest works. (I hesitate to say his greatest as I have not read them all, but to surpass this a book would have to be spectacular indeed.) The most outstanding feature of this book is its structure, carefully planned to give greatest insight into the mind and past of the protaganist and amply displaying Mr. Banks flair for immaginative and powerful writing.It is probably my all time favourite book and one I would heartily reccomend to everyone, albiet with a warning - if you are looking for a grand space opera perhaps it would be better to start with one of Mr. Banks' other Culture books (Excession or Feersum Endjinn spring to mind), for though 'USe of Weapons' has its share of action and adventure, the mind has to be in high-gear to fully appreciate the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, surprising, sad, breath taking","review":"Top notch story. I felt more connected with the characters in this story than most of the others in the Culture Series. When the truth finally comes out at the end of the story, I truly felt sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Epic","review":"This is THE best Sci-Fi book, and possibly one of the best books, ever written. Why? Because it is moving, it is about trust and betrayal, love, honour and dishonour.. Every one of your emotions will be called into play, your hatred, your compassion... The beauty of these distant worlds, the lives of the characters, it has everything a good novel should, and then a few sci-fi touches which serve only to enhance the plots and storylines.Absolutely Fabulous! Beg or borrow a copy from anywhere. Steal it if you must (but give it back afterwards) This is a book that redefines \\"epic\\" and \\"masterpiece\\", proving that science-fiction is no longer the shabby runt of literature.Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most darkly beautiful character studies in SF","review":"There are few books which evoke such a wrenching emotional response that they make me cry. Irving's The World According to Garp was one. Brook Hansen's The Chess Garden was another, and Mark Helprin's A Soldier of the Great War was a third. Use of Weapons simply destroyed me. Here is a book which not only provides a great and tragic character study, but also manages to comment on war and conflict in way unmatched since Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five. Add to this the glittering marvels of the Culture universe...and this book just does not let up. I cannot praise it highly enough--and I have to say also that Banks' Culture novels have gotten me reading SF again--a genre I had long abandoned out of disgust at the generally horrible writing and pathetic use of literary technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plot timeline is NOT a pretzel!","review":"This could have been an engaging novel had the timeline not resembled a particularly tangled ball of yarn. Also the background on the main character tends to be spotty and deliberately confusing -- all for the sake of obscuring the rather feeble motivation of the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disturbing ending","review":"I hate books that do not end well. I've read two books by this author and they both had depressing endings. This one was especially bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the dollar I paided for it.","review":"The book is garbage it was not worth the dollar I paid for my kindle copy. Another reviewer commented on how bad the ending was I wouldn't know I didn't read that far. Do not waste your money no matter how little you pay for this book it is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only ok","review":"Some parts of this book were ok, but generally dull and confusing. The suprise? ending was a joke, and the whole thing was forgettable. I have read many much better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I have only read two Culture books, but this one blew Consider Phlebas out of the water. Finished it two nights ago and I'm still a little shook up from the ending.........and I even guessed what was happening before I read it. Special book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me wanting","review":"I've read many of mr banks books which have been excellent. This one was disjointed and hard to stay involved in. The synopsis held so much promise. After reading all the way through ( i paid for it, so I'm reading it!)Too many guilt trips, emotional morass- give me more science fiction less crying about the past. More Skaffen-Amtiskaw!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Because It's Fun","review":"Why does Iain M. Banks write novels with such unusual structures? I think the answer is in Use of Weapons--\\"Because it's fun!\\" says a woman working, with her own hands, on the construction of a spaceship that machines could have built faster. Banks seems to have fun challenging himself. His characters have fun; indeed, I think fun is his Culture's greatest motivation. And the reader has fun.Use of Weapons is terrifically entertaining. It is exciting, dramatic, and often funny. Through his protagonist, Banks renders a study of a tortured individual. Treachery and disloyalty, recurrent themes in Banks' novels, lurk in every corner, waiting to surprise us.Banks' artistic literary skill make him one of my favorite authors. I enjoy his lush descriptions of exotic settings, his realistic dialog and his terse philosophizing. However, he implies as much as he tells us, so we use our own imaginations to see, to hear, and to understand. That makes reading fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accomplishment","review":"Not quite a space soap opera, but I found this installment of Iain M. Banks' sci-fi novels to be the most 'melodramatic' one that I've read. It doesn't take anything away from the quality of the story and the fascinating immersive parallel universe, but I feel this book could have done without the sci-fi element and still be a haunting and perplexing novel. The gadgetry and exoticism will still make fans of the genre giggle like little girls, and considering that, it makes it an even greater accomplishment. Beautiful, violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Glad I bought it, I knew it was a kids movie when I bought it allways loved Gamera, only rated it 4 for on reason the plot was great the actors good, but it lacked the old sound of Gamera ie) flying and screaming voice other than that if thay had done that I would have gave it a 5 :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"another MB fiasco","review":"*note this review is about the DVD itself not the film* The film itself is not one of my favorite Gamera films, but it is passable, and my kids enjoy it. However the BRD itself suffers from audio problems. At some points you can actually hear background audio from other portions of the film in the wrong place. I have attempted to contact MB/TS multiple times requesting a simple replacement with no response. Other fans have noted this defect making me think it may be on a good portion of the manufactured BRD's if not all. It's so sad that a company that brought us so many fine films in the past 10 years has fallen so far. (feel free to Google MB's issues with Toho and Destroy All Monsters, Godzilla vs Megalon, and tax issues in 2012) Just stick with the DVD if you already have it, no reason to upgrade to BRD since it is defective unless MB publicizes a campaign to replace the defective BRD's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I watched Gamera as a kid. I also liked the three previous movies. I ordered this because it's not available around here and I wanted to see it. I probably won't watch it again. It is too much for little kids.

I rolled my eyes a few times and almost wanted to gag.With that being said, my son did enjoy it and that counts for something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gamera will save us..................","review":"A great new Gamera film. This movie got nothing to do with the 90's garbage, it's why is great. A boy who mother dies is bond with a turtle. The turtle is called Toto. We even get a new better monster that looks cool. The best thing about this film, it got more of the old Gamera tradition. Gamera is a cute looking monster, like the old films. Buy this and forget the 90's trash. Just to let you know it's one disc, not two. But still worth to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gamera","review":"As a fan of Japan monster movies since I was a kid, this one evolved more around the kid than Gamera which took away from the action for which I brought it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gamera the Brave","review":"Worse Gamera movie ever. It had nothing to do with the last 3 of the series. It was about Gamera dying in 1973 witch never happen to save the earth and a boy who found his egg and was there when it hatch. I had to fast forward threw a lot of the beginning because it was boring and stupid. The boy named Gamera Toto after the dog in Wizard of Oz what that about. Very dull movie and I would not recommend this movie to any Gamera fan. You think they would of continued with the movie after Revenge of the Iris. they had to make this bad movie witch made no scene from the beginning to the end. This was a waste of money and will make a really good coaster for my coffee. I gave it one star because I couldn't leave it blank. Its not even worth that star. Very disappointed with this movie and I'm a major Gamera fan.Gamera the Brave"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"The muzzle basically does the job so far, but my dog and I haven't put it to the test around other dogs yet. Partly because I'm still a bit nervous as to how it will hold up. The overall quality of the product is poor. It is basically constructed of a few pieces of velcro. The manufacturers could have at least made the product with a less abrasive material. I feel the product would chafe my dogs face if left on for longer than 15 minutes.

The cards are organized very well and many anatomical landmarks are pinpointed.But besides the occasional info about clinically relavent aspects of a particular body part, there are no descriptions about the orgins, innervations, insertions of muscles or any description about arteries or organs. There is a lot of empty space on the back of these cards so that you could take notes for yourself...but that is something that you can judge for yourself if you want to do, since that does take a lot of time.They are great for you to test your ability to identify body parts, but if you don't know anything else about what the functions of the parts, these cards will not help very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy review cards helpful","review":"As someone taking gross anatomy after being out of school for a while, I found these cards helpful for reviewing structures in their anatomical position. Each card has an illustration with 10-20 items identified on the front by number. On the back is the answer key. The beautiful illustrations are accurate and detailed, but in a more modern style than Netter. The detail was right for a graduate level anatomy course. As another reviewer commented, there are no proximal or distal muscle insertions, so if that is what you want than there are other card sets available for that purpose. I used these to review before exams by writing out my answers to ensure I had properly identifed each structure and could spell it correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could (should) have been better","review":"We are using the Gray's Anatomy textbook for class, and so far I've enjoyed reading and studying from it, so I had high expectations when I explored the flashcards. I was disappointed for 2 main reasons:1. Cards were not punched and a ring was not included for easily taking a small section of cards for portable studying.2. The graphics were pulled straight from the textbook and downsized. In some pictures, the structures became so small that it is worhtless to try and label the structures in the picture. I was confused after looking at a flashcard picture with a pointer seemingly point at nothing, but after referring to the textbook with the larger picture I could see the small structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLC's are GODS","review":"What an album, it's fantastic.

I bought \\"Come Find Yourself\\" because I entered one of those record deals and got hooked. \\"100% Colombian\\" does sacrifice the alterna-pop hooks of its predessessor, but what these NYC guys gain is something much deeper--credibility. The smooth jazz and funk hooks here are way ahead of the mainstream. \\"Love Unlimited,\\" the band's ode to Barry White; \\"Sugar,\\" \\"Southside\\" and \\"All For Self\\" are all completely different-sounding tracks that manage to evoke the same cool FLC made their name with.

It is not interesting, very boring, has awful editing, etc. The movie's runtime is only 74 minutes, but they have long strange 2 minute pauses in quite a few different scenes where someone just stares for almost two minutes without even speaking. It is very strange, annoying, and unnecessary. This just dosen't happen once either. Many, Many times. If you would take out all the pauses, this movie probably would last 57 minutes. Even then, it would be 57 minutes of agony, because none of the movie is good. It's not the fact that this movie is low budget, because there are alot of good low budget films.

Sinead O'Connor? Earth Day? In 1990, while I was writing a novel that was never published, Lisa Stansfield was having a lot more success with her huge hit, \\"All Around The World\\". I loved the song, but for some reason it took me 15 years to get around to buying the CD. Anyway, I'm glad I did. What I found is a fabulous collection of beats, in a lyrical setting where Love is Master, for better or worse. The musical arrangements, to a great extent latter-day disco in the first part of the album, give way to excellent early 90's club music as it progresses. A slight jazz tinge can be heard throughout. Lisa sings with soul and authority, and her warm, expressive voice is complemented perfectly by the swirling strings and glistening synths. By the way, 63 minutes, 13 cuts and none of them bad - this adds up to \\"your money's worth\\" on a very good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"This particular Lisa Stansfield CD puts most of today's R&B female singers to shame.

Just listening to \\"Sincerity\\" now, and there's something I love about the song. It's the reflective nature of the lyrics. Many of Lisa's later lyrics fixated on the ups and downs of relationships; here, she sings about human interaction in general, and that's a refreshing departure!If Lisa puts out still another album, I would love it if she returned to some more reflective lyrics like she had on Affection: \\"Sincerity\\" and \\"Live Together\\" being the greatest of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest Diva!","review":"After listening to Lisa in the mid 1990, my forethought that she'd be one of the most unforgettable musical talents came true. Affection is the first incredible CD to hit the 90s!

Personally, I enjoyed Water's newer films more than some of the old ones. Pink Flamingoes is still great, but some of the older flicks such as Female Trouble and Polyester seemed a bit boring to tell the truth. I highly enjoyed Pecker and A Dirty Shame.

Whatever. Anyway, speaking of damaged auras, mine certainly has been since I played this prententious mess of an album.

I haven't noticed a problem, but I only used them for archival purposes.Second, of course - if you want usb power and easy portability, then you may be looking at powering it off a laptop. If used as a secondary or portable hard-drive, it will add considerable drain to battery load. When working using it as the primary drive for Power Point presentations, I found it comparable to watching DVD movies (about 1/2 normal battery run time).Its a good, fast, drive, but if power is a problem, then use it primarily for archival purposes - transferring your active work to/from your laptop's hard drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"This is a piece of garbage.

I always thought that Utopia was Todd's outlet for experimentation, and he always let other members of the band contribute equally to the effort.If you were to only own 1 Utopia CD, this is IT. Some of the earlier stuff is great but 'out there', and a lot of the later stuff was just too commercial/pop for me.

In the latter is the majestic, Overture: Mountaintop and Sunrise/Communion with the Sun, while the former is home to the silly, Singring and the Glass Guitar (An Electrified Fairytale).The pop sensibilities of Eternal Love and heavy punch in Jealousy are excellent remedies to the preachy politics found in Hiroshima. But the musicianship combined with the studio techniques make the album shine from the warmth of the sun, when not battling brief overcast skies."},{"rating":"1","title":"self indulgent silliness","review":"I love Todd Rundgren and respect all of his talents. He must have had a lot of clout to make this absurd work.The musicianship is stunning and there are some great melodies but it is still a silly, goof yconcept album. The chorus from Hiroshima?

To someone other than a Utopia fanatic, this is unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very BAD !!!","review":"This was a very disapointing movie. Sidney Sheldons novel was excellent.

Both James Mason and Audrey Hepburn, both very great stars, were totally miscast for the content of this motion picture. The explicit sex scenes were a total distraction from the plot, and not needed at all. Sidney Sheldon needed to know better. I can understand why Ms. Hepburn wanted out of this movie, when she learned what was to be filmed, but her contract bound her to this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare and Wonderful:","review":"This is one of the true Classic films of the Golden age.

The story's plot twists are extremely clever and surprisingly believable. It's obvious that Zimmerman spends a lot of time researching his novels..his descriptions of everything from catered food to forensci science are excellent and, as far as I can tell, quite accurate. In some novels its hard to believe that a proatgonist who is not a cop can be involved in as much murder mystery fare as they are. But Zimmerman's Todd Mills manages to pull it off quite believably.

Some of the answers are poorly explained and some reading passages do not (at all) adhere to the real SAT format- questioons on these passages are usually very ambiguous.On the other side, I believe this is the best practice test SAT book on the market other than the Officail SAT Guide.

The explanations still give a student the chance to work independently.Some questions are modeled after the College Board book's while others are not.Overall, Kaplan 12 is valuable, because it is most important for students to PRACTICE and think critically about their incorrect answers.

This book also talks about basic etiquette and how and when to illustrate it for your kids such as introduction or not correcting other peoples manners, etc. Buy either this or How to Raise A Lady.

The beginning was promising with concise \\"rules\\" and practical examples to explain them. Unfortunately, around the midpoint of the book the author appears to forget her purpose...and her manners. Vulgar vocabulary and excessively described, equally vulgar situations take the place of previously delicate and succinct wording. Readers hoping to improve their overall etiquette and social standing do not need to be reminded of the multitude of slang terms used in place of more socially correct, tactful terms.

I finally saw it on PPV, and was very disappointed in how much they deviated from the original story, and in the overall quality of the movie. As others have stated, the animation was poor, and the quality of the audio was terrible, too, as I couldn't understand much of the dialog.While it may appeal to the very young, I can't see how anyone over the age of 6 or 7 could enjoy the movie.

This must have been created to help cash in on the Disney gravy train, because this is a pale imitator. The musical numbers are lame and arbitrarily thrown into the story, which is written for children with the attention span of a hyper-active gnat. The animation looks like it was done on the cheap, and the voice talent (which by the list of names is impressive) sounds like they're just doing it for the money.

One down side of this announcement is that it will be in dvd format only (????). I guess Universal does not consider this one of their treasures, worth of a blu-ray release.As per Dr. Phibes review in 2004, Nighthawks now has a modified soundtrack, specifically the disco scene where Stallone and Billy Dee Williams are trying to track down a terrorist (Rutger Hauer). Two music selections in the disco featuring 'Brown Sugar' (Stones), and I'm a Man (Keith Emerson)have been deleted and replaced by run of the mill selections that are lousy (IMHO).I don't know what Universal's plans are but they have been notorious for this type of callous handling of their titles. If this release gets the same lousy treatment, I'll pass.Maybe it doesn't bother others, but this has been a pebble in my shoe for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sly and Billie Dee great pair","review":"Finding this show in DVD format was something we have been looking for for a while.

I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD.First of all, this film deserves a wide screen transfer. Instead, they give us a poor full screen transfer, which shows a good deal of grain and appears soft in areas. The print or original material's used for the transfer are not in the best of shape and this is very noticeable on the transfer with respect to scratches, nicks and abrasions.Unless you really love this film, I would suggest passing on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little dated but good movie","review":"I saw this movie several years ago and have enjoyed watching it periodically.

However it is unjustly so. Nighthawks is a good, hard bitten crime drama with great acting and well paced action.Sly Stallone is Detective Sergeant Deke DaSilva who has an extensive millitary backround and is now along with his partner Detective Sergeant Matthew Fox played by Bill Dee Williams are cops who make unorthodox arrests but get the job done. Things get changed however when a terrorist named Wulfgar ,played to prefection by Rutger Hauer, comes to New York.

Deke Da Silva(Sylvester Stallone)and his faithful partner Sgt. Matthew Fox(Billy Dee Williams)who work undercover to track a sadistic, elusive terrorist from England Rulfgar(Rutger Hauer)who unfortunately doesn't get caught and killed off until Da Silva is able to bait him by posing as Da Silva's ex-wife Irene(Lindsey Wagner)who was also one of Wulfgar's desired victims.I personally think this is one of Sylvester Stallones and Rutger Hauers best movies of all times, despite its graphic violence & harsh profanity.This flick also takes me back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 since Ronald Reagan was our President when NIGHTHAWKS had its theatrical release in the Spring of 1981."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't have the DVD and won't","review":"I, like others, love \\"Family Guy\\" but this season was a wash.

Honestly, it was like they were so stoked on being back they just phoned it tin, feeling untouchable. The episodes were completely sub par. I'm just letting people know. I'm not buying them, and if you do, I think you'll see why.Just for reference, \\"The Simpsons\\" this year has sunk to it's lowest and it's really time to go. I understand why \\"Seinfeld\\" and others chose to go out on top. \\"The Simpsons\\" is just pathetic with recycled jokes or jokes that need reach too far to be funny.

Seasons 1-3 were well written, and joke filled. From season 4 and on, the stories become irrelevant and take a back seat to long winded jokes. Most of these are unfunny, and the writers hope that the repetition and extension of these gags will win over the viewer. Some, like my dbag former roommate Paul Vogt, say this is the funniest show ever. South Park hit the nail on the head when dissing Family Guy.

It seems to be riding on it's laurels, so to speak, and it's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny. I don't like it, and I think it's been reduced to recent Simpson quality. Meanwhile, the DVD has a few commentaries (I'd like to point out that the competition Simpson DVD's have commentaries on every episode, same with Futurama...)Some sub-par special features. The biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single-layer, which means four episodes per disc, as opposed to the traditional seven.

Oh yeah it sucks that the stewie three part movie is not on the set, but the movie is AWESOME, it is hilarious I highly reccomend it, Go buy it too because it is worth it. Also I am sure they are not going to try to charge $35 bucks or so for the 13 episode set it will probably be around 20-25$ thats the same cost of the Chappelle show and it has roughly the same amount of episodes.

She's a bit mysterious, and becomes more so as the film progresses. All we really know about her at first is that she likes birds, because we meat her in a bird shop as she waits for a delivery of a Mina Bird. There she runs into Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), she tries to play a joke on him by acting like she is clerk at the bird shop. That starts a sort of odd and fascinating attraction between the two. She decides to bring love birds to him as a birthday gift for his younger sister Cathy in Bodega Bay. But right after she delivers them a gull attacks Melanie. From what the townspeople say a bird has never been known to attack anyone. I think that the townspeople hint that Melanie is somehow correlated to the attacks by saying that the birds didn't attack until she arrived and that they believe she is evil.

Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) comes to see her rugged boyfriend Rod Taylor in the village for a romantic weekend. Eerie effective thriller with great shocking scenes such as the schoolyard event when a flock of birds nest on a wire waiting for attack. This film will never cease in its power to terrify. The ending is even more shocking as the birds lie nesting on the roof of the house showing their dominated side while the family escape their vicious clutches. The mystery is one of the most remarkable aspects of this horror film. Followed by an appaling sequel, Birds 2:Land's End."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bird's Eye View","review":"This little thriller by Hitchcock still holds up pretty well even after circa 50 years.

I usually like to give any speculative fiction writer, novelist, or scriptwriter at least one big improbability per story. One disbelief-suspending \\"what-if?\\" scenario.

I like horror films, but this movie didn't seem like a hrror film. It was more of a drama. I'm sure people from 1963 liked it. The special effects of the movie were pretty cool, like how the birds acted so crazly and how all different kinds of birds were surrounding the characters. I wondered how that was done. One thing that was really missing from the movie was music. In a horror film there has to be music or the movie is less interesting and less suspenseful. The ending of the movie upset me because Hitchcock didn't tell why the birds acted so crazly or what they were after. I like endings where there is a conclusion. Everything is explained such as who did what and why. The movie needed some more action, it was too dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one annoyed by the ending?","review":"I've read some of the other reviews on here, and from what I've seen NO ONE has complained about the horrible ending. Why? Because there is no ending!! Hitchcock usually manages to find a way to explain everything in his movies. In Psycho the Psychiatrist told the whole story; in Vertigo it was all revealed in the end and in Rear Window the crime is solved. But The Birds' unfinished ending was HORRIBLE. If you're a person who needs closure (like me) this is not the movie for you.Some who have NOT seen the movie, may be bothered by my revealing the movie's lack of ending. But I promise that I'm giving NOTHING away. Even if I sat here and told you the whole ending it detail, you wouldn't believe me and would have to check it out for yourself. So don't worry.

It is my official selection for the best Hitchcock movie EVER...It is so much more than just a horror movie - especillay when you start asking yourself why the birds attack. Could the bird attacks be fueled by female sexual hysteria and competition for the only virile male (Rod Taylor) in the film? Or could it be just mankind's payback for abusing the fowl of the animal kingdom? This film is loaded with haunting images and symbolism which deserves multiple viewings and discussion among serious film buffs. Not only is the film worth 5 stars but there is an impressive flock of DVD extras. The film itself is a beautiful widescreen presentation with very nice sound; the extras should thrill Hitchophiles with a \\"making of documentary\\", vintage newsreels of the film's theatrical release, a very witty original trailer, deleted scenes, and Tippi Hedren's original screen test.

The so-called Master of Suspense masters mostly boredom and dullness throughout the movie. If you can get past the first 50 minutes, though, you'll be okay. The definate highlight of the film was when a man drops a match on a trail of gas. It blows up, and you are shown four stills of Tippi Hendren's terrified face. It was supposed to be serious, but it was hilarious.

It would have been better if the acting were improved, but I'm not sure even that would save it. All the characters acted so helpless throughout the whole movie. For instance, a little schoolgirl is down on the road with a bird pecking at her head, and the lead female just kind of trots over and acts like the bird is a delicate china vase, barely pushing on it at all. The acting was really corny, too. Just too plain and generic. All the little Cathy girl (Mitch Brenner's sister) does is cry throughout the whole movie, the mother acts crazy, and Melanie (the lead female) just acts so darn helpless. The ending (if you could call it that) wasn't very exciting either. There should've been at least an explanation as to why the birds were attacking.

I belive that this speical treatment made her act better than the other actors. Which wasn't true by a long shot!!!

I would really love to toss it an extra little half star and make it five; and perhaps after watching it a few more times and watching some more Hitchcock thats what I ll end up doing.It's a great mesh of a film. More than just some tense horror, you are given a story worth discussion. Why are those damn birds attacking? For the love of God! Its really quite brilliant how it all plays out and in a lot of respects is almost two films in one. The opening half, a very mysterious love story, and of course the later half a good ole Hitchcock suspense film.On note of the DVD, its outstanding. Theres a terrific making of, an original trailer, deleted scene, alternate ending, and, most important for me, other actors or film lovers, Tippi Hedren's original screen test!!

The film doesn't explain where these birds come from or why they attack, but this is a film that doesn't require logic or deep thought. Despite its otherwise flimsy plot, \\"The Birds\\" still has the stuff to scare the wits out of you, and it has earned its status as a horror classic. Also, be sure to check out the features, which include a documentary and trailers. My only complaint is that a film like this would be much more effective in 5.1 surround sound, but it's instead presented in mono. Still, \\"The Birds\\" should be among your first purchases if you're looking to start a Hitchcock collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birds","review":"This is such a classic film by the master of all suspense films, Hitchcock. Set in Northern California on the coast, it shatters the \\"cocoon\\" of a small town's security with unexplained and illogical events.

I felt as if the plot could of been better because it took too long to get to the point. More action was needed during the first hour. I guess the movie's special effect's were O.K. for that time. My opinion is that all of the birds sounded like a giant flock of Donald Duck's. Rod taylor's part as Mitch Brenner, would have been better if he had some better supporting actresses. Tippi Hedren (Melanie Danials) play your typical 1990's blonde in a 1960's movie. I feel as if she is just there to look pretty and be somthing to look at. Where was the ending? There was no ending. When I see a movie I expect to have an ending. The Birds just left me hanging. I feel as if this movie cannot compare with a modern day horror film. This movie is nothing compared to Friday the 13th movies.

As far as special effects go, they are great for the 60's,yet for today my little broth could have done better. Although the way they got the birds to stay there was cool. I feel that the characters did a good job. Ithink that Tippi Hedern,playing the part of Melanie Daniels, could have shown more drama when being attacked. The ending should have gone on longer. It left you siting there saying \\"is that the end ?\\" Compared to todays horror film's I would rate it poorly, due to the fact we are used to seeing blood, guts, and somthing fast paced.

When i first saw Melony get attacked I laughed,I felt no fear at all. That is when I realized this would be almost as dumb the Wizard of Oz,which it was.I was mad when we didn't find out why Tweety attacked.So over all I hated this unorthadox retarded movie that was a waste of money.

I found it interesting that there was no sound track. I like that because it allows you to make up the music in your head. Keep in mind that this film was made in 1963, so there is no way that you can compare it to the movies of today. Hitchcock had decent special effects, like the scene in the bird shop. I would like to know how they did that. The ending fits the film because both it and the film itself make you use your imagenation.

But The Birds was not one of them (nor Psycho). Direction and writing are nigh nonexistent. Was Hitchcock on tranquilizers while doing this film? If not for the special effects crew this film would be wretched, as is sometimes the case in Hollywood (such as The Mist, another example of extraordinary special effects talent mismatched with horrid direction and writing).

However, unlike Hitchcock's materpiece \\"Psycho,\\" it has not aged well at all. \\"Psycho\\" is still scary, in part, because it was filmed in black and white and essentially looks timeless. Alas, \\"The Birds\\" was filmed in color and not only are the styles of the times distracting, but the movie's supposedly menacing title characters look silly. Hitchcock is, of course, is master of creating mood with his camerawork, such as the scene on the park bench in which the birds slowly collect in the background. Unfortunately, they have lost their ability to scare to an audience accustomed to more frightening visuals and thereby the effect just isn't there anymore. There is no doubt that Hitchcock was a genius and that this was one of his biggest triumphs.

The overall level of the recipes is still a bit too simple for my liking -- the toughest questions have been left out. On the plus side, I am happy with the fact that the authors have included chapters on using XDoclet for EJB development and on unit testing EJBs with Cactus.

It's a simple and heartwarming story, but what makes it stand out is the superb quality of the illustration. The subdued palette and the deft drawing is far superior to the run-of-the-mill children's book artwork. I also love the way Beegu is ignored, overlooked, rejected by all the adults - appealing to a child's sense that only the small people can see and appreciate the otherworldly.

Despite knowledge that the subject of the experiment continued to assert himself as a boy and refused gender engineering, Dr. Money pretended that his experiment in socialization worked 100% on the subject.He is a not true, and his theories on sexuality are merely that - theories. And since he's got a proven track record of wrong and falsifying data to fit his theories, nothing he says should be believed.Those that support the doctor and dismiss \\"As Nature Made Him\\" are those that have a similar bias as the \\"doctor\\" and want his falsified findings to be true.

They are perfectly displayed here, along with her singing talent, in this Hitchcock remake--of a Hitchcock movie. She and James Stewart as perfect as a couple of American tourists who find themselves accidentally involved in an assassination plot, and whose son is kidnapped to guarantee their silence.

Sorry guys, I call 'em like I see 'em and this one is painful to see garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Silly Movie","review":"I love Alfred Hitchcock movies, but this is a silly movie. It's hard to believe that Alfred Hitchcock directed it and that James Stewart agreed to star in it. I found myself disliking all of the main characters and I didn't care what happened to them. In order for a movie to be suspenseful, you have to have some connection with the characters. Doris Day was just awful. The boy, Hank, is an obnoxious little brat. I was hoping that he would be strangled or drowned.At the end of the movie, Doris Day sings a set of corny and poorly performed songs for a group of European aristocrats who would never listen to such common pop music- and are all enthralled by it. What was Hitchcock thinking? Not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below expectation..","review":"The earlier version was more suspenseful and entertaining. Of course, Stewart and Doris acted well and so did the child actor. However, the villains were almost comical and bit pathetic, sort of the type that had had seen better days in their \\"career\\". Doris did look very glamorous and chic, while Stewart looked quite old, haggard and his exaggerated American accent was grating. The plot was very weak and resorted to remarkable number of coincidences; none of those hair-raising moments that one expects to see in a Hitchcock movie were evident. The background music was either missing or so weak as not to have any effect whatsoever. However, it is not unwatchable.I must say that I liked Doris Day a lot, she looked like a carnation with her pink blooming face and slim-line figure.Scotsman or whatever: Go to some Gaelic language site and put your shoddy opinions there.

Doris Day was annoyingly weepy and helpless throughout this movie. The Albert Hall scene especially annoyed me for two main reasons. First, Doris Day standing and weeping for 5+ minutes straight instead of telling someone who could protect the target. The second thing was that while both the music and the shots of the musicians were wonderfully dramatic, they were not in sync. There is a prolonged shot of the timpani player playing what appears to be a dramatic cadential ending, yet the soundtrack has no audible timpani at that point, certainly nothing as marked as what the timpanist is shown playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Too Much","review":"Hitchcock excels in this remake of The Man That Knew Too Much.

A few frames and a line, and the rest of the film moves on from there. Misleading, to say the least to advertize her as being involved in the movie at all. This disappointment was annoying, but the movie picked up from there. Afterall, Alfred Hitchcock has a larger part in his movies than BK has in this one. But after the initial downletting it turned out to be a moderately entertaining film of the genre. And it was far less insulting to some nicely drawn characters in the movie than similar movies of its ilk, such as \\"There's Something about Mary' which went from moderately interesting to goofy. This went from not bad to moderately interesting.

Make the investment, forget the haters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a benefit of the doubt ranking...","review":"Normally, I'm a bit more frugal with my money, but I had been looking for a DVD showing the workout the actors in '300' were put through to get them in shape for the movie, and for obvious reasons, I thought this was it.This is NOT the workout used to prep for the movie!!! It's just packaged as the \\"300 Spartan workout\\" as a marketing gimmick, and gets away with it by basing the workout aroung 300 reps, and gives a brief, irrelevant little reminder of who the Spartans were in the introduction.The workout is effective, but not any more effective than anything I could have (and actually have) come up with on my own. Definitely not worth the $40 they're asking for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jolly useful stuff.","review":"Steve Maxwell impresses with his simple instruction yet difficult exercises. Listen to his instruction and perform the exercises to your best ability and you will be improved. Mr Maxwell provides an interesting array of bodyweight exercises that are challenging physically and mentally. After 4 weeks of training twice a week I have noticed considerable reduction in my shoulder pain and knee pain. I have dropped from 24% to 22% BF. If you want to get your body under control then this work out is a very good tool to use. This is a no fluff work out; it is you, your body and mind. No gimmicks, no pep talk, just work. Your improvement is up to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE REAL 300!!!! WORKOUT","review":"For some strange reason people believe that it is okay to TRICK people into buying their products. Usually I am more of a discerning shopper, I actually read the reviews before I purchase any item that costs 40.00. However, I was so caught up in the excitement of 300 that I didn't do my research and find the real one for free online. (men's health) I am pissed, this is NOT THAT WORKOUT, if you are looking for something that you may have not done before and are not sure about the results, and/or you have some time to waste or are not already serious about your workout by all means purchasse this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Steve Maxwell sond anything like Mark Twight or Logan Hood?","review":"Ok I found this video when ordering a copy of the movie itself. I checked it out here because it is a blatant rip off. The trainers for the movie were Gym Jones founder, Mark Twight, and member Logan Hood. The Gym Jones site has the \\"300\\" workout on there site. Funny thing is the now famous workout isnt a work out or plan at all. It was a test they invited to participants to partake in. Links for the test itself and the so called program can be found here:http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=35http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=36If you want a plan to follow the true 300 work out is not for you. If you want to be inspired by what can be achieved then go take a look at the links. Dont waste your money on this video if you want what the actors achieved go to the site. Do some research. Do some soul searching. Its not as easy as ordering a video where some hack rip off artist tells you what to do, but it will be more rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SPARTAN WORKOUT!!!!!!!","review":"I just wanted to let everyone know that this is NOT the spartan workout. I, too, was fooled by the title and description and was furious when I received it and found out it's just a low budget home video.

It was a fitness TEST which member's of the cast/stuntmen could take once evaluated to be in good enough shape at the end of their training for the film. Not only is there no such thing as a 300 workout done by the cast of the film, but any good trainer should be good enough at what they do to know that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real 300?","review":"If you want the real 300 workout just search it in youtube.

James, my favorite writer was Mary Stewart. I may never read her \\"Merlin\\" series again, but I still think of it fondly as a great step along the way to good reading. So when I came across a few of her books recently that I may or may not have read 20 years ago, I snatched a couple of them up, anxious to see if they held up over time. I probably should have resisted. \\"My Brother Michael\\" is an interesting story, and Mary Stewart's writing is good, but she just isn't in the same league as the Big Four. This was an OK read, and the setting was beautifully described, but the story sort of lurched along for me. I may go ahead and read another of the Stewart books I picked up at the same time as this in hopes of redemption, but then again, I may not. The good news: this is a very fast read. : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Read","review":"To me this is a hard read. The print is small and the adjectives are just too many.

I wanted to add more music to my Samba playlist, but only 10 of the songs on this album are what I would call Samba. They include nice versions of most of the standards we all know. The others are slow intimate pieces that are beautifully performed. Still, they aren't what I wanted, and so it's not a five star album for me. But if you like the slow stuff too, you will get your money's worth and lots more. For me, I'm still happy because the 10 songs I really like are still a bargain at the album price. The quality of the recording is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mammoth Book of Twentieth-Century Ghost Stories","review":"Never received the book, you returned the money to the credit card.

Even Leela, who the author created, is a little flat. If you want to go for a fourth Doctor and Leela book, I would suggest 'Eye of Heaven' by Jim Mortimore, as this book is far better than 'Last Man Running'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and disappointing","review":"I was so excited to see a new story with Leela. However this plot was so full of holes that I had to re-read several chapters before I could comprehend what was going on.

I have read most if not all of Andre Norton's books and really like the characters and messages of her books. I especially like the books with strong female characters like this one. As I've read the reviews of her other books, I'm struck by the number of reviewers who say they first read her books at age 9-12 and were hooked on science fiction and/or Andre Norton's books after reading the first one. I was the same - first read Star Gate in 7th grade and couldn't get enough from there. It seems that they taught me to \\"bend\\" my mind around corners I never would have if not for her books - imagine possibilities I never could have on my own. I have read many other science fiction authors, but Andre Norton has a special way with writing that I can't really explain, but it keeps me coming back to reread her books over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another rousing tale from a master","review":"The world of Gorth has had its natural progress damaged by an attempted benevolence of Terrans from the stars.

While it does contain much information, it contains many errors as well. A previous reviewer was right in saying there's a mistake about every 5-10 pages. Well in a 700 page book that's alot of mistakes. Also it should be noted that these are just the mistakes we've noticed. Who knows what was in error that we didn't know about beforehand to recognize as such? Kaplan should hire an editor and people studying for the PCAT should check out some of the other study guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake after mistake","review":"The book is one of the most awfully edited books by Kaplan. It's just one mistake after another. There are also so many chapter summary questions about topics that haven't even been mentioned. I am almost convinced that the person who wrote the chapter summary question and the person who wrote the chapter reviews are two different people who had absolutely no contact with each other. And the editor was probably sleeping.The reason I give it two stars is because it's pretty much one of the few books for comprehensive PCAT prep. So you're pretty much stuck with it. I recommend getting it for that reason alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Structure but Sloppy","review":"The book is structured very well but contains a major flaw every 5-10 pages. Some of the examples are worked incorrectly (p. 428, under \\"Definite Integrals\\" the equation has a '=' instead of '-') and some figures are incorrectly labeled. Everything else about the book is well-done, but I can only wonder what errors I am not picking up that are misleading me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic research book","review":"This book was recommended by a professor in my PhD program. She'd used it while getting her PhD. When she passed it around the class, we noticed her copy was obviously well used.

Surprisingly, this album shows a different side of the Trio. Keith plays objectively.

Arguably the best jazz trio in the world today, these guys live up to their billing with some of the slickest piano improvisation by Jarrett, cool drum set by DeJohnette, and brilliant work on the double-bass by Peacock. The Trio has forged a connection over the years, and it's wonderful to see that some things just get better with age. Played at the Palais de Congrès in Paris, all I can say is that I wish I had been there, but this delightful collection of classics comes amazingly close. A must buy for any jazz lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A devoted Keith Jarrett fan","review":"As a devoted fan, I always ask myself when a new release comes out \\"Do I really need another Keith Jarrett, Gary Peacock and Jack DeJohnette CD?\\" Inevitably the answer is yes and I have yet to be disappointed. That is certainly the case with this double CD set of their concert last year in Paris. The selection of music, the pacing of the trio and the intuitive way that they blend together on every cut makes this a must own. If you're unsure, listen to the first three cuts of the second CD (What is This Thing Called Love, Conception and Prelude to a Kiss) to see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Keith Jarret I like to heard","review":"It is known that the music of Keith Jarret sounds different playing alone or playing with other musicians. This well known trio with Gary Peacock an Jack DeJohnette has recorded excellent music with very few exceptions. This new CD shows this trio in its best moment. The concert in Paris was recorded in 2 CDs of very high sound quality. Really this recording is excellent. A special comments for the slow songs. The combination here of Keith's left hand with Gary's bass creates very modern nice harmonies. Among these slow songs it's necessary to make a special remark on the excellent version of Round Midnight. The rest of the songs are also excellent being in my opinion Groovin'High the top one. In few words I really consider this CD as one of the best Keith Jarret's recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music Full Of Energy","review":"This album is recorded live in Paris in the summer of 1999. The 2-cd set contains some of the most beutiful and intelligent jazz improvisation ever heard.Starting off with Bud Powell's \\"Bouncing With Bud\\", the trio is on its way. The first cd has some nice tunes, but the second cd is better. It seems that they are more comfartable and more attentive on this cd. The interesting and different song, \\"Poinciana\\", somewhat stands out because of its different rhytm. Also worth noting is the last song, \\"When I Fall In Love\\", which also can be found on the \\"Inside Out\\" album.I don't understand why some people are against Jarrett's humming. Without it the music would be more tame. The music, on the other hand, is renewed with more energy. It's just a matter of getting used to it. After that you can't live without his humming. That's just my humble opinion on that matter.\\"Whisper Not\\" is simply beutiful jazz music created by three experienced musicians.

And only after reading it do I wonder how many of those reviewers might be associates of Dr. Kassirer himself. This is not a five-star book, folks; it is one long smear from beginning to end that seems to paint the entire medical profession with the same sticky, filthy brush. Yes, there is a fair amount of spice along the way--isn't that always true of \\"exposes\\"?--but the whole seems much less than the sum of its parts.

However, I find it hard to listen to this music knowing what kind of an egotistical ... Yngwie can be. Granted, he plays lightning fast riffs without batting an eye and has created the neoclassical metal genre all by himself, but while listening to this cd, it is not very hard to notice that he has not kept the same singer for more than two cds. Overall, the music on this cd is amazing. If you're an '80's metal fan, or just into hearing a dude ... on every other solo guitar player ever, then this cd is for you. However, if you care about the behavior and principles that an artist has, you will have a hard time listening to this cd. Don't make me bring up the incident he had on the Japanese plane, or the fact that he cancelled a concert in Hong Kong because ONLY 500 people were going to show up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a quick opinion here...","review":"Some of the lyrics are a tad cheesy and some of the vocals come off sounding a little unbearable at times.

Whether it serves as a introduction to his music for someone who knows very little about him or a greatest hits kind of thing for the Yngwie fan to carry around with them when they don't want to carry around all of his albums, this is a good one to buy. I own just about every CD that Yngwie has released, even those from Steeler and Alcatrazz and although a few of my favorites are not on this album, it is an array of songs that gives the listener a real feel for what Yngwie is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooo","review":"I heard a lot about this guy around places, and I like fast music, so I thought I'd check him out. Maaaan, was I disappointed. If you buy this, you're getting 70+ minutes of noise. And not the good kind of noise, either, like DragonForce. DF has some catchy solos. Yngwie has nothing memorable, except probably the opening of Black Star, which is actually nice and slow. Otherwise, he's all \\"HEY, LOOK AT ME, I CAN PLAY FAST, PAY ATTENTION TO ME!\\" I don't see how in the hell this shmuck could have inspired neo-classical metal greats like Michael Romeo from Symphony X and Timo Tolkki from Stratovarius. To me, it doesn't matter if someone \\"pioneers\\" a genre of music, as long as it sounds good. So, I couldn't care less that he apparently \\"led the way\\" for other neo-classical guitar players, he doesn't sound good. He's all speed, and no heart. Or talent. He's just some two-bit egotistical hack who couldn't create a full memorable song to save his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acritic","review":"Yngwie is the most conceited, attention hogging guitar player known to man.

There's more excitement in the opening bars of AC/DC's 'Whole Lotta Rosie' than in Malmsteen's entire oeuvre. Comments such as those from Fenris are the sort you'd expect to hear in a playground full of 6 year olds. As a classically trained guitarist myself I'm all too appreciative of brilliant technique and am a great admirer of players like Joe Satriani, Eddie van Halen and Steve Morse who also have the tunes, the self-restraint and the humour that Malmsteen lacks. The same can be said for the entire neo-classical genre, perhaps the dullest of all metal sub-genres alongside those populated by humourless dullards such as Staind, Alice in Chains etc."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(B,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-443542f0"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/26.md","filePath":"people/26.md"}'),W={name:"people/26.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
