There is little of Ian Anderson on this disc. He produced a couple of cuts and is credited for playing the flute on one, the standout cut on the disc, Gutter Goose.

Yes Barriemore Barlow plays drums on 7 of the 11 tracks but is so restrained (with the exception of the flute solo on Gutter Geese) that his presence seems wasted. John Glascock plays on 4 cuts but also seems to be under-utilized. The problem lies in both Prior's compositions (weak) and the talent of the remaining musicians-they come across as second rate studio musicians. Stick with Prior's work with Steeleye Span in the seventies. She is at her best interpreting English folk songs to the energy of Steeleye Span of that period.

We never really got to know them because not much of this book was focused on their relationship. Yes, he loved her, but they had a lot of issues to deal with and none were ever dealt with. They never had one heart to heart talk through the entire book and I would have liked to see more of what went on between these two, like we did with Poppy and Griffin.

Barbara Delinsky allows us(the readers)to project ourselves in Lake Henry almost unconsciously, I worried about Heather's fate, and the humongous chip on Poppy's shoulder; I sympathized with Griffin and felt sorrow for Micah.

The history (especially the parts dealing with Mary's marriages to Darnley and Bothwell) have no connection to the truth whatsoever. Yolen's depiction of Bothwell, in particular, comes off like something from a bad comic book. I would have thought that even the most casual historians would have gotten past this old stereotype of him as a scheming villain who had to force Mary into marrying him. (What a joke!) By all means, children should learn history (especially the history of someone as fascinating as Mary Queen of Scots) but this is hardly the way to do it! If that wasn't bad enough, the book is very poorly written--it has little value even as literature. What else can I say? I would have given this book no stars at all if I could have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bit of historical fiction...","review":"While not extroadinary, this book definitely stands out as a good, solid story for anyone interested in this time period. It might help if you've studied it a bit as well; while I consider myself a fairly informed history buff, this particular point in history was not one I'd studied in the past, so some of it went over my head a bit. Still, I enjoyed the main and supporting characters immensely, and the plot was full of exactly the sort of court intrigue I love.Nicola, an orphan living with a group of street performers headed by her often abusive uncle, never expected to be anything but what she is. Thus she is quite surprised when the young queen Mary is so charmed by her antics that she immediately frees her from her uncle, in exchange for her becoming her own personal fool.Though it tends to move a bit slowly at times, in the end the reward is worth it. Like I said, this book is truly good, recommendable to anyone twelve on up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was gripping throughout the entire story and it wa s hard to put down.

I could say that I don't approve of her biased treatment of the subject, but it's fairer to say that her bias is different than my bias.The author clearly has a low opinion of Scots and Presbyterianism. If you're a fan of Knox, you won't care for this book.If you're looking for historical fiction relating to the Huguenots, I recommend Huguenot Garden. For a better treatment of Scots and Presbyterianism, I wholeheartedly recommend Douglas Bond's series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"Anyone who wants to learn exactly what happened to Mary Queen of Scots should go read a BIOGRAPHY! I'm sure the authors did not intend this book to be the sole resource for writing a report on Mary's life. This is a excellent book. I found my self absorbed into Nicola's world, oblivious to everything around me. A good book does that. Clearly the dialogue was well thought out in this book, because not only did Nicola's witty jests make sense, they were funny! I would recommend this book to anyone simply looking for a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review","review":"This is one of the best books that i have read.while the story focuses on Mary queen of scots it also tells Nicola Ambruzzi's story.Nicola and Italian orphan finds her Uncle the lead fo Troupe Brufort. Nicola dances in Troupe Brufort and when Troupe Brufort arrives and entertain for Mary and her husband francis Mary is fascinated by Nicola partly because she made Francis laugh gives Nicola's uncle money so Mary can keep Nicola as her own fool. Though part of the story is fictional it tells the struggle of Mary Queen of scots leaving france,ruling scotland, and then escaping from scotland to save her own life. I think this book is a wonderful tale of Mary Queen of scots full of surprises happy and sad parts.

A girl with wit and oftentimes harsh honesty was something rare and special in the Tudor era, and so is this book today.

Millions of adoring listeners can't be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Post-Punk Album","review":"Seventeen Seconds is one of those albums that works best as an album, with most of the songs functioning to set a specific mood. The centerpieces of the album are undoubtedly A Forest, a classic Cure track, and Play For Today, but everything else works to paint the stark, bleak, minimalist soundscape of the album. The album sounds like its cover picture--a dreary autumn day in the woods. So it is best not to shuffle tracks, but to just listen to the album all the way through to be pulled into the soundscape. It only takes about 35 minutes to do so, so it is a rather short album. This is a definite classic of the late 70s/early 80s post-punk scene and is highly recommended not merely to Cure fans as an essential work but also to fans of any of that scene's bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Cure Album?","review":"Minimalism at its best. Released in 1980, just after Three Imaginary Boys and Boys Don't Cry, one could argue that this is the first true Cure album. Its haunting melodies, eerie vocals and intense introspection were a sharp departure from the scattered and idiosyncratic punk/pop sound of the previous albums, and lay a firm foundation for the next two albums, Faith and Pornography.The only real single from the album is \\"A Forest.\\" A terrific song, whose heart-beat bass line finale has become a tradition at every Cure concert. Also worth noting are \\"Play for Today,\\" and \\"M\\"--bitter, resentful and dramatic, as well as \\"In Your House,\\" \\"At Night\\" and \\"Seventeen Seconds\\"--sparse, simple, and beautiful, the lonely rhythms will swallow you whole.For new fans who liked Bloodflowers, this CD would be a great choice. As Robert defeatedly says in \\"A Forest,\\" you will want to listen to this album \\"again and again and again and again....\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"As varied as Robert Smiths mood swings are the albums of The Cure. Seventeen Seconds is the most minimal, pure album they've ever recorded. You can imagine they were playing around a little with drum and guitar and they left the recorder on and discovered it actually sounded very good.Some of the tracks are merely a collection of sounds, whereas others are real 'songs'. Songs and sounds alternate in a flowing way, which makes it an album that puts you in a different state of mind.Although A Forest is one of my all time favourites, it's really the whole album you should listen to.

It's a must have for sorting large volumes of digital images, for reviewing directly from your digital camera, (be careful if your using it for B & W, i.e., TIF images scanned from negatives).

Their approach of blaming someone else is shameful. The design of the product is marginal; almost impossible to read the dark grey print on black backgrounds. It is slower than anything I have ever seen. I could go on and on but it only raises my blood pressure .

Unfortunately, Adobe just released the 1.1 version w/o the same attention to quality that the original design implied.

It then refused to be re-directed from the corrupted library and wouldn't even open.

Maybe so, but I doubt he would be adding type to his images or cutting, pasting and warping. What for? My point is that from the beginning, Photoshop has had very little to do with photography.So Adobe got together with some photographers and ended up with something that leaves the emphasis on taking and fine-tuning a great photo--not altering, retouching or salvaging a poor one (although it can do all that). And what a program it is! Fast, intuitive and surprisingly easy to use. Reasonably priced, too.Lightroom also adapts to different ways of working. If you take pictures the old fashioned way and spend a day making 3 or 4 really memorable images, no problem. Or, if you want to take hundreds of shots and edit, in the hope that a few will be good, Lightroom is even better for that.Really great software and such a pleasure to see Adobe \\"gets it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using a PC - so many issues, i give up.","review":"I was very excited to use this software.

So I upgraded to 1.42 and then when I went into develop mode to alter the images that did import correctly, the program crashed repeatedly. I downgraded to version 1.3 and still the same.

The entire help text on Printer Color Management is less than 400 words and none of it actually tells you how to do anything. It tells you what Lightroom can do, but not how to do it. Any question you ask about Color Management on Adobe's website simply refer you back to Lightroom's Help/User Guide which, as I've said, has only the vaguest of explanations.I'm sure all this stuff is covered in Photoshop because Photoshop people who move to Lightroom don't seem to have any problem printing, but I'm not buying Photoshop.I'm really glad I used the 30 day trial.

When twist is used, that feature also \\"pins\\" to the left and cannot be corrected. The updated driver available on Microsoft's website does not completely correct the problem.

It even has several lights on it which is very cool. I have had no problems with calibration or anything really....sort of.

These controllers cant seem to stand up to the rigorous use for Star Wars Battlefront as this joysticks trigger sticks ALOT, and I have been hearing little cracks/snaps and such as I use it. The palm rest snapped off in mid game. Really I am not hard on controllers, and had no problems like this with my Microsoft sidewinder pro joystick, NOW that was a durable controller. Maybe this works well for games like 1942 or whatever it is people mention, but then again I dont know that game. Again this is a great controller but a bit too fragile for me or its designed to last one week before breakage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calibrate? Again?","review":"Okay, fade to the left is a pain.. But what's worse is that the twist axis is based on an odd number, so there isn't a centerpoint... after a twist in any direction, the calibration on this stick starts to go, then keeps going and going and going...

Anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay centered","review":"I've had this for a long time - only because I don't \\"fly\\" that often. After my last computer rebuild, I decided to get back into it with FSX. (Note - I had zero problems getting working in Win7) I then remembered why I had shelved it before. I can fly normal for awhile, do some maneuvers. Move the joystick back to center and I'm doing a tailspin. To fly straight and level, I then have to hold the joystick back and to the side. Doesn't make for comfortable use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This could actually be a pretty good stick if it wasn't for the fact that its calibration is constantly getting out of whack. I'm using the stick for flight sims only (mostly Warbirds) and I'm sick and tired of having to press F12 in the game to reset the stick's center position every 20 seconds or so. That makes this stick essentially useless to me.Another thing I noticed is that in the Windows game controller calibration page, the center position is constantly jittering ... as in not quite standing still (as all other sticks I've had to date would).

If you have never heard McLean in concert, you are in for a treat. McLean's voice is heavenly on his albums, but to hear him live is unbelievable. The timbre of his voice can send chills through you and if you don't already know it, this guy can play guitar and banjo like you wouldn't believe.

I have moved on to updated technology, but this would be a back-up-phone in case of a power outage. I really don't need a long cord, so this 12 foot cord is short enough to hang out of the way most of the time. I bought a very similar product at Radio Shack for $6.99 on 12-21-2012. It was manufactured in China. This product is advertised as GE, but it is in a Verizon package. I don't think most people care if it is GE or Verizon packaging, but it does look confusing.

The book turned out to be a wonderful story of a sweet little girl who went to live with a strict aunt and all the unfolding of events in their lives. Pollyanna actually possessed a very uplifting outlook on life, always playing the \\"glad game\\" in which she always made it a point to find something positive to be glad about in spite of sad circumstances. She was actually a very uplifting influence on her entire town and upon her straight-laced aunt.

I am sixty nine years old now and I have been searching for many years for all the Pollyanna books to give to my daughters and granddaughters.

Carrie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people seem to miss the point of this story","review":"Polyanna's optimism is not \\"imbalanced\\" - she does nothing more than try to find a silver lining behind every dark cloud. The very point is that life is full of inequities. Its all too easy to feel bad; certainly everyone has problems, and some people have real reasons to be miserable. Regardless of one's situation, one can feel better by finding the good points, even if they are contrived, rather than dwelling on the bad points. Improving your own outlook directly affects quality of life, including that of those around you. I'd say Pollyanna is rather more balanced than most people, because she does not allow herself to indulge in self-pity and depression so much as others might. Its an important lesson about coping with life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pollyanna - most delightful read","review":"I am so very glad to have reread one of my favorite childhood books.

There is hardly even a plot and when there is any sort of conflict Pollyanna always comes in and saves the day before the story can get interesting. Every page I turned I was just waiting nervously for the ridiculous Pollyanna to declare \\"I am so glad!\\" I really despised how Porter made the stereotypical happy-go-lucky 1800's she could have realized that very soon there would be the Civil War. Eleanor Porter should have given this book to a soldier on the front lines then she might have seen that life is not all wines and roses. If you want to read a book about a girl in the 1800's read Anne of Green Gables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo-ring!!!!","review":"I don't think Eleanor H. Porter was thinking when she wrote Pollyanna.

At a county library book sale, I picked up both Pollyanna and Pollyanna Grows Up for a quarter each. These copies originally belonged to some young girl who, like most girls do, wrote her name and address in flourishes. I determined not to be ignorant of the real deal any longer, so I read half of it late one evening, staying up past midnight. Like a child, I couldn't wait to finish it, so the next night, I continued, turning the last page at twenty minutes after midnight. All lucky, beautiful, well-fed, well-rounded, well-dressed, well-loved, aged ten-going-on-eleven girls who \\"hate\\" their lives, would be well served to be acquainted with Pollyanna.

He actually went to the flight school and talked to the people there, and talked to the people who knew the hijackers while they were there. Where did they live? What did they do?

I had a laugh at the way Australians were portrayed - It was so exaggerated. It made it funny in a nice way- I reckon if they re-released the film, it would almost get cult status. Mum in the kitchen cooking and all perfectly made up in the middle of the Bush. The stereotypical portrayal of Aboriginals (which are referred to as blackefellas believe it or not) as good stockman and trackers. (which they were but there is alot more to ABoriginals than that - ie their culture, spirituality). The Aussie kids all blond and freckled with names like Snow (How original!)Australia had come such as long way, and we like to laugh at ourselves!

It is apparently impossible for Mintzer to conceive of a tune that doesn't have a chord chart that looks like a sequence of random symbols. So, the chart for the first tune, a 12-bar blues, contains thirteen different chords in the first 12 bars! It get's worse from there. If you want to play funk, you have to be able to jam on one chord, that's what funk is all about, but, even in Mintzer's funk tunes, the chords change every two beats, thus it is not applicable to what I think of as funk playing. The book consists of transcribed solos, there is no explanation or comment at all. I bought the \\"Etudes\\" book, and now the \\"Easy Etudes\\" book.

On this set he really funks it up and gives all he's got on probably the same material that he would be performing in the clubs at that time. The band and studio sounds are tight, funky and rockin'. Scotty Moore's production is 'bang on the money' .. On several cuts Frank puts his harp through what sounds like a Leslie speaker giving an astonishingly funky effect ..I recall Jerry McCain doing the same thing on his recordings round about this time too .If you like funky classic soul blues with a touch of a Swamp groove .. this is your best bet ..

Hersh's book acts as a guide, walking before us, as we seek to walk alongside our daughters. Instead of fearing, we can look forward to what we both can attain together. It is a gracious approach to parenting that left me with the desire to love my girls with a hopeful heart. And her practical suggestions for thought and discussion are most welcome. We even took the book on a mother-daughter road trip, and had dear talks that I believe will be rattling around in their brains for awhile.

I clean them out every few months and only need to vacuum around the edge of the one side of the mat for the tiny bits. Other than that they work great and keep the mud, water, and snow from ever touching the carpet.I especially like the edges that go up about half and inch all around to catch material should you trek it in or spill something. I only wish they had made rear mats for my car because I would have gotten them, if they have them I think it was the wrong color beige.Not only do they work great but the cloth version looks very nice in the car as it is a near perfect match for my carpet so there are no ugly rubber mats in my car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too snug fit","review":"In general I would say it's a nice carrier with nice colors, the reason it gets a 2 star rating. The problem I had that the fit was too snug for my little one. Every time I put her in the carrier she would get claustrophobic and start crying to get out. My baby's legs started to get purple because the leg openings where too small for her legs. She is now 3 months and the carrier is too tight/snug for her. I would recommend a carrier with adjustable leg openings, especially if your baby baby doesn't have skinny legs. If you have a tiny baby you can go ahead but they will outgrow it very fast.

Krystal was annoying & I believe she should have been sent home. BUT of course BET kept her for the drama. The special features show the interviews before they got casted. What was particularly interesting is that the person who chose the cast basically said she picked the attractive,popular kids. Anywho, I liked Chicky; that's about all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring except for the fight","review":"I had never seen this before but I was on a spending spree on amazon and am generally a fan of reality tv, so as this was cheap I thought I'd give it a go. Having read some of the reviews I knew there was a big fight at some stage in the series. The first episode was alright, but after that it gets pretty boring and predictable.Then comes the big fight. It is good tv, with one housemate suddenly going off on another out of nowhere. I watched the next episode but it gets pretty boring pretty quickly. I didn't even finish watching it to the end of the season. Maybe when I'm sitting around on a rainy day and I have absolutely nothing else to do I might watch the rest..... but I doubt it. Thankfully I only paid $10 for it so not a big loss, but I won't be buying any more college hill dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works... sort of","review":"Pro'sWorks on some 66M blocksCon'sDidn't work on my Leviton 66 blockOther ThoughtsI bought this to work on my Leviton 66 block.

I felt like I had read it before, either I have or it was just that unsurprising. It was a petty little story line and I disliked all of the characters. I was not impressed by the ending, nor did I feel like there was a point to the book. A great idea that could have been executed in a more interesting manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun!","review":"This is a fun, charming book. It is definitely Jane Austen with dragons; there is even one scene that consists of an elderly female relative asking if the shades of (the dragon equivalent of) Pemberley should be so darkened by such a mesalliance, and the heroine dragon essentially answers as Elizabeth Bennett would... \\"He is a gentleman, my father is a gentleman, thus far we are equal!\\" (To paraphrase.) The same result ensues. The similarities seem to be salutes, and not thefts.The culture of dragons depicted is not simply a mirror of Victorain culture with dragons substituted for people; it is a fun re-imagining of of dragon lore with regency plot-lines. Yes, plot points are predictable, but fun and clever nonetheless.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy of manners Dragon style!","review":"Excellent. Witty. Impossible to put down.I loved this so much that on finishing it, I immediately ordered every other book by Jo Walton I could find.Walton wanted to explore what would happen if the accepted truisms of Victorian novels were inescapable laws of dragon biology. Walton has fun with the tropes of 19thC novels: an appropriate marriage to fix a social mishap, the bumbling fool, the scoundrel, the wayward hero who meets his hearts desire and changes his ways to become a dedicated and loyal husband in spite of his mother's disapproval and so on.Walton is such a skilful writer that her take on Austen and Trollope's style of writing is one of honouring their styles not ridiculing it.Delightful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bike Helmet","review":"This was a Christmas gift for our son who had picked it out.

This helmet was basically free to me because I signed up for an Amazing card and received a $40. credit on the account. I really like the feel of this helmet.

What's really cool is that you can choose to have Chrissy's groovy soothing voice lead you into all poses each time you watch it, or you can change the background and music to just have timed-poses with no instruction. This makes a huge difference when you are watching this over and over again.The way this video combines a gentle Kripalu approach with a flowing Vinyasa style really helps to individualize a workout, energization level and sense of being each time you watch it. Practice yoga with this and you'll find your flow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"Wow! This one is unique! It is the first one I have found which allows the viewer to select type of music AS WELL AS instructional level, which I found keeps me coming back for more. On this video, there are three levels of instruction available, as well as three varied musicians. (For example:you might choose to have as your only audible cue the NAME of each asana, rather than having to listen to detailed instruction.) In addition, Pedersen has a soothing, motivating voice -- ideal for creating the atmosphere most of us are seeking in a great Vinyasa video. The flow itself is terrific; fluid movements and the requisite sun salutations set you on your journey, followed later by the necessary advanced balance poses and SUPER core work. This video really stands out as the one that covers ALL the bases -- perfect for all ages -- welcoming, yet challenging. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calming","review":"This video has inspired me to practice yoga nearly every day.

I was tired of my same old, same old DVDs and took a leap of faith and purchased this one. I love it! Some of the poses are too difficult for me to hold but the instruction allows for various levels of flexibility. I also love how you can select the background music and amount of instruction. This is a great workout and is pleasant to watch. Christina's voice is nice to listen to. Overall, this DVD is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!!","review":"This video is one of my favorites! When I first began doing this video I was unable to hold some of the poses (like the balance ones) for long, but after a couple months I have no problems.

Definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music for a bargain","review":"This recording introduced me to Bach's Art of Fugue, and I was was not disappointed.

For myself, I will be sending my other string quartet recordings of these pieces to the resale bin. The Emersons bring to this music, as they bring to Beethoven, Shostakovich, Webern, and Bartók (or anything else they touch), a quality in which they really do exceed the possible sum of their parts: impeccable technical skills, agile intelligence, warm heart, infectious energy, and a breathtaking sense of ensemble. Each individual voice breathes with an independence rarely achieved in performance of this work, and yet each seems somehow utterly inseparable from the others. Definitely a performance to shelve with the keepers - just like any other recording by this remarkable band of musical brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach can do no wrong!!","review":"Love it. I'm a total fan of JS Bach and could never say anything negative about any of his creations. This CD as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One more essential \\"Art of Fugue\\"","review":"The problem is, of course, what ensemble and the answer is, of course, that there isn't one answer, indeed, Bach may not have answered or raised this question himself. The homogeneity of a keyboard instrument, espcially, a harpsichord, will appeal to purists. I have several myself. Others will prefer the deconstructive and coloristic possibilities of a small string and wind ensemble. A string quartet (though Bach may never have heard one) offers a valid compromise, the narrower but still varied palette of bowed instruments. My only reservation is that the Emersons do not play this work with the restraint period performance practice might have imposed. Sometimes they indulge in a level of Angst und Sehnsucht more appropriate to Beethoven than Bach. Nonetheless, a valuable addition to any collector of the seemingly infinite angles from which this monument can be glimpsed. Is there a version for full orchestra perhaps conducted by Pierre Boulez?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story! Respectable Storytelling.","review":"What a story! A classic tale of corruption in Washington, DC. I was both entertained and educated by the author's summary of this complicated series of events. He introduces the characters, the situation, and describes the \\"action\\" in a respectable narrative style.Sometimes I pay almost no attention to the Federal Government. The unveiling of Abramoff, DeLay, Ralph Reed, and the other villains is this drama passed me by. This book has filled me in admirably. Stone's choice of level of detail seemed just right.I take off one star for the few places where one wishes the editor had made the author clean up unnecessary repetition, and for the general lack of color. The style is that of a journalist, not a novelist.A fine job of reducing a complicated story to a brisk, informative read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a shallow xerox job","review":"The problem with this book is it swallowed whole what had already been reported in the press without the author doing any analysis or insight. Stone didn't delve into the depths. He just skimmed the surface. The author simply bought everything the Washington Post said, swallowed whatever Senator John Sidney McCain claimed, and believed the verdict imposed by the Justice Department, because the matter never went to trial. He had no access to Abramoff and no access to 99% of the documentary evidence that McCain refused to release. In a word, this author didn't scratch below the surface. He just basically photocopied what the press had already reported. This book is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an ignorant book","review":"This knucklehead author does not have a clue as to what actually happened in this scandal or how it happened. He doesn't understand the commercial interests that were at stake in taking down Abramoff. He doesn't understand the vendettas, the resentments, the envy that drove a lot of what happened. It's instructive that Abramoff delivering for his clients (to where they signed and re-signed him over years) and owning Democratic politicians is essentially never mentioned. Basically, this book is an embarrassment"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEO-CONMAN","review":"This book didnt go far enough of this neo-conman's connection to Dubja \\"00's\\" decade of greed; similar to the gopper \\"80's\\" greed.

That points up the two things wrong with this: the band sounds tentative, like they're not comfortable with the new material, and the setlist is drawn almost entirely from those first two albums. That leads to some questionable choices: it opens with the big, inspiring \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" music (uh, that's \\"Kill the Wabbit\\", if you don't recognize the name), and then the band comes in with a big, exciting, crashing chord, and you're just dying to hear them tear into \\"Captain Nemo\\", and it's an extreme letdown to hear \\"Armed and Ready\\" instead. Another odd choice is the piano ballad \\"Never Trust a Stranger\\", which surprisingly works very well live, and fits in well with the rest of the tunes because everything is played s-l-o-w. On the other hand, Schenker himself is great, so how bad can it be?

The problem is that one finds themselves taking one step too many in memorizing both the mental picture and then the definition. This takes way too much time (time you don't have an abundance of on the verbal section of the SAT). Another easy trap to fall into is to simply memorize the picture and forget what word it's associated with. Looking at some other reviews, I see this system is working just fine for some people (meriting its two-star rating).

The cues and images that the author uses to help remember words are very effective for my daughter. I know because I have tried it both ways -- with straight word study, and with this book. When going over word lists and definitions, my daughter would always forget words, and I would have to let her look at a word and its definition again. With this book, however, I have never had to repeat. When she is stumped, she recalls the word cues or images and -- bingo. I try to reinforce the word definition with real-world sentences.

The stryline was alittle confusing as chapters jumped back and forth between times and characters. I loved the premise of the story, but would have enjoyed it from a more historical view rather than from the present day -just my own personal preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and disappointing","review":"I rather liked the historical details and information about jewels that were worked into the story, but like other reviewers I found the characters cold, distant and not compelling. Katherine, the protagonist, suffers from the malady that ruins so many novels nowadays -- she's a self-involved narcissist whose obsessions are meaningless. The only remotely likable character is Daniel, and he suffers from another common character malady: he does little except question why he does so little. The quest is a snore, although there are a few highlights along the way; the \\"insights\\" and requisite quirky characters held little meaning for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly thrilling...","review":"I have to admit I did not finish this book. I slugged through the first three-quarters over about three weeks then skipped ahead to the last page, decided it wasn't worth the effort and put it away. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't call this book \\"riveting\\" or \\"thrilling\\" (maybe I just gave up too soon). Like other reviewers I didn't find Katharine particularly likeable though that didn't bother me much. She just wasn't all that interesting. The brothers, Daniel and Salman, were only a little more interesting. Actually the most interesting \\"characters\\" in the book were the stones themselves. Two stars for the stones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs some lust","review":"The minute you think of ancient stones, history and chase...you (watching too much TV as a youngen) expect ...well some lust, a lascivious love story interplaying all these chases.Nope- nothing.

Better books elide out all but the relevant fragments, but poor books include the whole program to flesh out their page count. This is really a 100-page book in disguise.To give you an idea of what level the author is targetting, on page 155 he helpfully explains, \\"You are probably familiar with the try-catch blocks...

You can't imagine how painful that is, because chances are you won't be able to run Knudsen's code on your device. Not only that, you won't even be able to compile it with your version 1 tools. It's a shame really, it's otherwise a good intro to J2ME with plenty of code and an appendix which serves as a reference. Pity that we'll all have to wait at least for another year to use this book while the mobile device manufacturers get up to speed.

I guess I just don't enjoy the rock em sock em ultra-viol like I did as a kid, but there also isn't any depth to hold onto here.

The classic example was Dennis Hopper's elevation to zietgeist guru after 'Easy Rider' only to rapidly fall after being shipped off to Peru with a budget to play it again, Sam. The self indulgent results were the stuff of legend. Lumbered with a fiasco to rival Norman Mailer's 'Tough Guy's Don't Dance', the studio rightly calculated Kill Bill Vol 2 would have a sufficient fan base to be worth releasing and the die hards would pronounce it a masterpiece anyway. It has made money. Those of you who went to 'Reservoir Dogs' expecting to see 'an amazing, pumping powerhouse of a movie' (as the billing boasted) only to be confronted with a filmed stage play of tedious verbosity, will not be dismayed by the last quarter of Vol 2, which makes boredom almost an art form.

Halfway through I couldn't believe I still had to sit there another hour through this pointless and meandering drivel. After almost every scene you found yourself thinking, \\"What did that have to do with anything?\\" other than, of course, to give QT a mouthpiece on his particular views (the Superman speech for example).

The film was an energetic experimental collage that pushed the boudries of storytelling in cinema. Vol 2. is just boring, it's like Jackie Brown, a radio show with a follow along picture book.The Kill Bill story is very simple, The opening scene of Vol.1 allowed the rest of the film to flow visually and conceptually without rules, it assumes that you have already seen 3 more movies about revenge, so it doesn't spend too much time dwelling on a story that you heard before.Vol 2.focuses on characters who yap about the obvious.

And even then...","review":"Without the extended dialogue sections between the various characters, which also act as useful exposition, this is is hardly the classic too much trumpeted. There is nothing one hasn’t seen many times before in other films. This is often something I have always thought of QT films, as if he simply took a bunch of movies, edited out sections, tied them together, and shot it all over again. Jackie Brown is his only original enough movie, which I think is his best, to date.If a Directors cut were to happen, I think Kill Bill 1 & 2 should be made into one complete movie and some superfluous scenes removed.

If people are giving this film one star for its lack of action, they are simply idiots! There is so much more to a movie than just action. If you guys want to see non stop action, then go check out a Jet Li film or something. Anyhow, I thought Kill Bill Vol. 2 was a lot better than the first.

At least, that is what I have found. It creates 'catharsis' (involves the audience through feelings of fear and pity)! Indeed, it's not a movie you can just watch at any old moment, or too soon again afterward, or view lightly. And I can't put on Volume 1 without seeing it through to completion within a short time. It takes a very special kind of film to have this sort of effect on me personally, and I find these two halves of a whole film to be just the right type; therefore I heartily recommend them to all who consider watching it but haven't yet. It's heavy, high-powered, charged, and flows from one monumental scene to another almost without consideration for the viewer. And superb quotes? There are too many to count. All in all, utterly brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Underated Movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies...It was great. I can't wait to get it.

Great Movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's back for the final cut!","review":"Uma Thurman shines in this wonderful sequel to the original Kill Bill. Beatrice Kiddo (Thurman) only has three other people left on her list: Bud, Elle, and Bill. While Beatrice never gets to fight Bud, she has a spectacular fight with Elle that is reminscent of her earlier confrontation with Vernita. Not to spoil it for people who haven't seen it I will tell you that it will leave you gasping at the conclusion of their fight. But the real star of this is David Carradine (RIP). He is charismatic as the Snake Charmer Bill, leader of the Vipers. He has such great chemistry with Thurman that it's a shame he had to leave us so tragically. This is a must for any Tarantino fan. The only downside is we'll have to wait for anymore Kill Bill films."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LIKE ACTION YOU WILL.......HATE THIS FILM","review":"I seen vol.1 the day it came out in theaters and i loved it couldnt not wait for the second. finally the day came and i went to go see sadly i didnt care for it. the movie starts out very boring alot of scenes carry on for way to long and the 1 yes i said it 1 fight scene in the movie isnt that great and is not very long the part that made me give it 2 stars was the acting was great and the flashback to Umas training is sweet i liked that alot but other then that nothing happins and the last fight with bill isnt even a fight. when they start to go at it, it was cool but i dont call it a fight scene"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Awsome Movie!!","review":"If you haven't seen this movie you got to see it.

In Vol 2 the viewer gets to see how and why things were the way they in Vol 1. The story, essentially, comes full circle- providing the viewer with a complete story instead of two hours of gore.

Vol.1 was a fast-paced tribute to pop culture of both east and west - and for that reason, many people criticise vol. 2 because its basically the opposite. But you have to remember that its not so much a sequel as the second half of a film. Vol.2 does not have the blood-spraying violence and in-your-face tenacity that gives the first film its bite, but it does have richer character development and also an emotional maturiy that was not as apparent in the first volume.Vol. 2 should not disappoint, though - the coffin scene, the opening flashback in black/white, and especially the 'cruel tutelage of pai mei' (in my opinion the movie's best scene).For those expecting vol.1's ferocity with perhaps even more, you'll be disappointed, but it doesn't stop Kill Vill Vol. 2 from being one mad film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This movie was just as great as the first.

At some points it does drag with no substantial dialogue, or anything for that matter. Likewise one could make an argument that \\"Kill Bill-Volume 1\\" was too much, with hardly any dialogue. So in reality, \\"Vol. 2\\" is really the balancing act. It provides a heart for the saga, without forgetting how to entertain. Whereas \\"Vol. 1\\" paid homage to Eastern influenced films through an anime scene, and through the brilliantly staged action sequences, \\"Vol. 2\\" pays homage to Western spaghettis through its black and white prologue, Texas \\"funeral\\", and of course Uma's fight with Daryl Hannah. The end scene with Bill, played brilliantly by David Carradine, is both sad and triumphant at the same time. And all the while, Tarantino hammers out a pretty solid, heartfelt story."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Dope","review":"blah blah blah this movie's f'ing awesome. Watch it. In HD though.

It's an action flick, lots of blood and gore, but it has a few silly moments, too. One of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarintino takes a two part dump.","review":"Tarintino plops out another stinker. This movie is so full of it that it is like 100 pounds of poop stuffed in to a 5 pound bag. Some people like it, that does not make it good. Uma Thurman realy capitalzes on her complete lack of acting ability.Tarintino wants you to think he is great for ripping off other movies. Don't be fooled by the hype. Watching this movie wastes your time. This Tarintino pervert actually had the gall to urge little kids to sneak into his celebration of rape and murder. There must be a special place in hell for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXACT OPPOSITE OF FIRST","review":"I came into Vol. 2 with expectations of awesome fighting scenes, good dicection, and great script. This movie cound't have been less like the first one. The bride took on and killed at least 200 people in the Vol 1, but less than 10 in Vol 2. I didn't rent Vol 2 for an Emmy award winner, I rented it for the action. Frankly, it was about an hour to long, with much of it being fluff that is not needed at all. I'll expect better from Quentin next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as Volume 1","review":"There is less action in this volume than in the first, which makes it more tedious. To be fair this is just the wrap up of Volume 1, but I found the second installment to be quite boring at times. There are several scenes that could have been cut from both volumes and they should have been combined into a single movie. Splitting the movie was a cheap grab for more money and this ploy should not be tolerated in the future. Worth a rent if you've already seen Volume 1 and need closure. Otherwise skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....What went wrong?","review":"The first one ruled. But when the second one came out- Everything went wrong.Too much talking and blah blah blah in this movie. In the first movie my eyes were wide, in this one, they were shut.Now the scene of Uma coming out of the coffin through the dirt was straight out unreal. I didn't know if I was watching action or a Sci-Fi movie.I give it two stars because there were some scenes that were kind of cool- To mention the kung fu master scenes and the 4th Assassin losing her left eye.I don't even want to go about the ending how Bill dies. There could've been more to it.Don't waste your time renting this or buying it on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"I've seen every Tarantino movie.And I have to say, this is the worst.I thought he was done a quality material again.

They usually eating popcorn, they're drinking cola, and they're laughing at primitive jokes.(...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quentin LOVES Uma...","review":"...and obviously cares very lttle about making cohesive, thought-provoking cinema any more. Sure, he is known for his collection of Seventies' B-movies, and literally throws in as many references as he can in this one. But if Kill Bill Vol.1 was at least an often funny, irreverent and well-choreographed tribute to the trash films of the 1970s, Vol. 2 is his love note to star Uma Thurman. He manages to capture every angle possible of the wraith-like Thurman and loses no self-created opportunity to get close-up shots of her face, mud-spattered and all.This film has the look and feel of being a slapped-together mish-mash of outtakes from Vol. 1, with ridiculous B-movie dialogue tacked on, and a story appearing to have been created as a means of tying up loose ends at the last minute.Awful, simply awful. And this was the same guy who gave us Reservoir Dogs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely overrated","review":"I seriously can't believe people are still so obsessed with these two movies. All they are is a complete savagefest of unnecessary blood and fighting moves. This movie is just as gory(in an unnecessary amount) as the recent release Land of the Dead, the only difference is there are swords (in 2003 and 2004) and there is some kind of strange exagerated martial arts... Overall it's simple to say Quentin Tarantino himself is overrated as a director as well (I didn't say actor because I don't think anyone has ever confused him as a good one in that catagory), and his truly only good movie was Pulp Fiction. This movie as well as the first one were disapointing especially after all the hype i heard about both of them.

We all know the song, just like we all know the Kill Bill saga is one long violent, bloody, amoral MESS. I promised myself and my Lord that I would not watch volume 2, but my friend's daughters assured me that the second half was far superior.Friends and fans (of my reviews! Unite!), let me tell you this movie is even more violent and disturbing than the first one. I'm glad I ate light before watching, because I surely would've tossed my cookies in a literal sense when watching a woman trapped underground in a coffin! Yeah, it's that bad.This movie sets the feminist movement (which I'm part of, and proud of it) backwards about 15-20 years. Uma Thurman has been celebrated for becoming a walking skeleton.

Even though the film is a bit tamer than the first, this installment is presented more as a psychological thriller/western-type thing rather than just a hack 'n slasher. The best part of this movie has to be the grave sequence...where \\"the Bride\\" is buried alive by one of her many enemies. You are made to feel as if you are right there with Uma as she struggles to get out of the wooden coffin she's in. Tarantino does a great job in carrying out this sequence...and it sends chills up your spine! And of course, who could forget the death of Elle Driver! Now that was classic! Elle was absolutely wonderful in this movie too...and gave \\"the Bride\\" a good run for her money...and her life!! She will be sorely missed!Go out today and get this one! It is most excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal, even better than Vol. 1","review":"Focusing less on the bloody mayhem of Vol. 1 and more on his typical brand of storytelling and dialogue, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 2 brings his epic homage to a close. Picking up where the first film left off, Vol. 2 finds the Bride (Uma Thurman) continuing her quest for revenge as she hunts down Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Darryl Hannah) in America before finally taking on Bill (David Carradine). The Bride's past is fleshed out and we learn what led up to the massacre at the wedding chapel which left our heroine in a coma and with a thirst for vengeance. Thurman is still perfect in the role she was born to play, and Carradine gives his best performance in years. Still though, you can tell this was a film that Tarantino made more for himself than for the movie going audience. It's still his homage to grindhouse cinema, and it's still as fresh as Volume 1.

For every 5 minutes of good stuff, there were 30 minutes of fluff.I would have cut several scenes out or at least in half: The \\"strip club\\" scene was a waste. The \\"Superman\\" speech was lame. The \\"wedding rehearsal\\" was a useless.David Carradine's character kept telling drawn-out stories and kept telling them. I was sitting there thinking, \\"Come on already. Get to the point, Bill!\\"KB2 was the equivalent of \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" with Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader sitting down for a chat instead of fighting.Someone needs to re-do this movie with some decent fight scenes and a lot more emphasis on Uma.

I like twists, but after watching all 4 hours of the Kill Bill epic I felt like I had been robbed. Volume one was great lots of action, humor and symbolism. Volume 2 (with some execptions) was just empty and predicable. At the end I hated everything and everybody. There was no coolness, no latent hipness. No angst from somebody who was locked in a video store overnight - just a sort of sick contest to be the most unlikeable. There was a possiablity for a really cool ending that would have redemed some and explained more, but instead we just get a stupid joke and emptyness.I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the thermometer","review":"I noticed that Kill Bill was recommended to me by whatever powers there be at Amazon because -- among other things -- I had purchased a Polder Cooking Thermometer.

I even rented the 1st Vol. the day before (which is magnificent)and was totally disappointed. In Vol. 1 Uma Thurman is just plain AWESOME. A unique heroine with a mission. Here she appears weak. It is not just the lack of violence and gore like some reviewres say but, the film is so predictible, It takes a 180 degree turn in the story, cinematography, and even the characters appear weaker. It also tries to build up a climax (which everyone is awaiting) that never occurs.

I think Quintin was very creative in putting it all togather, beleive me it couldn't have gotten any better. Some may think Quintin is over doing it, i think everything is possible. Uma really shocked everyone with her stellar performance, her facial expression really showed desire and ambition for revenge. I really loved the epilogue in the begining of the second movie, the acting was awsome and loved the cameo appearance of Sameul L. Jackson.

Im tired of people writting that there is too much dialogue. That is what Quentin does and that is his speciality. He doesnt need action to make a movie exciting.

In short, expect everything that you loved about the first part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kill the bill","review":"\\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\\" was something of a surprise. The first movie was some kind of slapstick-and-slash, samurai parody. The second was closer to a serious drama, with a lot more character development. I had expected the comic book splatter to simply continue for another two hours...Part of me was disappointed, another part actually liked \\"Volume 2\\" better. My more serious side, perhaps?But sure, the concluding part of Tarantino's inimitable epic does have its fair share of mayhem, including murder by black mamba, poisoned fish or kung fu. Best character: Samuel L. Jackson as an obscure jazz player, visible for only two or three minutes. LOL.

Chapters 1, 2, 8, and 13 are very general as they look at the nature of education and gender roles in England during the lifetimes of these six authors. At times her analysis of how the real lives of authors are reflected in their work seems stretched to the limit -- but this could be claimed in most literary analysis. As a writer, I can say that yes, our lives affect our work, but how it affects it can only be truly understood by talking to the author herself and there is no evidence that Hoberman has done this.

Definately one of the biggest highlights of this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums this year","review":"If you are looking for something that will never get old and be worth every cent you pay for, aside from the new Devildriver cd comming out, this is the album to get!Never before has a band given so much emotion and soul to a cd that doesn't sound like a pantera album gone completly wrong.Please believe me when I say that if this cd doesn't grace your collection, you will eventually hate yourself and your friends will hate you for not owning this.The Agony Scene is one of those bands that seems to get better with age... much like Devildriver, Killswitch Engage, and Slipknot.The best of the best is on this album...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book if you are serious about learning","review":"I bought this book for my wife who is taking a Chinese language course.

Had to push a button a bunch of times but it saved my TV which was on for days and couldn't be turned off manually or with a broken remote. It's REALLY light and I use it for my cable and tv, but it also has a dvd option as well. My only complaint is that it doesn't pickup any of the select features or info buttons for my cable box (Io/Cablevision).

It almost doesn't feel like I'm holding anything. The photographic power of the cam is pretty good... to the point that I gave up the 8mp Sony T20 for this 6mp. This cam doesn't take pics as fast as the Sony but it is still unlikely that you will miss a shot. This camera isn't slow, the Sony is fast.

I'm a member of a different church but I bristle now if I hear someone call these people a cult or weirdos. They have their own individual opinions and some use doctors, just like any other group of people. It's a totally upbeat book about the life led by Mrs. Terrell, her husband and children and they're as well-grounded as any other American family. I enjoyed following her adventures. She's got a lot of courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soul Cleansing Read","review":"Karen Molenaar Terrell's, Blessings: Adventures of a Madcap Christian Scientist, is a book that reminds us of how devotion can bring us through life, and how aspiring to kindness makes the world a better place. Her short meditations on positive thinking are a joy to read and a reminder of how the simple act of saying nice things can change one's entire outlook by taking the poison out of our human tendency towards negativity - she does so, embuing the text with a naturual humor and a joy that make the pages fly by. Terrell's testimony to Christian Science is written without judgement, makiing it accessible to everyone. I read the book in one night and felt a lightness of spirit and a cleanliness of the soul when I was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Book","review":"This is a very lighthearted book that gets to the heart of healing. Nothing stuffy, preachy or pie in the sky about this book. The author gives instances where she and others have been healed by prayer. The healing of a dog named Christmas is a very sweet story and you can sense the love that was behind the healing. The dog understood love and responded to it and expressed it as well. The injured dog had a human friend and dog friend that were caring, loving and loyal. I've often marvelled how dogs express things so simply and naturally without a church affiliation, class teaching or Sunday school advising them how it's done. I really liked this book for its remarkable down to earth style without a trace of the familiar \\"holier-than-thou\\" attitude that leaves you heavy laden.

I would highly recommend before reading the book to go on the internet and read the author's biography first, and you will better understand how she was able to write such a book.

The stories are different, but I liken them to each other b/c of the time travel.At first, I was confused/skeptical because while in Kindred, it was obvious that the characters were switching worlds, this book appeared to have been done as a dream.

I have had cordless phones for a while now and this is the first one that I have had that is getting so much static, even though the base is less that 50 feet away from the handsets. I have the base in my bedroom and when I use the handset in my dining room, there is so much static that I can't hear the person on the line. Also one of the handsets did not ring until I switched cradles. Then I have been seeing strange messages on the handsets like \\"line in use\\" even though the other phones are seated in their cradles and off.

The LCD panel on the base unit is hard to read at best, but when wall-mounted the display is barely readable unless you stoop to view it from below. The brightness of the readout varies from day to day, oddly; sometimes it isn't readable at all.We might have been able to live with that (inertia is a powerful thing), but the reception on the two wireless phones is awful - conversations are interrupted by intermittent bursts of static even when standing ten feet from the base station.There are far better phone systems out there for the same money.

The album is knit together cleanly, starting with the electric bluegrassy \\"Redbone Hound\\" and moving into the soulful \\"Forget Me Not\\", a song that you'll find popping up in your mind at some time or another. The Dillards stay true to their bluegrass roots (did you know they were the Darling Boys washtub band on the old Andy Griffin show?) but they mix in urban reality with songs like \\"One A.M.\\" and \\"Last Morning\\". All of this before you even get to the \\"Tribute to an American Duck\\" album on the CD. If you're only mildly interested in adding to your bluegrass collection, or if you are a rabid country/rock fan looking to broaden your horizons from the early Eagles, Marshall Tucker, Outlaws, et al. you can't go wrong with these two albums on one CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foghat and Guests Blurry Tribute","review":"This is the worst looking DVD I have ever owned.

His translations of Lorca's BLOOD WEDDING and Wedekind's SPRING AWAKENING are not to be missed either. Seneca's OEDIPUS is available I believe only in softcover.

However, the book had a bit of a \\"soapbox\\" feel to me. It was full of articles, how-to rituals,(which are fine in their own right, but I wanted stories) and just an offhand mention of stories. I felt a little cheated, because I wanted a light hearted and fluffy, feel good book and got what felt a bit like a homework assignment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Christie","review":"Of all the Agatha Christie books I've read, this is my very favorite. It is the most beautifully written of all her mysteries, and the story is tragic and beautiful. Elinor Carlisle is on trial for the murder of her deceased aunt's ward, Mary. She is the ideal suspect because she was in love with Roddy ? (forgot his last name) who fell in love with Mary when he met her, though he was engaged to Elinor. And Hercule Poirot is appointed by this doctor who loves Elinor to try and get Elinor not convicted. The end is truly surprising and there is pretty much NO WAY you can find out who the true killer is unless you look in the back of the book. The way Christie tells this story is just truly amazing. And the poem in the beginning by Shakespeare makes everything even better. I really can't describe this book with justice. It's just beautiful, truly tragic and beautiful.

This particular edition gets only 2 stars because, as other reviewers have mentioned, parts of the book are missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"What do I even say. It's great. It's a classic for a reason. Read it in high school, read it as an adult.

A chapter or two a day is al it takes, this is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of the name classic","review":"This is considered by many to be \\"the great American novel\\". It certainly is impressive, but not so much for the storytelling as the enormous amount of research Melville put in the book about whales and the whaling profession. The erudite and often long-winded passages about the anatomy of the whale, the different types of whales, why whales were hunted and their uses were all very interesting, but I felt I was reading a textbook more often than a novel. The very end of the book was the best, when they at last meet the white whale and the book takes us through everyone's different reactions to this event. You know the book can't end well from the beginning, but it was a long and interesting journey through the depths of obsession and the ultimate downfall that becomes those who set their lives upon revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow The Leader","review":"This was nice if you are an into the English language.

Today such an assessment would be inconceivable. Like War and Peace and other great classics, this is a novel that has everything. It's funnier than I remember, it's an adventure story, an ethnographic romp, and, oh yes, a profound reflection on good and evil and monomaniacal obsession. For under $5, this is possibly the single best value in all of Amazon. Under $5 and you'll never be quite the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke possibly?","review":"Who needs a strategy guide for Tekken? All the moves are listed in the start menu.

The handle is a little short for anyone with large hands, but the heavily serrated blade would put most steak knives to shame. It must be designed for cutting some very hard cheeses! This knife is best suited to be used on a stoneware plate or a cutting board with a ceramic tile cutting surface.

Maddy Prior certainly has a great voice, and besides the track which many other reviewers really like, that being \\"Long Lankin,\\" which is just simply amazing, their are about 3-4 tracks in a row on this album that are almost equally as good in my opinion. I would give this 5 stars, but I need to hear more of their other albums to make a comparison. Many years ago I had one of their earlier albums, and it was quite good. I would highly recommmend this album/CD to anyone that collects the British folk-rock music, this band was very good, and this has got to be one of their best according to many reviews I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage, but not best, Steeleye Span","review":"For my opinion, this is not among the best of Steeleye's productions from this period (all of which I have owned for over twenty years). The problem is basically the material, all of which is treated in a more-or-less consistent but not really inspired fashion. That said, *I* own it and have played it quite a few times, and if you like Steeleye in general you will doubtlessly like \\"Commoner's Crown.\\" For those unfamiliar with Steeleye, I suggest starting with \\"Parcel of Rogues\\" or \\"Below the Salt,\\" either of which are easily among the best folk-rock albums of the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"At their all-time best!","review":"Excuse my huge disagreement with other reviewers, but this album is number one in my collection which I listen to and float away to the Medieval landscape and share a glass of port with the Galtee Farmer, and sink in wonder to the darkest ocean depths in Demon Lover. If you don't fall in love with these incantations, then you've got no business in being a fan of the greatest folk rock band that ever existed! The imagery in the lyrics, accompanied by Span's hardest driving vocals and guitars, is second to none. As a fan of albums from the likes of Jethro Tull and Fairport Convention, among myriad others, I recommend this album as one of my top 2!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry...","review":"Book was very dry and the guys neo-con beliefs leak into the book in a way I found annoying enough to stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful","review":"fascinating read. a bit repetitive on certain subjects, but that's a minor flaw given what the author achieves overall - succeeds in challenging and changing preconceived notions about the \\"purity\\" of language, of \\"dialect\\" versus language, about the intricate relationships between language, politics, and economics."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a good source to learn about teaching strategies","review":"I was used to read it , but now i like the Linguistic the most.Most of techniques in Linguistic are awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written","review":"This book might have been deadly dull if anyone but John McWhorter had written it.

There's much more involved than just mutations. Second, the author states several times as fact that there once existed a single language possessed by the humans who migrated out of Africa to populate the world. I don't question the migration but the idea that there once existed a single spoken language used by all living humans is absurd. This idea implies, and the author directly implies this idea since he states it several times, that a single mutation brought the human power of speech into existence. Although I'm not going to attempt to provide any proofs here, the development of human language must have been a progressive process taking unknown hundreds of thousands of years to reach its full powers as we know of it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad, and the boring...","review":"This book is a mix of interesting \\"did you know\\" facts, mind-numbing forays into pidgin and creole languages, and evolutionist rubbish, with a LOT of private \\"wink-nudge\\" notes and 20th-century pop culture references thrown in.

Language helps to construct, register and appreciate culture. Language is and was developed as a social tool which allowed meaning to develop within a community. That is the foundation of a culture.And John the natural processes you document so well are facts. But the fact that language change exists in what you claim are static cultures; such as the tribes in the New Guinean highlands indicates simply that that either their culture too has developed down the years or that language changes regardless of culture. But regardless of the inherent flexibity of language, culture may also drive other changes in the language. The recent tendancy to nominalisation in English is an example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big omission","review":"Professor Whorter completly skipped over the most fundamental information in relation to the start and migration of Indo-European languages from the Armenian Plateau. He did not mention the research by Professors Atkinson and Gray, published in Nature Magazine in 2003, of the Indo-European language having its roots in Tocharian and Armenian, which dates back at least 9000 years. Professor Ivanov's 25 year research of the Indo-European langauge, which confirmed the Atkinson's and Gray's comperative linguist analysis, was also missed. An omission at this magnitute places a faulty foundation on proceeding arguments including the omission of the Armenian language roots of almost all Indo-European languages including Greek and German. Robert Ellis, in his book, Armenian Origins of the Etruscans, had more to say 105 years ago on this topic than professor Whorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"This oddly unsatisfactory book is well reviewed by Andrew Rasanen, who awards it 3 stars; if I give it 2 it is only because Mark Abley's superficially similar book The Prodigal Tongue is so much better.

The brass on the pommel and scabbard really lends itself well to that \\"old-viking\\" feel.Last comment: even though it's bladed and looks really well put together, I'm not sure it would be sturdy enough to actually deliver a blow.

Marry Higgins Clark is an author that includes every little detail as possible for the reader to visualize what is really going on in the minds of the characters. As a reader I was amazed and stunned by the shocking surprises that were unexpected. This book is one of the first books I've read by Marry Higgins Clark and I just couldn't put it down. I'am looking forward to keep reading another of her best selling books by this terrific author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book....","review":"As soon as I put this book down, I couldn't wait to get back to it!

I will definitly be reading more of her books in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cry in The Night","review":"A Cry in the night. This book is the best book you can read of mystery's. I like this book personally because it's more human like and is what would really happen in this world instead of some fantasy land. The five things I like about this book are: when jenny enjoyed herself, erich took jenny and the girls shopping, tina and beth got to ride the ponies, tina volunteered to do almost anything, and when rooney came to visit and taught jenny how to sew. Five things i didn't like about this book are: when jenny was accused of kiling kevin, joe oved out of his mothers house, erich goes to the cabin for days, joe gets fired from his job on the farm, and when the sherrif ask to many questions and jenny faints. the people who would enjoy this book are people who like mystery and gory in one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Shot In The Dark\\"","review":"This was my first Mary Higgins Clark read. What got me right from the start is how she wrote one of the last chapters first. It really got me into it right away. I call it a shot in the dark because the main character, Jenny goes out on a limb and falls in love with (and marries) a man she just met and gets swept into a world of weirdos and her life just gets swept upside down. It is quite exciting, and interesting complete with poisonings, thefts, kidnappings, and more. Quite a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eerie & chilling web of manipulation and obsession.","review":"This was the first book I read by MHC. I absolutely adored it. I'm a sucker for a romance-mystery and MHC is generous with both in this read. There's an old-fashined cliche, \\"look before you leap\\". Jennie, the central character, should have done precisely that before she wed the highly charming and yet too mysterious and aloof Erich. This was an excellent read. In fact, it turned me into an instantaneous fan of MHC. Some of her other books were a little more fast-paced, but you won't be disappointed nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Clark's Best","review":"I am an avid reader of Mary Higgins Clark, and once again I can say that this book is Awesome!!

(the murderer comes home, cleans up his mess and unwinds with a glass of vodka in his study. the victim is always a single, rich woman living in a new york skyline apartment. why couldn't the murderer be a woman for once?) anyway, about THIS book, it wasn't that, so to me, that made it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Mary's best!

I have read all of her books at least once and I read this one a couple of years ago and it is STILL fresh on my mind. I won't reveal the plot in this review but I'm confident that if you like mysteries, you will read it in one sitting; I did. After reading the other reviews of Mary Higgins Clark's works, I will agree that most of her stories are somewhat similar, some (though few) maybe even predictable, but she keeps it clean and smooth, never too may words or too much useless info. They usually have a happy ending in which the good \\"guys\\" or \\"ladies\\" win and I feel satisfied when I'm done reading it. Honestly, in this day and time, couldn't we all use a happy ending? All in all, this is my favorite, but don't take my word for it - read it yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I just could not get into this book. First, it was obvious from about the tenth page that this was going to revolve around Jenny looking like Erich's mother and Erich being obsessed with his mother. Secondly I just could not root for the character of Jenny, who invites a strange man,who was clearly coming on way too strong, into your home the first day of meeting him when you have two young daughters and than marrying him and taking your young girls to live with this man you barely know. Jenny seemed to not care about the safety of her children and seemed desperate for a man and easily bossed around."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful","review":"Very good read and had me from the beginning.

Besides the two instances where an animal was cruelly and unnecessarily killed, I could see the predictable, happily-ever-after ending coming a mile away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you have never before read a May Higgins Clark novel, I can see raving about this book. However, as a big Mary Higgin Clark fan, I found 'A Cry in the Night' disappointing. Personally, I am used to the books of MHC usually having plots twists and endings that are complete surprises. While this book did have one twist, the ending seemed obvious, and I grew anoyed with Jennie, the novel's protagonist. She was not the typical proactive heroine of a Higgins Clark book, who you cheer on as they unearth the truth.If this is your first May Higgins Clark book, enjoy- you probably will find it eerie and riveting- but if it's not I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"The description stated like new...it was not.

If you look at an older copy of this, like a library copy, you see in the earlier editions she dedicated it to her SECOND husband, and at that time she LIVED in Minnesota! Apparently that marriage was brief and unhappy, she returned to the NY/NJ area where she now lives and remarried a few years ago to her current husband. there has never been any reference to the 2nd marriage or to her life in Minn. again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book of many by Mary Higgins Clark","review":"This book was great.

This is not mindless pop, nor is it melodrama and \\"woe is me\\" ramblings. This is brilliantly conceived and executed music, lyrically intricate and musically challenging. Think Kander & Ebb's \\"Cabaret\\" score meets post-punk pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This is an entertaining, slightly different kind of CD. The songs are consistantly good, the lyrics unique and the tunes are catchy without being annoying (with the exception of coin-operated boy... that one does get annoying).Amanda Palmers voice is self admittedly flawed but somehow that adds to the charm of the music for me (perhaps not for everyone)Definitely a CD I'm very glad is in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tasty gothic treat!","review":"I try to describe this record to my friends as the interbreeding of the minimalism of the White Stripes with the silky darkness of Poe's album Haunted, with a good bit of cabaret thrown in. From the opening middle-finger-to-the-ex crescendo that is \\"Good Day\\" that is immediately followed by a strange little jump-rope ditty, you know you're in for a dark treat. One of the most interesting albums I've bought in recent memory.My personal favorite on the album, hidden among goth-tinged melodramas of self-mutilation, wind-up boyfriends, and the perils of gravity, is track 10, the Jeep Song. It's a strange little indie rock ode to an ex's 96 Jeep Cherokee - a favorite, since red Honda Civics like one of my exes drove are enough to make me cringe a bit.I can't recommend this CD enough. Go out and buy it, it's probably getting pretty wide distribution by this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential album.","review":"Beautiful dark cabaret music from the East Coast art movement. Amanda Palmer has a unique singing style and the piano and drums work together in a fantastic gothish style....great album full of great songs. For fans of Tori Amos, Bat For Lashes, and Rasputina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I have been hearing about this band for the past few months, and was actually going to go to their show when they came here to Chicago. Well, lets say I am glad I didn't. Don't get me wrong, I love ecentric music, and cross genre sounds, but this is just, yuck. I am surprised they are now getting mainstream attention, as I can't even swallow this, and I listen to some pretty abstract music. Not to compare the two musically, but if William Hung can sell, I suppose any band can now. Oh, and in response to the reviewer below me, just because they have their faces painted up like mimes, doesn't make them \\"Goth Rock\\", I hear no influence of said genre at all, cabaret piano mixed with punk rock drums gone very wrong...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar.","review":"That the other reviewers (even journalists) seem confounded by what exactly it is that The Dresden Dolls are doing, is a testement to their art (which is what this is). This is as cutting edge as early Bowie, and the songs are as tight and as affecting as John Cameron Mitchell's \\"Hedwig & The Angry Inch.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing, brilliant, and sometimes not","review":"Anyone looking for cabaret and unable to find it, need look no further. And those wanting to add depression to the mix, will definetely find this strange little album to their liking. While the album lacks other instruments besides the earthy piano and drums, it's not really bothersome and still inventive. The piano is haunting, as are the lyrics-sometimes. Maybe it's me but some of the lyrics are a tad...absurd. Like that line about backammon, or pretty much the entire \\"Jeep Song\\" which i found to be somewhat out of place on the penetrating album. That doesn't take away from the fact that the song is good, but it's just out of place. The album has alot of passion though, but i wouldn't suggest listining to it if you're in a happy mood; it might bring you down.

This band consist of a crazy chick who beats the crap out of her piano and sings all crazy, and this mime who is an awesome drummer who occasionally plays guitar. Unlike real mimes he talks every once in a while. The content of the songs is real femi, but still interesting to me for some strange unknown reason. Coin operated boy is about a plastic phallus. The radio single is all about going crazy and who psychiatry is dumb. I saw this band live at coachella and they played, note for note, a cover of war pigs by sabbath. That made me crap my pants. So in conclusion, this band is totally awesome for tons of reasons. You should really check this out.(The chick has hairy pits)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Cabaret?","review":"Pulling a dying industry out of its rut is hard work. Especially when all you have is a piano and a boyfriend on drums. Forunately for The Dresden Dolls(and us!) they have done something that is both remarkable and beautiful. With obvious influences from Tori Amos, Cinema Strange, the Cure, and the musical Cabaret, the sound of The Dresden Dolls' self titled debut album is unique, while remaining very much pretty and listenable. Witty lyrics and strong, bashing melodies are found all over the album, and for the first time in a LONG time an album has actually scared me. The song \\"Slide\\" about a pedophile murdering a girl ends with the line \\"THE ORANGEMAN HAS GOT YOU!\\" and in the context of the song listening to it late at night could just scare the hell out of you. Overall, it's a new favorite of mine, and I look forward to further releases from the masterful duo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"It's refreshing to hear something new and different.

I love how the entire album makes you feel nostalgic for something, but you can never quite figure out what. Truce, The Perfect Fit, Half Gravity and the Jeep Song (which is hilarious). The rawness of it is what makes it special. Surprisingly, I cannot STAND Coin Operated Boy, haha.

Not so much. Aside from most of the stuff from the album I already owned, there is a bunch of stuff on this that featured a lot of other instruments intruding on Kotke's guitar work to the extent that it no longer is his work. It totally ruins his artistry. Some of the pieces are actually painful to listen to. There is one that is actually mostly studio background noise. I hate to see that someone talked him out of performing solo and convinced him he needed other musicians to accompany him. DRUMS???

This is a guy who make an acoustic 12 string sound like nothing else. Listening to him reminds you of what the really great guitar players can do, like Stevie Ray, and Clapton, and Jeff Beck, and although his music is more grounded in Folk and Americana than Blues or Jazz (or Rock) as the other players I mentioned, he is an equal in every way to these greats and others.The only negative thing I can say is that as singer, he is one hell of a guitar player!... but even he knows that, and it will make you like him even more.If you have the chance to see him live, just do it.....Its magic to watch his hands and fingers work the guitar...you will leave in awe, that I guarantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"If you are any sort of a connisseur of movies, do not even think of watching this movie.

Mr.Van Daan, Mrs.Van Daan, Mrs.Frank, Margot, etc every actor who performs in the movie had own character. This is a reason how successful it is. Richard Beymer as Peter Van Daan was okay, but he was too old and to refined for the part. He really like twenty five years old youny guy. We want to see boy in the movie.

Also, why is there a gruesome and graphic description of a murdered woman's remains and what happened to them? If that scene had appeared, as written, in a movie, it surely would have been rated PG-13 or R.

Some of May's adventures were interesting, such as hunting for a murderer and getting chased up a tree by a bear and nearly drowning in the Nasel river.

But, the sweet baby sister she has always longed for dies while in May Amelia's care. May Amelia wakes up feeling relieved to have such a good night sleep without the baby crying, and then realizes that she's dead. It has haunted me ever since I've read it, and I have adult skills for coping with all the suffering in this world.It's one thing to read about infant deaths in pioneer times in a history book, but in this case, an empathetic reader is going to feel the shock and grief that the character is feeling, and the guilt also.

Pickin's must've been slim that year. The first half of this book is dull, just ordinary information about the character's life. It's not until about half way through that there's any kind of conflict--a bit too long to wait. But the second half of the book isn't much better than the first. And the ending was lacking. The characters in the book spoke using no contractions, which I found odd. I don't know anyone who speaks without using contractions. I don't think they even did that back in 1900. It made reading the dialogue somewhat ackward. I notice that other children's writers do this too. But I don't understand why. This book has a lot in common with Boston Jane. Both characters are tomboys, they spit, the Chinook Indians, and there's even a character in this book by the name of Jane.

According to the Roxette fan club website, \\"Wish I Could Fly\\", the first single, has not topped the charts in a lot of countries. Unfortunately, living in the United States, I personally don't think that as a first release would fare well here. Perhaps, \\"Stars\\" would be an apt choice to say \\"Hey, we're back and enjoy us!!!\\". We will leave it up to EMI America to decide what to do. I love Roxette, don't get me wrong.

I am so far satisfied with it and may purchase another in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much of a Catch","review":"While I found the historical context of the story to be very interesting, unfortunately I found the story as a whole to be soap operish. It felt as though the author put more effort in getting as much history in as possible rather than writing a believable plot. By the second half of the book, I found myself to be reading in order to finish rather than reading for enjoyment. The ending does give some satisfaction, but I don't see myself recommending this book. It just seems too contrived which takes away from the message the author clearly intended. In a word, dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"While I cannot say that I hated this book overall, I certainly did not like it as well as I thought I would. If you are looking for a historical romance novel with a happy ending, this is probably not your cup of tea. It's actually kind of a depressing story.Also, the writing was difficult to follow at times. At various points throughout the book, without any indication, the author jumps to another conversation or goings-on. The reader has to stop a minute and try to figure out who is now talking and the setting of the new scene.Finally, while I am a rather well-read person with an interest in learning new words, this book just got annoying. The use of obscure words several times per page--while perhaps appropriate for era--distracts the reader, not allowing them to fully grasp the meaning of what the writer is trying to convey.Overall, while I was captivate by the first third of the book and still interested the second third, this book is certainly not one I will read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"catch\\" - throw it back!","review":"There are three parts/sections to this novel: Part 1 was ok-fairly interesting, seemingly intriguing storyline and developed characters; Part 2 was even better- a move to London and a chance to explore Imperialism, class struggles, romance, etc.; however, Part 3 was just AWFUL! The novel completely fell apart in its final section - not even worth reading and unfortunately ruined anything else I could possibly praise from the beginning third of the novel.

They are all especially lathered up by Toby Keith referring to \\"his boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad City...\\" (If you, too, understand why they are upset, stop reading this review and try a different style of music.)I came out to these forums, kids hated it. People who listen to country casually hated it.I knew I had to get it.I have not been disappointed. This is a return to more traditional country while not slipping into the twangy sound of the 70s none of us want to go back to.This is a very good CD. You may not like it a lot on the first listen.

Southern culture sucks, get with the times, and out of the barn, anyone can make a hit country record. All you talk about is being a country boy and eating mom's home cooked vittles and that's a platinum record. Or you say something like \\"we'll put a boot in your ass\\" and set the american people back 100 years. I would recommend Toby Keiths music to anyone with a 3rd grade education.

He's an embarrassment, and he makes all southerners and country music listeners look like obnoxious drunken morons. He has set country music back 20 years. His music is a joke, and he is a joke. He is not fit to breathe the same air as Willie Nelson, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, and the others with whom he will eventually share the Country Music Hall of Fame. Why listen to such drivel? If you want to listen to real country, there are better choices. Buy Loretta's \\"Van Lear Rose\\". If you want modern country, Keith Urban is way more talented than this loudmouth. The Dixie Chicks are better than Toby Keith, too. I wish he would go away and quit making us southerners look bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!!","review":"I love this CD alot, it was great! Toby Keith is just amazing, I saw him in concert and he just sounds great! I get bored often in music, but this CD didn't bore me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered down Toby Keith","review":"This album was a huge disappointment. I usually love Toby Keith's \\"in-your-face\\" country. This ablum is a little bit whiskey and way too much ice. It's as if Toby and Kenny Chesney went to the Caribbean to write together. Don't get me wrong, I like Kenny, but Toby is not Kenny (who is trying to be country's answer to Jimmy Buffet). Toby was the one who would always stand up and say what he was feeling no matter what everyone else around him thought. This album is a relationship album without the edge. It's romance and breaking up with just a couple of songs that have the Toby \\"edge.\\" Most of the songs have had the edges a little too polished and shined. This album is more cookie-cutter country and less one-of-a-kind Toby. I've already sold mine on Ebay. Come back Toby, come back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"People actually LISTEN to this stuff...","review":"The other day I had the misfortune of flipping through the channels and seeing the video for \\"As Good As I Once Was\\", and I was dumbfounded. I found myself laughing at how idiotic this guy was. It sounded about like ever other country song I have ever heard. I realize it's all in good fun to have one song about \\"nothing\\" on your album but when I found this CD in my dad's CD player I had to play it. I put on\\"Honkytonk Uuniversity\\" (WORST album title, maybe EVER!), because I wanted to see WHY an intelligent man like my father would listen to such dribble.And I wasn't surprised when I listened. It was the same old Chevy anthems, confederate odes and just UTTER garbage.You ever wonder why people in other countries don't LISTEN to country? Sure there's rock, alternative, blues, jazz but not this stuff!One more thing, fans of rap and country should come together because they are equally non-intelligent and enjoy the same old song, over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so awesome! Country at its best!","review":"This CD was a gift from my husband prior to the Toby Keith concert in Indianapolis. The concert was great, but he only sang Honkytonk U and As Good as I Once Was from this album. Those are rousing, stand up and shout tunes, but this CD is so much better than just those 2 songs that are so frequently played on the radio. There are several love songs and ballads and I don't know which are my favorites. Alright, Knock Yourself Out and You Caught Me at a Bad Time win by a narrow margin, in my opinion. You Ain't Leavin' is sassy and full of Toby's sense of humor. Many of the tunes are \\"ole time\\" country and all the lyrics are clever and worth listening to. This CD proves that Toby's voice has a greater range than I originally thought he had and I've been a fan for a long time. You have to buy this one. I'll probably wear this CD out after the first week. TOBY'S THE MAN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music","review":"Not as good as I hoped.

Very glad I did. Full of excitement, close escapes, romances, murders, and enough detail about fishing in the Bering Sea on a Russian - US joint venture that you feel you have been there.

She admits she has taken criticism for focussing only on wives instead of all spouses, but I believe she is being true and authentic to her own experience--which is considerable--and should be commended for adding My Love, My Life to the existing literature on the military life. Now more than at any other time in our history, it's important to acknowledge and understand those who keep the home fires burning.

Nevertheless, this is a well written story that will keep you entertained from start to finish.We learn early on the identity of the killer. The remainder of the novel is filled with a series of contrivances, coincidences, and down-right silliness (think dwarf porn stars) as the game warden attempts to discover who killed Mr. Searcy.I recommend this book if you want a light, fun read. But do bring a pencil and paper with you when you begin reading.

When I finally quit playing this game, I had been playing for 70+ hours and STILL didn't really care about what was happening to any of the characters.

I usually don't die within the first six hours of a video game, but in Dragoneer's Aria, I had already died 12 times within the first three hours. The random battles are just that--random about what you'll actually encounter. During one battle, you may come away without a scratch.

I must be a masochist because I played the game over 100 hours hoping to get the ultimate weapons and armor, but only had enough items to open one chest at the end of the game only to get another recipe, not the actual item.

Terry Ellis should be shot. I saw Clouds 3 timesand they were just alright. Billy Ritchie is and always was justan average organ player. The only influence he had was that hestood up!

We have someone named Kath who's not CRAZYabout the CD, but none the less rates it FIVE STARS! Then someoneelse named Sarah who thinks it's just pleasant, but also ratesit FIVE STARS! Five Stars is reserved for a masterpiece, NOT analbum that is JUST PLEASANT or that you're not CRAZY about. Forthose that are interested in how Clouds sounded live. Listen to\\"The Carpenter\\" that's their signature tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Genius..","review":"David Bowie, interviewed in Mojo magazine (1994), described Clouds(formerly 1-2-3)and in particular, Ritchie the keyboard player, as 'genius' material - and one can only rue the fact that this group did not record more albums, for what we have here on these records are tantalising glimpses of brilliance without the meat on the bones. In my opinion, the songwriting and the musicianship shows signs of inherent greatness that is nevertheless obscured by lack of direction and certainty in the recording production/arrangement. If I was to guess further, I would say that these songs do not represent the true worth of the writer, nor does the playing represent the true worth of the group. They needed more time to produce, two more albums perhaps, and we would have had something to rival any other artist (and I DO include 'The Beatles'!).An opportunity lost, and genius unfulfilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consensus","review":"Peter Jones has a point. Reactions have been too extreme on BOTH sides, as far as I can see. Shouldn't the consensus be that Clouds were neither a pub band nor world-beaters either? They were probably pioneers of some kind, they paved the way for others who were perhaps better suited to take the next step. 3.5 stars seems about right to me, but decimals not allowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"open up","review":"This is a very unique look at a very unique time in history. This is a raw look inside an intelligent, passionate yet egomaniacal mind. I was an infant during this period so to me this is like being able to hear first hand accounts of a period I wish I saw for myself.The only downer is that the book pays almost no attention to the 20 years after the breakup. I wanted to learn more about PiL and how Lydon survived the 80's! The best part of the book, other than his brutal honesty, is that a good part is written by other contributors who offer a fresh (and sometimes different) view of the situation.I have no idea what truly happened back then but I do think that I a vague idea what No Future was all about. I'm very greatful to have read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about \\"No Rotten Revisionism\\"","review":"I agree with the review below. You have to know something about the punk scene of the 70's, otherwise Lydon will con you. It's mostly damage-control.For example, in the book Lydon laughs at the Clash for \\"starting off so mad\\" at their gigs that they got knackered halfway through. \\"We were smart enough to pace ourselves,\\" he claims.The truth is, the Clash stole a lot of the Pistols' audience because of their superior speed and energy. They played with such fury they made the Pistols look like a buncha hippie folk singers. It wasn't a matter of being smart; Lydon's band just wasn't as strong.That's just one instance. The rest of it will be irritating to the British reader because it's very anti-British, and meretricously American-friendly. Lydon squirms his way out of the debate on where punk originated--London or the States. Odd for such a proponent of candor and self-expression.Buy it for a cheap laugh only if you've got the real scoop already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad reading!","review":"I am sorry to say that this book was a major disappointment.

I am a person who enjoys the Sex Pistols and i have always been curious about how they came about being so different.

Not only do you get to learn about the Sex Pistols and Johnny Rotten but also Punk Rock and its history. The only thing is that there were a few too many details for me, i think they took a little too long to get to the interesting parts. Other than that a great and educational read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly readable book from punk rock's lightning rod","review":"While he didn't create punk rock, he was present at the beginning, took it over, and then destroyed it.

That's mainly because I bought this to get \\"Victims of the Fury\\", only to find that this CD does not include all of the old cuts. \\"The Shout\\" and \\"Ready for the Taking\\" are missing. The cuts are also out of order from the old vinyl and mixed in with \\"Caravan to Midnight\\" songs.

In brief, it treats something human as if it were something mechanical. Language is a way of conveying meanings from one human to another, and the most inflexible, most mechanical, most artifiial POSSIBLE way of looking at words is to classify them by their sound alone. That's precisely what a pun does.When Mel Brooks is playing a Polish actor playing Hitler, he says: \\"All I want is peace. A little piece of Poland, a tiny piece of France....\\" That is amusing -- the juxtaposition of the vital and the mechanical.More sophisticated jokes than such puns are based on the same juxtaposition. Here is one of Bergson's example, from a play by Labiche. \\"Just as M. Perrichon is getting into the railway carriage, he makes certain of not forgetting any of his parcels: 'Four, five, six, my wife seven, my daughter eight, and myself nine.'\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have preferred a legitimate publisher","review":"It's great to reprint classics, but this \\"book\\" seems to have been \\"published\\" by a 10-year-old working from his bedroom in Kentucky.

The art was really unique, it almost seemed to have a CLAMP-like touch. Not only was the art good, but the story was a cute, magical story (which I like), and the characters were great as well. This pattern followed up to about book 5. You can tell that the author was doing a rush job. The animation just went downhill, and things that should have taken about 5 pages took a whole book to complete. The humor starts out great, but as you go on, it just seems to get drier, but I can't complain since it's rated T. It's not horrid, but I wouldn't reccommend it.

I put it on and it was a JOKE! I felt like I had just strapped some sort of chineese torture band around my body.

The use of flashback allows the action to switch from extremely funny scenes set in Naples to extremely grim depictions of life in a concentration camp. Giannini is absolutely brilliant as he struggles to maintain his exagerated sense of dignity under increasingly difficult circumstances. The concentration camp is potrayed as hell on earth- all darkness and forboding. Contrast this with colorful Naples and the liveliness of the residents.

Giancarlos Giannini delivers a powerful performance and a good supporting cast, especially Fernando Rey. Oh Yeah! .

As one example, it translates \\"zenitnyi ogon'\\" as \\"ack-ack.\\"I can't recommend this version. A more up-to-date version is available directly from the publisher, ETS. They offer a demo version that lets you test the program on your computer.

It was printed in very limited quantities during Twain's lifetime, and it seems doubtful that he ever ascribed any lasting literary importance to it.To me, the sketch is too short to represent a highly developed literary endeavor. Also, it isn't very funny, with its childish scatological humor.This particular printing includes some interesting, though poorly organized addenda. It is printed in a bare-bones, desktop publishing format.I would not recommend it to the general reader. It would be marginally interesting only to the Twain scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pages","review":"I ordered the book. I knew it was a used book but I had no idea pages were missing.

Both editions were full of errors and contradictory statements. In particular, you cannot rely on the instructor materials- there are many test questions that have answers that are contradicted in the text. Also, the grammar exercises are too difficult for an introductory text- they test students on advanced grammar concepts that are not even covered by the book! There is a grammar reference section at the end of the text but it does not cover the majority of concepts tested in the end-of-chapter grammar exercises. So, my students were continually frustrated. Many of the examples in the book are also very strange- for example, instead of PowerPoint, they speak of \\"computer generated slides\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent value","review":"I wanted to counteract the negative review writen here.I have these tapes and listen to them over and over very often.I prefer listening to the old english KJV of the psalms as the pslams are very poetic and mystical and for that reasons I seem to find KJV of the psalms preferable. For most other scripturalpassages I'd probably go with NIV or something.I recently bought Zondervan's complete bible NT+OT on CD.I realized how much I enjoy the Scourby tapes as I did not enjoy the Zondervan psalm readings nearly as much as my Scourby tapes.Scourby puts alot of inflection in his voice and reads with great meaning and conviction. He pauses for a length where approriate as well. One of my tapes in this 5 tape series got eaten. I was able to order a whole new set of tapes for just the $10 or whatever it costs in order to replace that one tape. That is a good deal as the psalms alone are probably not easy to find and you may have to order the whole bible just to get the psalms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God, We can do better.","review":"A nice enough voice but very poor recording,a lack of media production and completely without conviction or individual style.

There are a lot of histoy here but its all very readable and easy to digest.

This book also takes an interesting look at Elizabeth's court, and leaves no doubt she was England's most powerful queen. Entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your school text book should have read like this...","review":"Wonderfully readable account of the initial colonization of America by the British. It's amazing to me that there is this much detailed information available about this era and, given that, Giles Milton crafts it such that you get the \\"feel\\" of what it was like in the late 1500's in both England and in the colonies. Realistic and sometimes gruesome, it shows that the initial colonization of America was no picnic. Details of starvation, organization and relationships with the natives will leave you wondering why the English kept coming back. The Elizabethian society is well chronicled and Milton does a fabulous job of portraying Sir Walter Raliegh's rise and fall as well as the true stories of John Smith and Pocahantus. Finally, his conclusions on the fate of the missing Roanoke colonists are very plausible.

Entertaining, funny, simple, and relevant. When I first read it I was about the same age as the hero. And boy could I ever relate! Erlend Loe has touched on universal themes here, and I think that the greatest value of this story lies in its ability to pinpoint simply and accurately the most fundamental questions of human existence and in turn cause you to think about them in a personal way. I don't see how anyone could read this book and walk away unchanged.Erlend Loe's unique voice in \\"Naive. Super\\" is open and insightful on a level that reminds me of \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" by Dave Eggers.

I can only hope it is not the author himself, because if it is it casts considerable doubt on the rest of the book.I find it amazing that the publishing company includes this in a published book, they really must have rushed it out.

Richard Gere plays a candidate at Naval Officers Training School in Seattle; Debra Winger is the local girl who falls in love with him. Does Gere have the inner strength and character to make it? is the major theme of the movie. Louis Gossett, Jr. is the drill sergeant who puts him to the test. There are few surprises here and no deep insights into character, but the storyline is well worked out and the picture well done and very entertaining. We know he's going to make it, but we cheer anyway at the end when he does. It's uplifting in an old-fashioned Horatio Alger way. Sometimes the movie crosses the border into melodrama (the scenes with David Keith and Lisa Blount and Keith's suicide, for example), but on the training grounds, the movie is first-rate.

Here is a perfect example of such romanticism, in a modern environment, that of a navy academy somewhere in the US. Romanticism, drama as well as happy ending, one casualty and one total epiphany. What's more you add to that the bad character of the salvaged hero at the beginning and his complete transformation into a good man, a good heart and a fair mind that will not play around and will finally do what his conscience tells him to do and his hormones force him to fall into. And what's more, the film avoids the dire tragic tone of all the rewritings of Romeo and Juliet.

Having grown up in the Wilkes Barre area,and now living outside of that region,it's great to have a chronological sequence of the events that led to the demise of the deep anthracite mining industry. The book also captures the economic and political realities of the region in times prior to and after the mine disaster. Sheds a lot of light on \\"powerful\\" people.

Of what did this wonderful book remind me. I think it reminded me how utterly banal most books are, and how utterly ingenious this book is. Of all the books I've read and lived, this one haunts me the most. It is not a cross of X and Y. It is not related to anything, but its self-contained brilliance. It is, quite frankly, the best book I have read in the last decade. There is no more honest appraisal I can give. Simply read it.

The man stands, and stands TALL, on his own merits.I was blown away by the new version of \\"Bridge Of Sighs\\", so I said \\"ok, I will go in and buy this one next.\\".

I don't know where, but somewhere along the line Brotha Lynch has abandoned his old style and he sounds like just another rapper from the West Coast.Bring back Season of da Siccness and Loaded."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to these guys?","review":"If this album had come out in 1995, I would still be listening to it daily. Without a doubt, these guys are my favorite rappers of all time, with Season of Da Siccness and We Come Strapped still getting frequent play. So, when i rank this album with one star, I do it with a heavy heart. The unrivaled combination of smooth beats and sick hardcore rhymes these guys were bringing early in their careers has simply evaporated. Sadly, none of the elements that made me a fan of these guys is present in this album. The beats are boring. The rhymes are lame. The style is canned. There is nothing original on this album. I was hoping it would be the lyrical equivalent of '90's era Jordan-Pippen, bringing two badasses together on a championship product. This album is more like if you took Jordan and Pippen 40 years from now, old men with no game, and put them on the court. If you enacted that fantasy, you would get a product of similar quality to this pathetic album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brotha Lynch, what happened???","review":"I hate to say this, but this album is disappointing. I really don't think I have set the bar too high for both of these rappers. Both artists are extremely good with their craft and I have always enjoyed Lynch's work from 24 Deep, the Classic Season of the Siccness, Loaded and even Lynch by Inch. If you like Lynch and MC Eiht, you're probably expecting some hardcore, Mobb music material. hardcore gangsta **** is out the window on this track. There are a couple of decent tracks but not enough to spend 15 plus dollars on. I still recommend for you to buy the album, for I support Lynch all the way. Unfortunately the album is not up to par compared to his previous work. Purchase the product if you are a huge Lynch fan and see for yourself. Maybe your reviews will be much lighter than mine. Enjoy the album folks - I have to \\"eat\\" now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lynch a shadow of his former self","review":"I had such high expectations for this album, maybe too high. The earlier Brotha Lynch from the 90's was classic underground; this is just so mainstream. It sounds just like every other rap album today. I still have faith in Lynch, but never again should he team up with MC Eiht, he's dragging the brotha into the toilet with him, we can't have that! Anyway, the only track on this entire album even worth a listen to, once or twice, is \\"Agent Double O Duece 4 Blocc\\", only becaues it's a remake of \\"Rest in Piss\\" Don't B wastin yo bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"why doesn't amazon provide more info???","review":"This product has virtually no information about the cordless phones for which it can be used.

But a brand new way to see this concept. From ages, people have seen curious thing on the sky with curious non-human people encounters. The main idea of Jacques is that : Civilisation has always explain it in relation to the civilisation. It was daemons in Europe Midle-Age, spys aircraft from Germany or Russia at the End of 19 th century. Now some said it's Extra Terrestrial technology but nothing prove it. It's only convenient to our technological space oriented civilisation. UFO are real, they exists from ages, they influence Man destiny and then it's a mind control system.

I've put a lot of mileage on this stroller and it still is in great shape. I wanted the straight wheel, because while running I didn't want the wheel going off in another direction. The front brake doesn't really work well on mine, then again I never use the brakes. It is a huge stroller, so it's disappointing when I can't bring it on vacations or weekend getaways.

It makes for a much safer cut, and if installed using the insructions, it acts as a relatively effective \\"featherboard\\" as well as a splitter behind the blade.

Also, make certain that if you are using a cordless drill/driver you have switched to the faster \\"drill\\" setting as the \\"driver\\" setting turns too slowly and may transfer too much heat up the tiny drill bit (with is included in the package.) If the bit heats up, it will damage the little plastic jig that is used to set up the splitter.When your wood passes by the splitter, the wood is lightly pressed into the fence through the reminder of the cut. Kickback has been dramatically reduced on my old Craftsman 10\\" belt drive contractor's saw.

The book was fun, relevant, easy to use, not overly academic and proved that, where there is a will (and some good academics behind you such as this book), you are golden. Looking forward to my 4 year old's turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is the ONLY book you will need to help your child become dry! Dr. Bennett made it so fun and easy to follow for both my daughter and me. My daughter is 7 and was very excited when we started reading the book together and planning out our program. Dr. Bennett explained everything, from the physiological to the psychological in a way that was interesting and engaging for both of us. I would read the book late at night and always find something useful to review with her the next day. The hardest part was seeing my daughter get disappointed when she would be wet after several dry nights, but Dr. Bennett tells you how to deal with every possible situation in a light, easy to understand way, so that you, as a parent, can procede with the confidence that your child needs from you. This book and the whole experience has created a precious memory and a special bond between me and my daughter. My daughter was completely dry in 3 months.

Aureolin and rose madder--Dobie's recommended yellow and red primaries, are extremely fugitive--they fade in a short time.Because of this alone, the book should be vigorously rejected as coming from dubious authority. Her plan for making colors \\"sing,\\" by the way, involves placing an occassional bright color in a field of grays or browns, mixed not from earth pigments, but from (fugitive) primaries. It would be irresponsible of me to perpetrate such a book on an unsuspecting public by giving it any stars at all. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have a \\"zero\\" stars option.

However, at least in my copy, in many of the illustrations colors were simply not reproduced accurately. In another book this might not be quite so frustrating. But in many places, rather than making the text more explicit she leaves it to the example to make her point. In those cases I sometimes found it difficult to grasp what she meant. Maybe for her next book she should seek another publisher, or at least a different printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information in this book","review":"Making Color SingI am new to the medium of watercolors and have found this book to be very helpful.

I found this book easily readable and useful to both decorative artists and fine artists, experienced or beginner. It covers both the why, the what with, and the how to of watercolor application and much of the theory is applicable to other media as well.

One listen to the cut I love the best, Fresh Garbage, can get you hooked (and the message is still needed TODAY!). Guitar and drum solos on most cuts point to the groups jazz leanings, but the messages and harmony are pure rock. Other cuts that have a wide appeal are \\"I Got a Line on You\\" and \\"Uncle Jack\\". The only disappointing aspect of this album is that it misses some of the versatility of the group that is evident on lesser cuts on other CDs.

The problem with the gameplay is that there are damn few hints on what to do at early levels. I figured out some of it, but it would be nice to have a couple of hints early on of what to look for, or of strategies. I can see why it's popular, and from a technical standpoint it's quite good. Without the hints, and without any ability to save within a mission, it's too easy to end up going over the same ground again and again trying to get to the point you screwed up and died.As FPS's go, you really have to be into it, and be willing to go through a lot of irritating problem solving, such as having to figure out to ask for a key from someone who, under different circumstances, fires a double-barreled shotgun at you the minute they see you. In retrospect, the action makes sense, but a hint or two would have made this title a lot less tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!","review":"I have always loved the Hitman Series and I bought this becacuse I didn't have Silent Assassins and Contracts. Blood Money is a very unique game and when the player does things right you feel really accomplished. Silent Assassins is pretty good but I think Contracts and Blood Money were the best in the series. For the price on this collection I say it's completely worth it! I hope other people who haven't played this game yet would give it a try especially Contracts and Blood Money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game in a great series","review":"This game continues the great tradition of the previous hitman games. It has improved graphics and allows you to benefit from a well-executed mission by being paid for the hits and being able to use that money to upgrade your weapons, customizing them to be more accurate and lethal. The game allows a wide variety of choices in how to accomplish a mission and there is no \\"right\\" way to beat a mission. The only problem that this game still suffers from is that the AI still needs improvements. Situations that you would expect the guards to get suspicious and start shooting will only get a warning, whereas a simple mistake that should only get the guards suspicious results in them pulling out their guns and blasting away at you when you just tried to open a door that didn't have any signs to Keep Out.

I'm currently set for a 150 shot but I think that's enough for my LT1 right now. This is a good parts kit for the price if you can't afford the all out model specific kit.

Since the release of that cd, Toby went to crap. Not only did he, along with other artists, benefit from the tragedy of 9/11 and the war, but he decided to tickle the little girls with an array of songs directed toward radio airplay instead of his early fans. I am still amazed by artists that claim that they were influenced by the likes of Merle, Hank Sr. and other greats, but their music goes the other way. Pop Country has no place in my cd collection and never will.

Take Toby for what he is a highly overrated singer/songwriter that cashed in on a patrotic theme after 9/11 and ran it.

What's the meaning of life?) don't look here for answers. Ms. Dillard asks the same questions she's been asking publically since \\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,\\" but with much less satisfying results. In \\"Pilgrim\\" she explored the territory - attempting to find her own answers - in \\"For the Time Being\\" she is content to mostly quote the \\"answers\\" others have found. And she does a poor job of assembling those answers. Mainly, she confuses the reader (at least she confused me) - you wonder where she's going with all the disjointed, disconnected \\"facts\\" she tosses out.

Her lambent tone [shading to exasperation far too frequently], the allusions that are both too long and too brief, and the attempt to balance polarities [agnosticism and belief] make for a unrewarding text. Readers interested in the dark night of the soul and some remedies for the angst it produces should consult all of Ernest Becker's, \\"The Denial of Death,\\" and not just the snippets Ms. Dillard presents. You'll be treated to a cohesive and demanding inquiry into substantial topics nicely adumbrated.It's always a disappointment when authors reach beyond their metier: \\"Pilgrim\\" is a wonderful exploration of nature's paradoxes.

But by the time I finished it, it didn't matter - I was caught in its spell. To be sure, it has its arkward moments. But it is full of marvels, and is another demonstration of Ms Dillard's ability to communicate a sense of wonder and awe at the very fact of the existence of this world.

We need writers like Dillard to get to the true essence of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindsticking Essays","review":"Dillard, who has an immense background in study and reflection, ranges across the writing of religious philosophers of many stripes.

I write the word \\"book\\" in quotes because to call this a book is more than a bit of a stretch. To me it reads like an old, senile person rambling nearly incoherently about things her mind has lost the ability to grasp for longer than a sentence or two. I can see only one very general theme come out of this - that people are a product of the earth. Why does it take 200+ pages to relate that no-longer-new theme? And relating the theme is all the book does - no explanation, no analysis of the theme, nothing beyond merely stating it in a very long-winded and oblique way. I hate to be so critical of this work, but I hope to save others the trouble of buying and reading this incoherent mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow, rambling, pointless","review":"Lots of style, very little content. Maybe she's asking the fundamental questions about life and death, but it sounds to me more like self-indulgent rambling posing as philosophy. I always wonder, too, at the arrogance of people who, even though most of the people on earth are neither Jewish nor Christian, assume that Jews and Christians have all the answers to fundamental questions about existence. And, when you consider that all through history, religions of all sorts have caused more problems than they've solved, why would anyone look to religion for answers to serious questions anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Donovan's best","review":"If you like Donovan's music and have never heard HMS Donovan, get it immediately.

I love this collar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance","review":"I purchased this items as I got a second dog and needed a bark collar for each dog. The first bark collar is about 5 years old and is also from Petsafe - it's a different model, the non-deluxe version.The first one works well, the second (PDBC-300) seems to work occasionally. I called petsafe to see if there was something I was doing wrong and it seems everything is set up fine. However, they told me that in order for the dog to get the static correction, it had to both feel the vibration from the dog's bark and also 'hear' the bark. This sounds like a good design as my older bark collar only works on the vibration and would occasionally activate when the dog was scratching. However, with the new collar, where it needs both the sound and the vibration, it seems like this prevents it from activating when it should.I will be returning this product and getting the non-deluxe version (I think it is the PBC-102)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Company!","review":"Great collar/idea, horrid company! It worked great for about three weeks. Then, suddenly, it doesn't shock my dog when she barks. Then it won't even turn on. So, I contact the company, and they won't warranty a replacement for me, because I don't have all the original packing. After a couple weeks of using it and it working great, I figured I didn't need it anymore, big mistake that was!

Once he got used to it, he actually doesn't bark at the garbage truck! It is amazing how much better he is even without it. Mind you, when he doesn't have it on, he still does get to barking a bunch, but it seems that his barks are less frequent and does not continue for the whole 5 minutes that a person may be in view of the front of our house. One thing that we have really liked about it is that because it detects vibration AND sound, he can still groan and growl and make noises while playing with his sister without being shocked. The only problem we have with it is that if the electric part of it is not directly in front of his throat it does not seem to work very well. Also, I agree, the buckle is ridiculous! We have Petsafe fence collars and I can't see why they can't just use the same buckle.

No effect. I set it on maximum. No effect. She barked whenever she felt like it, and there was no stimulation evident from the collar.

But the very poor collar design that supports the control box renders it horrible. It has both a clasp and a clip, which is a total pain in the a** to put on the dogs.

For starters, \\"Honeywell\\" did not make this product; some no-name company that is simply licensing the Honeywell name did. As someone else mentioned, the indoor and outdoor units display different readings - even when sitting next to each other; makes me wonder how accurate either gage is. It has a very noisy mechanical button to 'click' between indoor and outdoor units, and since it is designed for more than one remote outdoor unit, you need to always click through blank screens to get back to the indoor reading. There are better and cheaper electronic gages out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humidity is inaccurate","review":"The item comes comes with a main unit and a remote sensor. The main unit(displays inside Temp/RH) should be placed inside and the remote sensor(displays outside Temp/RH) be placed outside or inside. Distance between both of them should not be more than 100 feet(30 metres) and no obstacles between them.I feel both show temperature correctly but relative humidity(RH) incorrect to a great extent. While the weather.com says RH to be around 70%, remote sensor when placed outside shows it to be around 25%. Of course, its common sense, outside RH will never be that low. Even the main unit which says 40%-70% RH is good, never reaches that level. It displays around 30% RH most of the time, I tested in many different conditions where the RH is definitely supposed to be high. I have been using this unit since 4 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPONTING","review":"I thought Honeywell would be a name to be trusted: but I was mistaken. I bought two of these units.

The remote sensor seems to be way off on humidity--by about 14% below the actual level. The main unit is about 3% below. Of course, once you know this, you can keep it in mind when reading the meter, and the units otherwise produce readings and the main unit picks up the remote sensor with no problem. Overall, the unit served its purpose for me--to monitor the accuracy of my humidifier's humidistat and the actual humidity being produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke Too Soon","review":"It worked for about 3 months, then the remote humidity reading went haywire???????

As an original test I placed the unit on the open porch in <20 degree weather. The indoor unit lost the signal sometime during the night.

It tells us what is wrong with our world by contrasting it to an imagined world at the opposite social extreme to our own more mundane world. Utopia should not be read as a statement of how we should live but as a warning about everything that is wrong in the modern world. It is amazing to see how little we have learnt since this book was written.This book is as relevant now as when it was written. It remains one of the greatest social comments of the modern world.

Otherwise, look elsewhere. Utopia was created partly for fun, as the Penguin edition makes clear by including the Utopian alphabet. Clever puns are lost here: you might never guess that the river \\"Anidrus\\" in this edition comes from More's own \\"Anydrus\\", meaning \\"no water\\" in Greek.

However, when I received it I was entirely disappointed. The book is good based on the interesting stories as well as the fine paper, pictures and printing. But when it comes to the spells which is the main reason I bought this book, no body from the reviewers mentioned that the spells need ingrediets which are only available from magick suppliers. Moreover, these ingrediets are not easily found at your house. So whenever you want to cast a spell you need to order them online which will truely take time and eventually you might get bored or become unenthusiastic to do it. I thought that this kind of magick would concentrate mostly on the voodoo doll. I think it is really a waste of money if you are buying this book for the spells.

Many of the formulas can be found online, if the reader wants to home-make them. However, some of the basic ingredients may still need to be ordered, like dragon's blood resin. It may just be easier to order them ready-made from the suppliers Doc recommends.Doktor Snake's Voodoo Spellbook opens the reader to a world of rich experiences, not only of his empowerment, but ours too.I highly recommend this gem and am hoping Doc treats us to a Volume 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of data, little information","review":"As a book for learning a topic, this one is wanting.

Since the point of the book is Cross-Platform GUI programming, the build files are essential for a complete understanding of the process. To add insult to injury, the book does not discuss the build process beyond what is in Appendix A, and the information in that appendix assumes the CD ROM has the build files.

I find the size very adequate for him, my son is 35 lbs and 42 inches talll, so he is certainly not small. It took a little time to teach him how to \\"tuck his willie\\" behind the splash guard, but now that he has gotten that down, he has no splashes. It did take a while for him to figure it out though.Improvement areas: either make the doors easier to open on the side, or just eliminate them.

That said , if I had bought it, I would have returned it right away. To be honest, I haven't tried it out with my daughter so the issue isn't whether it works or not but it's design. There are so many crevices and nooks in this thing that should a mess happen where peepee didn't go where it was supposed to go then you would have to immerse the whole thing in clorox to properly santize it. I ran into this just cleaning it up to try using it.It is a cool design and that it can be used as a sturdy stepping stool is good but I think the cleaning hassel would be too much of a headache.

All of the other pottys we looked at seemed like she would have fallen through the openings easily. Not only is it great looking, especially because the lid closes and it looks nothing like a potty, but I've found it to be a comfortable seat at bathtime so I don't kill my knees anymore. Plus the fact that it can be used as a step stool for the kids to wash their hands. It's wonderful that it's a 3 in 1 considering our kids bathroom is also the guest bathroom and it saves space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for boys","review":"I bought this potty because reviewers said it fit their taller/bigger/older children best. We were definitely challenged with finding a potty to fit our son who is a big kid for his age, he's not yet 2.5 years. While this potty bench seemed like a good option, he has been attempting to use it and it is extremely difficult to get him positioned just so behind the shield. The shield is too small in height and width, it is a very difficult target for a toddler. We have tried to direct him behind it or get him to point down, but for a new trainer, all of this creates more anxiety than anything else. We are extremely frustrated. The design of this chair is very thoughtful in the way the shield inserts, unfortunately it does not function well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes for girl but no for boy","review":"I believe this potty would work well for a girl. However, it is not a potty to buy for a boy or atleast not a taller boy. I purchased 2. My son is small enough that I can help direct him into the orange guard. My nephew is way too tall and it in not possible to direct him into it at all. The toilet paper and storage sides are a huge hit with both boys, but the function issues seem like something the manufacturer should have product tested and worked out prior to marketing. I would also suggest putting rubber on the bottom to keep it from sliding while ysing as a step stool."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it!","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months and used it as just a bench until she was 21months.

It's rather large so it just seems to be in our way all of the time, the seat is too narrow so when our boy sits on it the guard squishes him in all the wrong places because the sides squish his thighs in, which in turn squishes other parts so we have to wedge the guard in between his legs and by that point he's had enough, therefore not wanting to sit on it any longer. We've found that an insert for the toilet is much easier than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking.","review":"I'm still in the early stages of potty training, so I can't comment on it's function at this stage.

There is no visible way to open and close the door on the carrier for instance, the pieces which one would think would fit and snap into place easily do not, and there are pieces which I have no idea where they are supposed to go. I would guess they are for the door, but they are too large for the holes.

She caught him and got him in the carrier. I was a little bit early for the vet appointment so as I was getting ready, maybe 10 minutes after the cat whisperer left, my feral cat found his way out, actually knocking down the metal gate.

I also don't like the way the door closes and locks into position. I have had it pop out on me. Now I use this crate without the door as an area for the puppies to go to and relax or play in.

Nouvelle Vague could have easily chosen nothing but New Wave classics to cover but instead they threw in some slightly obscure and unexpected tunes. The concept is strange enough but hearing Killing Joke and Dead Kennedy's done this way is just twisted. It is undoubtedly a novelty recording and it's done pretty well. Some of the breathy vocals are a little irritating at times but overall it's a fun listen.

Boring, trite, nice effort but try again please.. I think the worst cover is the slaughter of Guns of Brixton. The Undertones cover on here is pretty bad, too... I don't know, I didn't fancy this. If you like boring yet somehow hip music, this may be your cup of tea.

At the top of the jacket of the CD, there are small words--too small to read on the order \\"songs from [Pete Kelly's Blues].\\" They sing the songs from the film but not the same arrangements and not the original band with Dick Cathcart,Matty Matlock,Nick Fatool and others. They recorded on RCA Victor; this band on Decca, and unless you read Japanese, you can't know who they are. The arrangements for Peggy Lee are too lifeless (especially \\"O Didn't He Ramble\\"), although Ella's renditions are faithful to the movie version.

The words included to the songs are pluses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pete Kelly band or arrangements","review":"As I specified in a review for the more expensive CD, this CD would be of value only for the Peggy Lee/ Ella Fitzgerald fans, as the band accompaning them is not the Matty Matlock-Dick Cathcart group featured on the LPs and other CD and in the movie \\"Pete Kelly's Blues\\". The arrangements are not even close to the ones used in the movie. \\"O Didn't He Ramble\\" is anything but a burial rite but set in an anguishing blues format.

The band playing on this Japanese CD is not the one headed by Dick Cathcart, Matty Matlock, and Nick Fatool from the movie, LPs, radio-television programs, and a far cry from a good Dixieland band!

You also get another Neil single uncollected elsewhere and Roger Spear's version of 'Release Me'. Otherwise it is more of the same although I'll never quibble with a CD which includes 'Hunting Tigers', 'My Pink Half of the Drainpipe', 'Tent', 'Jollity Farm' and (if you must) 'Urban Spaceman'.

If you know what I'm talking about, skip this collection and order \\"Cornology\\". If you are looking for a Bonzo intro, but are not YET a Bonzo-head, this is a good choice for you. Seriously, Bonzo-heads, the drawback to this collection is that many of your personal favorite cuts will undoubtedly be missing. It is also a bit disconcerting that the cuts are out of order from what you are familiar with (assuming your memories are still reasonably intact). So, deduct 1 star.

But, after a dozen listenings I just couldn't get into it. Needless to say, this album didn't do much for me. I didn't find the songs particularly memorable, nor clever or funny.

However, I was very disappointed to find out that this album is Copy Controlled, which means that I cannot copy the tracks onto my computer. This is the way I listen to ALL of my music, in fact, I don't even own an ordinary CD player. Because I cannot rip the tracks onto my computer to play them with Winamp or another mp3 software, I probably will not listen to them at all. The Copy Controlled technology was put in place to stop pirating, but will also cause honest customers like myself to stop buying CDs altogether. I will never buy a disk that is Copy Controlled, and if all labels start doing it, then I will not buy CDs at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fan, It Blows.","review":"This fan works great in my old PC.

This book, My Bridges of Hope: Searching for Life and Love After Auschwitz, is amazing book that tells the story of Elli Friedmann's life after the holocaust has took place, and the many adventures along the way.

The author is unable to posit where the real thing might be, though there is no lack of differing ideas. I tend to agree that the stone every monarch of England, Great Britain, and the U.K. was crowned on for seven centuries is phoney baloney, and I even guardedly agree that the Irish people might be a lost tribe of Israel, as Gerber suggests (anyone wonder where the Ark of the Covenant might be? When was the last time anyone took a sonogram under the high hill at Tara?). Some of the references will be too obscure for those who don't already know something about Scottish history, but a general audience might appreciate most of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good earphones","review":"Excellent bass level.

Yes, the clips can break off but they don't just fall off; it does take a bit of pressure to make them come off.My problem is that the cord is rubbish! Instead of being encased in the 90 degree plug things used to come with, this is the straight ipod style plug (the pictures show an older model I believe). With almost daily use for 10 months, I noticed that the cord was being pulled out of the plug from all the weight of the pulling I had been doing to it. I taped it up but the cord managed to finally kill the right side audio today. Honestly I would recommend these to anyone I meet but I would feel better about buying them if they lasted longer than a year with constant use. I'll have to preemptively strike and glue the cord to the plug this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, cheap stuff.","review":"Very pleased with product. The assembly is very durable, and should last quite a while. Sound quality is amazing - even competes with the over-hyped products such as SkullCandies and Turtle Beaches. Maintenance can be done incredibly easy on these as well, as it all snaps together and apart if need-be without screws or bolts.Only downside is that the clips aren't the most comfortable thing in the world. If you are used to clip-on headphones, they probably won't trouble you, but if you're used to ear-buds, they make present you with some annoyance.Very happy with my buy, would have spent three or four times the asked price for such quality and durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"If cheap is what you seek","review":"I bought these for situations where in the ear phones could be dangerous, and was pleasantly surprised.

I had to stretch it to get it firmly on my ear. Then once I got them on I tried to leave them on as long as possible because they were such a pain to put on and remove. So I would just unplug them from the computer and walk around with them on. But they were big and bulky and not comfortable. Plus they don't stay on all that well.So piece not only doesn't swivel it also comes off. Which I originally thought was a good idea. It is not. After a week and half of having these headphones the piece fell off, I haven't seen them since.

However, I am through dealing with these headphones. The connection bar, that other similar models have, being absent proves more of an irritant than I had expected. One really needs to curl these around your ears to set properly. And if you don't do it right, they just pop right off. I remove them a dozen times a day so that gets annoying.

At first, I thought they were OK, but then I noticed subtle, strange noises mixed in with my favorite songs on my iPod. They seem to add digital distortion, which ends up sounding like electronic crickets or additional synthesizer tones mixed in with the playback. After I was aware of it, I couldn't ignore it. The portability is good, the price is great, but the sound is basically unlistenable to me. I am giving 2 stars because of the warranty, which is great to have, and everyone who's taken Koss up on it seems to be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but I had a couple problems.","review":"The connecting point where the hook goes into the headphone is loose, so they don't stay in place very well. The sound quality is OK, but because it wont clamp onto the ear well enough I lost a lot of sound definition which made it sound pretty crappy overall. My primary problem with headphones is the cord that connects to the Mp3 player stops working because it rips at the base of the plug. I bought these about 3 months ago and the where the cord connects to the metal plug has completely come undone. I think it may be because I wrap my headphones around my Mp3 player before I put it in my pocket. But nonetheless, this cord didn't last near as long as some of the cheaper headphones I've purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful and fragile","review":"I much prefer outside-the-ear headphones, even when working out, and I've long been a fan of Koss. The KSC75s, however, were not a good purchase. At first they were so tight that they hurt my ears. Then, as they loosened, the arms that hold them in place began to pop off. They can be re-attached, but they get looser and looser every day. I've had my pair almost three months and doubt they will last another three.[update, 12/20/2011. Three months and a day, and they're totally broken.

There very hard to put on plus the little thing that holds the two pieces together falls off a lot which is very annoying.Sound Quality: These are the worst headphones ever if there is even a little noise around you. I ended up having to turn the volume up all the way because of it. Even driving in the car I decide to put my ipod in while the radio's playing very low, Cant here anything but the radio. Plus the bass is not very good it falls out especially in songs with a big beat.Cable: The Cord is awful it gets tangled just about every time you use it.

I just didn't expect that and it's just not comfortable. My ears also feel itchy wearing these and it's hard to fix that with how the build is. It seems like these could break easy.There is a lot of base. If you like base then that will be good for you. It's not overwhelming.I wont buy them again in the future. I wanted this style of headphones because my last pair as very comfortable, but these are not. I feel frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for you, bad for neighbors","review":"These headphones have excellent sound quality; leaps and bounds over ipod earbuds. Bass isn't as good as PortaPros, but the mids and trebles are much clearer because of less bass. However, because of this the volume is usually turned up more to compensate and worst of all, sound leaks out of these headphones like crazy. The Portapros, while also open, absorbs most of the leakage, but these do not absorb sound at all! I can put my ear next to the outside of the earphones and hear the music just as loud as if I put it right side on."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted one month","review":"I didn't expect a lot out of these because they are so inexpensive. The actually sound better than I thought they would. Unfortunately, they only lasted one month before one of the speakers started cutting out.

I've had cheap earbuds last much longer than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"I ordered these headphones to use in place of earbuds, which hurt my ears. They were difficult to get in place, but once they were around my ears they were very comfortable. With regard to sound quality, the noise reduction was very good but the volume level was poor. Not that I wanted the volume super loud, but the volume level on a scale from 1-10 was a 5 at best. Here's the major problem: one of the ear clips snapped off the fourth time I used them. So...don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get these, get these, get these!!!","review":"These headphones are just incredible! I really couldn't believe that it was possible to get such clear, crisp sound, with an equally crisp but powerful bass response, for a little over 10 bucks, but it's true! I considered dropping $50-100 on a larger, ear-surrounding set of headphones because I wanted to get something with a really high-quality sound, but decided I had nothing to lose with these at this price and with all of the favorable reviews. I am still flabbergasted that a pocketable set of walkman/ipod-type headphones can sound this darn good. There's really no excuse not to own these unless you don't know about them, and if you're reading this, you know.Bar none, these are the best $10-15 you'll ever spend on audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Headphones for Price","review":"I've had a Labtec set of headphones for (too many?) years that finally gave up the ghost. So, I shopped around still wanting (the hard to find) headphones that sit over your ears. I found these from Koss and have been very happy with them. My one comment on them regards the arm that sits over the ear: it does not adjust, just slightly flexes, and if pushed too hard, it will snap off and will have to be snapped back on. I've had some pairs that allow the arm to dislocate up to 90 degrees to make putting them on easier, but these don't; you have to slide and spin them on (not really a big deal).

My ears must be shaped funny because the Apple ear buds fall out if I tilt my head, and I can't seem to get them pointed into my ear canal in the proper direction. These Koss headphones were recommended, so I thought I'd give them a try. They do sound good, especially for the money. But I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes before I can feel them pinching my ear - very uncomfortable. As others have mentioned, they are a little awkward to put on - the plastic piece that goes behind the ear is very stiff (it has metal reinforcement) and for me it is a 2 handed operation to get them on.You won't be disappointed, assuming your ears are normal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones.

I went through 2 sets of these both only lasted about 5-6 uses. The first ones I just took off normally next day they didn't work, I didn't abuse them in any way but I liked the sound and got a 2nd set. The 2nd set I did accidentally yank when the wire got caught by my elbow while jogging, it wasn't harsh but it was a mild tug. From then on one side kept cutting out.

They're light and cheap and sound great. The bass frequencies come through extremely competently. But from my experience they're also unreliable. The first pair I bought worked for a few weeks and then one of the phones stopped transmitting sound entirely. I thought I'd just bought a dud or accidentally yanked a wire or something, and I ordered another pair. These lasted about two months until the speaker in one of the phones apparently blew. Now I hear a crackle with bass frequencies in that ear. It costs nearly half the price of the headphones to send them to Koss for repair, and factoring in shipping and repair time, it would be easier to just buy another new pair from Amazon and have them at your door in a week.

Having used them for several weeks now, I can definetly agree with other reviews. First of all, the sound quality is great. I've never had any type of earbuds that sound this good, and these perhaps sound better then my old Sony's. The weak point of these headphones is mainly in their exterior construction. I have to admit they are relatively cheaply made, and the fact that the ear-clip detaches from the speaker is a bit lame because it's possible to take them off and snap the clip off, dropping it somewhere to never be found again.

The ear clips are designed to be detachable, I guess so that they will just come off instead of breaking if it gets jostled in your bag. That's fine, but they get detached much too easily - sometimes just with the motion of putting them on your ear. When I take the headphones off, one of the clips will often fall to the floor.

It's a bit tricky actually getting them looped over your ears, but they're snug without pinching the cartilage.The sound: crystal-clear with solid bass, no coloration. The bass is tight and does not overpower (unlike Koss PortaPros) other frequencies. I use these with my Rockboxed iPod, most everything I rip from CD is either FLAC or Ogg Vorbis Q7, so I need good cans.The only potential downside: they are NOT isolating headphones. You hear everything around you -- and if you listen loudly, everyone around you will hear your music. However, that doesn't affect my 5 star rating -- I have Shure isolating phones if I need them.

The clips were not very user friendly for they barely snapped in place. When I thought I had them pressed down far enough to stay put, I would start my run and find myself constantly trying to make them snap tighter on my ear because they kept bouncing loose.

As some have noted, build quality is somewhat questionable, that said many of this ilk are of similar quality. A storage case would be useful to keep them from damage too. All said and done, I could not fault these for the $13.51 price, top value for money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"The sound quality is amazing! The price is unbeatable. Only draw back is I can't find an easy way to store these headphone when I am on the move. I can't hang them around my neck, and they are too bulky to put into my pocket. Being someone who loves good sound...these defiantly have better sound than most of the higher cost headphones I have listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mini headphones with maxi sound!!!","review":"I've tried and owned numerous mini headphones since the \\"Walkman\\" era, then came CD players (which is almost on the brink of extinction) and these so far, is the best, even for the new Ipod generation. Throw those flimsy earbuds that comes with the unit. These minis deliver balanced sound. Unbelievably quite large drivers for deep bass, and good highs. Quite comfy around the ears, too. I use it with my 3rd generation Ipod Nano and it takes a pounding with almost no distortion. Performance doesn't mean you have to pay for an expensive pair of headsets. And for full size headsets, I love the new Panasonic RP-HTX7PP Retro Style Monitor Headphones...It's simple and it delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music sounding like it's supposed to.....","review":".....not like it's being listened to via tin can a la string. I can't get technical like some of the other reviewers...I don't speak that language. I will say that most headphones I see people wearing should not be sold. If Koss can make a headphone that sounds as good as this and sell it so cheaply, then all other manufacturers should try to rise to this level. First I bought one set, tested it (only problem being the connecter plug is a little 'touchy') then I came back to Amazon and bought two more pairs for when my first pair eventually blows a speaker or otherwise breaks. I truly suggest anyone in the market for headphones give these a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend - Good fit and sound","review":"I bought these headphones to use at the gym and am not disappointed. They fit well and the sound is very good. I bought a pack of replacement cushions, since they will surely need to be replaced someday and I have found with other headphones that they may not be available years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, poor design","review":"Very good sound at such a low price. However, the earclip kept coming off the earphone and eventually was lost forever. Also, the cord should have a guide on it to prevent it from getting very tangled. I returned the item and was fully refunded."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HEADPHONES","review":"These headphones are awesome for active people who want headphones that can go and do anything that they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"$9.00 for Lifetime Warranty","review":"I gave these to my girlfriend for Christmas. One speaker stopped working in May. She does put them in the pocket of her backpack, but that seems like normal use for a headphone. I paid $15 originally and I looked up the warranty from Koss which says to send $9 for the return shipping. They are just charging for a new headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts","review":"I bought these just a couple of months ago to go with an MP3 player I bought for work. I decided on these head phones because I cannot wear those little ear buds. Well, these head phones were wonderful, however they did not last. I work in an office, I don't move around, I sit at my desk, one side has already quit working. Now I am just waiting on the other side to quit also. Very disappointed in this product. I expected a better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Earphones","review":"I purchased this set after reading the excellent reviews here on Amazon. After about a week, the right unit developed a crackle/buzzing that is absolutely unbearable, and within a month the left speaker suffered the same fate. I generally listen to original film scores and \\"classical\\" music, both of which are often subtle, and the crackle absolutely ruins the music. One would assume it would only occur with low frequency sound, but this isn't the case. Blasting brass and even piano sonatas can result in the same unremitting buzz at modest volumes (I enjoy my hearing, so I never turn the volume very high). I will send in for another pair when I return to the country, but these are not worth the price. If sound quality is a priority for you (as it is for me), ear buds and these clip on sets will not suffice, so endure the awkward glances and get a set of full-size headphones (many collapsible models are made for transport)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a great value for the price.","review":"The sound quality is a bit muddy compared to higher end headphones, but you shouldn't expect sound quality like that when paying $13. They're very comfortable, but a bit confusing to put on the first couple times. They can also be annoying if you try to keep them in a pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"These Koss headphones are definitely great for their price. For only $14 this is a great product. My friend has some of these headphones and he let me borrow them for about 2 weeks. I didn't want to give them back to him but I had to. I also like the comfort of them. They fit perfect on me and were very soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for casual listening","review":"I thought these were pretty good for the money. The sound is good and they are comfortable once you get on. They are a little tricky to get adjusted on your ear. These are really good for casual listening on the subway or a long bus ride. Good buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss KSC75","review":"these headphones have very good sound quality if you don't mind not having alot of bass, i am sort of a bass freak, and i wasn't impressed with the bass. but for the money these are the best, i got them for like $15 and the sound quality is very good for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent sound","review":"Hooked these up to an Archos Jukebox 20 and was very impressed with the sound quality. The ear clip on style is pretty comfortable when running on the treadmill. Better than the behind the head style I was using previously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great overall with one minor problem, very minor","review":"This product is everything all of the other reviewers say it is. It has excellent quality sound and I use it when I'm running, so it was important to me to find headphones that would stay securely in place. This product does that fairly well. Occasionally, they start to loosen and bop around on my ears a bit, but it literally takes 1 second to readjust them back into snug place. That is the reason for 4 stars, and not 5. They have never bopped around so much that they've flown out of my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"For sedentary use only","review":"I have been searching for a headphone solution for my walks/running. I must have smaller than normal ears but the \\"sports\\" clip was of zero use. I couldn't even walk at a slow pace without the headphones coming off my ears. I wouldn't even recommend these if your only \\"activity\\" would be sitting as they don't sit close to the ear, so sound is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy","review":"Sound quality is alright. Fit alright on my head. My main complaint is that THEY BROKE WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF USING, NEW OUT OF THE UNOPENED PACKAGE. The speaker snapped out of the ear piece while it was playing without me even touching it. I then broke the other speaker by hand with what felt like 2 pounds of force... Completely useless"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but it feels really cheap","review":"I read a review saying that these headphones had excellent sound quality for the price, and that review was right. What they failed to mention was that these headphones were really uncomfortable and cheaply made. It's pretty awkward putting these on since the hooks that go on your ear are so stiff. I actually pulled one off trying to bend the metal into a more comfortable shape. If you're looking for cheap headphones, you'd be better off buying an earbud style(typically better quality at this price) or saving up for a more expensive set."},{"rating":"1","title":"everything but the actual speaker section","review":"the sound is outstanding. but the ear clips are kind of tight, getting them bent to the point where they are comfortable is a bit of a pain and if you dont get it just right it will pinch the ear or slip off entirely. after so long the plastic/rubber coating on the wire leading out of the left earphone became very hard and began to break. and along with it so did the wire and the sound went kaput. i really miss these headphones, they were very clear crisp and produced incredible bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones Fell Apart","review":"I bought these headphones about 2 months ago, and one of the ear clips fell off a couple of days ago. It had done this before and I was able to get it back on, but I couldn't this time. So after 2 months they went in the trash. They weren't very comfortable in the first place, and I definitely won't be buying Koss headphones again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate udder Hate","review":"These headphones are awful. They don't clip to my ears, they are heavy and fall off all the time, they cause MASSIVE Static in my hair, and the sound quality does not impress. I went by all of the good reviews but wish I would've just stuck with the Phillips i know and love. These are uncomfortable and totally NOT WORTH IT. I am taking scissors to them and buying a pair of Phillips as soon as I sign off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear clips does not hold up well.","review":"I will not recommend this Headphone. It has been difficult to use, the ear clip does not fit very well.I cannot really determine the sound quality, since the phone keeps falling off my ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor purchase","review":"These are by far the worst headphones that I have purchased. Difficult to put on, you have to struggle to have them pass behind your ears. So hard that one came apart the first time I tried them on! I was able to put the pieces back together, but they weren't secured and came apart every time I put them on, until finally the didn't stay together, after a total of just five uses. I didn't bother to return them for exchange; I'm buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"Very good sound quality, but entirely unusable. I bought 2 pair, both of which are so poorly designed that keeping them on one's ears is all but impossible. Forget about moving around with these on, simply wearing them while driving is hard enough.Very bad purchase on my part, don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"How are these supposed to STAY wrapped around the aer?","review":"Really? Such good marks? I have tried these headphones for over a month now while working out, and for the life of me, I can't get them to stay put! Good sound, terrible fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 words: sound leakage","review":"i didn't like them because of the sound leakage, and if you put them to a volume without sound leakage the volume is way too low... the sound quality was pretty good though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for people with big ears!","review":"My ears are normal size and these do not fit at all. They are very loose and large. I cannot vouch for the sound of them very well because they were bounching around and falling off. There is no way to adjust them to make them fit better. Bad design, too much room between around the ear piece and speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart way too easily","review":"It comes apart way too easily making it easy to lose. Super annoying to get on ears. I have never written a review but felt the need bc this product sucked so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be used","review":"These are the most worthless pair of headphones that I bought. I am a runner and the sole purpose i bought these headphones was to use them for my runs. Please don't fall for all the positive reviews. I mean these might be good for general purpose use but THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO BE WORN while RUNNING. You can hardly adjust them. They keep falling off and it takes 10 mins to put them on. USELESS PIECE OF SHIT !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing mind-blowing as many rewievs try to assert","review":"I bought this stereophones nearly one month ago, waited several days in a hope that after ''burning'' sound would became more ''better'' yes it changed little bit but nothing I can call improvement.First I would mention my background I am not audio professional, listening classical music and have lot of good recordings in my audio library.Sound characteristic impression: The bass is not particularly deep 20-50 Hz is nearly nonexistent, also it suffers punchy and annoying mid bass. I hated S and SH overpowered sounds in vocal performance. 2 hours is maximum for me to listen on these more than that my ears are annoyed. I would call it sharp sounding.If your budget is below 15$ you can try but I don't recommend it for general listeningVery Best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed b/c of high hopes","review":"I heard good things about Koss and was excited to try a new line of earclip headphones for my workouts. I immediately heard a difference in sound quality compared to my old Philips in the same price range, but alas, the construction is rather shoddy. Specifically, the ear clips were way too loose to start, and when I attempted to adjust them, the hooks fell off and have been popping off ever since.I'd love to keep them if they were only more sturdy but they completely fail their purpose as is. As far as I can tell from the specs, the next bump up in the Koss line has only this difference but doubles in price for what should be a very simple and basic feature. I've had these earphones for less than 30 days and the manufacturer still wanted my return to count for less than its purchase value toward an upgrade. Can't think of anything to add but to shake my head. Could have been a great product but it's back to searching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an audiophile, but impressed anyway.","review":"I am not an audiophile, never spent a mint on audio equipment and I am never likely to, but I bought these because I googled up \\"cheap audiophile headphones\\" and found a bunch of audio nerds raving about these phones. They're very much in my price range, so I bought them. They sound pretty great to me. I wear headphones all day while working so I wanted some nice, comfortable ones that sound good. These are them. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 months and a blown speaker","review":"Purchased these based on the positive reviews. I don't ask a lot of my headphones, but a rattling \\"speaker\\" after 4 months seems like a lot less quality than I would expect in this price range, and from this manufacturer. I do not abuse my headphones, don't turn them up very loudly and secure them neatly for transport. I'm going back to the less than $10 variety, which usually last me about 2 years, and this set is going in the trash. These headphones also have a tendency for the speaker to unsnap from the earpiece hook. This worried me at first, but then just became annoying. All around, disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I have normal ears. They are of average size and seemingly normal shape. These headphones, however, are easily some of the least comfortable ones I've ever tried. Sound quality is fine, but they're going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"For being a name brand I expected more. Way to flimzy, Speaker fell off ear mount . Ear mount does not go well for people that wear glasses. they actually hurt after awhile. Very cheap quality. Don't waste your money!! Buy the sony over ear head phones if you are lucky enough to find them. But hey if you have money to burn,like thowing it away and like pain go for it. you have been warned"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks after 6 months","review":"I've bought two pairs of these within the past year. It's got excellent sound and it works with my iPod Touch (it's hard to find headphones that work properly with the Touch for some reason). However, the left earbud stopped working on the first pair after six months. I was hoping it was just bad luck, so I bought a new pair. Same thing happened. I see now in other people's reviews they've had the same problem. Take my advice: don't waste your money on these. Buy a pair of headphones that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within weeks","review":"Broke within a few weeks & now useless. The headphones stay on your ear via tension from a small component that rotates. After using it for a month, mine now rotates so far on one side that it no longer stays on my ear. Due to a design flaw I now have only one working headphone. Best of all, the 'warranty' requires you to pay Koss $7 for the repair and pay for shipping to them - in effect it's not a warranty at all, it's a repair service charging half the cost of the headphones plus shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sound after little use","review":"Sound fine while they lasted.After about 2 years of very limited use these failed, first on one side and now both sides. Limited lifetime warranty but \\"service\\" requires the payment of $9.00 for return shipping. This is virtually what I paid.Poor quality from what used to be a top notch brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 3 uses","review":"I used these three times and can no longer hear anything from the left headphone. Other headphones work fine with the ipod and these headphones are mute in the left ear regardless of the source. I will attempt to return them for a replacement. Before they malfunctioned, they sounded fine and they are a comfortable pair to wear when running. The design keeps them in place without being painful or irritating. I hope my pair were just a bad set because I would like another pair which works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great headphones...if you have elephant ears","review":"I came across these headphones while looking for a cheap way to listen to music while running outside or on the treadmill. Cheap, lots of good reviews, can't go wrong, right? I can't complain about the sound quality but there is nothing else appealing about this product, at all. It feels cheap, the cords get tangled extremely easily, and most importantly, they don't fit on my ears. I have what I would consider to be \\"normal\\" or \\"slightly smaller than normal\\" ears, and these simply do not stay on while running. You can't adjust them either! I had some friends with varying ear sizes try them on as well while running and all came back with bad words concerning these headphones. I recommend not wasting your money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clip broke off","review":"These earphones worked decently for a couple of months although they were a bit snug. However, within a few months the clip kept coming of one of the headphone pieces, and I would have to keep snapping it back in place so I could wear them. Pretty soon, I lost the piece, and now I can't wear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"Headphones are not comfortable and are larger than I expected. They clip onto your ear and after a few minutes, it hurts. I returned this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent budget phones","review":"Got these with the intention of doing kramer's mod (google it if you are considering these and have a drill), bought them, the mod took ~15 minutes, and they now sound better than my $50 sonys, not bad at all. The only way these didn't impress me was their perfomance in a noisy environment, the bass really suffers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"I purchased these headphones two weeks ago, and I have to say I am not very impressed. The ear pieces are VERY easy to pop out. Simply snagging the cord while running will separate the pieces, and since I don't like stopping my treadmill runs in the middle, I am then stuck with only one ear piece. Additionally, the left ear piece already fits in so loose that it constantly bounces off my ear during workouts. All the positive reviews convinced me to buy these headphones, but I have to say they are not very good overall, especially for working out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lived Up To Reviews!","review":"When I bought these headphones I was looking for an affordable set of headphones, which were easy to carry with me, and produced high quality sound. There are so many choices for headphones. I have always been happy with Koss products. I had never worn a pair of ear clip phones so I read several reviews on this product, which almost all overwhelmingly recommended these. The headphones produced great sound listening to movies and music. It didn't very long before I got used to the ear clips. For the price they are a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best inexpensive headphones you can buy","review":"For about $20 these are the best headphones that I have found, and I recommend them highly. These are a huge upgrade to the earbuds that came with my player, and after several months of use I am still sometimes thrilled by how good they sound. The dynamic range and bass extension is phenomenal especially if you listen to source material recorded at 192 kbps or higher. I also have Alessandro MS-1s with an upgraded (and very stiff) LC-OFC cord which sound more relaxed and spacious, but for eight times the price they should! The Koss are easy to adjust to your ears, very light, and once set you can practically forget about them; not so with the Alessandros which I can use only at home or while walking the dog.The drivers do pop off the ear clip when tugged accidentally and the cheap cord keeps getting entangled. The drivers snap back in place with no harm done; I haven't found a good solution for the cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"too big looked like I had bunny ears","review":"Fell apart first time I used and the fit was very uncomfortable. I thought they were smaller but too large for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once you have their money, never give it back","review":"I can't agree with the claims of good sound quality. These earphones have a pronounced crackle to them that kills any listening enjoyment. Also be aware that these fifteen dollar headphones have a warranty with a ten dollar return fee, plus postage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best deal under $20","review":"Do these things sound like a $200 pair of headphones? Hell no. But they have good, responsive bass, clear highs, and just overall sound great.I gave them four stars because they do leak quite a bit of sound, so it's hard to take them on the bus/wear them in a public place with other people around unless you're really keen on sharing your music with others. If you're going to be using them in private, though, or for jogging, working out, etc, I cannot recommend them highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second pair to break in a year.","review":"This is the second pair to break in a year. Exact same thing happened to both. The left headphone seemed to have been severed from the wiring.The quality:price makes it a 2 star than a 1, but if I am purchasing things to have an expectancy of ~5 months, I would have not gotten Koss. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Questions Asked","review":"I've owned the Koss KSC75's for about 2 years. They are not perfect; the clips that hold the speakers to the ear hooks pop out too easily, they also break after you've put them back on after the hundredth time, and they look goofy. However, they have three overwhelming qualities that can't be over-looked; they sound phenominal, they cost less than $20 and Koss stands behind them 100%. They recently replaced my worn and tired pair with the broken clip with a brand new pair, no questions asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sounding, terribly uncomfortable.","review":"These headphones sound great. There is treble and bass clarity, and it doesn't sound muddy when you turn the volume all the way up. Sound-wise, these are probably the best pair of portable headphones I have owned. However, since these headphones are so uncomfortable, it subtracted from the great sound. At first, when I took these out of the box and tried them on, they wouldn't fit and stay on. Also, the cushions were very itchy. After adjusting them for an hour, they fit a little better. I gave these headphones a chance and wore them for a week, hoping that I would get used to them. A week later though, they still didn't fit correctly and were itchy. When I say they don't fit, I mean when I shake my head (even lightly), they fall off. Despite its great sound, I ended up giving them to a friend to pay off a debt."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST for the money","review":"These headphones are so good I had to get 2 PAIRS this time in case the first one dies on me. I had a pair of these a year ago and one of the metal clips broke on me after bending them so much to make them fit well in my ear. I had then bought other headphones like the Sennheiser pmx 100 and the px 100 (which sound excellent btw) and the wires on both broke on me after months of using them (wear and tear I guess). I realized how much I missed these and decided to go back to them. AMAZING sound for what you pay for. Everyone should own at least 1 pair of these :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphones I have ever owned","review":"These headphones are great. Best sounding I have ever owned. I have much more expensive headphones and I used my splitter, and went through each of my headphones playing the same song... These handled the bass the best, and sounded clearest.They sometimes start to pinch my big ears after listening to them for a few hours but for a normal ear sized person these should cause no pain, and the clips easily fall off. But great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value in headphones","review":"Nothing in the price range sounds nearly as good as these, you'll have to spend 2 or 3 times as much for comparable sound quality, and much more for better sound quality, point blank these are an amazing value. Some burn-in time and some modifications improve the sound even more. With that said, recognize that these have an open design (part of what makes them sound so great), so they are not suitable for blocking out sound or keeping sound in, you'll hear everything around you and people around you will hear your music, so they aren't suited for every listening environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather fragile","review":"the first time I put these on, the clip broke off from the main portion.

My first pair started to buzz/crackle in the right earphone. I decided to make use of the Koss lifetime warranty and send them to get replaced/repaired. In the meantime I bought another pair so as not to wait for the first to get fixed. Within one week I have the same issue as the first pair!! They have started to crackle/buzz when the heavier bass comes through. This is unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Koss headphones","review":"I've always really liked the sound from my Koss headphones. But I like this pair even more than my previous ones. My only complaint about past Koss headphones was an inline volume control. Given that I primarily use these when working out, that was a repeated invitation to shorts due to sweat invading the circuit. However, without that volume control (which was nice, but ultimately superfluous), no more shorts! The sound is great, and I look forward to holding on to this pair longer than my previous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"i received the package early and undamaged. when first trying the headphones i had to adjust the wires that secure it to your ears a bit, but afterwards they fit wonderfully and seem to be sturdy. the sound quality is great and not tinny, with a good amount of kick to the bass and clear notes and vocals. great purchase so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, not entirely comfortable","review":"These have surprisingly good sound for their price, but the hard plastic earclips are a bit difficult and uncomfortable. They've snapped off a couple of times, which really isn't much of a problem since they reattach easily, but if you get a good tight fit, your ears get sore after a while. They phones are an open design so they don't block any ambient sounds. Not bad if you spend time at airport gates and want to hear the flight announcements, but not great once you board the plane and want to block the engine sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UNCOMFORTABLE","review":"These headphones are supposed to clip around your ears but they are terrible to put on. The sound quality seems pretty good but I bought these for jogging and they just are not going to work out for that. I would not recommend for ANY sports. Also the connector looks very cheap and probably wont last long. All in all I was disappointed but they do sound OK for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Upgrading","review":"These headphones are great to buy when your 1st starting out. They are much better than the ones that come with most MP3 players. I've heard they run sales on them for as low as $12. I payed $20, but still worth it. 2 weeks later I got the V-Moda Bass Freq's and think they are awesome but, at a much higher price. Also,the V-Moda's are in ear headphones. Im still not sure what kind I like better just yet, but will post again in a few weeks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifetime warranty is useless","review":"The sound quality on these things is great, especially for the price. The earclips are very lightweight yet they stay on very securely (I go running with them). However, six years after I bought them, the sound in the left earpiece is starting to go out. I think it's a wiring problem, since if I jiggle the wire the right way, the sound will come back.Koss offers a lifetime warranty, but I would have to pay to ship the headphones to them and include a check for $9 for the return shipping. For that combined price, I could buy a new set of these headphones! The lifetime warranty may be good for more expensive items, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..","review":"The sound quality is potentially good but there is too much sound leakage.

Would have rather payed 30 for a better set of head phones right of the bat.Moving on from Koss. You should too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I wanted a pair of headphones that would clip or slip over my ear and hold in place while exercising. These are horrible. They just sit on top of your ear, and gravity keeps them in place. As soon as you take a step or tilt your head, they fall off. Furthermore, the piece that attaches the ear loop to the sound piece is on a pivot, so the ear loop constantly pops out. Very frustrating if they're in your pocket, gym bag, or purse. I've worn them three times and am planning to toss them--- a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Price These Back Where They Belong","review":"I added these to my shopping cart recently, but didn't have time that day to finish shopping and check out.I came back the next day and found that the price had risen from $14.09 to $15.71.

My cat chewed through the cord of the first one, and since they're so cheap I decided to buy another pair. In the second pair, the sound went dead in the left ear after a month or so. I figured maybe the cat had been at that one, too, although I couldn't see any bite marks, so like a fool I bought a third pair, a fourth for my girlfriend as well. These we were very careful to store away from any felines, and both had the same problem within a month.For the price, sure, these sound fine and are perfectly comfortable. But considering that in my (admittedly anecdotal) experience they have a 75% failure rate within the first month or two, well, how cheap does it have to be before having to buy a new pair every time they break catches up to you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound good but flimsy","review":"These sounded great with my portable player. The ear pieces were hard to deal with while wearing glasses. Also, I was told that everybody within ten feet can hear what I'm listening to at high volume. Not good on public transport.While listening in bed, the plastic ear piece pops off if I roll over wrong. Then I'm fumbling around in the dark trying to reassemble the headphones, while half asleep. Finally one of the ear pieces disappeared, rendering the phones unusable.OK, I'm a klutz. I need something simple, that stays in one piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're alright... :o","review":"They're pretty durable... I thought I broke them but apparently the clip part can come off, which is nice when you often sit on your stuff... ;_;The sound quality is somewhat lacking, but hey, when you're watching porno you don't really care about the sound m i rite? ... i rite..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already broken...","review":"Within two weeks of purchase, the clip on one headphone snapped off in my bag. I managed to snap it back on, but it kept snapping off repeatedly. It now snapped off somewhere between my residence and the train, so I've got one headphone that actually clips to my ear and another that I need to press against my head with my hand. *Sigh*. Time to get another set of earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on-the-ear Headphones for the price","review":"In-the-ear head phones bother my ears after a while which is why I like these on-the-ear style headphones or ear pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"best headphone under $20, yes!","review":"I love the sound these headphones are producing.The high is crispy clean and the low is bassy enough for any kind of music. I own the AKG K26P headphone which has more bass than the Koss's.I think they are simply the best headphones under $20 out there.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is the appearance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome product, great price","review":"i didn't expect much for this small earpieces. they took a while to clip in my ears. but once clipped, whoa! I realized I have missed many details from my previous headphones. these pair of Koss really cover wide range of frequency response.the bass is tight, the mid is sweet, and the high freq is not at the point where you hurt your ears. I use them in my everyday life as a student and they are durable. they are comfortable as they are light and doesn't hurt the ears like some other headphones out there.highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fussy","review":"I cannot seem to get these to stay snugly on my ears - it's very fussy to get them on and they feel like they could pop off at any moment. The sound is fine, but it's a little hard to judge since the headphone is barely sitting next to my ear. I'm wishing I'd stayed with the old style head band with a bridge from one ear to the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound!","review":"These are great headphones. I pulled one of the ear phones out of its little socket, breaking the plastic clip, but used the headphones until the one wouldn't stay clipped in any longer. They are a little large and the cords get tangled, so portability is a little tricky. The comfort and sound quality are terrific. The cost is entirely affordable. They look a little funny, but I don't like the in the ear buds of many headphones. These are wearable doing many chores and repairs, but not good for exercising, they stay on for most dancing but fall off if I do down dog or headstand type poses. Remember, its about the sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detaching earclips are VERY aggravating","review":"For some reason the earclips detach from the speakers--I have no idea why they made them that way. They pop off any time the headphones brush up against something. So half the time I'd go to put the headphones on, one of the earclips would be missing, making the headphones totally unusable. I found myself constantly digging around in the bottom of my bag or my desk drawer or searching the floor of my car for the missing earclip. It got really old and I'm not using them anymore.Also, the clips don't fit very well--they're huge. I not a small person and don't have small ears, but they would fall off pretty routinely.Sound quality was fine, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning these immediately","review":"I can't wear ear buds and have been on the search for clip ons for a long time. Based on many positive reviews, I gave these a try. The clips were uncomfortable and didn't close over my ear at all...I've used other clip phones and they've all closed properly. They sounded pretty good though, and I'm annoyed that they didn't fit well! I may have gotten a defective pair so I hope others have better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"This will be my third pair of these headphones. I use them very heavily, especially for jogging. I cannot stand earbuds, they don't stay in well when jogging and they give me painful pressure points in my ears. Which is why I love these headphones. They stay on great and don't hurt my hears. The sound quality is excellent. And a GREAT price! My only wish is that they lasted for more than a year for me. Eventually the clip that connects the ear hanger to the speaker starts popping off. And once it does it will happen over and over again until it wont clip anymore. It really becomes a pain. But, as I mentioned, I used these at least every other day jogging and they last a year. For 15 dollars I will keep coming back. It is hard to find this style, especially with such great sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one jogging session","review":"These apparently amazing ear clip headphones broke after one jog, the plastic clip on the side broke off.

It is comfortable, the cord is not too long and the sound is almost as good as my $100 Sony studio headphones. You can't find a better quality anywhere close in price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes GREAT helmet speakers","review":"I've been using the Koss Titanium headphones to make motorcycle helmets speakers for myself and my friends, but lately I've had a hard time finding them locally. I decided to try these since I've been impressed with the Koss brand. Although they don't have the inline volume control of the Titaniums, these were so much simpler to modify and install. I simply popped the ear pieces off and the speakers slipped right inside of the speaker pockets inside the helmet. Taped the wires under the liner - done! The music from my iPod is very clear and not distorted when I'm riding and I don't have to turn the volume wide open to hear them. The price and the quality of these beat any \\"helmet speakers\\" I've tried in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound quality but very uncomfortable to wear","review":"I did my research for the best headphone and the Koss KSC75 came up as one of the best one. The sound quality is amazing. You can hear all the base that you never heard of when you use crappy headphones. There is a problem for me is that they won't stay. I need them when I go work out and they keep falling off. I ended up running with my hands on my ears to hold the headphone. Very inconvenience!! Also someone has mentioned that the headphones tend to trap the heat and the sweat when you work out so it's not very pleasant at all. I would highly recommend to buy this headphones if you are indoor and stay still or when you're on a bus or plane. It's not good if you need it for work out at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earclip Issues","review":"I ended up returning the headphones in less than a month because the earclips regularly came off. While it is possible to pop the earclips back on, it's frustrating to be stopping every five minutes during a run to make the adjustment. I also found the headphones to be an uncomfortable fit -- perhaps I have unusually shaped ears. The sound quality was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handy but Fragile","review":"I purchased these headphones to use with my ipod for when I didn't want to use my other pair which are in the ear. I thought that with these, I could hear outside sounds and conversations, horns, cell phones, etc. For that purpose, they are great, but they are very fragile and the ear bud pops off of the ear clip fairly easily. The inexpensive plastic construction, though light weight, looks and feels cheap. On the plus side, they sound really good; just don't plan on these for every day wear...they won't hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, for a reason","review":"One of the earpieces fell off on first day. I could put it back on, but it would randomly fall off, in my bags, while I was wearing it, etc.I ended up buying another pair of headphones because I couldn't take the annoyance of trying to keep these together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a week","review":"These headphones are very flimsy. The earphone came off the plastic stem in less than a week. I can't judge the sound quality, because it busted so quickly. The fit over the ear was uncomfortable. The price was good. I got less value out of it than other cheap headphones, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The sound quality was OK, but oe side of the headphone broke in two months. The quality is way below my expectation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"These headphones are VERY CHEAP! The sport clip pieces fall off from the ear cushions almost every time I put them on. Luckily I was able to find the detached piece and snap it back on, but I wish they were higher quality so this wouldn't happen so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"These clip earphones STINK!","review":"These I thought were going to be the best quality because of the Koss name.How WRONG I was! I bought two sets. It said adjustiable clips. I TRIED toadjust them and the first set broke! I tried the second set and theSAME thing Happened! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT IT ISN'T WORTH ANYTHING!Buyer Beware!!!IT'S CRAP!!!CHEAPLY MADE!Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Inexpensive Headphone","review":"I've had about four pairs of these and I just bought two more. I'll have to pack the lot up someday and send them in under Koss's lifetime warranty.These have the same full sound as Koss's Porta Pro, KSC35 (their predecessors) or Sennheisers PX100. I can't figure out why these are so inexpensive. They should be priced many times more their price.The fit is better than the KSC35 for longer usage. The 35s would pinch your ears. These initially do tend to wiggle around on your ear, but the metal arm can be bent to adjust them. The arm can occasionally fall off... but don't glue it, that's like fusing your arm to your shoulder. Bad.This purchase is a no-brainer if you want cheap, portable, headphones--and why else would you be reading this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"It is impossible for me to position these for comfort, in fact, after awhile they are quite uncomfortable. As i cannot get \\"buds\\" to stay in place, the KSC75 was my only alternative. Sound is excellent and this is most important."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good headphones","review":"I use this pair in conjunction with a Cowon S9 and the sound quality is amazing. Very comfortable, not irritating like other similar headphones. Good bass. For audiophiles: The BBE Headphone 3 setting on the S9 sounds amazing on these."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Dare You","review":"I dare you to find a better sounding set of portable headphones in this price range. I bought my wife a set of Bose earbuds for her birthday. The Bose are excellent headphones and have an unbelievable sound. I liked the Bose but I could not justify the price when it came time to purchase headphones for myself. The Koss portables were so inexpensive that I decided to give them a try with out listening to them. I could not believe the sound. I actually think they sound as good as the Bose and the Bose sound very good. They look a little funny but they sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well made","review":"I was disappointed in how these fit, and that they really aren't adjustable. Some reviewers said something about bending the metal. Well, I guess you could do that, but I had a pair of sports ear phones prior to this (for years before they broke), and the clip part was actually adjustable without having to literally bend the metal. The Koss ad says something about the pivoting ear piece, They don't pivot at all. Anyway, they do not feel at all secure. Most people are not 100% symmetrical, so I'd like to adjust the left one tighter but I can't. The clip part of the headphone pops off when I have them in the pocket of my gym bag. I can just snap it back on, but that is also another thing I find inconvenient. The sound is not great either. I had a pair of Philips sports headphones prior to this, and the sound was much better. So I'm going to purchase another pair of Philips. The cost of shipping and the hassle isn't worth it for me to return these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Sound, Definitely Big Ear Friendly","review":"I tested these right when I got them. Just by looking at them, you can tell that they can fit bigger eared folks though I have smaller ears than most. Regardless, they do fit a little loosely but that didn't affect the quality of the sound or the fact that they still fit snuggly, I don't think they'd fall off unless you're seriously headbanging.But for the price, they're pretty sweet. The bass on these is better than the bass on my computer headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I've used Koss headphones for years and these didn't disappoint. I use them at the gym and they stay on my ears no matter what I'm doing. For the size the sound is great. Good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones but delicate. They only lasted 6 months","review":"These work well and hook on the ears securely. But they snap off easily and broke after only 5 months. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones, but pieces are extremely easy to lose.","review":"The headphones provide great sound, especially for the price. Good for moderate intensity physical activity.However, I purchased these headphone 2.5 weeks ago, and have almost lost one of the ear clips a dozen times, which would make the headphones effectively useless. I can't find replacement clips online. The clips become unattached all the time, in your pocket, in your bag, etc., forcing you to fish around for them. I'm really not sure why they didn't just make them permanently attached, considering the clips aren't adjustable.It's just inconvenient for them to pop apart all the time, in bags, purses, pockets, etc., and it's even worse if you lose them, as they don't provide replacement clips in the box or anywhere online, as far as I can tell. The best you could do is tape them to your head.However, I'm still giving them 4 stars, as they are a terrific value, other than the clips popping off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bass","review":"First off I would like to say that this is the only set of headphones that can handle the bass of the music I'm playing. Even expensive home stereo speakers can't handle the amount of bass that I have my EQ set at. The only reason for giving it a 4 star is because they aren't very adjustable. Don't get me wrong because they are comfortable it's just that it doesn't conform perfectly with my one ear. Everyone has slightly different ears from one another. I just wish they could be more adjustable. There are No instructions other than a picture overview on the back of the package. I'm actually afraid to bend the earpiece because I don't know if will bend of just break. Other than that they are great sounding headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!","review":"I bought these after 3 weeks of research. I wanted headphones to run in that wouldn't move. These are them. Oh yeah, I also wear glasses and the still don't they have hooks that go over the year and have the old school big head phones. This product is ugly, but i use it only for running. The bass in it sounds great, the sound is clear, yet there is a good balance between listening to the music when and how much street noise i can hear so i don't get run over. For $15, i don't think you could get a better pair of headphones for running. If you want style, go somewhere else. If you want quality, stay here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"I ordered these headphones because the reviews said they would stay put during physical activity. I already know I have small ears so I was skeptical, and unfortunately for small ears they are terrible. They are too large and barely stay put during a walk. Didn't get a chance to even test out the sound quality, but definitely wouldn't recommend these for small eared runners."},{"rating":"1","title":"good at the start, but didn't last long","review":"I bought these headphones for runs. They lasted all of 10 weeks before the left earphone shorted out. Not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running!","review":"Ear buds would always fall out while on my runs. I wanted something I could slip on that were not super big. These work great. They are comfortable and I have had no concerns of them rubbing against anything or falling off. My dogs chewed up my first pair and I decided to stick with the some product because they work so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"These headphones break apart all the time, and I have to force the pieces back together. It's only a matter of time before they break entirely. Bought them primarily for use at the gym and the left earphone constantly falls off. Unfixable and bad purchase. I just wish I could find a pair of headphones that work well for running and actually fit my ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldilocks is Fully Satisfied...","review":"Head/behind the ear phones are too non-portable. Earbuds are too uncomfortable and don't stay in my ears. But these are JUST RIGHT!Noise cancelling headphones are too expensive. Most cheap department earphones have bad sound. But these are JUST RIGHT!For the folks who thought the sound was bad, I hope I'm not insulting you, but did you adjust your equilizer? I had to make major adjustments and these earphones did NOT sound good with my MP3 player's factory default equilizer settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for money!","review":"These headphones sound awesome - I really can't believe you can get such good sound quality for this price. I definitely recommend them to anyone who wants good portable sound quality for a song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones","review":"As many reviewers have pointed out...for the money the are AWESOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the Price","review":"These headphones are lightweight, comfortable, and produce a fantastic range of sound - the low frequencies are rich, and the mid- and high-frequencies are crisp and clear. The only qualm I have is the sound insulation. As they are sport headphones, they don't really do a good job of blocking environmental noise. They also don't do much of a good job at confining your music to your ears, and even at a reasonable volume they can be audible to people nearby. But, as the price is great and the quality is superb, I would definitely recommend them for use anywhere except the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bang for the buck","review":"For a pair of under $20 headphones, these sound great.I have been through several pairs of headphones, from giveaway-grade to the $100 level. I would have been happy for these up to a $50 price point, so for under $20, they are a steal.UPDATE: Lost one of the ear clips. Called Koss' support line, they sent two new ones free of charge. Great support and makes me like the headphones all the more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"I like these headphones for the light feel and quality of sound. For the price they offer a very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add me to the love list","review":"I stumbled onto these when they were on sale, and boy am I glad I found them. It's tough to get good bass and good balance in a small, light, on the ear unit, but these manage it splendidly. I hate in-ear phones but wanted something similarly simple, and here they are. If you do some googling apparently you can do some mods if you desire, but for phones this cheap, why bother? The only thing they don't do is offer isolation from outside noise, just like any other on-ear foamy headphone. Buy them, you'll like them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good headphones for the price.","review":"These headphones are very cheap, but fairly well-made. I occasionally have trouble getting them over my ears, as I find it difficult to maneuver the clips, or whatever they're called. Once you get them on your ears they work fine and produce decent sound. They are fairly bass heavy though, so indie rock listeners may want to be careful. While I've gotten used to the sound emitted from these babies, the first time I listened to artists such as Andrew Bird and Sufjan Stevens on them were just terrible. Overall I am happy, as I can listen to my music comfortably, though a little bass heavy, and I didn't have to empty my wallet to get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect budget portable phone","review":"Just bought my second set of these. One for my portable cd player, the other for my mp3 player. Sound is excellent: forward, balanced, as detailed as you can get at this price point.Regarding the fit, if the phones are too loose on your ears, just grab some needlenose pliers and gently bend the back brackets until the fit is to your liking. Also, I wear these with glasses and they are perfectly comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is for BIG ears","review":"I bought this item because my ears are small and there are no comfortable earbuds that fit me. I've had other over-the-ear headphones in the past and loved them (they discontinued the type I like). These Koss headphones are designed for people with really big ear lobes. These earphones are bulky and barely balance on my ears. My other complaint is that the ear clip piece keeps falling out of its attachement to the foam sound piece. One good thing about this item is the quality sound. If you have really big earlobes, this would be a fine product for you. Otherwise look around for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't last...","review":"I've owned three pairs of these headphones, and I've arrived at the same conclusion with each. They sound great, but definitely do not last.I've found that one side gives out and I'm left with sound in one ear; usually the left. I use them casually with my iPod, and rarely find that they are being tugged. Yet, I suspect the cords are not properly glued into place, and the side tends to detatch enough for sound to stop.I kept purchasing newer pairs, because I love the over-the-ear style, and these do have excellent sound quality. But I've stocked up, as I'm on my third set. As soon as I find a better brand, I'm going to toss these out the window. Good thing they're down to around $14, because they're certainly not worth more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, just not for me","review":"These headphones sounded very clear and crisp. I listen to all kinds of music from reggae to baroque, and they sounded pretty good with whatever I threw at them. I must say though, I thought they were a bit lacking in bass response. As a user of in-ear or \\"canal\\" phones, I am used to stronger bass. This is turn led me to try and find ways to make them fit tighter over the ear (and also get more isolation). I tried using a headband, and it worked ok, but felt weird having to do that. I also tried forcing my ears through the clips to keep the drivers as close to the ear as possible but this led to some pain after prolonged listening.So, basically for someone who wants an open-air style set of phones, these are great. I still rate 4 stars because they are very good at what they are designed to do. It just wasn't the type of phones I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice headphones","review":"I received these headphones and a set of the \\"Spark Plugs\\". These earphones sound great. And the price was great. I should have ordered two sets of these instead of getting the \\"Spark Plugs\\". Do not get both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price...but let's not get carried away...","review":"On paper the frequency response is almost exactly like the IGrado's, but there IS a pronounced difference. These are brighter and more delicate. I would describe the sound as slightly hollow. There's something missing. I lost my Yuin PK2's and when I went to replace them, I wanted to buy an American product. After using these, I really miss the Yuins...but..are they worth $60.00 more?? I think they might be. If all you want to spend is about $20.00, I'm pretty sure these phone are the best you're gonna find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds is fine, fit is terrible","review":"I'm not terribly picky about sound and these sounded just fine to me. However, the clips on these headphones are enormous and no matter how I try to adjust them I can't get them to stay on my ears. I've owned several of this style headphone before and never had this problem. I don't use them for exercising, just walking around casually during the day, and they simply don't stay in place. I also don't particularly like the clip attachment which feels very cheap and easily pops off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A no-brainer!","review":"For the price, you can't beat these. Run it through an Electric-Avenue(.com) portable headphone amp and you will be amazed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality construction","review":"The fit and sound quality of these is quite acceptable considering the price, and I was happy to have an alternative to buds to give my ears a break. They fit snugly enough to stay on and do not bother my ears. I wear them at work while sitting and ocasionally walking somewhere in the building and not while exercising, so I cannot speak to how well they stay on while active. I have had them less than a month, however, and the left speaker has started cutting out, forcing me to fidget with the cord to make it work. This is unacceptable after so short a time. This is my first and may be my last Koss purchase. These are supposed to have a limited lifetime warrantee so I will update after I look into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, but not loud.

After removing the many wires that held the item to the packaging, I discovered that the 2 sails did not stay on the pirate until I drilled 2 small holes and re-wired them on. Do you realize how frustrated my grandchildren were by the poor design of the product? Not only was the pirate ship expensive($44.00 plus) but it was not easy to play with until I made changes.

It is not a good movie. Keeping in mind the time in which it was made, it is still bad compared to other movies of the time. The acting is bad, it doesn't even come close to following the book (but then again, what Dracula movie does?), and the camera work is extremely shoddy. The only plus of this movie is that there is a pretty gloom and creepy atmosphere to it.

I bought this movie for the first time in 1983 and this new video beats it hands down.I'm still undecided on Philip Glass' score. At times it compliments the action perfectly, but at other times it was so loud, I had to strain to hear the dialogue.

At least I din 't experience horror in its straight sense. Browning would seem to emulate the traces of Caligari instead to follow the accustomed mainstream.Bela Lugosi is admirable in this role; but I insist: if you are looking horror conceived as ra material you may disappoint. In this sense it is recommended; more by the hidden facets than the usual behavior of the personage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kronos / Glass score only adds to experience","review":"The original film, replete with it's amazing cinematography, is rendered even more so with the addition of the newly commissioned soundtrack.

I found it flat. It is not well enough done to be horror nor slappy enough to be good slapstick. The only engaging characters are the Carpathians and Reinfield, the rest are flat and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not withstand the test of time...","review":"The definition of a classic is a film that still looks fresh years and years after it was made: like Citizen Kane or Nosferatu. Lugosi's Dracula is one of the most overrated \\"classics\\" ever hyped up by the movie industry. While his version of the Count does still evoke some command, his ridiculous accent made Dracula a joke for years until Christopher Lee shattered it in Britain's fine update of the tale in 1958.Certain aspects of the film are admirable. The opening scenes evoke a certain dark mood, but the flat shooting of this Broadway adaptation of the book condemns the entire film to a sequence of tableaus without any powerful, directing dynamic.The vampire's end is lame, caught in a box and basically finished off stage. The sound is terrible.Compare this ossified fossil of a movie to FW Murnau's 1922 silent film Nosferatu--which still evokes a real sense of creepiness in spite of the lack of sound and aging of the footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Studios...What Were You Thinking!","review":"There was never a need for \\"New Coke\\" and the same goes for \\"New Dracula\\".This film although a bit stagey, is a classic. Lugosi is Dracula, the film's gothic legend and immortal star. Unfortunately someone at Universal forgot this basic fact and cranked up the new music so loudly it distracts you from the dialogue. What is the point of watching The Great Lugosi and Dwight Frye if you cannot hear them!Whomever is responsible at Universal for this travesty, I can only wish that you take a coach to Borgo Pass at Midnight.By the way... I am waiting with a stake for your heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic for a reason.","review":"I bought this and had it sent to a young friend who loves classic vampire movies.

Both films are great, though for different reasons. The Lugosi version is great for one reason-Lugosi. He is absolutely hypnotic in this role, and is truly the defintive Vampire Count. The Spanish version is superb for it's use of the camera, and for the supporting cast, which is superior to the English Language version. The DVD extras are splendid; the documentary(narrated by Carla Laemmle, niece of the founder of Universal) is fascinating, and David Skal is the ultimate authority on Dracula,hence his audio commentary is very valuable. The film transfers are good, though the Lugosi version does show it's age. The Spanish version looks gorgeous, however. And the English version, despite wear, looks better than I've ever seen it before. Definitely a must own DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original archetype - you have to know your roots","review":"If only the camera would not pan away everytime Count Dracula got out of his coffin or anything exciting happened, this celebrated film version would hold up a lot better. Still, this book is the primer on vampires for everybody else that comes on down the road, so this is where you want to start. Renefield alone is worth the cost of renting the tape. But if you have not seen Bela establish the model, you cannot appreciate what Anne Rice, Joss Whedon and others have been doing all these years. Check out the Spanish version made at night while Tod Browning was making this one during the day. Screen them back to back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music & documentary notes","review":"I found the Glass score to be very helpful to the movie - it is in the style of the period, and although it does play over the dialogue in many instances, it serves a very useful role in papering over the shortcomings of director Browning's work, and establishing a somber, foreboding mood, when all the viewer is otherwise hearing is scratchy silence and jarringly bad (by today's standards, of course) accents and acting. To say nothing of the armadillos in Castle Dracula! The movie stood up to modern viewing much better with it, in my opinion. The documentary notes and commentary, with their focus on the far better Spanish version included are the highlights of the DVD, however. Watching the Spanish version is a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a classic- Lugosi's finest and most famous work","review":"When you think Dracula, you think of Bela Lugosi in the trademark cape with the errie yet enticing accent. And when you think Bela Lugosi, you think this movie- duh! Bela Lugosi made this 1931 horror classic a legend- the prince of all horror movies. The film, which begins with a haunting rendition of the Swan Lake theme during the opening credits, is rather slow moving, but the crisp and calm character of Lugosi's Dracula perfects everything. Dwight Frye plays the perfect madman as the Count's looney henchman. Helen Chandler's Mina is innocent and bewildering, while Van Helsing is smart and quick. Overall, a defenite must for any classic horror buff. Something you will want to watch again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy The Version Without The Score Instead","review":"It's a great film, but the new score plays non-stop and is very distracting during the dialogue. I strongly recommend that viewers seek out the original, music-free version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Seeing","review":"Don't look for special effects in this film. The eerieness is created by the black and white and actor facial expressions, especially at the beginning at Dracula's castle. Excellent performances by Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye. The same actor who played Dr. Waldman in Frankenstein, plays Van Helsing.The main confrontation between Van Helsing and Dracula is not as spectacular as some of the later versions of the film though. The ultimate destruction of Dracula is done off-screen and loses dramatic effect.Not having read Brahm Stoker's novel, I am not sure how true to the book this one is (there was a movie called Brahm Stoker's Dracula that was very different from this one) but just seeing Bela do Dracula is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the version with \\"music\\"","review":"We recently ordered what we thought was the original Dracula movie. We'd had a copy before, but had loaned it out and never got it back. It was an all-time favorite. Well, the one we received contained a new \\"musical score\\" that is obtrusive, distracting, and poorly, poorly done. It was the biggest disappointment. This was a classic! The music not only is too loud, and inappropriate -- but it obscures the already-muffled dialogue. Old movies often have fuzzy dialogue, owing to the limited technology at the time -- I understand that. But this musical score adds nothing of quality to the picture. I only wish we'd known this when we ordered it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been better","review":"The 75th anniversary edition of this horror classic really disappointed me.

The mood, look, and feel of this movie is incredible. This is Bela Lugosi's greatest work. In it he delivers an Oscar worthy performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome DVD, OK movie","review":"The English version of the movie is the least of the early Universal Horror pictures, or atleast I think so. If you disagree, you MUST buy this DVD however. It is seriously cool. It features THREE versions of the movie. It has the Spanish language version, shot simultaneously with different actors, the original English Lugosi one and the same one rescored with Philip Glass music. The Spanish one is my favorite. The Philip Glass score sometimes helps, but more often detracts. Sometimes it's hard to hear the dialogue over it. Sometimes the silence is creepier in the original. It's nice that they offer it as an option, unlike the video version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff for all extra-content junkies","review":"Universal's done a wonderful job of presenting these three versions of the Dracula story; it hasn't left my dvd player since the mailman came friday afternoon! It's especially interesting to compare the spanish version with Tod Browning's seminal film. I was also curious about the new score Phillip Glass wrote for the Kronos Quartet to perform (I'm a fan of both Glass and Kronos). Some have complained about the mix, and I tend to agree, but found that careful adjustment of my surround sound channels produced a good balance.One quibble - Amazon notes that the DVD features the Glass soundtrack as an isolated audio track, but I can't seem to find the music independent of the dialog. It's unfortunate, but after a couple listens I've decided that although the music complements the film adequately, it really doesn't stand on it's own as an independant, coherent piece (atten: rabid Phillip Glass fans, your mileage will probably vary)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Failed Masterpiece","review":"The first part of the Lugosi Dracula, in the Carpathian Mountains, is absolutely eerie. It becomes stage bound in the London sequences and loses the compelling terror. Bela Lugosi is still the best Dracula. Repeated lampooning of his style has unfortunately watered down his interpretation, but nevertheless he blends the courtly count with the spirit of the undead just enough to give us a plausable concept of a diseased demon come to life. One key aspect of the Carpathian sequences especially at the castle is the lack of music. The quiet enhances these scenes particularly those moments when Dracula and his brides rise from their coffins as well as when the brides approach the unconcious Renfield. I have not seen the version with the great Philip Glass's music added, but I can not imagine these sequences being improved upon by anyone's music. This version of Dracula is worth seeing for the brilliant first half."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER RECEIVED ITEM","review":"I never got it.

The picture is grainy and there is alot of digital \\"noise\\" (dithered pixelation in multi-hues). The image quality is not crisp but is rather dark and very fuzzy.The Spanish-language version, by contrast, is a much better picture, obviously sampled at a higher rate and with less compression. Why would the producers of this DVD spend more time (and valuable disk space) for the Spanish version of the film is beyond me! I mean, how many of you reading this would actually buy it for the obscure Spanish version versus the ultra-classic Bela Legosi version? Put the Spanish version on a separate disk next time, or on the flip-side and compress the main feature less."},{"rating":"2","title":"and see the film 'Ed Wood' as well...!","review":"When you've seen 'Dracula', take the trouble of also seeing 'Ed Wood'. You'll never forget the role of Lugosi in Dracula and the magnificent role of Martin Landau (10 stars!) in 'Ed Wood'. Through Landau the person and the magic of Lugosi really comes to life. And as for the Glass-music: being a fan of him since way back, I stopped very soon trying to persuade people of the beauty of his music. And hey, Philip Glass too can't always compose masterpieces! One lesser piece makes you appreciate the beautiful ones even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula 1931 version","review":"I've always enjoyed this movie, however, in my opinion, Bela Lugosi's portryal of Igor in \\"The son of Frankenstein\\" was his best performance.

In the previous model, the microphone boom could be removed. I like that feature since it made it even more portable. However, the reason that I had to replace the older model is that I either was generating static in VOIP conversations or the others on the line could not hear me. So, I suspect this new, permanent mounting was to address such an eventual defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"VANILLA FUDGE LTD","review":"BEFORE ANYONE CAN REVIEW THE CD...

Amos travels from his home in Braintree, Massachusetts to Monticello, Virginia. Along the way he rides in a coach, ferry, on a horse, and travels by foot. The trip takes several weeks and Amos incurs several hardships.

After configuring it on Win XP SP2. It recognized the device, was easily calibrated, and easily allocated onto BF2. When the game-play started my trigger didn't work.

I still have no idea as to what might be causing the conflict.On a second note, I bought this joystick as an upgrade to my logiteck attack 3. Mostly because I wanted a joystick that I can twist for in-flight yaw motion. The first thing I noticed was that the stick is like a broom stick.

The authors�?answer to binge-eating is simply eliminating all sugar, flour, fat, caffeine, or whatever your “trigger�?foods are from your diet. Not only that, but they insist you must weigh and measure your food all the time for the rest of your life. That’s hardly what I consider freeing yourself from obsessing about food. They actually recommend keeping an emergency food kit in your car to be sure you always have measuring cups, a food scale, and several cans of “safe�?food available to you at all times.

This book explains why I was addicted in a way that makes so much sense. I find the food plan easy to live with, and I have ZERO cravings. This book was written by a woman that has lived the same miserable life of an overeater, therefore, she knows exactly what she's talking about. She is living proof that you can overcome this disease.

Most gate arms can take some pushing, but if a vehicle or person pushes hard enough, and if the gate is large, the arms will get damaged and will have to needlessly be replaced. A Gate lock is a must and this new version has a nice powdercoated black finish that blends in nice with most gates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work as planned","review":"I bought this lock because my dogs discovered they could worm their way out of the gate and run into the street (when i just had the GT500 opener). I thought this would be perfect to lock the gate in place with no chance of their escape. What I found was after hours of adjustments, it would not time itself correctly to lock when shut and to release when opened. It would try to open even though the latch was still locked (latch would open and close back before the gate would start to open). I finally removed the lock when it malfunctioned so bad, it bent the arm of my GT500 opener. Luckily I bought the opener at a local store and they swapped it out for me. The new opener has worked fine since I took the lock off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has worked great for a year now","review":"We wanted this to keep the dogs in the yard, yet give easy access to the gardener and family.

Nice 'feature' is that the receiver pin is removable if you don't complete the install. Install tip: don't put the cap on receiver pin till you're really sure. Mine is still off.

It was extremely easy to install and we didn't have any problems leveling/lining up the device as stated in other reviews. The manual that came with the gate lock did not include directions for our particular gate opener (Mighty Mule 350), but after an extremely quick internet search, we found what we needed at the Mighty Mule website. It literally took less time to connect the automatic lock to the opener (just 2 wires!) than it did to find the directions on the internet - and that's saying something! The automatic gate lock works seamlessly with our remotes and the keypad.

It is closer to a white/gray than the rich cream of the original pattern.I have only gotten 2 bowls wet, and both have turned a disgusting gray color as a result. After contacting Mikasa I was told this is how stoneware is and that the bowls would turn back after a couple of days.

And unplugging, then plugging back in didn't resolve this problem, no you have to completely restart your computer and hope it starts working again. Then after a long battle in my computer game Crysis the mouse stopped working and i got a bullet in my head, at which point i realized this mouse isnt worthy of living anymore and i just chucked the thing at the wall and broke it to pieces.

It was a step up from my generic dell mouse, when I first got it. The size and design of the mouse is a plus but the actual intended mouse function was badly executed. The basic clicking function ceased to work, after only a few months. The backward/forward side buttons initially worked nicely but they too stopped functioning. I went back to the dell mouse since I was too frustrated to wait for the GE mouse to begin to work again like it should.

We have used it enough, that we know it's not really meant for heavier people ( over 225 lbs ). It is easy to assemble, but one of the stools had one leg piece that just wouldn't flush agaisnt another piece and we ended up stripping the screw that was supposed to tighten it together so we have a gap that's slightly noticeable. They are very lightweight and the seat is very \\"cushy\\", not firm. You tend to sink into it a little. It's made of pleather or whatever it is, so it can stick to your skin. Otherwise, not bad for the price considering how pricey good bar stools can be. It does look really great in my espresso colored kitchen.

I would expect that from Bigelow or Yogi tea, but not my beloved Celestial Seasonings. Although I can understand the desire for innovation, sometimes the adage holds true: \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\" CS had the perfect forumula before, and they ruined it.

It was a great idea, but it's one of those things that looks good on paper but doesn't work in real life. It isn't very precise in adjusting. A quick tap will send you up or down roughly 30%. This is a problem when my flight instructor (in the game, of course) says, 'You'll need about 80% thrust to get it moving.'Of course, if you can control your throttle with your keyboard, it isn't really a problem at all.Pros:Excellent stabilityresponsivelooks coolfolding legsCons:Bad ThrottleOnly 3 buttons"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap stick, doesn't last too long","review":"I've had this stick for maybe four years now.

The concept of getting great singers like Marcia Ball, W.C. Clark, Ruthie Foster and Sweetpea Atkinson to be the \\"voices from the street\\" was a truly inspired idea. And the vocalists, especially Ruthie, are uniformly excellent. I don't think W.C. has ever recorded anything as soulful as \\"The Power Is Gone\\" and Marcia makes me want to get up and get involved with her \\"Listen to Me\\" anthem. But it's Sweetpea, especially on the sexy \\"Chance at Love\\", that steals the show. All the music, featuring Boyack's enlightened guitar lines, is fantastic and it sounds great to hear horns behind the singers. The songs all have a message and with voices like these delivering it everyone should be listening. The big ending of the album, the old protest tune \\"Time Has Come Today\\", has all the singers on it and it rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"Pat Boyack's first 3 albums (with the Prowlers) were some good listening, foot tapping, rockin' blues.Great guitar work....tight band....my type of stuff.This album, however fine it may be, is WAY different from anything in the first 3 albums. \\"Voices from the Street\\" really has a more gospelly/R&B type sound. There are, in fact, numerous tracks on this CD in which Pat's guitar work is definitely kept in the background.I guess I'm missing the point behind a CD by a guitar player in which the guitar player is NOT featured.As I said above....perhaps a very fine album...such as it is....but not what I want to hear from Pat Boyack....at least not given his first 3 albums.If you enjoyed the original Pat Boyack and the Prowlers albums you should be well aware that THIS album is significantly different in nature from those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for bagels","review":"If you are planning on using this toaster for waffles or regular toast forget it.

It costs more, even at Amazon, than I normally spend on foggers. It didn't work very well at all. We were getting bitten while we were cleaning up from setting off the foggers. A fruit fly even survive them. We may be bitten a little less frequently than before, but I'm still getting them in the kids' diapers and clothes. I have to get more foggers and try again. With a newborn and a wild two year old, the work to do this and clean up from it is nearly impossible and the chemicals - however safe manufacturers say they are - cannot be good for small kids and pets.

But this book feel far short of that goal. The subtitle is, \\"How to Discover and Unleash Your Hidden Powers,\\" but it didn't help at all with that. It is a good book for self-help and explaining charismatic characteristics. But helping YOU become mroe charismatic will require far more than this book. Thirteen kinds of charisma, imagination, how to stop putting yourself down, anger, breathing, overcoming performance anxiety.... Just a few things covered in this book that will help you feel calmer, perhaps more in control around others, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No help here","review":"This book didn't give me any clue about how to become more charismatic. The basic premise of the book is that we need to stay in tune with our bodies. This book provided many superficial physical exercises that seemed completely unrelated from the subject at hand. The author suggests that almost every problem can be solved by breathing deeply. If you belive this - by all means, go ahead and buy the book. For me, it was hard to weed through the wordiness, and the disconnected and jumpy chapters kept me from focusing. In summary, I'd say that this book simply doesn't give any real solutions for gaining charisma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage in, garbage out.","review":"I'm writing this review because I disagree strongly with the review of Darryl Porter, who says that this book is just filled with \\"silly exercises.\\" He's missed the point entirely.

To really get the full benefit of what this book has to offer, it's not enough to pass judgment on the exercises and call them \\"silly.\\" Once you give them a try, and apply them to your daily life, the value of this book will become clear. The exercises might make you feel silly--at first.

Personally, I believe that Charisma is a spiritual intangible, but Doe Lang does touch on how to bring out exactly that in your own life. The old axiom: \\"You either have it or you don't\\" about charisma doesn't apply with this book. Doe Lang gives example after example, and exercise after exercise, about how ordinary people can tap into that magic lantern of charisma that lies asleep within each of us. A scientist, she explains many of her techniques in modern scientific terms and examples; a creative artist, she demonstrates the process through many examples and exercises. I found her process to work. This book is like 'water in the desert.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious story based on the RTA episode","review":"These RTA series of books are based on the television series that ran for seven seasons during the 90s. The show is beloved by fans and is one of the best family-friendly shows ever screened on television. I have all the DVDs and watch them every year. These books follow the television episodes quite faithfully.In this novel, the story centers around young orphans Davey and Dora Keith who are destined for the orphanage before Marilla Cuthbert takes them in. Since Rachel Lynde also lives with Marilla, she has to tolerate the youngsters, especially Davey, who is quite a troublemaker.

I think I've read someone describing the treatment here of Perikles' Funeral Oration as a \\"tour de force\\" - and, considering Perikles' (or Thuc's?) at times bafflingly scattered sentence structure, it is certainly helpful to have someone such as this author to guide you along.

In the US, they are represented by Interscope, a division of Universal (who also own Island). U2 has no relation to Baktabak - this is an unofficial, unauthorised bootleg release and U2 do not receive any profit.I have nothing against unofficial recordings.

We received the box set of movies (Bright Eyes, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm & this one) for my young daughter who loves singing and dancing. She loves watching Shirley Temple dance and act, and overall enjoyed this movie but be forewarned that the end is rather scary (SPOILER ALERT: she's kidnapped briefly at the end and is caught in crossfire which frightened my daughter). The scene is over within minutes and compared to today's movie violence is very tame, but I wish I'd known so I could have addressed it ahead of time.

The point of tummy time is for baby to use his/her muscles on his/her own and by having a pillow under baby it really defeats the purpose. My son sometimes enjoyed himself and sometimes didn't but in the end we rarely ever did tummy time and when we would I would just put him on a blanket on the floor, sit on my tummy in front of him and shake a rattle.

In the beginning she would just sort of check out the fish(she looooves fish), but over time her ability to interact with it has greatly increased. Now-4mnths- she pushes around on the fish with great joy even making fun bubbles. It is a great first tummy time toy. The pillow velcros on so you can remove it if your little one wants to practice holding themselves up or just for a wash. As far as the new water everyday thing goes. I was good about that in the beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something. It turns out nothing horrible will happen if you don't change it very often. Actually the ability to empty it is helpful if you plan on taking it with to say grandma's house. Very easy to roll up and take with unlike our playmat. The little sun could be easier to activate bubble noise. A little hard for the little bitty ones. Toys are still good for crinkling and chewing though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for tummy time....","review":"This product was suggested to me as a 'must have' by a friend. I have to say that yes, we could live without it, but it's also a nice thing to have. If for nothing else, it's a good shaped mat for our baby to lay on when he's on the floor. We sometimes put him on here with his head on the pillow when he's playing with toy bars that dangle above him. The pillow is also good for propping up his arms/hands for tummy time. He's not too interested in the water feature, and I have had trouble filling it. I think it's a little silly to refill it every day. Ours doesn't leak, and our baby certainly doesn't bite through it (he has no teeth!) so I don't know why everyone is freaking out about that. Might be a tad expensive for what you get, but if you get it as a gift (which we did), hang onto it. Your baby might like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"This mat is terrible! It's very poorly made. Everything about it seems cheap. Within 1/2 hour of us filling it with water, the entire thing had leaked through the side of the pouch (not the hole to pour the water into) and soaked the mat and our carpet. Not only did it soak through but the dye in the material stained our carpet pink. I would never recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but...","review":"My baby does not like this toy at all. I wanted to stimulate her, by helping her push up better, and getting her upper body stronger, and I thought the mat looked like fun. Every time I lay my little girl on it she starts to cry within seconds. She seems so uncomfortable on the prop that she doesn't even take the time to discover the hanging toys, or bother with the swimming creatures. It's also a pain to have to take what little free time I have in the day after she goes to sleep, to empty and refill the water cushion with sea creatures. Additionally the water creatures stick together really easily while you are filling the toy, and they are hard to get apart. I wouldn't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it much!","review":"My son hated this mat at first, then he played in/with it for about 5 days...after that, it got old!

He would SCREAM for the entire time that we would lay him on his tummy. He quickly learned how to roll over (since we did start kinda late) and wouldn't stay on his tummy. This mat was WONDERFUL! Because of the pillow it has, he was unable to roll-over when on his tummy. AND he remained on the mat for about ten to fifteen minutes before he would start crying to get off his tummy.This mat helped us out so much. It has little rings that you can add toys your child likes to it so they have their own favorites to keep them occupied. We have another son on the way and we will use this for him, as well.

I looked at other brands but they did not have the front swivel wheel. It rolls great and it easily navigated. It is very easy to assemble. I would definitely recommend it. My daughter bought a cloth drink caddy that goes across the handles for hers that she likes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stroller!","review":"I love this stroller. I had a tandom double stroller by graco and I loved it but my kids are now 3 and 4 (15 months apart), and they outgrew our stroller. I wanted a jogging stroller because my kids still fall asleep and need to be laid in a stroller sometimes when we are out or for days where there is a lot of walking (disneyland!). This jogging stroller is perfect for them. They are older but fit into this stroller better than our tandom stroller. Their feet used to drag into the wheels and their legs did not fit under the child tray bar so this stroller allows them to fit more comfortably. I have a 3 and 4 year old on the taller side but this still works. At least it works better than what we had before. I can't wait to use it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thing...","review":"....I don't like about this stroller is that it doesn't have a good way to shield my babies from the direct sunlight. I think it stinks that you have to buy extra screens and rainguards for strollers when you will ovbiously need these items! Other than that this stroller has been a lifesaver. I recently brought home twin boys, and once my \\"help\\" left town after two weeks, it was great to be able to run the babies around the neigborhood. They love riding in it, and it's so easy to maneuver I love pushing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live without it!","review":"My girls are 18 months apart, this stroller was one of the best purchases I have ever made. It folds easily and fits in my car and is the only stroller I have ever owned, and I've owned about 10, that i can easily manuever with one hand. That means that when the baby is grouchy and refuses to sit in the stroller on the way back to the car, I can hold her on my hip and stear the stroller loaded with my toddler and all our gear with no problem. There are occasionally doors we don't fit through unless we open up the door next to it, but again the stroller is so manueverable its really not a big deal. I was worried about the reviews that talked about kids not being able to sit up all the way, but my girls, who are usually very finicky about that kind of thing, have never had an issue with it. They love the smooth ride and have no problem sitting side by side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usable as a jogging stroller","review":"In order to work for jogging, the front wheel must lock firmly out in front. The Safari's front wheel locks rearward, providing an inadequate wheelbase for jogging. Furthermore, it does not lock firmly. It rattles side-to-side badly. This stroller is NOT usable for jogging, and any claim to the contrary is a falsehood."},{"rating":"1","title":"BABY AGE is a TERRIBLE Store. Filed BBB complaint","review":"Bought stroller from BABY AGE and opened it. Did not like the stroller, handle is too low, but I'm six foot tall. Called about returning the stroller. I was told that if it was rolled around the house it was considered USED and could not be returned. This is NOT the return policy is listed on their site.Filed complaint with Better Business Bureau. Company a NIGHTMARE to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous~","review":"This stroller may seem like a bargain, but three-wheeled double strollers are much more dangerous than four-wheeled strollers. Whenever you are putting weight on the front wheel, like when are on uneven ground or going up even one step, the entire stroller becomes unstable and can tip. This happened to us. Just going up one step onto our patio, the stroller tipped, and we have two bumped heads. Maybe you shouldn't even go up one step, but the reality is that three-wheels give a lot less balance than four.Certainly worth the extra money for a four wheeled jogging stroller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if you're 5ft nothin'","review":"My husband is 5'8 and I'm 5'11 and the handle for this stroller was so low that it put our wrists in an akward position. As for the swivel action just like all the other swivel double joggers I've tried the stupid wheel shakes if you go faster than a slow walk or hit a bump in the road. I have given up on the double jogging stroller that swivels. Save your money and get one that doesn't swivel because you'll just end up locking the wheel anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This stroller was a great purchase for us - it rolls very smoothly and is excellent for parks, boardwalks, city walking, exercising, etc. It does take up a lot of space in the trunk, but we can live with that. The kids are very comfortable in the stroller. I am very happy with this stroller - and the parent console is a huge plus! My only recommendation is the shade extender to go with it - it does not shade the children from the sun very well...other than that, I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stroller!","review":"I really love this stroller! My newborn and 2 year old are very happy in it! It is really easy to push/steer and handles changing surfaces well. The main downfall is that it is wide and limits where you can take it (small or cramped stores for example.)Instep had to send me a \\"parent tray\\" because it was not in the box and should have been. It is just a little bag that hangs from the handle and is not the greatest, but at least you have somewhere to set a drink and have your hands free..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I was a little leary about buying a big double stroller... especially online! After reviewing and comparing double strollers for hours and hours, we decided to buy the Instep Safari. What a great buy this was! Although it can be a little heavy to lift, it pushes very easily. The swivel wheel makes steering with one hand no problem. Although the canopy doesn't do a whole lot to block out the sun, a nice weather covering can be purchased at Target for $14... helps keep the wind and rain out. I found the leaning problem with the seats could be easily fixed by tightening the center strings as tight as possible, and letting the outside strings hang a little loose. This way the kids lean to the outside more. It really isn't much of a problem though. The kids seem very happy riding in it. This stroller is definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handle Bar","review":"I love this Stroller! Myself or my husband use it 5 days a week for daily walks and/or outdoor adventures and works great. The only thing for TALL people to be aware of is the handle bar DOES NOT extend to accomidate taller people. I researched for a couple of weeks for the best stroller for what I wanted to use it for without paying high dollar for a name brand one. There was a couple of reviews on amazon and other websites that carried the same stroller and said that the handle bar adjusted to different heights. NOT TRUE!! My husband is 6'3\\" and I am 5'10\\" it works fine, but would be a little more comfortable if the handle bar could adjust a couple inches. So I just did not want anyone to get false information. Also amazon delivered the stroller in just a couple days, I was so impressed. Would recommend this product and amazon to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The day we received the stroller we were very excited. We put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction. However, when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow. Of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming. We have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company. I would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far so Good!","review":"It has worked out well for us so far. We have a 2 year old boy and a 4 year old boy. We are enjoying having the swivel wheel. It is hard to get through doors at the mall but can be done! Now I don't have to lift the whole stroller just to turn it! It works very well for walks. The storage space below is not huge but ample if you use wisely. It will not fit my large purse or my large diaper bag but I put purse and diaper stuff in a backpack for the Fair and was able to fit it in there as well as other items like coats, blankets, waters. It's just not very deep. I may need to write another review in a year to make sure all is still well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instep jogger works great","review":"We purchased this jogger to replace a rather nice double stroller from Graco. We found the jogger far less bulky and easier to push up hills etc. My kids like it and the baby fold down seat is great for naps. I wish it had a parent tray and child tray however. I feel like my kids are safe and this was a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice ! except........","review":"I love the swivel wheel , which is the main reason why I wanted this stroller. HOWEVER Its shade is not large enough to cover the children so I had to buy a seperate shade for the stroller. An added expense to the stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst baby investment ever","review":"Do not think you can jog with this stroller and the back rests are very short. my 3 year old's head was completely over the top of the back of it, which would be fine if you could sit the seats up. They lean way back at their highest position.Here's the kicker! The wheel fell off and the stroller when tumbling forward and landed on the pavement on TOP OF MY CHILDREN WHOSE FACES GOT SCRAPED UP!!!! I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER recommend this stroller to my worst enemy. Save your money and get a BOB, even if it's just work walking.Oh and did I mention that the axle in the back is bent after only a year? And that the rickety clicking sound was there after a month and never went away? And that it's hammock style so that means the kids just lean into each other and get angry with one another? What a hideous investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned Stroller","review":"I originally had my heart set on the BOB but couldn't justify spending the money. After reading the reviews on this stroller, I decided to go with it because all of the reviews seemed positive. The first time I tried the stroller, the left side wobbled a lot and the front tire shook. After having several people look at it, they decided it was put together correctly and it shouldn't have that problem. Long story short, I ended up returning the stroller and got the BOB. The BOB is the best stroller I have ever owned and it is definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Steal for the Money","review":"While trying out a regular jogging stroller, I quickly realized that I needed one with a swivel wheel (I'm not so much a jogger as I am a walker on rough city streets and gravelly paths); I looked into the more expensive brands but simply couldn't swing the $ and opted for this one.I'm super impressed with this stroller!!! It is relatively lightweight and rides smoothly. The undercarriage basket is somewhat shallow and the drawstring seat recliner is odd (I often end up with a lopsided toddler), but I think the pros far outweigh those two little issues, especially with regard to how much money I saved :) I'd recommend this stroller to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money and no headaches!!!","review":"I was looking to spend some money on a worthy twin jogging stroller. I read the reviews and am very happy that I purchased this one. I agree with the con that the children can not sit up in this stroller. But I figure, if I'm jogging or walking briskly they would rather 'relax' and lay back a bit to enjoy the ride. It is unbelieveably easy to push and turn. I can do it with one finger! I did purchase the extended canopy and am debating the snack bar that goes in front of them. I highly recommend this product and am extremely pleased to own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful stroller","review":"This stroller is light and easy to push. It turns on a dime even when the front wheel is in the locked position. The seats recline easily and the hood has a clear pane in it so you can see your children when the hood is deployed. I like this stroller much better than my more expensive Zooper single stroller. Most importantly, my children like it, too! However, the lack of adequate sun screen as well as the difficulty getting things in and out of the basket underneath the stroller is why I didn't give it a 5-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instep jogging stroller","review":"I love my new jogging stroller! It's very easy to steer and push. I only wish the canopy would protect the kids more. Overall great product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent buy","review":"I bought this double stroller for my grand children. After much research and comparison, interviewing many \\"lucky\\" parents on the streets of several cities...I came to the conclusion that this stroller is what we need.I actually exported it overseas to Jerusalem. My daughter in law walks a lot with the children and this stroller is a \\"dream come true\\". Very easy to push, easy to fold and easy to erect. The children 1.5 yrs and 1 month old are comfortable in it and we are looking for years of excellent service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy!","review":"I recently purchased the In Step Safari double stroller and we LOVE it. My twins are only 3 mos old but they fit comfortably in the stroller (as does my four-year old!) and enjoy every minute of walking, jogging and just hanging around. It is so lightweight and easy to manuever that I can lieterally push it with my fingertip! My only frustration is that the shade does not really provide shade, although I hear none of the strollers really do!. Otherwise, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it and so will you!!","review":"First, I want to thank you for the reviews that people post for this product. It helped me to choose the perfect stroller for my two sons(1 yr & 2 1/2 yrs old. The stroller is smooth, steady, and easy to manouvre around. An option of the swivel front wheel is 'the best' part because, it's easy for quick turns. The only problem I have is, the shade does not serve its purpose when we are facing the sun. I have to hang an extra blanket on the shade to keep them away from the sun. Beside that, this stroller is making me a happier mom on the block!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stroller","review":"I bought this stroller for my 3 month old and my 17 month old.. I love it.. it pushes so easy I can do it with one hand... I only gave it a 4 because like other posters said, the canopy is really lacking.. you might as well not have it on there.. Also..the instructions were not so great.. they had diagrams that weren't included, and the pictures were all really dark.. and some of it was just plain confusing to read...luckily, it was pretty easy to put together anyway...But I use it almost ever day...I have an Impala and can not get it to fit into my trunk, so that was a little dissappointing as well..But over all I am SOOO glad I bought it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Journey!","review":"An interesting and fascinating book about a newer form of Reiki, developed by Kathleen Milner through meetings, visions and channelings according to instructions by the teacher Sathya Sai Baba in India. The book barely contains any pictures, only a few not so go(o)d ones of the newer symbols that Kathleen, her students and other Reiki-practitioners were given in different ways. This, and the fact that the book is also a little hard to read on account of the doublespacing, lowers the rate as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor attempt at writing","review":"Milner may be a gifted healer and channeler of healing energy, but she is not a gifted writer. Her personal story changes from edition to edition which leads me to believe that when she is challenged, she simply chooses a new path to follow.The book contains SOME useful information and the symbols are a plus, but the format and overall layout make it difficult to read. She insists on using hard to read fonts and odd spacing in all of her books. This book is perhaps her best, and that isn't saying much. It's hard for her to stay on track with ideas which leads to rambling. I returned her latest book, \\"Becoming a Shaman\\" because it was so poorly written. I will no longer buy or recommend her books to anyone.If you want information about Reiki and energy healing, you would be better off choosing books written by Barbara Brennan or Diane Stein - both are very gifted writers and healers."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give zero stars, I would","review":"I read many, many books per year and, although I've read at least a dozen books on Reiki and even more on healing and energy work in general, this is by far the least helpful, most chaotically organized book I've ever read. I agree with another reviewer in saying Ms. Milner must have convince family and friends to review the book at 5 stars. It's a very difficult read. I do, however, sense that she is genuinely caring... just not a writer or teacher, as far as the book goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful, Just Aweful!","review":"The reviews on this book had to come from the author herself or her friends and family. There is no other explanation why anyone who actually read (or tried to read) this book would recommend it to others. I only wish Amazon's rating system permitted negative stars. Not only are the illustrations amateuristic and embarrassing and the double-spaced typface irritating, the content is a joke. This Vanity Press booklet is Kathleen Miner's first attempt at being an author and it should have been her last. She has absolutely nothing to say, yet that does not stop her from rambling on interminably. Aweful, just aweful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile set will break DVD trays easily.","review":"I have no doubt that this is a good collection in terms of material.

I was looking for something soft, not a stuffy plastic blanket. And while the denim side is nice, I don't want to wake up with marks from the seams all over my face. Frankly, I'm confused as to how this got so many favorable reviews. The pattern on the comforter doesn't even match the description/picture.

Casually tied to the bones of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, The Crystal World is clearly an early attempt at philosophical introspection by an author whose style would mature much later. The Crystal World's setting is indeed fascinating as a piece of speculative fiction, but not much was done with it except as a background for some thin romance and confused, meandering characters. As noted previously the colonial mindset will also grate on modern PC sensibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant writing, wonderful history","review":"Sadly, Bruce Alexander passed on shortly after the release of this book, but has left us one more book after this.

In this book it was not the case. It was reiterated multiple times that Justin was 17 years older than Danielle. That in and of its self would not have bothered me, but Justin kept referring to her as a child even after they were married. The whole thing just gave me the creeps.Now if you looked passed the age thing the story was choppy at best. There were like three distinct stories, and they didn't seem to flow very well. In the last third of the book she introduced a character that was seeking unholy retribution for acts Justin's father committed, and then she didn't even explain it that well.

There is, of course - knowing Heyer - a very sweet romance as well as a well-plotted mystery story.Sound familiar at all? Have other reviewers not read Heyer's book?

Dave wrote this book from a pilots view and I did enjoy the memories. He also gave some credit to the crew that flew with him. Fine book Dave, I'm glad I bought it.

Most of the press followed the Americanization of the war north of Saigon, and I was amazed to learn how much went on with the traditional helicopter aviation companies that continued to be stationed at Vinh Long and Soc Trang in the IV Corps. I genuinely liked being in the cockpit with these guys, and felt I had learned to fly a helicopter by halfway through the book. There is much humor to experience here, along with the thrills and bizarre war-stories inherent in a tale like this. Read it! And get a copy for the vets in your family that might have trouble telling you exaxtly what they went through flying these incredible Hueys, either as pilots or door gunners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing is an understatement","review":"I ended up with this book because it was matched up with another book, \\"Kill Me If You Can\\", a book that many battlefield hardened grunts had said was a really good book, and it was. This one leaves a lot to be desired if one is non-military and trying to learn what the war was like. I suspect that most of the really good reviews here came from the author's friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge disappointment","review":"I served in the 175th--my tour overlapped with the author's who I don't recall meeting--and hoped to read about the immediate history of the company. Instead I found a poorly written (the book is a vanity publication) set of judgmental, arrogant, rehashed \\"war stories\\" by a cocky young officer. (Full disclosure--I was a warrant officer and it's clear the author has little respect for those of us who lacked a \\"full commission\\") The favorable reviews must be from his friends. The author is active in post Vietnam veterans groups and I can just imagine his buddies listening to the same old stories over a glass of beer nodding their heads in encouragment when the idea of writing the stories came up.If you want to read a well written, sensitive account of what it was really like, try ChickenHawk by Robert Mason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twerp","review":"The book was written by a Twerp!

Ten POWS died of starvation, mistreatment, and torture in Garwood's camp; none of them crossed over to the enemy. To know the real Bobby Garwood, read Frank Anton's \\"Why Didn't You Get Me Out?\\" or Zalin Grant's \\"Survivors,\\" plus several more POW narratives that are out of print but still may be found at major libraries.

I ordered this pet bed via Amazon from Splintek. Based on the measurements, I ordered the medium. It turns out that I needed a bigger size. In the meantime, I found a comparable bed that was 50% cheaper than the Splintek's large. JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT, ALL SALES ARE FINAL!! I didn't see that stated anywhere obvious on the Amazon site when I made my purchase. Needless to say, I'm not going to go out and buy the less costly bed now. Not only that, but when I called Splintek about at least exchanging the medium for the large bed, I was told that their Customer Service would call me back a couple of days. Well that deadline has come and gone and I haven't heard a peep. I am very unhappy and dissatified with this whole experience. The product itself seems fine.

Forget GWTW and Casablanca. Dr. Otto is a movie that looks like it was made by squirrels.Every student should see this. It is perfectly AWFUL! Which is why it should live. There is hardly a frame or a word of this movie that works. It is a textbook of cinematic error.Now and then you are fixated by Jim Varney, because you know there was something in there but it would not come out until later movies. Jim was cast against type and it is just a pain to see him working so hard to go in the wrong direction.Nevertheless, the years have shown that Cherry and crew learned a bunch and went on to make some of the funniest movies around.In some ways it is reminiscent of Alan Ormsby's horror classic, which was like getting hit with water balloons while standing on one foot and reciting lines from Pogo. Perhaps this is the primordial soup from which is made, in time, good comedy.I threw my copy out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"If Forrest Gump was a crime fighter it would have been like this movie.

It had all the makings of a great flick which could have been on par with kickass. A delusional super hero, wasp grenades, and Woody Harrelson to boot. Sadly, the defendor, just didn't get there as a movie. It wasn't really a comedy and it was pretty sappy as a drama. I think if the script writer had dreamnt up a few more gadgets like the wasp grenade and gone after the kickass type angle this would have been a brilliant film. Among the few words of praise I can give to this movie go to Woody in that atleast he didn't go full retard. Some women may score this film a star or so higher depending on how well they enjoy the gratuitous shot of Woody's ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defendor - A psychological goofy movie","review":"The DVD arrived in the advertised condition with no marks, blemishes or skips.I'm sorry, but I felt this was nothing but a dumb attempt at trying to understand the psychotic mind, and far, far beneath Woody Harrelson's acting ability. A thoroughly rotten movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bomb of the year","review":"Being skeptical of the description and reviews of this movie we decided to rent instead of purchase it. About 30 minutes into the movie we turned it off. If there was a plot, we were unable to find it. Totally mindless viewing. We liked Zombieland with Woody, but this thing made no sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"superhero-by-night.com","review":"Before purchasing this DVD, let me warn you this movie is nothing like what the title suggests. There is less than 5 minutes of action and is more in the sleepy-boring-drama classification. After watching the first 45 minutes of the movie, I nearly fell asleep. It felt like two and a half hours had passed. Some parts of the dialogue was written as if trying to be \`cool' but turned out to be stupid and immature. As for Woody's acting it's not a far stretch for him to play a whack job. So, therefore, his acting was okay. Sandra Oh wasn't given much of a dialogue to work with, so I don't blame her that much. Kat Dennings, I did not see much of her films so I can't really judge her performance but her performance on Defendor was really bad. I would like to tell Peter to quit his day job but this is his day job! What a shame for the film industry.

Not your typical superhero-type film with a typical warm and fuzzy happy ending either, which I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pretty Blue","review":"Got these for wife as she likes \\"leverbacks\\".

The author appears to have made zero effort to research the background information (medical details, physics of nuclear bomb detection, computer security, etc.) so it all seems lame. It's not even well written. It is supposed to be a page-turner, but it seems like a chore to read. It is supposed to be a thriller, but after reading half, I really don't care what happens next.

Sure, the idea that Islamic extremist obtain nuclear warheads with the intent to detonate them in the U.S. is believable. As far as I'm concerned, the characters, the situations and the way the characters react to those situations is far from believable.

Of course, Jake Grafton along with his wife Callie, old friends Toad Tarkington and Tommy Carmellini, new friend Anna Modin, and others intervene to save the day.

The fact that it was written about the author's grandmother made it all the more moving for me. (I did always wonder what happened to her afterwards though).As I said I haven't read the English version so can't comment on the quality of the translation.

They made an effort to make it look like Rome, but far too many things were off. The true story of Gaius Julius Caesar's rise to power and his assasination will take SIX films, all of which, two and half to three hours a piece. This is truly a piece of crap.

However, if you're not such a historical purist, if you're in it strictly for the entertainment value, I think you'll really enjoy this film. Personally I think the historical critics so far have been unduly harsh with what is otherwise a very admirable production.Jeremy Sisto was excellent as Caesar, and was very ably supported by Christopher Walken (Cato), Richard Harris (Sulla) and Chris Noth (Pompey). The depiction of the siege of Alesia was very well done, in my opinion. There were quite a few emotionally gripping scenes, not the least of which is the climactic assassination in the Senate. If you don't get too hung up on the history, I think you'll agree that this movie is three hours well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheaper elsewhere","review":"i bought this phone brand new from FRYS.com.

Anyhow, mix enough product that you will only use for that day, since it is made from rotten eggs, it will form clumps of mold as it sits in your pressure-sprayer.

I bought this book mainly so I could get free shipping on another book, and I wish I had just paid shipping. The essays presented here are terrible, and a similar essay would score in the 3-4 range on the GRE (out of a possible 6, and only 32% of test takers score below 4). Don't fool yourself into thinking that the essays are real or teach you anything. Save your effort and see the free downloadable files on the GRE website (gre.org) with REAL responses and criticism for each score level.

The examples of essays are basic enough so a person can add his own style and that's just what I did to get a 5.There is no such thing as a stylistic method to get a 6 because the GRE essays are graded on the soundness and the logical flow of an essay.Don't let some idiot know-it-all tell you that the test is graded on style or cleverness. It is graded on the pieces coming together as a whole. The website even says that.This book is where I got my best teaching. Believe me, I got about 6 books total.

However, they can be a bit overwhelming, as they tell you all the possible senarios that can go wrong, and also pack information about the baby's first year(s) into one book. This book, on the other hand, is a practical read to prepare for your first few months as a parent. The authors keep it simple, and only expand on common health concerns (such as collic). Instead of scaring you with all the other worst-case health scenarios, they just tell you what symptoms warrant a doctors call.

My MIL gave it to me and at first glance, I thought it was too basic and not likely to be that helpful. To my surprise, I read it the week before I was due and was so glad I did. It really goes over all of the basics and tells you what you don't know, but also, it was oddly reassuring to me because I discovered all that I did know! I now give it as a gift.

First off, this book only has 25 pages and is more a pamphlet/booklet than a book at all. The dimensions are small - this staple-bound pamphlet is smaller than your average day planner.Ok, so I think the saying goes something like \\"it's not the size of the package, it's how you use it\\", but when it comes to this book, they've not used what little space there is well at all. It is certainly not chock full of ideas and what die cut patterns are shown are nothing more than what you can buy at your local craft store for $1.00. They're your average, every day die cut designs - nothing to get crazy about and waste your $6.00 on.If you're a scrapbooker, you must have a little creativity in your blood. Think about it, there's probably something a lot better you can do with your hard earned $6.00, but don't spend it on this one!! There are plenty of other books out there on the subject that may be more expensive, but are worth their weight in gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could relate","review":"I loved this movie.

When the author runs up against the wall of lack of evidence he just simply states \\"and this is where science runs out so we need to turn to religion\\". Instead of posing questions about what needs to come and pondering on the advancements that will be achieved by science he just simply states \\"God made you this way now be happy with it.\\" You wouldn't consult a 2,000 year old medical journal for proper surgical procedures, so why would you try to apply the workings of 2,000 year old brains who thought the earth was flat and rain could be obtained with animal sacrifices and dances to modern brains?

After persuasively describing in considerable detail what the problems are, Brian Czech offers practical and articulate ideas on how to stop the \\"runaway train\\" of chasing after too much growth without stagnating the economy, or causing painful recessions. It is the cautionary words of Shoveling Fuel For A Runaway Train that make this treatise stand out and demand to be read by governmental policy makers and the entire taxpaying population."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOU RUKYSER - READ THIS BOOK!!","review":"Brian Czech is one of the few people who can step back from all the hype of our capitalist economy and look at where we've been and where we are going.

Beyond simply pointing out the problem, though, he goes on to offer a solution...Lou Rukyser should not be the only one to read this book.

The lids do fit tightly as previous reviewers suggested, but in my opinion this is the best way to prevent leaks. The best way I've found to get the lids on and secure is to start at one side of the lid and press down with both hands as you move around to the other side (one had pressing on each side of the lid).One caution - Be aware that the white plastic on the lids is easily stained by tomato based sauces.

There is enough good information to warrant a second star, but Mr. Bowman's attempts to place the Heads' music into a broader cultural context are laughable at best. I agree with the reviewers who found that there is far too much clutter about non-TH art, like Twyla Tharp.

This is a great book -- especially with all the details about the era. I am a Talking Heads fan from way back and thought this book was fun and informative. It gives hundreds of details of how the four Heads created their music while also giving a sociological/historical grounding to their records that I had never thought of before. A \\"must read\\" for fans of any musician/artist who was around during this time and an absolute requirement for Heads fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is definitely NOT the place!!","review":"This book is NOT worth your money, you better spent it to buy the bands music, after all thats why we loved the Talking Heads for!

Unfortunately I don't know what to trust in terms of what is accurate or otherwise. How much trouble would it have been to fact check if James Brown actually sang \\"More Bounce to the Ounce\\" as Bowman writes? (He didn't. The great funk band Zapp recorded the tune.)I also would have preferred a little more balance in Bowman's reporting. His bashing of Tina Weymouth puts the integrity of his story into question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Come to Life","review":"I found this book too much about the author, with too much name-dropping,and not enough well-researched story of early radio and television.

Find someone who owns one first and try it on your computer and see if it works first.

This game is very promising even though the graphics leave something to be desired. It is alot of fun though when it doesn't crash every 10 minutes. The strategic lvl is a little tedious but still fun. The tactical lvl is very cool using and controlling ships. Allies expansion will make this even more fun since you will be able to control the big guns on ships, and have location based damage. I will be getting it and seeing if it is anymore stable.

This makes me very leary of Pacific Storm Allies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right idea, but...","review":"PACIFIC STORM is a great idea. A RTS game combined with an arcade-like battle sequence, along the same lines as the TOTAL WAR titles. However, unless you have a relatively new system with lots of graphics power and memory, it's going to crash a lot. And sometimes the battles aren't very realistic (I once fought four aircraft carriers, none of which had any aircraft on them).

After just a few months I began to come out of a fog that I thought I was doomed to be in for the rest of my life. I practiced over and over the techniques given, and really spent a lot of time and thought while working in the book. For years, I carried it with me everywhere - just in case I needed it. Don't rush through it - it's going to take some time and hard work to feel sane again. But I assure you that you will get there!

The writer wears many hats for this book; and sometimes it makes the book nothing other than an interesting look at history and music. Unfortunately, there are many historical and cultural aspects neglected (probably because that would make this the longest book in the world) and it leaves something to be desired.I wouldn't call this book negligent if you are one who likes reading books on this topic. My guess is the writer is counting on this. Debates over who originated what, where, and for whom seems to be the secondary concern. Talking about the process of innovation seems to be the primary interest of the author. Collaborative forces at work to achieve separate goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 Great Guitarists","review":"This book is lousy. I think I paid about [...]for a used copy and have considered asking for a refund. There are MANY factual errors about the guitarists in this book, especially places of birth and death. If you're going to publish a book on great guitarists, at least get that much correct...it's not difficult to find out a celebrity's birthplace and place of death, and it really does a disservice to their memory by listing it incorrectly. This book is a great example of a guy wanting to make a quick buck by writing about a subject he knows little if nothing about. After reading just a few articles, I knew this guy was a phony.

According to this clown Jerry Garcia is GOD and Eddie Van Halen is a joke. I'm not making that up. He says Jerry Garcia is GOD. He knocks almost every popular guitar player since 1973. For example, I don't care if you like AC/DC or not, Angus Young's best work was not \\"Ride On\\" off Dirty Deeds. Personally I like the song but it is in no way his best effort. Remember that little album Back in Black? He manages to list at least five hundred guitar players that NOBODY has ever heard of. I could go on and on. This book is as bad as it gets.

Even when it came to Jeff Beck saying the reason he left the Yardbirds was due to a dispute with Jimmy Page, NOT!!! Beck was ousted for being a nutjob, which is what makes him one of the best guitarists ever.

Each woman is described biographically, then within context historically and according to her place within scripture.

His crown of sonnets, although not adhering to a strict crown of sonnet structure, is stunning in its raw description of a father's horror of being falsely accused of child abuse. All sensitive readers will be deeply touched by his chronicle of the emotional trauma the child abuse charge created for him, and finally his ecstasy of being exonerated from all charges.

The times were so much different than today, at least in the western world.This work does get a bit bogged down in Miss Bell's personal life, but does a decent job of relating her life and times to the happenings in the yet-to-be-established Iraq.For a first time study of the region, it's as good a read as any. I too, as others have mentioed, would have liked a bit more solid (meaty) history.Her approach, learning, through personal interaction, tribe histories and notables, is still very applicable (and perhaps missing) today."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still about oil","review":"When Gertrude Bell was helping draw the lines for what is now present day Iraq it was about oil then and it's about oil now. Anyone wanting to understand a little bit about the culture of the Middle East should read this. A very interesting book about the female \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"We know Whose side you're on!","review":"I liked this book, having never before read about this remarkable woman, until page 200. That's when the author begins to infuse her pro-Zionist views into the \\"history\\". I found it very disappointing that she had to insert boring trite statements like \\"Indeed, Israel became the only democratic state in the Middle East.\\" (p. 203). She talks a lot about early Zionists but makes no reference at all to Palestinians or the Palestinian people, inferring to the beginner student of Middle East Studies, that they did not exist. The book was intended to be about Gertrude and her home in Iraq/Mesopotamia. It disgresses greatly to achieve the author's agenda. I appreciated Wallach's attempts to bring Bell to life but mistrusted, in the end, all of her historical data because of her lack of objectivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"There are plenty of more interesting people to read about. No mention is made that during the time of Bell's travels through Turkey the Armenians were being wiped out by the Turks. I found her to be pretentious and a spoiled girl who turned to daddy every time she ran out of money and wanted to be back in her \\"beloved\\" desert. If she was so wonderful at politics, how come those areas of the world are still at war?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great woman","review":"This book is a great read--helps to understand the tribal origins in the Middle East and presents an amazing woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needed an editor","review":"I began to read this book with anticipation. I was a put off by the sort of breathless tone more worthy of a bad romance novel.About twenty pages in, I was surprised by a reference to the Ottoman Empire expanding since the 13th century from Constantinople. The Ottoman Empire expanded around Constantinople from the 13th to the 15th centuries, until they finally took the city in 1453, and promptly renamed it Istanbul.I soldiered on, until I was informed that British were fighting Germans in the Boer war in the late 1890s. The Boers, descended from Dutch colonists, would have been surprised to hear themselves described as German.These two mistakes, obvious to anyone with a decent knowledge of history, ruined my willingness to accept anything else in the book. I put down the book, never knowing if Miss Bell was able to overcome her lost early love.Gertrude Bell's life seems to be worthy of a good biography. This isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Overall I found the book a good introduction to the events that led to the creation of the Middle East as we know it today. The first part of the book is interesting from a strictly biographical angle on Gertrude Bell. Though I found the profuse gushing by the author about \\"almighty England\\" and on Gertrude Bell and her family rather annoying.The second part deals with the political intrigues which eventually created the Modern-day Middle Eastern States. From a historical perspective it really helped me to better understand the very complicated politics of that area."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing woman whose life deserves to be remembered","review":"A woman that marked in the desert sand the borders of what is today's Iraq. A fascinating life of the woman who was the mentor to Lawrence of Arabia, and should have been the star in a movie about her life. Gertrude Bell, born to British upper class, was an Arabist comfortable in the palaces of British royalty and the tents of Arab sheiks.Yet, in her personal life she remained a Victorian-era virgin. Responsible for setting events in the middle-east in motion, Gertrude Bell is an example of women making history, yet, in the telling of their role, are being pushed to the periphery of time and place.Talia Carner, author,Puppet Child and China Doll"},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept but hard going","review":"This was my book group's pick and I could hardly wait to get it and read it; it sounded timely and fascinating. Unfortunately, it was like reading a textbook, interesting but WAY too dry. No one in our group finished it and even the brilliant woman who loves a book best if no one else understands it, didn't want to read it. I only stuck with it to page 50. Maybe it gets better as you get the author's rhythm, like Dickens. As much as I would like, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Adventure","review":"Wallach's biography of Gertrude Bell is an excellent read. It offers an intimate picture of Bell, the woman, the intellectual, the adventurer, and the political strategist. Desert Queen offers an outstanding historical and political background of the Post-WWI period of Iraq and the Middle East revealing that the political issues and concerns that confront Iraq today are similar to those which confronted Mesopotamia and Iraq in the early 20th c.

The history of British rule and their failure to solve the Tribal problems at the establishment of Iraq as a new State after the breakup of the Otterman Empire. This only proves that History can repeat itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Life","review":"I first became interested in Gertrude Bell while on a tour of Jordan, visiting a museum which included a number of her wonderful photographs. I was extremely amazed that a woman had such access to Arabian men at that time, and admired her adventures and curiousity. Even in this day, her exploits are unheard of, for a female. I was thrilled to come across this book, quite by accident, a few months after I heard of her. After reading the book, I am even more amazed by her life, and although it bogs down a bit at times, I still believe Grace Bell is one of the most intriguing females of this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Queen","review":"Excellent book.

So far he has managed to play with it for less than 2 minutes before the wings promptly fell off. So far he received alot of Hasbro Star Wars toys (transformers and action figures) and they have all been complete junk. None of them have held together for more than a few hours.

We read it to our three year old and it holds his interest due to the vivid pictures of cowboys & cowgirls, horses, cattle, lassos, snakes, etc. It has the counting in Spanish and English on each page, i.e. una luna or one moon. Then, following the section on counting (one page for each number), it uses repetition to expand on the counting while creating a short, easy to understand storyline. I like that it's bilingual, easy, nice illustrations, and represents the \\"cowboy\\" life with both cowboys and cowgirls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be ready to be ripped off","review":"This CD has exactly one, count 'em one, interview, so the title alone (\\"Interviews\\") is extremely misleading to say the least. Zappa was an amazing musician and insightful person about society in general, but only a tiny glimpse of this is seen in the single 26 minute interview on this disc. Also, there is no date as to when the interview was conducted, (some time around 1983 just after the Valley Girl single became a hit) or who was doing the interview (several voices are heard asking questions). It seems to have been recorded with a hand held microphone, as the volume from the interviewers jumps all over the place.

Worst: nobody here in Brazil ever thought it would be possible. It is against all evidence. He was a synonym for \\"new\\" in Brazilian music since his first song in the 60's. But it happened. His \\"Livro\\" (\\"Book\\") is a strange mixture of lyrical efforts, \\"cool jazz\\" and standardized rhythms. His sincere defense of Bahian popular music of the 90's is a prove that his greatest problem is not having left inheritors of his gift and his achievement in Brazil. The sonority of \\"Alexandre\\", for instance is characteristic of Axé Music: the musically poor but rhythmically apelative music of contemporary Bahia. Since his musical sons proved to be mere promises he has to invent new ones. He has to prove that his legacy is not going to perish, that he invented Axe Music and it is worth his powers.

Here in Brasil he has a loyal following, but he is not considered a genius by everybody. I think that Caetano is a fine singer and a good composer, but he surely can make horrible music, like the music on this CD. It's simply horrible. Caetano is trying to sound hip and up-to-date, but his ideas and his music are old for Brasil and for the rest of the world. It's ironic to see how americans and the people of other countries misjudge Caetano, seeing him as an inovative artist. This CD is a complete mistake. You have to be brazilian to understand this mistake. Sorry, guys. If you want to hear the REAL brazilian music, begin with PAULINHO DA VIOLA. He is the real genius, samba's greatest poet. You'll hear a brazilian master, not an old fart who's trying to convince people that he is cool and young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Livro - Caetano is back!","review":"While considered a musical genius in Brazil, Gaetano has often underwhelmed me as a non-native speaker of Portuguese with some of his previous albums. I get the impression that his exceptional skills as a lyricist in Portuguese have compensated for his spottier successes as a tune-smith.This CD is refreshingly different. Without understanding a word of Portuguese, a non-Portuguese speaking listener can still appreciate the sheer musicality of song after song on \\"Livro\\". There is much less of the self-indulgent experimental (and frequently grating) music on, for example, his album \\"Estrangeiro\\". \\"Livro\\" is smooth, tuneful, listenable - with more of the slow ballades that Gaetano's voice excels at. A great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic","review":"The best song on this album must be \\"Manhattan\\", which I cannot hear without being deeply affected after the September 11 tragedy. Yet I'm also partial to the rendition of \\"Na Baixa do Sapateiro\\", with the horn section outlining Joan Gilberto's original in a manner that is peculiarly eerie and disembodied, as if to tell that there is no way we can capture the past however we try (which is the theme of the song itself). Other than these two the material is somewhat uneven, like I find in most of Caetano's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The thinking woman's Ricky Martin\\"","review":"OK I stole that line from a newspaper article but to paraphrase my friend Mario \\"(titles)belong to those who need them.\\" I am fascinated by Caetano Veloso-music is just part of his complex artistry-but for our purposes i'll stick to that. His voice is all palm trees and sandy beaches, sweet and supple as that of a 25 year old. Most of the songs have a seductive, hypnotic feel-if you get too close, you will fall in-but you know you want to! It should also come with a warning label: you cannot listen to this and not dance! So draw the blinds if need be...2-3 of the songs are (to me) very weird-sounding:repetitive, chanting, falsetto, but i will ascribe that to my lack of familiarity with the culture and the material. I know Caetano Veloso falls in the new-to-me catagory but i think anyone who wants to be serenaded by a real master or have the neighbors wonder why you are samba-ing around the kitchen will love this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another bright moment","review":"Thank God for Caetano (and Gil).

Plus, I have been using Photoshop 4 Wow with Photoshop 5 program and it is very easy to adapt the techniques to Photoshop 5.0/5.5. So if you have Photoshop 4 Wow book, I would hold out until Photoshop 6 Wow and beyond is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, but maybe not for everybody","review":"First, if you own the Photoshop 4 Wow book, you'll probably don't want this one (there's a lot of repetition from the 4, which I find excusable since a lot of Photoshop 5/5.5 is the same as in version 4).Second: even though it says on the back cover that it's for beginners up to advanced users, in my opinion the ones who'll benefit the most from it are the intermediate users - those who, without being Photoshop gurus, are already familiar with Photoshop (at least a little). I think this is a great book, with a lot of information, tips and tricks that will probably make using Photoshop a more enjoyable and fruitful experience for everybody, but almost certainly for intermediate users.However it would be even better if the CD included all the pictures, photos and presets necessary for the book's projects/tutorials, instead of only some of them (that's why I didn't give it 5 stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful For many","review":"This book is very good for those who like to look at pictures. The only problems with this is that it dosent explain what its doing. A beginner I know read this book cover to cover and still new nothing about adobe photoshop, I am a self taught user of photoshop and i wanted to know more, this book seemed to skip important bits and i got lost. Not for the basic user, not for the intermediate user!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get me something better","review":"Unless you have an idea of what photoshop is all about, then go for some books that emphasize more on the basics. The first two chapters were a complete chore. My recommendations, go get something better, like the classroom in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW this book is confusing","review":"This book is confusing and not for the beginer, the content keep jumping back and forth, it is hard to catch. have to return the book. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rules!","review":"Look all you people that wrote other reviews. Have you ever tried to write a book before? No! Half of you can't even speak english. Anyway, this book is brilliant, its THE most informative book I have seen, and as for Mr-I'm-soo-advanced, email me with links to your 'great' work and let me see why this brilliant book isn't applicable to your superior Photoshop skills. =P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors and omisions...probelsm with this book","review":"It seems that the auhors really cut corners in this Wow series book. As a loyal and long time owner of the PS Wow series, I was disappointed with this book. For one thing some of the action scripts do not work. Try the carved text as just one example. Second, the authors still have not yet deigned a book that is TRULY cross platform. If you are a Windows user, you will be dissapointed with this book. All efforts to resolve problems with the publisher have been futile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto Ditto","review":"This is like buying a new Elton John record. Same old tired act. I've owned the previous Wow books and everytime am hoping for new material and actual sample files on the CD to use for the book tutorials. I think they just put a new cover on it and sent it out of the printer's shop. I wonder what the big wait was for, since the publicatin date was pushed up so many times. It couldn't have been new material added."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down&#65533;","review":"I have to agree with the last reader. I had placed my order last March and was eagerly waiting what I thought was going to be another excellent addition to the WOW! series...I was sorely disappointed. I really love the series but like the last reader said wait until Photoshop 6 WOW! comes out with, hopefully after enough negative feedback, some new material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long wait, but chock full of great tips!","review":"I first ordered this book close to a year ago, so it was fantastic that it was finally printed and distributed! The book seems to ramble on a bit much concerning filters that come with Photoshoshop, as well as 3rd party filters, but an example of each filter is illustrated, providing some great inspiration for cool effects. All in all, the book was only slightly worth the wait, but is extremely resourceful, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not for basic instruction, it's for playing...","review":"The WOW! book is marvelous, but it cannot be read. It is like a treasure chest of hundreds of special effects and possibilities. I find it works best in the magazine rack for perusing during that regular personal time we can't mention here. It's too complicated for reference. It's just great fun --"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Photoshop 5.0/5.5 Wow! Book","review":"I am not new to Photoshop 5. I believe in that old saying,\\"you can never learn enough or be smart enough to learn even one new thing everyday\\". A lot of the material in this book was old hat to me, but I did learn more than one new trick! I would HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone that wants to learn about Photoshop 5/5.5. This book has super tutorials and the pictures give a wonderful guide for, step by step, instructions. The CD rom could have been better, I will agree on that one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Milking Digital Artists","review":"I have been a fan of the WOW books, having the painter WOW, Web design WOW, and photoshop 4 WOW. I must say this recent Photoshop 5/5.5 WOW book is nothing but daylight robbery. If you're going to write a new version of a book, put some * NEW * content in it, or tell your readers this is just an update covering new features of a product.Seriously, beginners would be better with the photoshop classroom in a book, and the experienced photoshop'ers may like Photoshop Studio secrets (a personal favorite)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful if you are already familiar with Photoshop","review":"I really like the Wow book series for Photoshop and Illustrator. However I am quite disappointed at this one. Some examples are not new at all. This one is not useful to those who have the verions 3 and 4 Wow books. If you are new to Photoshop, you may find this book useful.I recommend beginners to read \\"Classroom in a book\\" and \\"Photoshop Artistry\\" for the advance users. Then buy a used book for version probably at half price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper... and my money!","review":"I was sorely disappointed by the \\"NEW\\" Photoshop 5.0/5.5 Wow! book and will be returing it to the retailer tomorrow. Like a recent reviewer stated... this book is nothing more than an attempt by the author/publisher to milk the growing popularity of Photoshop by addressing the VERY slight differences between PS 4.0 and PS 5/5.5, putting a new cover on it and trying to pass it off as new material. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE PS 4.0 WOW! STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"This is my first WOW book and I'm sorry to say I am greatly disappointed. I bought this book to learn more about Photoshop and I found a few good tips and tricks...But several images on the companion disk are mis-labeled or non-existent. I would like to go through each exercise to learn how things are done and if they don't give you the original images as a starting point, what good is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely user friendly!","review":"This book is very easy to use for someone with no web-page design experience. It walks you step by step through the process of design either from scratch or by templates. Pictures match to your screen images to help you follow the text and there are quizzes at the end of chapters for review. Although it's set-up for classroom instruction, almost anyone could use it independently!"},{"rating":"2","title":"C.S. Lewis's amusing, thoughtful letters to children","review":"These eminently readable letters to children over the last 19 years of Lewis's life cover a surprisingly wide variety of topics (many being responses to thoughtful questions from the children who wrote to him). Most of the children began corresponding with Lewis after reading books from his CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series, and Lewis's responses are neither patronizing nor somber, but rather sincere and often humorous. Readers from gradeschool to adulthood levels will enjoy wandering through this lively correspondence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book answered many of my questions about the Chronicals of Narnia. As I read this book, I was amazed at how Lewis corresponded with people. He responded to every one of the letters he recieved. I could never do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"adding to the collection","review":"I am collecting all of his video travel documentary series but this one and his Hemmingway disk are probably the least two I'd recommend. Still good but not as good as all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sahara","review":"An excellent series. I would have given it 5 stars, but it didn't quite measure up to the very high standard set by Around the World in 80 Days. I have already pre-ordered Michael Palin - Pole to Pole and am eagerly awaiting its delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Fact should be re-checked by the \\"History Channel\\"","review":"Like most History Channel documentaries, this one doesn't impress one bit. I felt like watching a cheap documentary with historical lies repeated over and over.Luckily, I didn't buy it. and I urge those who want to learn real historical facts about the sahara to avoid this DVD set."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad description","review":"The cable was not a 1 ft figure eight plug as advertised. It was a 6 ft mickey mouse. I would have returned it but the seller's return policy was such that my refund did not include shipping in either direction and there was a 20% restocking fee. Altogether I was paying about $12 for nothing. Next time I'll buy straight from the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over 1FT","review":"Not sure why this item is listed as being 1FT. By my measure, it's about 20\\", and it's labeled as being a 8121-0889, which google tells me is a 0.5M (1.6') cable for some HP product.Cable quality seems fine, but it's a good 60% longer than advertised. At the very least, the description should be changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, 5.99 shipping?","review":"The product itself is nice and very useful, but why charge $0.45 for the product and then $5.99 for the shipping. If you add two to your cart it's 11.98 for shipping... guess these tiny cables weigh too much to all fit into one shipping envelope. Wait no the seller is just deceiving and knows that a $0.45 price tag will attract more customers to look."},{"rating":"2","title":"longer than 1 foot","review":"I got two of these, and they both work fine so far.They are longer than 12 inches. Measuring just the wire between the connectors, one is about 12.75\\" and the other is 12.5\\". Tip-to-tip, including the connectors, they're more like 17\\". I actually would have preferred them to be shorter than advertised, but I can't find anything shorter (except the adapters that involve no cord at all).The wire itself doesn't inspire much confidence, since it looks almost exactly like a phone cord. From markings on the insulation, though, I think the wire gauge is somewhere between 18 and 19 AWG, which I think should be fine, especially at such a short length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Strapless Bra!","review":"Best strapless bra ever!. I am large breasted and have never been able to find a strapless bra that actually holds me up and I have tried them all. I have even worn two at once. This bra is great! Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A no go.","review":"This bra is shaped oddly; it creates the pointy breast style of the 1950s. I did not like it at all. Also it is very significantly padded, and the top of the bra does not make for a smooth transition from bra to chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible--drastically inferior versions","review":"This is a shockingly terrible EP. This 'alternate' version of \\"Come Together\\" (for video/ airplay purposes) is toothless and has lame lyric changes--it sabotages the fact that it's a great song. The roughly 15-minute 2nd track is wholly aimless & awful--an all-time low point--does Jason seriously think this is good stuff? The \\"Broken Heart\\" versions here are unbearably lame as well. This EP, like the \\"Medication\\" EP before it, finds Jason offering drastically inferior versions of songs of which the album versions are brilliant, which is quite a strange & admittedly interesting phenomenon, however as far actual listening value of this EP is concerned, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not hard to swallow..","review":"the 15 minute Lone Swordsman remix of Come Together is pretty stony...worth five bucks? .......Yes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Several swings below par","review":"Spiritualized have scored a first: They have delivered a release that is not worth listening to. J. Spaceman's drunk/stoned visions have devolved from beautiful fever-dreams to the DTs. The opening track is *essential* to MTV-watchers and the second track is a must-have for David Lynch fans, but overall this CD is an embarrassment. Skip it and wait for the Albert Hall CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"More dry nights","review":"These pullups fit. They're very absorbant and are not as bulky as some. We're very pleased with our purchase and will continue to buy this brand. We've had more dry nights and less tears and for the mom's...less laundry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PSYHIC POWERS","review":"THIS MOVIE IS EXCELLENT THERE ARE LIKE 4 OR FIVE OF THEM AND THIS ONE ISN'T THE BEST BUT IT'S RIGHT UP THER"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful moment in Texas, trapped in time","review":"What a wonderful live set and a wonderful cd from the Velvet Underground. Rather good bootleg quality and sound, Volume 1 really shows the group in their element: live, and in a small setting. They even joke before the show actually begins about the way the Dallas Cowboys played the Eagles before their show, giving it even more of a close feel to it.This cd contains my favorite renditions of some classics: \\"Waiting for my man,\\" \\"Lisa Says,\\" \\"Femme Fatale,\\" \\"New Age,\\" \\"Begining to see the light,\\" and \\"Heroin.\\"The sleve of the cd even contains notes from Elliot Murphy talking about the history of the band and what he feels history will remember about the group.I don't have a lot of Velvet Underground, but what I have I like. This is definately in my top 15 cds in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"vu in full kick-arse mode","review":"Wow, for a low-fi audience recording( Hint: Turn the volume up you hear less his and more music),despite the sonic limitations (or despite the \\"amputations\\" as Lou states in the song Rock n Roll), there a lot of \\"fire\\" in these performances. i'd definitely say this is the definitive live document of the legendary proto-punkers. btw, the live version of Sweet Jane on here squashes any other version recorded by anybody, including the original studio version. also, the version of New Age is really good on here too. This is essential Velvet Underground and you will wonder how these guys didn't make it real big in the sixties and seventies."},{"rating":"2","title":"VU IS ALIVE & WELL","review":"One of VU's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The VU at their most entertaining","review":"Velvet Underground/ Live 1969 - Volume One: As interesting as the studio albums are, the Velvet Underground are at their most entertaining in this live CD (and its \\"Live 1969 Volume 2\\" sister CD). For the novice, these live CD's are the place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have Velvet Underground","review":"If forced to choose, I would pick \\"live w/ lou reed\\" volumes 1 and 2 over their mighty, mighty box set. The perfect introduction to the Velvet Underground. Perfect renditions of Ocean, Sweet Jane, etc., etc. My personal pick for best live album recorded ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live album","review":"What can I say about a record I've listened to perhaps ten million times. Absolutely my favorite Velvet Underground disc. Everyone I lend this one to returns it and says \\"man, that was great! Didn't think I'd like it but I did!\\" Don't judge an album by its cover. (Vol. 2 also rules.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick up both volumes","review":"I own the album on vinyl (2 LPs, discs 1 and 2), and I must say it's the one VU collection I would take with me if stranded on a desert island. It's not as artsy as VU and Nico or White Light/White Heat, though it't not as \\"dry\\" as loaded. This is a good introduction the VU for new listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"What its all about","review":"Sure, John Cale is gone and the wall of sound that easily set vu apart from everyone else is gone, and he is sorely missed, but without him they are still the best band, and although i reccomend all three of the three vu live stuff, (maxs, bootleg, this one) this one has the best sound quality and is my personal favorite, the best live cd ever in my opinion and the reason the vu changed history shines possibly brighter here than anywhere else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Also nessecary.","review":"A touch less restrained than volume two. \\"Sweet Jane,\\" \\"Rock and Roll,\\" \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"New Age\\" sound great. I wish I'd been there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wished I was in Dallas when this show went on.","review":"This was a rather good night for a concert, and the Underground didn't let anyone down. The first song I heard from this album was \\"New Age\\". Different lyrics and sound than what I heard on \\"Loaded\\", and this is by far the better version. Other good stuff on here \\"Lisa Says\\" which fuses this version with the one on his 1972 solo debut, \\"We're going to have a real good time together\\" from the infamous lost album, \\"Beginning To See The Light\\" is actually better on here than on their studio album, and of course \\"White Light White Heat\\" is the last of one of these highlights on this album. As I said they never sounded better in concert than on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"the cover is the best part","review":"No, no, that's totally unfair. I didn't really give this album a listen until recently and I was surprised that I hadn't given it more time before. If you've heard \\"Live at Max's Kansas City\\" and are expecting more of the same, then you're in for a surprise. Caught on a rare excursion outside of New York, The post-Cale VU puts on a surprisingly good set of shows on \\"1969,\\" and what stands out most of all is Lou Reed's sense of humor. The between-song banter is pretty entertaining (though not on a par with \\"Live Take No Prisoners\\"). If you buy volume one you're sure to want volume two. A good document of a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest of all live albums.","review":"This is my personal favorite of ALL the Velvets' immortal discs -- the only problem is that this original double-album has been cut into two separate CDs when it ought to be packaged as one. The Lou Reed we see here is a far cry from the snarling beast he was to become; in his remarks between songs, he actually sounds as if he wants to be liked. And well he should -- what makes this live disc so unusual is that the Velvets were playing great rock and roll for a crowd that barely seemed awake. Glorious rave-ups that should end with cheers end with a few pitiful claps -- proof positive that this band would always be light-years ahead of its audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty but easily damaged!","review":"I had to purchase three of these lamps before I received one that was in good enough condition to hang. The first two had a lot of copper scraped off in areas and some of the delicate pieces were actually ripped in places. The first two I purchased through a local lighting company; the third one through Amazon.Be careful removing it from the box and hanging it...everytime you touch it, damage is likely to occur. It is, however, stunning when finally in place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"This thing has constant hum coming from the speakers, even when connected to an iPod nano. At high volume its poor quality shows well, with plenty of distortion and clipping. Clock and alarm are hard to setup. It doesn't control your iPod sound, which is annoying because you have to press the buttoms in the ipod in a incovenient position when docked.Not worth the price charged in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not just for kids","review":"For those of you who continuously state \\"if you are between the ages of 20 and 30...\\" up yours! That's about the age of my kids. But I, and a bunch of my friends, are huge fans of Chicken. In short, If you have a sense of humor and the desire to experience irreverent entertainment far above the level of the usual prime time fare, then this DVD is for you !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the title is hilarious!","review":"Robot Chicken is one of the shows not to be missed on Adult Swim. This show makes me pee my pants, it's so hilarious. Even the title is hilarious! And another thing is, there is a lack of traditional animation such as stop-motion compared to all the computer-animated stuff we have these days. Where else could you see Walt Disney feasting on Cuban children or The Wright Brothers in a wrestling match? Where else can you see the Peanuts gang being attacked by a monster or the Smurfs dealing with murder? There will never be a day where this show is not liked. And releasing Seson 1 only boosted it's popularity. As for the DVD, I'm pretty much satisfied with all the special features and the rest of the episodes, but my only problem was the Teen Titans and Beavis and Butthead being cut out of the episode, Vegetable Funfest. Other than that, this show's got my five stars. Congratulations to the creators, they've created a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, life after MST3K","review":"I just wanted to write this review because the only review of this show is actually wrong. The show isn't claymation, it's stop motion action figures. The orgins of this show actually stem from two things: the mad scientist scenario is an homage to MST3K and the actual programs are an extension of a feature titled \\"Twisted Toyfare Theater\\" in a magazine entitled Toyfare. Okay, now that I have clarified these miscrepancies, on to an actual review. The shows aren't exactly peabody award winners, but if you're like me and grew up in the 70's and 80's you'll get a good chuckle out of seeing your favorite action figures in hilarious and sometimes compromising positions. My main problem with the show was that the episodes are only 13 minutes long. Something like this definitely needs to be upgraded to a half hour at least. If you're a fan of Family Guy and it's ilk, give this show a good look, but if you are easily offended, steer clear. It's definitely not a kid's show."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"This set is not uncensored (and in fact bleeps the word \\"ass\\" out of the commentary). Only 3 of the 12 episodes of Sweet J are on the DVD, and the entire Teen Titans segment from Vegetable Funfest and the Christmas episode were cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute mind numbing brillance.","review":"Robot Chicken is very clever, and perfect for anyone with ADD. Short sketches involving popculture refferences of the last 20 years, it's like a more extreme and sped up SNL on drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny","review":"so the opening sequence is kind of creepy, but the show is hilarious. watch the star wars eps as well. really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the Robot Chicken DVD!","review":"Before you whatch the show and just look at these reivews,whatch it on cartoon network at night on sundays 11:30-11:15 tuesdays at 11:00-11:30 and thursdays at,12:00-12:15."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the release the fans Expected!","review":"First of all....in the episode \\"Nutcracker Sweet\\" in the \\"Robo-Served\\" Skit the music has been changed (must be due to licensing) all the episodes are NOT uncensored or uncut and there is not Christmas Episode included! - A SERIOUS DISSAPOINTMENT for Robot Chicken fans I was a fan of the show but after this little stunt I am thinking twice about season 2 and beyond!.... if these details don't bother you then by all means you must aquire this release since it does have most the episodes and decent special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"da robot chicken","review":"after watching this Seth has jumped into a new level of comedy with me almost genius, almost."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROBOT CHICKEN ROCKS","review":"I GOT THIS FOR MY MAN FOR CHRISTMAS BECAUSE WE LOVE ROBOT CHICKEN AND MOST OF THE SHOWS ON ADULT SWIM.

Now you don't have to buy this dvd.You might like this DVD if:Getting hit in the balls is super hilarious.Farting is pretty funny.It makes you laugh when a celebrity is referenced in the same skit as an 80's cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenious animation resources, hilarious spoofing scripts","review":"A real jewel in the adult animation sub-genre, Robot Chicken is the result of a very clever utilization of old toys as the raw material for frame-by-frame animation shooting, together with snappy, irreverent, sometimes crude, always hilarious and ingenious, scripts spoofing pop culture. The fast paced short scene format (anywhere from 3 seconds to no more than 2 minutes) makes for most dynamic entertainment. If like me, you grew up in the 80's/90's and you ever enjoyed Mad-magazine-like satire, your abs will be aching for hours from laughing so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's insane... sick... twisted... IT'S FANTASTIC!","review":"This is great! This is the best thing I've seen Cartoon Network do. Seth Green is a warped genius. This is madness in it's purest form.Robot Chicken is a sketch show that uses action figures and various dolls to act out scenes in stop motion animation. It's only fifteen minutes long and only airs once a week but it's great fun. It's so completely random that you have no idea what's going to happen next. Nothing is sacred. Adult Swim has a real gem with this one.This show is fun. It's like watching a mad man play with his old childhood toys. You can't help but look as you see Seth Green's sick imagination unfold bizarre and comedic situations for several famous characters with their action figure counter parts. Various celebrities lend their voices. I hope this show lasts a good long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont get pissed!","review":"Dont get all pissed because the christmas episode is not in because the Dragon Ball Z chritmas is in season2,I know that because i saw it in anather episode part of season2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I've seen many of this shows episodes simply because I love Adult Swim overall. I have to say that of all the comedy shows on Adult Swim I find all of them at least slightly amusing except this one. You can say I don't get it, but I love other shows that some people think are awful (Tim and Eric). Every joke in this show is predictable. I've tried to look deeper into the jokes to see if I'm missing something but I don't think so. Seth Green is not funny. This show is just plain awful. The writing (and voice acting) is what makes it so bad. It's like I know what is coming in every scene before it happens, and when it does happen it happens in the most unfunny way possible. How did Seth Green ever become famous?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An honorable but desperate attempt at comedy.","review":"I admire what Seth and company are trying to do with this show but at times it just reeks of desperation to get any kind of a laugh out of you. You may get one quality skit in its 11 minute time span. The show is getting better with every season but this first season shows that they didn't quite figure out what they were trying to do.Their are some inspired skits but not enough to warrant a purchase for this other wise sub par adult swim show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Offensive and an Insult to Movies and TV Shows","review":"This show is not funny. It is disgusting, revolting and very offensive. If you're a \\"James Cameron's Titanic\\" fan, you might want to think about how disgusting it is when you mix it with a show like \\"Robot Chicken.\\" I was watching this trash, basically waiting for \\"Cartoon Network\\" to come back on. When an episode of this first started, I was shocked to find that it was making a mockery of \\"Titanic,\\" one of my all-time favorite movies. Let me ask you this. How would YOU feel if YOUR favorite movies or TV shows were made fun of? That is the same way that I feel about this show.Let's hope something like this doesn't ever happen again. Even if you see it coming, you never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I loved the show since the first episode; so of course I bought the dvd, but little did i know that basically I could have just recorded the episodes that came on tv beacause its exactly the same as the one on the dvd!!!

I began watching the show just because it came on after Family Guy. It's now become one of my favorites. I love the parodies of the old cartoons like the Jetsons, Smurfs, and Flintstones to name a few. Hope there's more of that in the upcoming season. My only knock on this DVD is having to go through the intro on every episode, kinda wish they would've bypassed that it gets old after the first 2 or 3 episodes. The deleted scenes should've been deleted so not too much there. Every DVD advertises \\"packed with deleted scenes.\\" Well it's deleted for a reason, because it wasn't good enough to make the cut. Overall I enjoyed the collection and am looking forward to the 2nd season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemonhead Interview","review":"I recommend this interview to all those true Lemondheads fans out there. If you're as obsessed with the Lemonheads and especially Evan Dando(lead vocalist), as I am, I suggest picking up this cd. It shows some of the views and opinions the members of the band have. After hearing the interview, another dimension is added to their music. If the Lemonheads intrest you, their 1998 release, 'The Best of the Lemonheads-The Atlantic Years' is an excellent cd to pick up. It contains hit tracks such as 'Mrs. Robinson' and 'It's a Shame About Ray'. This interview is a great addition to any Lemonheads fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Epic Experimental Metal.","review":"This ep (approx 28 minutes running time) is exactly what I had hoped it would be. I am unfamiliar with Justin's work, although I am a big fan of most the bands on Hydrahead (Isis, Pelican etc). Firstly, the four songs combine to create a great piece of music, crushingly heavy but beautiful guitars, a mixture of up-tempo and doomy drum patterns, and almost pop-esque vocals. Melodic and ambient interludes interwoven with industrial rhythyms and swirling lead guitars - all capped off with Justin's fantastic vocals.Buy, and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product...","review":"So hard to mount.

First it is in the typical Konnemann Editions format,big and top quality paper. It has many illustrations, many of full page size, that are of top quality. Also, at its price the book is a bargain.If you are interested in Early Renaissance arts, you will find this book a valuable addition to your library and because of its very good price it makes for a perfect gift. However, it must be mentioned that the book features mostly Durer's superb woodcuts and his paintings to a lesser degree. I like woodcuts more than paintings, your call though.In addition all of the texts are very well writen without errors, by experts of the field,with many details that do not tire the reader. A last thing, taking only in consideration the book's price and its format and image-paper quality, it makes all other various editions of Durer's work look inferior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emporio Armanj","review":"I bought this product and it seems to have no scent.

Homunculus was the second book in a trilogy. Blaylock's cardinal sin was that he did not create a novel in Homunculus that could stand alone. That is, in order to understand the characters' machinations one had to have read the first book in the trilogy. Bad boy! As an example of what can be done, one can read the second book in Stieg Larsson's Millenium Trilogy (The Girl who Played with Fire) without having read book one (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and enjoy a completely satisfying literary experience. Not quite half way through Homunculus I gave up in disgust and tossed it.

While Schramm may wax on about the history and lore of the beverage at first, he does eventually get down to business and provides a wealth of information.

I've looked at a number of bride-groom cookbooks. So far, my favorite is NOT ON LOVE ALONE by Jessie Carry Saunders. It has a friendlier, more intimate tone than any of the others -- it feels like something written by a bride for other brides.It has a friendly, appealing feel, like the author is in the kitchen with you, telling you stories about the recipes as she teaches you how to make them. Also, it's just a higher quality book -- it's a hard cover, the pages are nice and thick, and the watercolor illustrations on every page make the book seem like something you could display on your coffee table as easily as you could use it in the kitchen.If you want a good cookbook, any of the various newlywed cookbooks will work fine.

I love this cookbook - it is my go-to when I want to try a new recipe, and most new ones I try end up making it into my normal rotation!

It not only has delicious entrees, sides, and desserts, but it also has great recipes for basics like pesto, mayonnaise, and chicken stock. The book is written by two southern twin sisters and you can tell that a lot of heart and time went into this beautiful compilation of recipes. It is now my go-to gift for any wedding shower.

I had visions of ordering them as Christmas presents for my entire family later this year. Sadly, I doubt I'll get much use out of it.I'm experienced with indoor grilling, and I followed the directions to the letter. I turned my exhaust fan on high, placing the grill directly under it, yet my apartment was filled with smoke. Even after cleaning the grill and the entire kitchen it stinks in here. I've sprayed air freshners and can still smell it.If I can't cook simple hamburgers on it without setting off the smoke alarm and having to air the place out for days, what use is it to me.Two other things are troubling. The thermostat dial is too vague, making it hard to determine at what temperature your grill is functioning and the ridiculously shallow drip pan makes emptying it an Olympic sport.I'll try it again, using a higher tolerance cooking spray, but I don't hold out much hope for success and certainly wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizzlin' Little Grill","review":"Bought this grill to get thru a kitchen remodel. Surprise! It's easy to use, easy to clean, heats quickly, no smoke, non-stick, and is big enough to make the whole meal - meat and veggies - all at once. On the negative side, the sides of the grill don't heat up very well, so stick to grilling in the middle. What would make it better? An optional lid to keep in the heat. Will we use it after the renovation? Absolutely! Very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This grill arrived at my door and that same night I cooked a steak.

I have had small gatherings and this is a great thing to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Sent It Back","review":"I sent the grill back without using it because it is so slim top to bottom that the bottom was practically sitting on my counter top. The only thing separating the heating element from the counter top was a thin metal tray about an inch off the counter. With the tray itself causing heat transfer, this was a disaster waiting to happen (IMHO). In order to keep from causing heat damage to my counter, I would have had to sit it on my stove top (not enough room) or on top of something heat resistant (don't have). I'm not sure why Sanyo didn't think to make the body of the grill higher, but it was a definite deal breaker for me. I was happy that Amazon took the grill back without question and gave me an instant refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"I am very pleased with this indoor grill and food tastes wonderful.

We have used it grill everything from chicken to fish and it does a very good job. The surface is big enough to hold several pieces of meat to feed a family of four.

Seared the meat nicely, tho took longer than on charcoal grill. Even got the sear marks on the meat...which psychologically, seems to makes the meat taste better. The water in the plater underneath the grill seems to capture any smoke, as well as taking in the \\"grease\\" from the meat. Cleaning the pan was easy. Cleaning the grilling area easy. Would recommend the pan for \\"winter use\\" when an outside grill not convenient. Better than pan frying and only a little more effort in clean up.

After 90 minutes, the inside of the chicken was still way under- cooked (thermometer 110 degrees). The outside was great, but I ended up putting the chicken into the oven for 20 minutes more to finish it up. Had I not dropped the grill on my foot, breaking off a piece of the handle (cheap plastic and lots of it), I would have returned the item. It just doesn't hold the heat evenly or continuously.

There are three major parts to this grill, a lightweight plastic frame, the actual grill grate with the electric built into it, and the electric cord. There is also a lightweight drip tray. It amazed me that something so simple could cook food as well as my large propane Weber grill. I love that there is no gas to have to run to the store to get, love that I don't have to worry about not having enough gas to cook the meal. The food cooks perfectly. I start most things on high to sear the meat then turn it down with a result of tender on the inside and crisp on the out. Smoke/steam is minimal especailly if you spray the grill before you turn it on. It has ample grilling space without being crowded. I find it as easy to clean as any other pan I would cook with. I let the grill soak elevated in hot soapy water. Food tastes much better cooked on this than baked in an oven. I love mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This grill was way better than expected for the price. I was suprised that it cooked evenly.

After reading such great reviews I thought it'd be a good investment. Wrong. The product does not live up to its reviews. It is the biggest disappointment. I used to live with my parents and they have the best indoor grill so I figured I want one for myself since I love to grill. Here are reasons to not buy this product.1. It is like the George Foreman grill. Why is this bad? Well, when you cook meat products it does not taste like how it should taste when you would cook it on an outdoor grill. It is not at all a grilled taste.2. It heats up really slow. I mean S-L-O-W! Not only that it doesn't heat up high enough to cook a thin slice of steak. You would probably spend more than 4 hours for one piece of thinly cut steak.3. Just don't get it. It is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"I purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it's too cold to be outside. It looks very nice and clean up is super easy. The problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it.The first time I used it, I grilled chicken breasts and they turned out fine and by keeping water in the drip pan, I had no problem with smoke.This is great, I thought. The next time I grilled hamburger patties and even though I followed the same procedure as before, it smoked up my whole house. (these were not high fat content burgers either) I added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more. It was not a pleasant experience. Right now it is sitting on top of my fridge and it may stay there until I decide to give it one more try. If it fairs better next time I will return and give it a better review..maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"It is not completely smokeless but its pretty good considering there should be more smoke with grilling anything.

Water splashes everywhere during washing.- It is easier to clean the non stick cooking surface, but, pieces of meat just stick at the bottom part and they just don't let go of the grill...- the tray is made out of the cheapest material. I use the grill on my counter and I have to take the tray out to drip the fat to the sink. But the tray just bends, I spilled some that disgusting meat fat during the journey from counter to sink on my hardwood floor... It sucks.- I don't understand how, but the plastic frame also gets dirty? It gets oily and disgusting, and it is so large that it is impossible to clean...So this definitely doesn't worth buying if you are planning to use it just for a piece of meat once in a while.

I had to return the first one since the plastic case broke as I got it out of the box. I've owned the second one for about 3 months now. The first thing I cooked was a package of bacon. A whole package of bacon almost fits on the surface. Later I've cooked marinated pork chops. It smoked like crazy even though the temp wasn't that high. From then on, I've been using this grill outside. It's not the same flavor as cooking it on the bbq. Cleaning can be a pain since it's big and 3 big parts. I highly recommend placing foil on the bottom of the pan and add a little bit of water for easier cleaning.

The first one worked well the first time, but when I washed it later, it didn't work again. An electrician had a look at it and said that the element had 'blown' as evidenced by a burn mark about half way around the element. I thought it was because of the way I'd washed it but now I think the element was defective. About three months later I bought another unit, the exact same model. When it was turned on, it went POP and a small flame was seen at the same place on the element where the burn mark on the previous unit had appeared. Amazon refunded the purchase and shipping costs.I didn't make as claim for the first unit as I thought it was my fault but now I don't think it was.I got the impression that the power 240volts in Australia is too strong for these units.Sanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill, Black"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it","review":"i saw this grill at my friend house ,the food was great thats how idecided to get it ,i cheked many places it was expensive but with amazon.com it was the best price i love it and i use it almost every week my family love the kabab i cook they are happy and im happy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Grill","review":"Very happy with this product, Super fast delivery, Easy to work with. would buy again. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider The SG4","review":"The Sanyo grill is fantastic!

The grill lifts off of the base and drip pan. The temp gauge is easy to read; you just turn it like a dial. It doesn't take very long to heat up. I enjoy having it as an option to cook with.

I grill kabobs, steak, fish, veggies, etc. It's virtually smokeless. Spacious, too. It takes about 10 minutes to clean. Some cleaning tips:1. Right after cooking, unplug the cord.2. Wet a paper towel.3. Using tongs, wipe the grill with the wet paper towel to remove food remains. This takes about a minute, and you will find out that it will be much easier to clean your grill after your meal.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Got this a few weeks ago and have used it probably a dozen times since for fish, kabobs, and other random stuff. Works as advertised, would recommend. Also, to make it work even better, get a tin or aluminum cover or pan to cover the grill to keep the heat in. No smell inside except of the awesome food your making. Pretty simple to clean, but a little awkward to store.

This grill has none of that but it needs a better nonstick surface like mine.6 STAR RATED with ceramic coating...5 star without...

There was a little smoke when I cooked with it, but no more than I would have when pan searing.I am satisfied with how this grill performs for it's price point. I got it to whip up pork chops, burgers, etc. in the winter without having to broil everything in the oven, and it does a great job for that purpose...I will say that if you clean the grill IMMEDIATELY after using it (once it cools), the stuff caked on the bottom comes off very easily with dish soap and water with a basic scrubber sponge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I have no complaints with the grill.

I cooked lamb shoulder blade chops and salmon fillets on here and both took way longer than the instruction book recommended. The lamb came out ok but the salmon fillets dried out because by the time they finished cooking all of the juices had been cooked out of them. Also, the plug in heating element came a little damaged as well so maybe that played a part in this grill not living up to my expectations. I was so excited when this grill came. However, I feel severely let down. It also would have been great if it came with a lid but that's neither here nor there now. I'm returning and buying one a little more expensive and with a lid.P.S.

Okay on to the quality of the grill... It gets very hot and cooks the food evenly. I get nice flavor and grill marks on whatever I grill. I preheat it by placing a lid from a roasting pan or just a cookie sheet. Before that I wipe the grill down with corn or veg oil. There isn't much smoke, sometimes there isn't any at all in one grilling session. After I am done cooking I place wet paper towels on the grill while it cools. By doing that clean up is a BREEZE!

We live in an apartment, which means no bbq's allowed. We purchased the Le Creuset Oblong Skillet Grill which performed below our expectations. Smoke filled the apartment within 10 minutes of use because of seasonings and juices that had fallen in between the grill slots.

I was skeptical at first until I tried it. After I tried it, I was amazed. I have had fun making shishkebabs in winter! Which, until now, we only had in summer months on the outdoor grill. Now I can make all of our summer favorites inside all year long. My family loves all the many varieties of dinners that I have been making on it, instead of the same old winter ones from the stove top, oven, or slow cooker!! It cleans very easily also. All in all I think this is a real winner!! A terrific product at a fair price. I liked it so much I actually bought the large size, then bought the smaller size!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for BBQ anytime","review":"I have only had my grill for about 2 weeks but have already used it several times. I've grilled perfect steaks, pork chops, hamburgers, chicken and polish sausages on it. I was able to place 7 large pork chops - although close together - on it at one time so my family of 5 plus my guest could all eat hot food at the same time without having to go outdoors to use the big grill (which is a mess to clean up later) and the meat seemed much more moist than when cooked outdoor.

It doesn't take long at all for the grill to get hot but it will smoke off a little for those that think this grill is not supposed to smoke. Also the grill works better with a make shift lid that you can make out of a turkey alumium pan, just use the pan and make a handle and there you go. The drip pan is a bit small but you can use foil and cover the drip pan and the base of the grill to get a drip pan about 2\\" deep. The food is unreal for an electric grill, steaks, hamburgers, chicken, hot dogs, and salmon taste just like or better then an gas grill and hamburger taste better then both charcoal and gas. Easy to clean with the non stick grill so no problems there. I really recommend this grill to anyone who lives in a apartment or condo cause it brings the outdoor grilling experience indoors so no more frying burgers and boiling hot dogs on memorial day. And its 40 bucks, you got to love that especially. GREAT GREAT BUY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a pain to clean","review":"I was surprised that this appliance had so many high-star reviews because this is a pain to clean! Yes, the grill part is removable but doesn't seem to be immersible. Even if it was, the bottom of the grids have grooves in them, making them very hard to clean.

I thought about going with a more expensive model, like DeLonghii, but bought the Sanyo. I really, really wanted to love this, but there were two big problems: (1) it didn't seem to get hot enough to really grill the food, and, more important (2) the coating on the drip pan started peeling off within 5 uses. Within 10 uses, at least 50% of the coating had peeled, and we decided that we shouldn't continue to use it anymore. I emailed the manufacturer through Amazon, and the manufacturer said to send the item back and let them know the tracking number. It took me awhile to get the item posted back to them, but it's been a couple weeks, and I've heard nothing.

The characters all tend to be petty, and self centered with little variation. The 'no one is better than me' attitude was tiring in the beginning, and the trend stayed through the entire book. It was very much like a soap opera.On a good note, the action scenes were enjoyable, but I found myself not really caring what happenes to the characters in the end.

As a classically-educated European and outsider with a penchant for the ghostly, Hearn's work also offers a nice counterpoint to Twain. The more fantastic passages (picturing a cotton press as a monster) Hearn himself later called too florid, but for the post-modern reader, it's a fitting route into old New Orleans. Few journalists of his day embraced places like Hearn. Having known destitution himself, Hearn writes from the bottom. He describes industry, architecture, manners, crime, clothes, furniture and flora while telling his stories. Those familiar with Hearn's later, more mature work in Japan know that he can both capture a society and retell a good ghost story, sometimes intertwining the two.

The album has the \\"today\\" sound. The updated \\"Allegheny Moon\\" version is especially noteworthy, and so are \\"Detour\\" and \\"Mister & Mississippi\\". I found the updates of \\"Left Right of Your Heart\\" too slow, and \\"Cross Over The Bridge\\" lacking the religious overtone the 1954 original possessed. It was great to hear a fairly new Patti Page recording \\"On The Inside\\". Overall, this CD is definitely worth buying, and it's obvious that Patti Page is STILL THE RAGE!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original recordings","review":"I love her music but Old Cape Cod and other songs were re-recorded and not as good as the originals.

It works well for Skype, and also general recording.The only reason I didn't rate it higher is that it's a little noisy when the mic is live, even with the mic input switched off. However, in real-world use, I don't notice it. For one thing, I keep the mic muted for my PC, as Skype recommends.

Who is the manufacturer of my DVD and why is it not produced and released by the film's original studio Paramount Pictures? If the film has been considered classic enough to have been added to the Criterion Collection at four times the cost of my cheesy copy, then what could Amazon be thinking by allowing this knock-off item to be included in their inventory, especially after the sharp reviews and comments by so many other customers?

It doesn't scare me anymore, but its still fun to watch.Steve McQueen made this movie before he was a star. He needed the work and money. I have read and heard that Steve McQueen was offered either a flat fee or a percentage of the box office. He took the fee because he thought the movie was a clinker and he and his wife thought no one would see it. \\"The Blob\\" became a huge hit and a cult classic that made millions.

It was a completely uncessary, forced tie-in to the Sword. I'm really surprised it got by the editor.If you read the Sword too closely to this book, you find a few other things did not work (route of the war as it occurred was different from that described in Sword, the burning of cities according to King did not happen, according to Sword).

I really liked Galaphile and the scenes w/ him, especialy the first one. Bremen was well portrayed as deeply hurting, confused and desperate in dealing w/ his challenges and Galaphile's visions we an unusal focal point. I was moved at the tragedy of how the elfstone was obtained. I don't think I've seen such a story where sucess was so costly and heartbreaking w/ so much undone as this. I really enjoyed this story.

This is yet another great story from Brooks.. It has all the action and suspence of his others and a little more.. I only hope he continues to write more SHannarra books.. They are GREAT.."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK - Now I see more","review":"I have enjoyed all of Terry Brooks' Shannara books. I have found them to be very enjoyable reading and this book is no different. I am the type of person that always wants to know the whole story and this book does that. I have always wondered why Jerle Shannara wasn't able to destroy Brona since I firs read \\"The Sword of Shannara\\" back in the 70's. The \\"First King of Shannara\\" fills in a lot of the background. If you enjoy the Shannara books, you will enjoy this one also. I do recommend this book for all Shannara fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fantasy","review":"I read the original trilogy at 15. At 30, I have rediscovered Brooks. The First King was exciting. I couldn't put it down. A very enjoyable pace, great plot. I loved it so much that I read First King and the three in the Heritage of Shannara series all in the same month. I couldn't get enough. Now I am reading the Sword over again which is slow in comparison. My only wish is that Brooks would write more in this series. He is a literary artist. His style of writing is as interesting as the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book read this review!!!!!!!","review":"In this fabulous book, one of Brooks best, the outcast druid, Bremen learns that the rebel druid Brona, the worlock lord,is building an army to destroy the druids. Bremen then tries to the tell the rest of the druids but they send him out. But a few believe him and decide to go with him. The group then goes to the hadeshorne, aplace where the dead rest, to talk with the dead. The dead give bremen 4 visions. Bremen alone goes back to the druid keep only to find them all dead. Now he and the rest are left to warn the rest of the world and prepare them for what lies ahead. Bremen then goes to work to find the soon-to-be maker of the talisman which will destroy Brona."},{"rating":"2","title":"my look on shannara","review":"The First King of Shannara is the prelude to The Sword of Shannara and I think it is a great book. First King of Shannara is like the Lord of the Rings in many ways. The Warlock Lord (The Evil Wizard) has Skull Bearers, Gnomes, and Trolls under his control.There are four races: Humans, Dwarfs, Elves, and Druids. None of them are powerful enough to defeat the army that the Warlock Lord commands, and if one race were to fall it would be nearly impossible to beat him. They could use spells, but fear the most of them too much to use. For every spell there is a consequence. The more powerful the spell the worse the consequence.I liked this book because it has to do with the old world and magic, which are two things we don't have and never will. I also like that there are a lot of encounters they are a little confusing, but should make more sense if you read it for yourselves. I hope that you like this book as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to a great series","review":"Yes, it's a prequel, and if you're just starting on Brooks' series then by all means, read it first. I'm reading them all for a third time - and I don't read ANY fantasy or science fiction novels. That's how good the Shannara series is.I really admire the way Brooks has reached back and tied the characters together once again, allowing us to see the long ago history of the characters we've followed through this series. It's quite entertaining for a fan of the series to see the familiar names cropping up, and being able to see how these families were entwined in one another's fates from generations earlier than the first installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"First king of Shannara","review":"This book has to be Terry Brooks second best in the whole Shannara series. it is fun, imaginative, and best of all, a change from the usual. hopefully, if this trend continues, terry will successfully complete several more books to add to the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much, too soon","review":"This is another wonderful book by Terry Brooks. It is a great book to read AFTER the other 7 Shannara books. It gives away many parts of later books in a very blunt manner, taking away the suspense that makes his books so thrilling. If after you read the other books you come back and read this one, it will help you more fully understand the plot, which you will surley still be thinking about months after, while not ruining his other fantastic books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another outstanding effort by Terry Brooks","review":"Terry Brooks has outdone himself again. This book is destined to be considered one of the GREAT parts of what may be the best series of fantasy ever written--sorry Mr. Tolkein. This particular book completes the Shannarra epic and leaves no questions unanswered. I am truly sorry to see it come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy action. A must-read for Brooks' fans","review":"I've been a fantasy fan since threee years now. I guess my favorite authors are Tolkien and Brooks. \\"The First King of Shannara\\" is one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend that you read first all of the Shannara saga first because of some details (for example: the one who forged the sword, the true story about Allanon, etc) that are better appreciated by the ones familiar to the story of the Four Lands. Overall, it's a great title (perhaps the best in the Shannara line)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predlude makes great ending","review":"After reading every Shannara book from the Sword to the Talismans, I was glad to discover the prelude to the 7-book series. It tells of the destruction of Paranor and the near extinction of the Druids, as well as the creation of the Sword of Shannara and the beginning of the family line. All of these factors are hinted at in the first 7, but are detailed in full in this book, especially the beginnings of Allanon. Terry Brooks is one of my favorite authors, and I hope he writes more books involving this enchanting series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all to waste","review":"This is the first book - in well over 500 read - that I have ever left unfinished. Terrible, from start to half-finish. Skip this.(it got two stars because the cover was nice, and I'm not mean enough to give just one)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooks needs to get a life","review":"Terry Brooks hopped on the Tolkein fantasy badwagon in the seventies, one of the first truly copycat writers to do so. Since then, fantasy authors like Jordan and Silverberg, Feist and Bradley, have largely succeeded in exploring new realms and systems, new races and generally developing new ideas--all except Brooks. He struck gold with the first book and has been milking that vein ever since.As an author Brooks in not utterly without talent, though that talent is still largely undeveloped after all these years. The world of Shannara didn't have the depth of Tolkein's to begin with, and has long since run dry. Mr. Brooks should either get off the teat and write something new, or he should retire this series and live off the royalties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get cover art on my Kindle","review":"I'm very disappointed the publisher did not include the cover image for this ebook.

I was especially impressed by the use of different points of view in the narration of the druid friends in their own sections. The use of these different view points allowed for each to make claims that they viewed as true even though the others would have disagreed. This \\"different perspectives\\" approach that I first discovered here in \\"First King of Shannara\\" is one that I truly enjoyed utilizing in my own writing as I wroteMy Name is Gary.

This is an action-packed book. If you have already read Sword, Elfstones, and Wishsong, this book will answer many questions, and fill in a lot open gaps.

Also, if you like battles, you will be glad you read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vive Shannara!","review":"This is THE Shannara novel, the culmination of Terry Brooks's talents. Yup, he's still into loads of narration, but this time you can't ignore the splendour in the tale. The magic's there, and the danger, and the feeling of age, of coming full circle, the awe of seeing the world of Shannara shape itself during history.

It reads like it was written using a fantasy-by-numbers manual and the cliché meter turned to the \`on' position. Chunks of it are dull and full of padding.It is only worth reading for completeness and, to be frank, even then it doesn't add anything really significant to the canon.If it was a book other than in the Shannara series then I would only have given it one star.steve"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Brooks is losing his Shannara touch","review":"All i have to say is WOW! This book was a huge disappointment. It's been quite sometime since i've read other installments in the series, and i am trying not to let this one keep me from reading the others again. It was unimaginative, rehashed, cliche fantasy material, enough said. It seems for fans of the series that no matter how generic, it suffices. Which is ridiculous. It could be the fact that i just finished Tolkien's works, but even so, i found it dull and waited patiently for the last page hoping Brooks would redeem himself. The characters are boring and all the same. Except for difference of career, none of the many characters in the novel have distinguishable personality traits.

I selected The Life and Times of Grigorii Rasputin for a book review I had to write for my Honors Government class as I had always been fascinated by the man who has often been credited with bringing about the downfall of Tsarist Russia. Unfortunately, this book was far from what I had expected. I have read plenty on Rasputin, and this by far has been the worst book I have ever read about him. De Jonge takes pleasure it seems in rambling verbally about the Russian countryside and dedicates very little time to the actual man.

Waging War has surpassed even that. It still has its heavy moments but it has progressed to include more melody and it flows a lot easier.

I remedied this quickly after I placed my first shelf in by taking a DVD and placing it on the shelf, then putting the next spacer in place.Like another reviewer stated, this unit is somewhat flimsy, but it comes with a stationary strap that you can attach to the wall if you so choose. Personally, I think that once you have the unit assembled and the bulk of your media on the shelves, this unit will stay put unless you get a little rough with it.Overall, not a bad unit for your media.

Ron Rozelle summered in Galveston as a child and that began his fascination with the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. He was driven to tell the story in a manner that was true to history and striking enough to recreate the terror of those in the path of this storm. This book is a fictionalized account of the Galveston Hurricane of September 1900. While the weather events are factual. The people he portrays are a mixture of real people and those that Mr. Rozelle created to add depth and heart to his story. His research into the facts of the hurricane's ferocious assault of Galveston and the utter destruction of life and property is vividly portrayed. The characters bring a rawness of emotion, making the reality of the vast loss achingly real. This is a realistic and intense tale of Mother Nature in full fury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vintage racing footage.","review":"Being a Jag owner and enthusiast, I thought I'd give this video a try.

Having made quite a few of these recipes, my concern is that they are not practical if you are trying to bake regularly to produce bread for yourself or your family. Reinhart focuses heavily on a delayed fermentation method that requires your starters and doughs to sit in the fridge for about a day to further develop the flavor before final rises. I am sure that this does improve the flavor of the bread. However, the downside is that baking your loaves, an already time consuming process with rise times, takes at least two days, sometimes three. This book is wonderful if you want to make exquisite occasional breads, and it does a fantastic job of explaining the science and math behind bread. However, if you are just starting out or if you are looking for recipes that will fit into your life more, I would recommend another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baked Every Recipe in the Book","review":"I have just finished baking every single recipe in this book. When I first started I had no idea how to bake bread or keep a sourdough starter alive for more than a few days. 20 months and 43 recipes later, I am proud to say that I can now tackle any bread baking project with confidence. The clear instructions, detailed explanations and excellent recipes in this book make it a must buy for anyone who wants to learn how to bake bread. The types of bread range from bagels to brioche, from stollen to sourdough, and include many variations of breads that rely on wild yeast starters. If you want to learn how to make breads at home that rival those of top notch bakeries- this is the book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for everyone and anyone who wants to bake bread!","review":"This book is amazing. I bought it after trying to make bread for the very first time from a recipe I found online and ended up with 5 bricks. From the first time I opened this book my bread went from bricks to delicious huge loaves. With the first third of the book just being on ingredients, trouble shooting and step by step explanations and descriptions of each of the steps, I have yet to to come across a bread that I can't figure out how to make. The recipes throughout the book are incredibly easy to follow, and with about 10 pages of shaping methods with pictures included there is practically no bread or shape that you cannot make with the help of this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book is excellently made, beautiful images, very detailed instructions, exact formulas (or not?).I bake my bread because I want perfect bread, and after following Mr Reinhard guidelines my breads are still a long, long way from the breads pictured in the book, breads come out correctly but don't even get near the breads pictured despited the huge efforts I've been doing. I follow some of the formulas and I see in the picture how they hold a beatiful dough while my dough slips between my fingers, his doughs raise beautifully while mine get thick and dense (tasty anyway).I don't understand how I'm the only one to rate so low this book but I assure you that before reading the book using fresh yeast and tweaking the recipies more or less by intuition I got better results. The use of this book, up to the moment has been very frustating to me.Despite the extensively detailed explanations I guess Mr Reinhard keeps a lot of secrets for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"bread bakers apprentice","review":"This book is informative,well written, has pictures and the recipies are great. this is a book for anyone interested in understanding the mystery of bread making"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the beginner","review":"I found this book to be overwhelming.

Baking good bread should be time consuming, but not to this level. Perhaps someone who is going to school or already a professional would enjoy this, but not me.

Unlike a regular cookbook, this (or at least the first half) is actually a \\"how-to\\" manual that explains how and why bread recipes work. In addition, the book supplies the amateur bread-baker with the professional terminology necessary to participate in discussions and forums with other bakers (amateurs and professionals).

My initial wholemeal bread offering was OK - better than shop bought anyway. I was looking for a book that stopped me just dabbling at making bread and might help me impress the family Also, having a scientific background I like details about why things happen as well as just cooking them from a recipe. I ordered the Bread Bakers Apprentice because it had good reviews and I thought it might suit me without being too difficult. As many others have found before me I find it to be a wonderful book. It gives the reasons for why you use the various ingredients, how you use them, when to use them and how to make bread like a professional baker. I have only had the book a few weeks but have made baguette, ciabata and wholemeal breads and without any problems. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever!","review":"This is the best book I ever had!

However, this book really drew me in with the pictures (I'm a visual learner when it comes to baking). After years of baking bread from a regular cookbook, this book taught me more than I ever imagined about the chemical processes the different parts of the dough go through on their way to becoming bread. I've made some pretty spectacular breads from this book, namely the Brioche, Stollen, and Focaccia, and I think the knowledge I've gained from this book has made me a better baker. There may be better technical bread-baking manuals, but the combination of interesting science and gorgeous pictures makes this a book I recommend to all bakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tutorial on bread baking.","review":"Awesome book!

This book is more like taking a journey throughout time and places as the author tells the story of making bread. This book is not dull at all and is a very good read as well as convincing the reader that bread is life and life is bread.But the book is not just a story. Somehow the author is able to weave in and out of storytelling to teach anyone how to make not just good bread but great bread.Going into what it is that makes a great bread, including what gives breads their different flavors and textures.You will not look at bread the same way again after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good New Information","review":"This book gives a lot of tips and tricks that allow you to make loaves of bread that don't appear homemade. However some of the recipes, such as the pizza dough, are a little overcomplicated without a lot of reward. I've tried many of the recipes but found I can get great results (and many times better tasting bread) by using the knowledge from this book, with recipes from other books. Another thing I found was that the measurements for water in most recipes seemed too low and I've had to make slight adjustments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"This book is very informative for beginning or intermediate bread bakers. It has photos showing the techniques they describe. There is a good variety of recipes including english muffins, stollen, rustic breads, slicing/sandwhich breads, etc. The recipes are fool proof if you follow the directions and do your reading on techniques if unfamiliar.My only complaint is that there is a lot of 'fluff'-or not recipe/baking related stuff in the beginning. Stories about himself and travels. It is worth getting though, but if you want all recipe and nothing else maybe look else where. I personally like the lengthy description of the breads, photos, and the organization/layout of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nasty Cracker Pizza to Awesome Pizza!","review":"I read posts from people here on Amazon and many of the bread blogs most of which sung the praises for the author and this book.

I got this book for Christmas 08 and it's Jan 3rd. I've already made 4 pizzas that way out classed my previous attempts all thanks to the author's techniques and the new found understanding of fermenting vs levening (rising) that this book talks about.

I love it because he goes into the why in great detail, not just the how.You won't be sorry with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Bread Book for Experienced Bakers","review":"Peter Reinhart has written an amazing book for the intermediate and advanced baker. The recipes are packed with tips and ideas for variations and there are chapters on how to create sourdough starters and other types of pre-ferments.

Some of my favorite breads include the sourdoughs, the Greek Celebration Bread, the Ciabatta and the Tuscan bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baking bread at home.","review":"First off, I really enjoyed reading this as a book. The first section delves into the art and science of baking bread, but in generic terms. The author has good stories about his own experiences and that of his students.

The pizza dough I made from the Pain L'ancien recipe was some of the best I've ever eaten. Love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bread baking book","review":"Outstanding award winning book.

The introductory text, the plain english recipes and techniques of a bread master and illustrations are great. Peter Reinhart is a bread legend and he has outdone himself here. Bread can be a pesky critter to schedule, mix and bake. You can not go wrong here with this book. Be aware, this is not the book for someone who wants bread machine recipes or quick breads.01-05-03An update. Almost a year later, this book is getting worn out and the pages full of flour.

I don't bake very often so I'll update this with recipes as I try them.Recipes I've tried to date:Bagels.This single recipe is enough for me to recommend this book. The taste and texture was absolutely correct. In my town we have one deli that makes good New York style bagels but its a 30 minute drive from my house. Now, I no longer need to make that trek.I would recommend not trying to use an electric mixer for this very stiff dough unless you have a professional machine.

Still, if anyone can get an Opera Queen to think, it might be Slavoj Zizek and Mladen Dolar. Dolar's is a more conventional and comprehensive treatment of the history of opera as a history of ideas. It is excellent and one can almost read the copious notes as a separate and equally enjoyable experience. Zizek uses particular operas to explain profound and fascinating ideas about love and death, narcissism and self-destruction, through the ideas (among others) of Lacan and Hegel. Ever since Zizek's seminal books explaining the complexities of Lacan and Hegel through popular entertainment he has accrued fame in intellectual circles without ever becoming pompous or complacent. He makes for enjoyable and provocative reading and chances are, after you've read him, you'll be keeping an eye out for his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"lkt","review":"I was able to remove about 4 links and push 2 pins back in, then it quit working--it wouldn't push the pins out anymore.

And it has the capability to be a fridge as well (though not at the same time as if you used it as a freezer). My only complaint is that it can be a bit noisy for my taste. If you keep it in a room you don't sleep in, it shouldn't be a problem. Or if you have a studio, it would be ideal to keep it in a cupboard or nook to minimize the noise.

In fact, I like a lot of the songs on this one (\\"Herion\\", \\"Sweet Bonnie Brown\\", \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\", \\"White Light/White Heat\\") better than the originals. In the case of \\"White Light...\\", it's probably because you get a longer version of a good thing.This makes it the rarest of live albums, in that the material here is at least as good or better than the original.

I know Lee Ann wanted to make a traditional album, but for this album she is going back to the time when \\"Women just stood there and sang\\" and even then Tammy and Loretta packed some punch into their songs. I loved two of Lee Ann's albums, \\"I hope you Dance\\" and her first album self titled, they had some awesome material on them. I played her first album to death. Man with 18 Wheels, Never again again, and Montgomery to Mephis. Great Stuff.

First out of the box it seems pretty cool, but after a while the gears start to become difficult to turn and pieces will stick. The cover is also really hard to pin into, you have to pin it like you're piecing fabric together, but when you're using a dressform, it's easier to just stick a pin in like a push pin! Also it is not realistic. If you measure your body and adjust, it is not a good clone to you. The boobs especially are problematic, the torso slopes into them too much instead of having it be more realistic. This is a problem if you like to make very structured and fitted clothes.

I went out and bought the cassette shortly thereafter knowing full well this would be music I would revisit later in my life. Now that I'm in my 30s and Caetano's profile has risen substantially since then--I still feel this is (for the period and for those who are inclined to hear some of the more Luaka-Bop esque sounds from Caetano)a brilliant release. My favorites are the title song and Rapte Me Camaleoa. However, to my ears Lua E Estrela is not only the albums highpoint but is the single most moving piece of music Caetano has ever created. That track has haunting Nick Drake elements. Overall the CD's only weakness is it's production and some lite jazz rock elements that need to be ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!!!!","review":"At first I had the Leviton activie unit with power supply.

Well, maybe I'm overstating it, but it is as amateurish a production as I've ever seen. Virginia Madsen is excellent and plays the role as the sexy, beautiful art thief quite well, but Rick Rossovich is awful. I have to respectfully disagree with the first reviewer who characterized him and his performance as \\"less like an experienced actor.\\" No, he seems like someone who has never acted before. His emotions range all the way from A to B, and his voice never changes pitch or volume in the entire flick.By the way, the jazz on the soundtrack is terrific.So, Virginia Madsen and the soundtrack get five stars. Everyone else and the movie get one because I think that the least you can give.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Book on Valuing Players","review":"For those of you that have wrestled with the issue of dollar values, position scarcity and valuing a player's future value in preparation for your rotisserie draft, this book is for you.

I have been using the McGee method for the past two seasons and it has noticeably improved my draft performance.

Without spoiling too much, I will say that this season elevates the series from a standard police procedural (albeit a good one) to a commentary on the basic notion of right and wrong. The season is certainly different, but I think this much more thoughtful direction will allow it to stand the test of time.Eagerly awaiting season 8!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EJ 's closer review","review":"Love the shows , watched at least 3 shows at a time very addicting.

If you're purchasing episodes individually via Amazon Instant Video- definitely skip this one. It has nothing to add to the story arcs of the season. You won't be missing anything except another drunk, pathetic, vomiting Santa which, for some reason, still passes for humor with writers and producers who are obviously completely drained creatively.

Who doesn't want to be as strong as this woman and melt in someone's arms afterward,and still be credible?

But I found out I can't blame Raymond Carver after reading the cover story for the Aug. 9, 1998 \\"New York Times Magazine.\\" That cover story shows that Carver is only vaguely the \\"author\\" of a lot of his stories. His editor and sometimes his wife did a great amount, and sometimes most, of the work. When the reporter was looking at the evidence of this ruse in the library that holds Carver's papers, a librarian came up to him and said, \\"I stopped looking in that file when I saw what was in it.\\" She couldn't handle that Carver had so much \\"help\\" on his short stories.

I cannot believe garbage like this gets published. This book was a solid waste of time (I'm extremely glad I did not spend my money on it). The stories are littered with easily forgettable characters, and plots centered on nothing. Whether or not the \\"nothingness\\" of these stories was Carver's point, we'll never know. Also, Carver is one of the worst prose stylists I have ever read as his style is very uneven. Also, several of the stories in this collection were so short and pointless they make the others seem like grand-master works of fiction.

There, that's the whole book in a nutshell.

I guess that's about it--same ideas, same results, over and over again in a boring, depressing way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"Personally, I feel that Carver is given too much praise. This book was a waste of my money and of my time. Most say that the content in this book is too depressing if they dislike Carver, however, the focus on the bleak does not disturb me. Carver's writing style is what i find annoying. The only story that i found even worth reading in this compilation was Catherdral itself, other than that his udder lack of \\"action\\" (and i mean action in the sense that SOMETHING...

Stories in this collection like \\"A Small, Good Thing\\" and \\"Cathedral\\" are among the very best in literature. They are the ultimate in showing rather than telling, tapping emotion in unexpected ways just by showing us the way people live their lives. Sometimes they are faced with life-changing events, but more often they are just making their way from morning to night in their various desperate and oblivious ways. Carver says less about those lives than other authors would -- but, in doing so, he allows them to appear to speak for themselves. The result is often unbearably moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and moving.","review":"I just now- just now, finished rereading the story Cathedral (posted online). Amazing.

Carver employed Hemingway's technique and gave it new life with his sensitive attunement to the struggles and pain of ordinary people. Although many disparage the structure of the epiphany operative within these stories, I find there subtle and revelatory unfolding to be understated and yet sublime. Carver's terse realism is a welcome contrast to the hysterical realism of contemporary prose. A must read for any aspiring short fiction writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for kids and grandkids","review":"My folks read this to me...again and again. I then did the same for my kids. Now, I'm getting copies for them to read to my grand-kids.I can recite, by memory, Little Orphan Annie, forty-five years after I learned it. The Old Swimmin' Hole still brings tears to my eyes. There are so many classic poems for kids. They are all rhyming poems, and the alliteration is great for kids, too.There is a least one poem/illustration that is, by today's standards, racially insensitive. I simply skipped it until my kids were a bit older, and then we used it as a teachable moment regarding the changes in society re race and racism.If you're going to have grand-kids, GET THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang it up.","review":"This is a very neat product.

The Mac Fontana and Thomas Black series are outstanding.This is a piece of overwritten rubbish. The writing is simply bad - the opening pages are those of a novice not a skilled craftsman. The plot is unconvincing (to be generous). The group dynamics - which he usually excels at - are childish. But above all the characters are totally uninvolving and unconvincing. The awkward combination of self-knowing weakness and \\"charm\\" of the protagonist just make the hair curl on the back of your neck.This is careless and lazy writing from an author who is capable of much better and needs to stop looking for the \\"besteller\\" - and thereby underestimating the taste of his readers.Regretfully all three thunbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"Earl Emerson's experience as a firefighter is evident in this fast-paced, page-turning thriller.

Perhaps a lot of that is due to the fact it stays far away from the war it takes places during (Vietnam). Instead, it takes you to the Camp Pendleton refugee camp set up after the United States pulled out of the war. It deals with the difficulty on both the side of the refugees and the Sergeant responsible for them (played by Patrick Swayze). The refugees want to get on with their lives, but they aren't quite sure how to do that. They know returning to their country would be a pointless deathtrap, but they are afraid of what life in America will be like for them. Introduces Trung Hieu Nguyen as the little boy Minh who develops a friendship with Forest Whitaker's doomed cook/artist Addie. If you are interested in the more emotional side of the effects of war and not just the explosions, put it on your \\"to rent\\" list.

All the music that's on the soundtrack is in the film, and I think the album really conveys a great, fun feeling (like the movie).However, the soundtrack doesn't include POD's \\"Youth of a Nation\\" and Moby's \\"Jam for the Ladies\\" which are both featured in the film.

Every song on it has meaning and they all rock. The Cruel Summer remix is awesome, and so is The Doves' Firesuite. Every single song is worth listening to. I was kind of disappointed that P.O.D's Youth Of The Nation wasn't on it, because I'd heard it in the movie...overall, this is definitely a CD worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This soundtrack is much cooler than I expected. I bought it for the Blestenation remix, which is great to dance to in the car :), but there's a whole mix of stuff on here and nearly every one is great. My particular favorites are Daybreaker by Beth Orton, the N.E.R.D. remix, Front 2 Back by Playgroup, Everybody Got Their Something by Nikka Costa, and Destiny by Zero 7. I've never really listened to much reggae, but I like what's on this album. I personally don't care for the Lenny Kravitz song, but that's pretty much my only complaint. Oh, and also that they didn't include \\"Alive\\" by P.O.D., which they played in the preview for the movie, on this CD - I hate when they do that :P. Otherwise, I think this is an awesome album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"I recently bought this CD for a couple of songs in the movie that I really liked. I was very disappointed to find that one in particular was not included in this soundtrack (POD's \\"Youth of the Nation\\")Overall, it is a great mix of artists and songs. While it is a a soundtrack for a surfing movie, it is a far cry from the old Beach Boys or Jan & Dean genre.Nice job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Saw This Film...the soundtrack was KEWL!","review":"The film is GOOOOOOD! The music was well mixed. There are TWO remixes of Cruel Summer in the film, on the CD there's only one of them. The BOB MARLEY remix is a VERY nice touch, but I didn't see it in the CD listing.I highly recommend seeing this film. Its NOT schlock. I was surprised like a lot of ppl in the theater at just how good it was. I had read a review of the film and the reviewer said that I wouldn't be dissappointed...She was right. The visuals are to die for....its not a schlocky film at all.I would see this again....really want to get the sound track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Heard Of These Artists ...","review":"I've never heard of these artists, really. When I listened to the CD the only song that was familar to me was the Lenny Kravitz song and \\"Cruel Summer\\" (a hit none-the-less) Oops! Sorry, I'm rambling on again aren't I? Well this CD is definetly worh it. The songs may not be familiar (as was the first thing in my mind) but after I heard them they got you addicted! I don't really think that it matters if you liked the movie or not. I mean, these are just cool summer-surf songs that you can play on a lazy summer day (or any day for that matter) and just bop your head and smile. The songs are catchy, and fun.

Somehow I just enjoyed the music that was actually in the movie much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best. This soundtrack far surpasses the movie","review":"I liked the movie alright, it was cute, just sort of typical. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't stellar. The soundtrack on the other hand is a fine collection of great songs. They mix old with new, lots of catchy feel-good songs. I love popping this cd in when I'm working out, it really pumps me up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimmu Borgir do it again and again","review":"The dreadfull loss of their keyboard player Stian Aarstad did not effect this recording as i feared. The joining of a great new member Mustis realy turned the heat up in the keyboard part. New realy wonderful backig vocals by Simen Hestns wich gives us his wonderful operic singing in some parts and it realy fits in. Shagrath keeps up the good work with more deamonic screams and Astennu cant fail on those hard guitar riffs. A great new dimension for Dimmu Borgir and to name a few great tracks \\"The Insight And The Catharsis\\", \\"Dreamside Dominions\\" and \\"United In Unhallowed Grace\\" although all the tracks realy ROKK. This Cd is A must have for any BlackMetal fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy, too much synth","review":"Being a Black Metal fan, I must say that although this album isn't a total waste of time, Dimmu Borgir surely had done better in the past. It's too noisy, in the bad sense, full of synth taking over the music, which makes it sound like disco, and look, I'm NOT with the \\"True Black Metal\\" people. Imagine what THEY say about this. Finally, this album is totally immmersed in the poser era of Dimmu Borgir. It doesn't even compare with the older Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, where the music is richer and the use of keyboards hardly takes over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Diappointment","review":"This book was given to me by my father; I wish he hadn't. It's a poorly crafted book, with maps that do not relate to the text, and a text that jumps without any clear logic or apparent continuity. It is solely focused on order of battle issues but seems to find it hard going breathing life into the subject matter. It's a pity since the subject is intrinsically rivetting but it is lost in a disparate, wooden and dull listing of numbers and events. I concluded that Mr Williamson's interest in his topic was not matched by any talent in the vein possessed by the likes of Cornelius Ryan. Catchy title though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This product is listed in \\"Liters,\\" not pounds. This is really a eight pound bag of this excellent \\"Koi\\" food. The vendor doesn't see any problem with listing it in liters which, I think, is decieving. What I thought was a really great deal turned out to be an overpriced bag of fish food. This is NOT a 25 pound bag. Don't be fooled - buy it cheaper at some other site! The vendor DID offer to take it back, but only after the third back and forth message. My fault for not being more careful when I was attracted to this add.

I like Spooky Tooth a lot, and I am also impressed with the religious content of the songs. However, I cannot listen to this because the electronics are totally out of context with the music and worse are mixed way out front. This may have been considered a bold experiment at the time, but it doesn't work at all. (The main reason I give it 2 stars is that the cover art is pretty cool).Get ANY of Spooky Tooth's other albums before investing in this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that almost killed Spooky.","review":"From what I've read, Spooky Tooth's 2nd album was a hard rock masterpeice, and they were set for the big leauges. Then they put this out, and it drove them to the edge of the abyss.Ceremony may not have been the best tactical move for this band, but it is a very good album. Most of the songs stand up as hard rock, though the hard rock on here is far darker than on their first two, blues-based albums. Think of the difference between The Faces and Black Sabbath and you'll understand.The electronics can be destracting, but only becuase the songs hold up by themselves. For me, I like the 60s wierdness Pierre Henry adds to this. It is almost like you are playing two completely different albums at the same time on two turntables. The collaboration between him and the band is just so bizzare, you can't help but like it.That alone makes Ceramony worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHANGE OF HEART","review":"When I first reviewed this 'lp' I was relying on years of past disappointment with this particular piece of metal/art. I just received my copy of the 2009 remaster and WOW! what a difference. The electronics work with this version, excellent art reprint too. Though I still personally think the tape loop of some pathetic babbling that runs all the way through jubilation could be tossed, everything thing else is genius; mixed perfect, with the band and vocals up front the way it should have always been. The guitar work is crystal. 5 STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very few true rock applications to classic genres","review":"'Ceremony, An Electronic Mass' may be one of the very few classic Rock works where the rock idiom in its (relatively) pure form is applied to a classical genre, the Mass. There are some well-meaning but weak attempts, as with the Electric Prunes attempt which simply does classical phrasings with rock instruments. I hope to do a much more thorough review of this work soon, but I'm moved to put in my two cents quickly, as I misstated the title of this album in my review of 'Tommy', one of the other very few genuine translations of classic genre into the rock idiom.I would say this about few albums, but this work demands your attention simply because of its great ambitions to accomplish a difficult task. Even if you don't believe the composers succeeded (I think they did) it is important to listen to and be aware of this important signpost in the history of Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inkwell","review":"One of my favorite movies.

Never have I seen adolescent boys behave the way the group were portrayed. It was simply another Fat Albert-style farcical attempt to make the boys and feuding brothers-in-law appear utterly ridiculous. The director/producers didn't know whether to make an outrageous comedy or a drama with moments of good humor. Regrettably, they made neither.Such a shame, because many moments in this film were truly enlightening and poignant. This could have been a tremendous drama! A remake done correctly would be wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad period flavor, but YECHHH!","review":"Being that I was 12 during the Summer of 1976 when this film took place, I'll agree that they got some of the period flavor of the era correct (outrageously fake afros aside), but this movie stinks to high heaven as a whole. Not only for the atrocious acting and meandering story, but for the ending with the father (Glynn Turman)congratulating his young teenaged son for bedding down a GROWN MARRIED WOMAN!?

It was an easy read. It gave insight into family life at that point in time. But what I objected to is the blaming of 'those millionaires from Pittsburgh' for shaving off the top of the damn. There is another reference to \\"It's all the fault of the greedy rich\\". What was the point of blaming the rich? If the people at the time saw some objectionable practices, like lowering the height of the damn or the removing of the drainage pipes, why did they not speak up? Nothing like a broad generalization to start the wealth envy in the young.

Daylle doesn't mess around. She explains that the best way to get a record deal is to pursue a career, and she's right. I would rather make money from my music than chase that elusive deal. I know so many musicians getting stagnant on labels. I do want a long term career. I'd also like a record deal but as Daylle says, the best one is a deal that advances your career because most labels won't give you one. I'm motivated to do what it takes to succeed after reading The Real Deal because it is the real deal. Daylle gives great resources for making money from music and that's what I want. Her chapter on making money from songs is very helpful and the one on getting to the next level of touring gives me hope.

If your looking for a solid treatment of the polymer physics of DMA testing, that's not this book; maybe it hasn't been written yet.

The answer? No. Of the 9 songs there is not one bad one. It's bluegrass,country,folk,gospel and even almost soul (see the opening track \\"Out on the Side\\"), sometimes all at the same time.

About 10 years ago it popped up as an Amazon special pick of some kind. I couldn't beleive it was still around, so I bought the CD. I'm 59 years old now, but I can remember riding on a bus in the middle of the night when I was 20, with the words from The Radio Song flowing through my head.

Ken Croswell has everything needed in a great science writer. He knows his subject and understands the joys, difficulties and frustrations of being an astronomer. He has great skill in interviewing the scientific protagonists and drawing from them the details of the excitement and disappointments of their endeavours; many of these interviews are quoted verbatim. And he can tell a superb story, which is compelling and complete. I particularly liked his discussion of the way the media reacted to the \`new planet' news. The book is riveting. And what is more, it has an extensive note and reference section. --David W. Hughes, NATURE, vol 391, p 652."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very good book","review":"I liked this book, I am very interested in these things, but I really would have liked to learn more about HOW they find the planets, for this was not really explained in detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD","review":"Dont waste your money or time on this loser.I wish i had never ordered it im still trying to forget the plot oh yeah what plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so glad that I bought them!","review":"I bought three of these bags.

Do something good for yourself and the environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I made this investment!","review":"These eco-shopping bags are fantastic. I cannot believe how much they hold. I use them to food shop, and all other shopping. I have been able to fit all my groceries into 2 of these bags comfortably. The long handles are great, so I can carry them over my shoulder.

Many canvas totes is made with a heavier fabric and that just adds a little more weight when carrying your shopping goods.The canvas tote is easy to fold up and carry around in your purse or backpack. I live in San Francisco and this city has decided to become enviormentally friendly and encourages consumers to start bringing their own grocery bags or tote bags to carry our shopping goods. Purchasing the reusable tote bags is a good start to help stop using plastic grocery bags and help out the enviorment.Thumbs up for this company for making these canvas tote bags with fair wages and fair labor laws in India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiderman Lamp","review":"I was disappointed with this one.

The stain will disappear on its own. If there is some residual stain, I repeat it a second time which does the trick. I don't usually blot the liquid up. I leave it to dry up and that's it.

Over time, it will conform to your foot and be the most comfortable thing your feet have met. The straps are soft and strong. Mine show no sign of wear and the color stays as vibrant as the day you got them. What I love most about these is unlike Rainbows, they are awesome even when wet.

For starters, the case is not leather like the descripton leads you to believe. It is a composite blend, that does not feel, smell nor look like real leather. In fact, one of corners was pealing up confirming the leather is not genuine.The look inside is not bad. I was pleased with that, but upon further inspection (like another review), the interior material is cheap as well. Also, the latch does not line up so of course the ability to use the lock and key is missing.The description states \\"Handcrafted\\" and \\"holds 10 of your finest watches\\".

Run!","review":"Forrest White ran Fender production.Forrest initiated all the important changes that allowed Fender to grow as a producer of instruments and amps. And he did it without much help AT ALL from his one-eyed boss, Leo Fender. What Don Randall was to sales, Forrest more or less was to production, and he was an absolute key figure in what made Fender a success as a business. For example, his employee compensation incentive system made each worker something of a quality control inspector. This was vital, and something obviously beyond George Fullerton to appreciate or have thought of himself.And if Forrest saw fit to settle a few scores with a few barbs, thats fine! And if he describes Jimmy Bryant as being arrogant, well I appreciate hearing all sides, including that one. Great job Forrest.

However, because of the design, the only sounds that my son hears are of those similar to those produced by a slot machine when the handle is pulled. My husband and I frequently comment how we are reminded of a casino when our son is playing with this toy.

Close to price of popular shape sorters, but way more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stacker toy that lights up","review":"I bought this for my 1 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. He loves toys that light up and this one definitely does. The toy lights up each time the child slides a star ring onto the post. Then when all the star rings are stacked, the top star lights up the whole toy and plays a song. It is a very colorful interactive toy that rewards the child with lights & sound each time they succeed in stacking the rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My daughter really started enjoying this toy at about 1 year old. She loved the songs and the lights. It was a great coordination exercise to put the rings on the base. My only complaint is there isn't an off switch for the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely scary","review":"I bought this toy for my granddaughter and she loved it while it was still in the box. The first time I took it out of the box and she heard the music, she cried (age 6 months). I thought it was a fluke so I put the toy away. I gave it to her a month later and the same thing happened. I also tried it last week (she's 8 months old today) and she still cried. I cannot explain this because she has several other Fisher-Price musical toys that she loves. Maybe, some day, she'll enjoy it.Edit: At 11 months, this toy became one of her favorites. She now plays with every part of the toy and constantly finds new creative ways to play with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad idea","review":"This toy makes no sense. As a ring stacker, why all the bells and whistles. Also the yellow star on the top? What's up with that? All is needed are the rings and the stacking poll.

He really likes the lights, sounds and music. However, I was disappointed that the stacker is shaped like a cylinder so you can put the stars on in any order you choose. So it does not teach children that the big star goes on the bottom and get smaller as you go up. Also, the star that goes on top is cute, but it almost never gets used in conjuction with the stacker. It didn't take long for our baby to figure out that you just have to press the button on the top to get the music to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke Within 6 months","review":"My son especially liked playing the tunes by pushing the top button on the stacker, and I liked the toy too--until it suddenly died.

My husband wanted to get the plain jane stacker like what we had when we were kids but I had to get this one. I wish I would have listened to him. This is great to catch my sons attention however it doesnt serve its purpose. The rings are hard to get on and off because there is a button on the side when you put the rings on make it lightup. I have a hard time putting them on sometimes so you can imagin how diffucult it is for my 8month old. If I hadnt destroyed the box when I opened this toy it would have went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Actually Stack","review":"This toy looks great and seems like a new twist on an old classic. However, its functionality is severely diminished by the fact that the little button at the top that triggers the music makes it extremely difficult for an infant to stack. It's a big problem with this toy, especially when you consider that the thing is billed as a \\"stacker\\" but doesn't function well at all in that regard. My 10-month-old can pull the rings off until it gets to the button, where it gets stuck. Same principle for putting them back on, they get stuck at the very top. I now realize we would have been better off getting the old school stacker, since it actually allows a child to stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"This toy really is a must have for all babies.My daughter absolutely loves the music and the way it lights up - it keeeps her entertained for quite a while!

They can put the rings in any order, and they can can grab them all and feel the different textures. These are the first toys they banged together to make noise. It is a good toy for them to share because they can each have 2 rings to play with while the post is between them.I gave this toy 4 stars because the star that sits on top is pretty useless. It is supposed to be the trigger to press the button on top and play music, but it just sits on top so there is no way to keep it with the stacker. My kids just press the button to play the music, and the star is somewhere buried in the toy box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't impressed","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter's #1 b-day.

When we bring it out my daughter initially sits and stares at it, then quickly goes from staring to crying, and to down right scared. This might be fine for a baby who has siblings, or who is used to a busy home. In my house, this toy does not fit in. My daughters doctor likes to call this toy the \\"seizure toy.\\" With all of the lights, and sounds you are going to quickly find out if you can cause your baby to have seizures.

We got it when he was about 6 months old and he continues to be fascinated by it - he loves to push the button on top to get the music out. The music itself is also pleasing (unlike some other toys) - it consists of a few measures of various familiar classical music pieces - the pieces change each time he pushes the button. The measures are not too long or too short. Overall, this is a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive, durable and holds my kids interest for much longer than other toys","review":"I haven't reviewed many toys but this one deserves a review. I have two kids who are now 14 and 16 months old. We've had this toy since our youngest was a baby and he's as interested in it as he ever was. He plays with it differently now but I'm amazed how it's kept his interest long after he's tired of most other toys. The stars are large, round and fun for them to hold. They even love dropping them on the tile floor as they bounce around, my kids laugh, pick them up and drop them again. I find the music and lights quite tolerable and of course best of all, it's fairly cheap. As others have mentioned, our kids can now begin to put the stars back in place. If every toy held their interest like this one, we'd be set for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for babies!","review":"This is a very engaging toy: the music is pleasant, the pieces sparkle, and the star is just too cute! The pieces are a little hard to get on and off but it's not a deal breaker. The only major improvement I could suggest would be making the stacking pieces softer! When I saw the pictures I thought they would kind of be a teether-material, kind of gel-like with a squishy foam star. I was way off though because the pieces are REALLY hard! My baby smacked herself in the chin with a few and it was not pretty. Obviously my fault for misinterpreting the picture but it would have been much better! Still, great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"We bought this toy two month ago and it's not working now. It looks fine but there is no more music and lights...

He was three months at the time, so he didn't really play with it, but a little while passed and the stars became great teethers. He liked to throw them at me, too. lol He's now 13 months and he still loves this toy. He has excellent coordination and I know that this toy had a big part in that. He can stack the stars on very quickly, and loves to press the button over and over, I guess he really likes the songs it plays. It's not too loud and never really gets annoying. I would be willing to purchase another one, but there is no need..even after daily prolonged play (and I mean this thing has been thrown, dropped and used to beat on the floor) and it's still going strong. Not even the paint is showing wear. I really recommend this toy to all new parents..it's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original stacker","review":"This toy is so much more fun than the original plastic stacker.

It has been one of the best purchases I have made so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the original!","review":"What I love about the original stacker is that the child has to put the rings on in the correct order for them to properly fit. With this electronic one, it doesn't matter which ring goes on first - the rings slide all the way to the bottom lights and music will go off. I was looking for a toy that would help teach my child about size/proportion and problem solving. This version quickly went into the get rid of pile and I bought the original stacker, which my son loves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard for baby to get rings on/off","review":"The rings get caught on the button that triggers the lights and music, making it too difficult to take them off and put them back on again by my little guy while he's learning how to do it. He just gets frustrated and becomes uniterested.We tried the classic rocker stacker and it was so easy to slide the rings on and off and he seems to really like it.

From the first time she saw it, she loved it. I had read that some people felt that it was too hard for their babies to activate the music, so I was a little concerned, but the other positive reviews made me give it a chance anyway. I am so glad I did. Although she is not really all that coordinated yet, she is able to make it play music by spinning the stars, and by partially taking them off. I am sure it will get lots of playtime as she continues to develop. It is solidly made and the music is pleasant and fairly low volume, so I don't think it will become tiresome to the adults in her life. Score one for Grandma and Grandpa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Bright","review":"My 7 month old baby girl enjoys the bright colors and sounds.

He was preemie so about a month behind on certain things. He was able to hold the stars and kick them off of their base which he found quite fun and was delighted when the stars flashed and made noise(via the base). He did not have enough coordination to keep from hitting his poor little head with the very hard plastic stars when he was waving them around. We switched back to the regular fisher price donut stacker until he was a little older(around 8mo).

It's an okay toy - neither my 11 month-old daughter nor I has ever found it to be very impressive, and the fact that it has no off switch nearly caused me to return it immediately upon receiving it. I kind of wish I had. It lights up and plays a loud song every time you touch it; how can there be no way to turn it down or off?!

He doesn't try to stack the stars yet but he loves how it lights up and enjoys the music and noises that it makes.It's very easy to keep clean and I think it's great. It is also easy to put away and I have not had to change the batteries yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic plastic ADD toy","review":"I reluctantly bought this toy [...]. I should have known better -- it's Fisher-Price! A couple of problems:1. It gives off a strong plasticky smell, even now, weeks after it was taken out of the box. It may be a \\"safe\\" kind of plastic (although after Fisher-Price's notorious 2007 recall I no longer trust them when they say their stuff is safe), but I still don't want my 9 month old mouthing it.2. Any stacking purpose of this toy is completely overshadowed by all the lights and sounds. This thing lights up like a Christmas tree! No kid is going to want to stack it; they'll just want to stare at it.This toy does not develop imagination or any kind of motor skills; this toy is designed for future TV viewers unable to concentrate on anything for longer than 5 minutes.

It was missing the yellow star on top (I didn't even know it was suppose to have that) but other than that was in great condition. So, it has held up well through a couple of babies so far. At first he simply enjoyed banging the stars together for a very loud effect. My now 11 mos old still hasn't gotten the hang of putting the stars back on the stick, but loves to pull them off and \\"drive\\" them around like cars in each hand. When he was younger he liked to hold the two smallest stars, but now he always goes for the largest two. He also enjoys pushing the little button on top which controls the music and lights. He pushes it and then shakes his shoulders back and forth, dancing with a giant smile on his face. When we returned home from a two week trip, this was the first toy he scampered toward, very excited to see it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent toy!","review":"When I met with the physical therapist about getting my 3-month old son to like tummy time [he hated it!] she used one of these. He loved it. He was fascinated by the lights. As he got bigger, he learned to pull off the stars. Then he learned how to push the button to play the music. He'll push it over and over and dance to it. Now he's almost a year and he's stacking the stars. It's an excellent toy for the money - it will grow with your child and no matter how many times they drop it, it still works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay while it Lasted","review":"Was very excited to buy this toy for my 7 month old baby. She was very attracted towards it and loved when she saw lights and sounds. But just after 2 use, the sound stopped playing.

It's one of the few toys that will calm him down when he is fussy. He enjoys listening to the music and looking at the changing lights. Definitely a good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Tale of Horror.","review":"I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original \\"Texas Chain Saw Massacre\\" and \\"Poltergeist\\" but this episode does not live up to his reputation. The story is blurry, unoriginal and not scary at all. It is a tale that has been told many times before. An angry demon of the earth, this time oil under the earth, enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother. Now years later it's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in. The story has no real clarity, and there is a no suspense or thrills just mass confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer. It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute. If you want some originality and horror watch Hooper's Season 1 contribution called \\"Dance of the Dead\\" and save yourself some time and money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, dull and definitely NOT horror","review":"The story follows a main character who is trying to cope with the untimely death of his 6 year old son from a rare heart condition. He also seems to suffer from an incredibly acute sense of hearing, which worsens with time. Common, everyday sounds begin to torture him as much as the death of his son.After approximately 10 minutes, I got the general premise and waited for the story to become more profound, more interesting, to insert a twist or two, to do anything other than annoy me with an orgy of overly loud everyday noises. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Oh, and absolutely no horror in it, unless you count the predictably lame ending... and I do not.Save yourself a buck or two, and more importantly, your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review for season one and two.","review":"Season one was great. I enjoyed all the episodes. My favorite episodes were \\"Cigarette Burns\\" and \\"Deer Woman\\".My least favorite episode was \\"homecoming\\" just thinking about it gets me down, I could write paragraphs about what I did not like about this episode but doing that would make me sound like the crybabies who wrote the episode. Getting to the boxset, I liked the packaging, each DVD came with it's own individual sleeve and a bonus disc which unfortunately I have not been able to get to but for the sixty dollars I paid for the set I don't feel robbed. Season two was ok, Family, pelts, were good but my favorite episode out of the series was \\"The Washingtonians\\". Overall the second season was disappointing, most of the episodes had weak stories. It's not hard to guess I have not purchased the season two box set and probably won't unless I find it for cheap. So the bottom line is spend your money on season one and rent season two."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PACKAGING CAME TO ME IN PERFECT CONDITION","review":"just thought you all should know had no problems with packaging and the teeth/dvd packaging everthing in it's place as it should be. i'll give a short review after i view all of the dvd's in this great set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"the skull is made of cheap plastic. item came totally TOOTHLESS because all the teeth fell out during the shipping. packaging is horrid.

As a result, the \\"teeth\\" fell out/broke and several of the discs were scratched. I recommend anyone looking to purchase this set in the future either buy it on site somewhere, buy it used and give specific packing instructions for the discs to be removed from the skull before shipping and for the skull to be securely wrapped, or download the episodes rather than purchasing a hard copy. But do not purchase it new and expect it to arrive in new condition. This is not necessarily Amazon's fault, so much as whatever fool designed the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"No music at all, but a great interview!","review":"There is no music here, but this a great Celine Dion Interview CD from 1992, nevertheless. She is quite humorous and at the same time serious. She really has a lot of interesting things to say. If you know someone who says Celine has a bad personality, any listen to this will get that out their head. She is especially cute when she cannot understand the word \\"flabbergasted\\" as she was still quite new to English. The only problem with this CD is that it is all one track, so if you are in the middle and accidentally flip the switch, you'll have to fastforward your way all the way back.

This movie in no way promotes this terrorist practice, but takes you inside the minds of two suicide bombers and their culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A celebration of death","review":"The film is a failure. Notwithstanding Hollywood's praise of this film,it fails to offer insight as to how such a culture of death would be celebrated and offered to Palestians, especially children. It attempts to justify those heinous acts which can not be justified. Putting a \\"human face\\" on evil does not humanize it .. Evil remains evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Justin (see below)","review":"I do happen to aggree with Erica too and I bet she wasn't being funny with her geography. You see, you should go and take out a current atlas and try to find Palestine. You might be looking for a while. Having made that point, I do think this movie glorified terrrorists, and in America our tolerance of these bombers should be extremely low. They have two choices. They could spend their lives enjoying what they have and spending time with their families and friends, or they could strap themselves with explosives and blow themselves up along with innocent people. To regular people, there is no choice. This movie was extrememly one sided and unfair toward the people who live in fear all the time yet choose the right thing to do and that's to act civilised and not to kill people."},{"rating":"1","title":"sickening","review":"I guess I feel guilty now of enjoying movies about serial killers (based on true stories such as bundie or sam), the thing that enrages me in regard with this movie is the humanization of suicide bombers, There is no dillema, the suicide bombers do not think twice during their last 24 hours before the deed. Why won't they make a movie about the suicide bombers of 9/11, how poor they were, how pure they were, how they loved thier families, and fighting for freedom, and how they had no choice in doing what they did. Obivously this movie has an agenda supporting the martirdom of a dark age society. There is art, and there is propaganda, there is no peaceful conclusion to the movie, no positive message. Its not even crafted right. If you never been under the knife of terrorism, and never felt the hate, and you are a mindless idiot, then you would like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad :-(","review":"In this movie, they say that they already live in a hell, but in death it will be paradise. It's sad that they don't have anything to live for. People like Jamal who are too weak and scared to do the dirty work themselves, put brainwashed people in their place and send them out to kill innocent people because they don't have any drive in their life. They don't have jobs or education etc so this gives them something to live for. They think they will be collected by angels after the act is done, but they won't.This movie shows two young men who are sent to be bombers. One is really eager, the other a little hesitant. Things don't go as smoothly as hoped for. It is an interesting look at their lives and the reasons behind why they want to do this for their families and their people. But I'm sorry, I just can't accept their choices. We aren't supposed to be pro-terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if possible","review":"This movie makes these terrorists out to be martyres. They are not. They are cowards who blow up innocent people. I thought we were supposed to be opposed to terrorists. The information on this page says this is set in Palestine. When I last looked on a map or atlas, there is no country called Palastine. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Your money would be better spent on almost anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"To understand is to forgive","review":"This is a good example of humanizing the modern Islamic terrorist. Film is an attempt to show that suicide bombers are also humans that have their doubts and feelings. They strugle, they suffer but they still carry on their mission.Great example of sophisticated Muslim extrmist propaganda.How would you feel for a movie about a pedophile who struggles and suffers and then goes out and rapes your child? Now imagine a movie from his point of view, portraying him in sympathetic light, showing how he is a victim of circumstances, poor misguided soul, his tragedy, his struggle.Same thing as this movie is doing.I wouldn't recommend this movie just for the mere attempt to push viewer into \\"understand and forgive\\" state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil Terrorist Move","review":"Reminded me of the Nazi propagands films of the 30's.

It punctuates the reasons behind so-called terrorism through the eyes of the victims of colonial abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I wanted this movie to be good so badly. These are deep issues that need to be brought to our attention; however, in the end the film did little to communicate a vague thesis with no conclusions either way.I am also disappointed in Warner Brothers trailer, this film was not the film or the message you see in the trailer. The marketing department worked their magic by changing the color, pacing, adding pop music and the ever dependable deep voice to completely change the films feel, message, and identity. It's one thing to try to resurrect a $100M blockbuster you've blown your summer budget on, it's something completely different to manipulate viewers when the themes, issues, and opinions run so deep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good...if you remember it is fiction.","review":"I think this is an extremely well made, powerful film showing some of the inner struggles of a pair of suicide-mass-murderers. It has some really intestesting things to show about how terror masters manipulate people and how a society where pride/shame is so central can become so terrible.Things to keep in mind: Unlike how it is shown in the film, most victims of Palestinian terrorism are civilians, including children, not military personnel. The film's characters recite \\"facts\\" about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that are hardly factual. This isn't necessarily problematic from my point of view. I am sure terrorists really do subscribe to that world view and a piece of art (as this surely is) is entitled to artistic license, but I'd hate for it to be confused for an accurate desciption of the facts underlying the conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD storage rack","review":"I love this Cd rack!

We begin with Euripides and Pericles in the ancient Greece and end with the latest crypto ideological movements, such as feminism, animal rights activism, green politics, and the end of history thesis.

I was even back in high school when I found this book from my sister's Dale Carnegie course and began reading it. While it's been nearly 20 years since I read this book, I've been carrying its principles ever since. The best part of this book and Carnegie's other landmark, \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\\" is it's all common sense. Sometimes, it's so easy to see the obvious until it's pointed out to you and illustrated with very easy to understand anecdotes. The book teaches you to live in day-tight compartments, to accept the worst-case scenario so you can be prepared to handle the consequences, to weigh the odds (Carnegie tells, for example, the story of how as a little boy he started crying because he thought he was going to be buried alive), etc. You won't find a lot of psycho-babble here, just real life experiences from real people to deal with an all too real problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnegie, the ancient father of self-help books","review":"Taking worry as a disease of the mind and equating it with the most awful disease a human being could suffer throughout his life, Mr. Carnegie uses inspiring life stories, including his own to show the futility of worry and set effective rules to combat itFor Mr. Carnegie, worry is the root disease that affects the mind and wreaks havoc in the body, and medicine did not take the time to study it carefully as it shouldHe shows how people like you and me who hit bottom could recover, turn events around and stay afloat, self helping themselves by way of eliminating pervasive worry from their lives employing those rules.This very well known book written in a simple and friendly language more than 50 years ago is still inspiring, useful and very convincing"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"This was one of the early books in the self-help genre that has proliferated into such a mass movement today.

He shows positive thinking that is more practical and frivilous than idle talk that I have come to see with the general positive thinking mindset.I would consider this one of the most powerful books for assisting worry. The solutions are practical, attainable, and applicable.

I cannot say that about any other book (or person or anything else) I've ever come across in my life.Risk a few dollars to try the book out. If what I say is true, you'll look back on the expenditure of that money as a fantastic investment. If not, you've lost a small amount of dough on what looked like a good risk.Personally, I wish I'd come across this book fifteen years ago.Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book!","review":"I was given a copy of this book by my psychologist and it completely changed my life. The strength of this book is in the fact that Dale Carnegie drew upon so many sources through research, interviewing people, and so on, to write this book. I was completely surprised that somebody as pessimistic and full of worry as me could completely change in such a short time - and that the benefits have stuck with me. With the help of this book and a few others, I was able to completely stop taking anti-depressants once I realized that the strength for changing my mind was inside of me and not in a pill. No matter how bad life can get, there is always a way to fight through it and actually still look at the bright side of things. I recommend buying this so you can highlight and keep it for re-reading. It is so full of insight that you'll definitely want to return to it time and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For everyone who says the glass is half empty.","review":"If your looking for a book to help calm your nerves or sooth your troubles you've found it. With his logical approach towards life's concerns, Dale Carnegie gives you back the perspective you always had but have since forgotten. In a classical style of writing the author curtails several famous quotations and writings, while tying up each chapter neatly. He gives simple principles that you can remember, while reassuring you in yourself, and in your God given abilities. I remember I was quite distraught when a business associate handed me this book. He said that it had helped him and that he wanted me to have it. I gave it a read, and the funny thing is I felt better within the first three chapeters. There is something unique about Dale Carnegie's books that leaves you with a contagious positivity. And so with such positivity I recommend this book to all individuals searching for another perspective on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST Read!","review":"I first bought this book for my kindle.

I felt this book was easy to read and the multiple examples helped drive home the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Really GOOD !!","review":"I was having this book for a long time in my library, but recently i've read it, the techneques which was described in the book are very simple, easy to use and IT WORKS !!It will not stop you from worrying but for sure it will reduce it.I recommend anyone who is jobless or with a searious illness or dispert to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"Dale Carnegie compiles time tested wisdom in this book of principles on how to avoid worrying about problems you can't affect. Carnegie outlines some basic principles to help you stop worrying. He draws from common sense, from people who have achieved peace and happiness, and from the sayings of philosophers, business leaders and others. Although Carnegie wrote his book in the 1940's and some of his examples may seem dated, his basic principles are timeless - in fact, ahead of his time. He presents them in an easy-to-read, personal way. He draws on his own and other people's experiences to show a number of techniques for letting go of worries and becoming more productive. We at getAbstract recommend this self-development classic to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute for boys room","review":"These curtains are cute but not as well made as I was anticipating. Fortunately, my son doesn't mess with them and for the price it's not a bad deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"seriously scary","review":"Speaking as someone who is rarely frightened by a horror film, (and I have seen quite a bit) this 37 year old didn't want to turn his lights off after seeing this.If your scary-bone is ultra sensitive to the eerie (as opposed to hacker/slasher shock value) then this movie will haunt the pants off of you.I felt that the plot's pacing/timing was perfect, and even the most frightening things had a way of coming off remarkably understated, which made it even creepier. The visuals are what truly make this film as terrifying as it is; lighting, use of color, staging of actors. It's quite brilliant. 45 minutes into watching it I knew that this was the scariest movie I had ever seen. (Besides \\"Wait Until Dark\\" with Audrey Hepburn.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulse won't make your pulse beat any faster","review":"I was hoping for something really scary, but Pulse's plot moves slowly and just isn't that frightening. In the beginning it's a little scary, but once you finally discover the concept you'll see it's pretty lame and the ending is even lamer. By the middle of the movie I was so frustrated with it's slowness, poor sound effects and lack of scariness that I was ready to turn it off and put in another DVD. Unfortunately, my friend made me see it through and he was disappointed with the movie as well. Afterward, we imitated the movie's sound effects and pretended we were the ghosts in the movie and had a good laugh. Definitely do not rent this if you've seen any good Asian horror movies before. Don't let the good ratings on Amazon fool you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pulse in \\"Pulse\\"","review":"This movie was DOA. If truly it frightens you, then for heaven's sake, stay away from movies like \\"The Grudge.\\" At 119 minutes, \\"Pulse\\" is about 118 minutes too long. There is a fake plane crash near the end. Don't bother to wait for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After I first saw this I gave it a much too kind 3 star review cause I was a big fan of Kurosawa's 'Cure' and I wanted to like this movie more than I did. Yeah, 'Pulse' has got a number of creepy moments, and it could be decent if you chopped it down by 40 minutes, but at this length it's just remarkably tiresome. The characters are utterly unmemorable and the the horror scenes themselves are generic, played out Asian horror cliches. They're passably well done as far as that kinda thing goes, but nothing exciting and the movie has a remarkable amount of down time which is filled simplistic, existentialist prattling. People wanna tell you this says something about alienation in the technological age, but it doesn't, nothing beyond the basic assertion that we are alienated.Not recommended. If you wanna see some Kiyoshi Kurosawa films, check out 'Cure' or 'Doppelganger' or maybe 'Seance'. (Though that last one definitely ain't great.)Grade: D+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent","review":"Another hit for Japanese horror! I thoroughly enjoyed this film and all the suspense it maintains throughout. Don't even bother renting it if you're a collector. Just run out and buy it. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this version, not the remake","review":"I saw the American remake first and was put off the idea of an original. Friends talked me into getting a copy (thank you) and as usual the original film is far and away the better version.A very disturbing film about ghosts, technology, internet despair, loneliness, and the collapse of society.Fascinating that special effects can be sparse, but you can have the wits scared out of you by one good professional contortionist. The movie does a great job of playing into visual and auditory notions of right and wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"all style - no substance","review":"like most current ghost and horror movies coming out of japan, in \\"pulse\\", almost nothing happens and what does is incomprehensible. some reviewers have raved about this flick being a masterpiece of a metaphor about the fragmentation of interpersonal relationship at least partially caused by the internet. if so, i missed the boat. it is all style, no substance, but the style of many of the images: deserted, burning gray tokyo, the grimy interiors and exteriors of housing, the horticultural workplace of some of the protagonists, the university computer room, the deserted factory, can be compelling, hence the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Up With These Subtitles?","review":"The movie is GREAT but I have a real problem with the subtitles. I've been watching subtitled movies for years and this is the first one where the actors speak and i have to wait a second to read the subtitle. Is anyone else noticing this? it doesn't kill the movie but it is definitely annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and with little drive","review":"The latest trend in horror is to address an old idea: the struggle of characters against and unidentifiable force that will always have power over them. There is a nice tension available in these kinds of works, that of anxious rage against insurmountable powers. But when does that tension just become a bland montage of vague threats that leave the lack of resolution disappointing rather than empathic? Pulse falls in the disappointing category--there are nice overtones of the problem with an overly technical world, but these are highly unrealized, and the movie seems to prefer pulling away from any kind of empathy rather than truly trying to scare the s*** out of the audience by letting them in just enough to really fear what they don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool jazz on a hot summer night","review":"Every time I hear this CD, I am transported to New York City, on a hot summer evening ... perhaps sitting on a fire escape trying to catch a cool breeze.

I had to study other textbooks and materials so I can pass the real exam. If I just study this book alone, I would fail the actual exam. The book is so wordy! Blah! Blah! Why do I want to hear long sentences. Just get to the point! And the sentence structure was terrible. I don't understand what was going on most of the time. Just focus on the subject without the jargon. Not enough on Windows XP and networking, but many questions had these on the actual exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I am sure that this book will serve the needs of most of the buyers as a competent treatment of the subject area. I am studying for the exam and wanted two things: A large set of practice questions for drill purposes (the cd had 30 questions) and a portable reference copy of the book. The ebook included can only by read from the cd according to the text file that comes with it, but in fact for me the book was totally unreadable from the CD on a PC or a Mac with serveral different versions of the adobe reader that I tried. I am not interested in reading a 900 page book just to pass an exam and found that the dummies book plus the testking questions were enough. This book did not suit my needs at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for only the Basics","review":"If you would like to know the basics of PC hardware and Microsoft Operating systems then this is the book for you. If you want to have the confidence of passing the A+ exam then I suggest you look for something else.

Maybe half of the exam was discussed in the book while the other half was questions that hinted at or not even discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great study guide, well organized","review":"I recently passed the A+ exam and found this book to be a real asset in combination with the Exam Cram 2 books (the Cram book and Practice questions for 220-301 and 220-302). This book was well organized and the information flowed very smoothly from chapter to chapter. There were a few \\"huh?\\" moments with some of the answers not matching the question, but they were very few by comparison with the total number of questions. What this book also has over the Exam Cram 2 book is the information on Operating Systems minimum system requirements, which is on the exam.

I'm an avid mystery reader, so I know what it takes to \\"hook\\" a reader. This book didn't have it. The setting was depressing, the characters uninteresting and unlikable, and I honestly didn't care about the storyline. If the main heroine turns you off, there's not much incentive to keep reading. Heaven Lee, a many-times-married former stripper, has no positive personality traits that make the reader care about her. I regret buying all the books in the series before reading the first. I will not read the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, how did this woman get published???","review":"After reading Tamar Myers, Phyllis Richman, and Diane Mott Davidson, I was really looking forward to another clever culinary mystery series.

Plus, there were so many supporting characters with common/similar names (Chris, Joe, Hank, Sam, Sal, Sol) that I had trouble keeping them all straight.

Even though these guys never got together at one time to record these songs, they still sound solid, cohesive and excellent. Gene Clark's \\"I Remember the Railroad\\" is no doubt autobiographical. You can hear the yearning and aching in his voice. This album, for me, points out how unique and impressive the Byrds were - too bad they didn't last longer in their 5 man configuration. Crosby's harmonies and McGuinn's leads are icing on the cake while Chris Hillman's bass playing is outstanding - easily one of the best bass players of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is reasonably clear from my predecessor's comments","review":"that he does not accept the Credo of the Roadmaster*; on this point we are at variance.

Cool, but no extras - except trailers - big deal. Where are the classic sci-fi expert commentaries and \\"making of\\" documentaries? C'mon Paramount!I can't imagine anyone not already familiar with these films, liking them, especially anyone much under 50. War Of The Worlds was one of my very favorite films from childhood. It doesn't hold up very well, but remains a nostalgic favorite. When Worlds Collide, never excited me very much, but is worth a look now and then. Maybe the problem is, Pal was a master with the visual aspects of movies, but couldn't do humans and genuine emotion very well. The characters look human, but act like plastic imitations. They're probably as smooth as Barbie and Ken, underneath. Also, as amazing as the special effects were, they're stone age compared to what movie lovers get and expect these days.If you know you want these movies, why don't you already have them?

The idea that these 2 shallow individuals were actually able to \\"fall in love\\" so quickly seemed ludacris to me. Lust maybe, but enough to last... I think not. I just didn't buy that a confirmed bachelor could see a woman in a wedding dress with pink hair and be ready to head to the alter, (or at least the bedroom).

If this is correct, then the best way to fight obesity will be to fight chronic infections. This is, needless to say, an unproven theory.\\" The author holds out the hope that in the future, sophisticated medical treatment will be available. For now, the author recommends reducing stressors: avoid alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, air travel, television, etc. The author also recommends some changes that are easier said than done: marry the right person, live within your means, trust God, and so on.

I thought with the bottom being able to hold umbrellas and with added weight to the bottom of the stand that it would be sturdy and not fall over, it is not sturdy at all (we tried on carpet and wood floor). If only hanging two coats recommend hanging on both sides to avoid it falling over, something to think about if you have small children or animals.

I had to re-screw it since I didn't look and it leaned a bit when I was done. It is strong and well-built and does NOT tip or lean over. You won't regret buying this for yourself or someone else.

Though I'm not a 49ers fan (GO COWBOYS), I still watched to witness Montana's prowess on the field.

Too long or too short and they won't work. The cable is a mechanical metal stick that is driven by the wheel and turns inside the cable housing to drive the mechanical clock inside the speedometer. It needs a pretty straight shot from the front fork dropouts to the mounting on the handlebar.These old things were fun as kids. They didn't last very long then and they don't last very long now either from a functionality standpoint. If you want it for cool factor on an old bike, this is the thing, surely.

Worse, I just bought a one speed beach cruiser coaster brake type bike and I don't think these are made for it. There was just not enough space. If I tried to the left of the fork nearest the spokes, it would require eliminating the inner nut that keeps the cone secure. when I tried the space to the outside of the fork leg, the trip lever won't reach inside the spokes. The problem is simple ... the center hole in the unit is just too small to fit over the cone and the cone locking nut so as to lay tight to the spoke side of the axle ... In sheer desparation I used a Dremel tool to cut out the axle sized hole all the way up to a hole big enough to slide over the cone and the cone stop nut.

Some companies you'll have heard of, but many you won't have. However, they're all successful in their various niches, some of them very competitive, because of what they're doing to stand out in the minds of their customers.Fans of Seth Godin will love this book and most people in business will be able to get something from it.

Half inspirational and half educational Seth delivers a great book. Purple Cow should become today \\"How to win friends (or customers) and influence people (or employees)\\". I came accross this book in a long round about way and I am glad I did because it is my new work bible.

I always wonder reading this kind of book if it was so easy to make a successful brand like to make a good cake. I'm sure it's not. The author seems to know all the keys of marketing and resume them in one idea : be remarkable. Isn't it too simplistic ? And what about be unremarkable by being always remarkable,think of United Colors of Benetton. The question is not approached. But the book is a good distraction for thoses who are interesting in funny and rationnal marketing short cuts. Anyway, remain to think in a singular way is always a good work to do in any job.

I can quote books that I have read in high school school but I can't quote anything from this book. It was very generic information that isn't unique to the book. That is ironic because the PURPLE COW is centered around being uniques. This book is everything but unique or special. It drags on even though it is very short. I can summarize the entire book for you:TV and mass media were new frontiers 50 years ago so fortunes could be made by putting a lot of money into advertising mediocre products. Today people have seen it all so they don't notice ads anymore. To be successful you need a PURPLE COW, meaning something shocking that causes people to tell their friends. Word of mouth is the BEST marketing because it is effective, economical and hard for competitors to duplicate. Most important it comes from a trusted source, your friend.

Its about as meaningful, helpful and deep as a thin coat of purple paint. A poor show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"What a waste of money. This book does nothing but ask questions that youve probably already asked yourself. He gives you no guidance on how to find the solutions your looking for, or how to become \\"remarkable\\".

I became a fan of Seth's work after reading this book. He addresses being different, thinking different and marketing different are keys to standing out and being noticed. I already was a believer in this philosophy, but Seth's numerous examples, enjoyable writing style and wit made this book a wonderful read. I think this is a must have book for any marketing person or entrepreneur. Once you read it, you will get hooked as a fan of Seth's style, and message. This book encourages you to examine what you are doing or not doing to be a leader in your industry. It challenges you to think outside the box, and create extraordinary campaigns, messages and results. We don't live in a world that allows ordinary to last very long.

A first grader could have done better","review":"Godin just tries too hard to be clever, but in the end he cannot seem to come up with the goods. I guess that is why he primarily writes about marketing instead of doing it. Perhaps the only thing that he is good at is marketing himself.I was hoping that this book would be an enlightening, fresh and interesting look at the techniques used by several successful contemporary companies to distinguish themselves in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Not so. Unfortunately, the premise of the book is erroneous!

I expect something exciting other than another book telling people to be different.

I would not recommend this book to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Marketing Fluff","review":"This book has lots of really great ideas for SOME but not all marketers.The reason I give this one star is because Godin makes big fat generalizations about marketing that are just not true or substantiated, particularly in reference to mass marketing. Mass marketing, TV marketing, and brand dominance through ad spend has not gone away and will NEVER go away.These pop culture/business/sociology books have been really well received lately because it's fun to think \\"all the rules have changed\\" and give groups of people names (the \\"sneezers\\"???). Well, the rules haven't actually haven't changed at all. Communication, delivery systems, tactics and operations are the big changing factors. Business strategy, marketing strategy, those are the same. Unfortunately, they make for a pretty dull and analytical read, hence the trend to whoop it up. Thanks, but no thanks. This is a disservice to serious marketers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little book with a lot of ideas","review":"I like books that offer all kinds of marketing ideas, and this book does just that. It's a little overpriced, but I guess just one good idea is worth some extra dollars. A lot of the things that make a purple cow stand out take a lot of money. Fun to read. A little education course on what works and what doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious, Random, Superficial Observations","review":"In my opinion this book is no more than a random collection of superficial thoughts & observations. There is no depth. Nothing substantial can be gathered from this book.I find the author's 1 page, vague recommendations completely useless. (Refer to \\"what should tide do?

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purple Cow - a light mid-afternoon snack of a book","review":"Having heard others describe this as a \\"visionary work\\" I read Purple Cow with great expectations. The central message of the book is \\"be different\\", in other words, don't follow industry norms or you'll never stand out and be noticed. Seth Godin certainly has some interesting ideas, and I have to say I agree with pretty much all of them, it's just that if one reads this book expecting to find deep intellectual stimulation or new marketing ideas one will be disappointed. It is essentially a lightweight thought-bite work, more a mid-afternoon snack than a feast of new ideas. If you read this book before reading Blue Ocean Strategy you'll find it stimulating. If you read Blue Ocean Strategy (W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne) first you'll find Purple Cow has altogether too little weight, research and well presented data to back up the central argument of the book. A good book to read on a short train ride to kill the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"purple patties","review":"i bought this book looking for something different to generate some creativity in my business life. well, it starts out interesting and i'm thinking \\"hmm.. that makes sense.\\" but as i keep going it changed into \\"duh! everyone knows that!\\" this book is just a new metaphor for the same idea - to stand out in business endeavors make yourself unique. i've read many books that preach the same thing. and i suppose that theory works because you think they are all different but they are not.. i think i'm going to writing a book about the same thing but come up with a catchy gimmick to sell more books before everyone catches on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you remarkable?

The man who has changed the way we think and even talk about marketing with Permission Marketing and Unleasing the Ideavirus extends his reach into the business world in general with Purple Cow, theorizing that you and/or your company must be remarkable to get noticed.This book is a quick read and well worth the afternoon it will take you. I found the case studies with real world Purple Cows excellent ways to demonstrate remarkability. After reading Purple Cow, you'll want to check out Seth's new e-book, 99 Purple Cows, with 99 more real world examples of the remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent book and thought provoking","review":"A very interesting read. I don't have much criticism, only wish it could lay out how. But I understand that there are infinite ways to go about creating a purple cow and no fool proof guaranteed way to go about doing so.A bit funny to see Apple listed as the 50th most valuable brand of 2002 just barely beating out xerox and 30 places behind Gillette.

Classic Godin, (remember \\"yoyodyne\\"?) he doesn't in fact differentiate his new work so much as borrow interest from someone else's work, to which he gives little credit, and from which he wrings credibility and goodwill that are not properly his.There's no good ethics here."},{"rating":"2","title":"How are you a purple cow?","review":"A twist on marketing. This is about niche marketing at the extreme. It's practical and makes you really think about your product or service and how it's a purple cow.

His \\"formula\\" for success is to differentiate your business, be remarkable and use original ideas. However, any business that follows his advice is by definition a follower, not a leader. It has been proven over and over again that followers succeed, not leaders. Leaders take the lumps while followers reap the benefits. It's much more expensive for a company to learn something the hard way than to learn from others mistakes. Look at successful knockoff businesses like mightyhot.com and bensbargains.net. They have virtually no operating costs and copied the business model perfected by larger competitors.Godin claims that you are better off by differentiating, but that's just a ploy to get you to buy his book. If you buy the book you've already fallen into his trap. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I feel suckered.

That's all.","review":"I think most readers, like me, already know the importance to make a product remarkable, innovative and outstanding (a purple cow in a group of brown) so as to differentiate it from the sea of competitors. What we want is the means to do it. It's disappointing that the author focused on the \\"why\\"s with many not so \\"accurate\\" or \\"relevant\\" examples and counter-examples, but failed to deliver the \\"how\\"s as promised on the book title: to transform and to be remarkable. He kept on criticizing the common 4Ps and the TV ad push type marketing, but couldnt bring out something new, systematic and practical for managers to follow, especially those who work in big corps where red tape had choked most of the innovation process. I am sorry to say this book simply lacks substance but is full of cliche. Unless marketing, customer-orientation and differentiation is something new to you, I am quite sure you will get the same opinion as mine if you can finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"20-20 hindsight is marvelous","review":"This feel good book simply reviews the past and Seth Godin takes the credit for making observations that support his superfluous theory.

That's the real purple cow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing book","review":"This is a totally amazing book! I usually dislike books aimed at changing my way of doing things (I hated Who Moved My Cheese? - how insipid can you get?), but this was incredible. Seth Godin talks about how marketing is changing, and how remarkable marketing is no longer the goal; having a remarkable product is.I am the owner of a very small landscaping business, and I picked this book up on a whim. I never expected it to change the way I look at myself, my company, and the world.Since reading Purple Cow, I have been seeing these theories play out everywhere I look. Purple Cow has tons of strategies for getting exactly what I want out of my business and my life.

I also believe being remarkable is all about creating a relevant remerkable temporary monopoly, and competing on the level where noone else has gone (yet. hence temporary). Is it easy to do?

Keeps you on your toes and definately a good writer. On the line of Cornwell..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Highly recommend this novel. The characters are well developed and there is a story about the relationships between the characters that happens parallel to the actual crime story but does not slow down the investigation of the crime at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Slaughter fan","review":"This was my first book by this author and I won't buy another of hers. Don't care for her writing or her characters. Just not my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Patricia Cornwell","review":"I bought this book w/ the anticipation that I had finally found someone to keep me preoccupied until PC comes out with her next book. This was terrible. The characters were ridiculous and although it was a guess until the end, the story line was bland. Lena is a horrible character - her past and the way is she is treated and treats others is really down right disgusting. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Faint Cold Fear","review":"I bought this book as it was recommened and was compared to novels by Patricia Cornwell. I read at least one book a week and I found this book not worth the read. The main character, Sara's sister has been brutally attacked and yet, Sara and her ex-husband spend more time in inane banter about their relationship than on the murders and Tessa's attack. I am sorry but the characters are weak and to compare this novel to Patricia Cornwell is a slap to Cornwell. Only buy this in paperback and used, if ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top form as usual.","review":"I've never read one of the Grant County books yet that I've not thoroughly enjoyed...even though I've read them completely out of order.I would recommend reading them the right way around though as the character developments really make sense that way...especially Lena's.Interesting deaths with a few surprises during post mortum, personal issues and believable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Faint Cold Fear","review":"I got about three fourths through the book and couldn't take anymore. I doubt seriously if I'll ever finish it. I just got fed up with the characters, particularly Lena and Jeff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable, unrealistic characters","review":"After reading Kisscut, I thought that I'd found a new author to add to my list of frequent reads. In Kisscut, I was able to overlook the unlikeability of Slaughter's characters because the rest of the book was pretty interesting. In A Faint Cold Fear, though, the despicable, unrealistic, miserable characters completely overwhelm the purported plot of the book. It's not merely that Slaughter's characters are \\"unsympathetic\\" or \\"unlikeable\\" as other reviewers have commented, it's that they behave completely irrationally and in ways that I can only hope no real person would.Although I NEVER give up on a book before finishing it, I put this one down half way through, and I will not purchase Slaughter again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of research","review":"I read all the reviews and not one mentioned a very glaring error. The terms \\"gauge,\\" \\"skeet,\\" \\"caliber,\\" and \\"rifle\\" are not synonymous. Yet, Karin Slaughter uses them together, switches back and forth between them to a confusing degree. I don't pretend to be an expert in firearms, but I do know that sportsmen shoot skeet with a shotgun, not a rifle. And the ammunition for a shotgun is measured by gauge, not caliber. A rifle is an entirely different weapon using ammo measured in calibers. And her coroner and a police chief don't know the difference? Come on now. I'm closing the book forever on page 143 and deliver me from careless authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been Much Better","review":"a troubling story in which the author supplies a cast of characters who ALL seem to have sexual-physical-mental abuse in their backgrounds, which affects their jobs and their personal relationships a little too much; it's very hard to empathize with a cast composed of totally wacko characters and leads one to question the authors background; does she really see the world as she presents it? or is she just trying too hard to shock for better book sales? such as the \\"kicker\\" ending in which Lena is revealed as having killed her boss after she had already disabled him and defended herself from his attempted physical abuse"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"First book I have read from this author: too much gratuitous violence and the characters were never sympathetic....I kept on reading to find out what happened but would not read another from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"KARIN SLAUGHTER HOOKS ME AGAIN","review":"I am hooked on Karin Slaughter books. Her characters are not \\"perfect\\" people, but flawed and real. Her story lines are rather gory, but no more so than what I read in the daily newspapers. She grips the reader from the beginning to the end. As a reader I can't wait to get to the end, but once I do, I want more.This book is a great beach read or one to read when you have time, as you won't want to put it down.I do suggest that you read her books in order of print. They are not sequential, but the characters and the story line are carried through her books.I want more and hope she keeps writing for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have given 5 stars","review":"but the ending completely floored me. This series was a page turner for me throughout...very well written, but after the ending of this last one in the Grant County series, I refuse to pick up another one from her. What a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnetic Influence for Success in any business","review":"I found this book most informative, uplifting and a great guide to prosperity. This is a fantastic book with great Hollywood insight which leads the way with a positive outlook. Hollywood Success has been believed to be based on \\"Who\\" you know, now with the aid and encouragement from Michele Blood and Rock Riddle we realize it's all about knowing and believing in yourself. Striving for dreams and attaining a magnificent, magnetic life...not just in Hollywood but anywhere anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile and important info, BUT...","review":"I noticed that no African American entertainers or producers were interviewed for this book. Maybe Michele doesn't know any black folks - hmmm. HOWEVER, I do recommend this book for anyone interested in an entertainment career. It gives an important slant on how to find work in the industry. It approaches the subject from both a metaphysical and practical viewpoint. The interviews from people working in the field were insightful and valuable. I would have given the book a 5 if there had been more diversity. I believe the experiences of successful \\"minority\\" entertainers would have given the book greater value."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Actor's Must!","review":"I found this book so full of practical wisdom and spiritual inspiration. For those of us who were born to be actors but have been floundering around trying to get somewhere with our dream this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Invisible Children","review":"This is the most incredible book. Every teacher, Pastor or individual that works with children with special needs must have a copy. It will help provide you with insight into the world of children with disabilities, and give you a better understanding of the problems that you might encounter while working with them. I read the first page and continued to read through the night. Could not put the book down. This is a book of solutions. The author is to be commended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as titled","review":"I returned this book as it is not as described. It seemed to recommend excluding rather than including students with disabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by Clark Howard","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who feels a need to advise family members pertinent information regarding all aspects of your everyday life (and death): i.e. bank account numbers, passwords, retirement data, bills owed, will location, detailed description of what you would like for your impending funeral, and numerous other areas for documenting things that only you would know that would be needed by the family upon your death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-toxic choices!","review":"This comprehensive book is a terrific resource for learning about and living more healthfully in our toxic world.

A marvelous array of photographs complement the engaging text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book!","review":"As a Eichler home owner I couldn't wait for this book to arrive and thankfully it was a joy to read and pour over all the original photos in the book. I always knew I owned a special home and now I own a wonderful book that validates that too. Even if you are not a Eichler homeowner, but rather just a fan of mid-century homes this is also a must have for your library as it goes into more then just Joe Eichler and his homes. Enjoy the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"Joseph Eichler is known for his 1950's Atrium homes.

I remember touring Eichler homes in Orange California with my parents. The homes, to me, were spectacular. My parents thought they seemed cheap. They were from the midwest and were used to brick homes built for powerful winters. We moved into another home several blocks from the Eichler Subdivision. I walked past the homes on they way to elementary school and just admired them so much. I guess I will never know what it is like to live in one, but I do know what it was like to tour an Eichler as a model home. What a memory! These are very special homes.Scott K Dolik"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic learning aid","review":"This product will help one create the correct wrist angle throughout the swing and most importantly, help create the correct wrist angle to compress the ball at impact!Helps with solid ball contact.

Greg's secret is he just picked your pocket for 28 bucks. It will hold your wrist back for a proper lag but it is uncomfortable and doesn't feel natural. And because of those two reasons you won't get mussel memory to hold that lag on your down stoke. The mind isn't going to repeat a certain wrist angle when it associates it with pain. A much better tool is a Smash Bag, 5 or 6 different companies make them and it is a true training tool. You will get much better on squaring up at impact and learning to delay your release to get that distance creating lag. I think Greg would be better off putting his name on a poster for restaurants on how to do the Heimlich maneuver, after all he is the King of Chokers, and thats no secret."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Long Shirt","review":"The shirt is great looking and well made; however, it is so very long.
