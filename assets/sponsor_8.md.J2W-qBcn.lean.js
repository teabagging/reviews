Yes, it does sound charming--a wonderfully angelic girl, but one must not go overboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Child Abuse","review":"I read this book because a friend said it was her favorite in childhood. I was horrified. In brief, it is the story of a child who is taught to be the worst kind of martyr, abused physically and mentally by her hideous father, and who never contradicts nor stands up for herself. THE PERFECT CHRISTIAN CHILD?

She is a little girl who lives in the 1850-60's, that time period. She eagerly awaits the day when her papa comes home, but is extremely disappointed when he does arrive, and doesn't like her. Elsie's grandfather had told Horace (her father) that Elsie wasn't a very good girl, so she isn't loved. Elsie's father is not a drunk, as some might think, but he is VERY harsh with her. Even after she wins his love, he is very strict, and isn't very indulgent; he is very careful about what she eats, wears, the kind of parties she goes to, etc. Elsie IS sometimes a 'goody two-shoes', but she's ok.

If this 'bonus features' producer really does like the movie so much then he should be utterly ashamed at himself for misleading fans this way. Old cast members tell you their favorite Fletch moments - big deal. This is worth buying it all over again? And a seperate chapter for 'best moments' when the previous chapter interviewed people talking about the exact same things?

In fact, it's one of the best comedies Hollywood has produced since the Marx Brothers. Fletch also serves as a masterclass in the now-defunct sub-genre of the comedy-thriller. This seemed all the rage in the 80's (the equally superb Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run being fine examples); a good storyline, strong villains and plenty of wisecracks.

Although the story primarily revolves around a corrupt LAPD and the drug trade, Fletch's sharp wit and determination reassures the viewer America is still 'it'. Chevy Chase was made for this role, there is no doubt about it. It is only sad that the sequel lost the intelligence of the novels. I too, have seen Fletch countless times and I am pleased (and reassured) to see there are others as well! Other feel-good 80's movies I keep watching again and again (don't ask me why) are, of course, Berverly Hills Cop and Golden Child with Eddie Murphy. All music by Faltermeyer as well as Top Gun.

I made one for the first time at home this past weekend and it was so deliciously chocolatey and tasted surprisingly similar to the hot chocolate I got in the restaurant.

Due to the stress of yanking paper and changing the roll, the anchors constantly weaken and loosen. The poles swivel down and the holder stops holding.Short of putting in recessed paper holders (which if you are starting from scratch is my recommended approach for a paper holder), this looked like the next best thing. The U shared design means that unlike paper holders with two independent poles that hold the roll axle, there is no way for the poles to rotate independently. I installed it with spring toggle anchors and tossed the plastic anchors it came with since the holes in my drywall have long use enlarged well beyond plastic anchors due to the constant repairs with the old paper holders.I plan to buy more of these for my other bathrooms.The only negative is that the paper roll axle is made of plastic, not chrome.Installed in less than 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I DIDN'T finish this book.","review":"I really tried to hang in there for this book and read it through to completion, but it just didn't' happen.

I cannot honestly say that I prefer one over the other, they just have a different style.

We then slow down into \\"Taking the Plunge\\". Honestly, I could do without the scatterbrained \\"Binky's Dream No. 6\\" as this is nothing more than mildly amusing. And on no other piece is Julio Fernandez's talent more apparent than on the awesome guitar solo on \\"PG\\". Then we move back to the past a bit in \\"Heartbeat\\". And nobody can forget the ever hummable \\"Mardi Gras\\" after which we slow down into \\"I Believe in You\\", just to pick up the pace and end with the mood lifting \\"Sunflurry\\".The group's style has changed somewhat here, but they're just as talented as ever at making good music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AC is electrifying","review":"Music's pre-eminent fusionists score again with this sparkling work.

Jay Beckenstein is a master of the sax and his style is one of the most distinctive and copied sounds in smooth jazz today. He is the godfather of smooth jazz and having met him personally after a performance, I can say he is a true gentleman as well. Definitely worth a listen.

It is true that his thoughts are everywhere today, and that some of his ideas have become canon-like, but why should that stop us from reading them?

The synopsis on the box was intriguing enough, although I realized the potential for a hackneyed portrayal of an all-too-common family comedy theme. I was hoping for a cleverly-written dark dramedy along the lines of a Charlie Kaufman or Wes Anderson film. What I experienced was a trite presentation of your textbook dysfunctional family.The film had its moments, but those moments were far too rare. There was little in the way of character development; in fact, the character who experienced the most development was the dead one. As screwed up as this family is, I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, and I couldn't bring myself to care about their lives even a little bit. Even the big revelation at the burial service, perhaps the most interesting moment in the film, was somewhat of a ho-hum moment.I really had high hopes for this one, but in the end it just fell flat for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Nothing original here.

While it may seem that so many locations would be difficult and time consuming for a young child to navigate, the layout is straightforward and each location has a distinctive look.My only complaint is that my 4.5 year old initally saved all of the animals with an hour. Unfortunately, the challenges do not change from game to game. You always find the same animal in the same location and use the same tools (found in the same locations) to rescue him/her.

The author ignores so much overwhelming evidence that runs counter to his many points, that by choosing instead to either ignore or omit them, Griffith's finished product becomes an exercise for its own sake.

I ended up at the RV dealer paying $65 for another product that did work but only if I super concentrated it above what they recommended. maybe it would work if your steaks are newer but I bought my RV from someone so maybe they haven't cleaned it in awhile, so that could be why it didn't work. If you have a lot of streaks and they have been there awhile, I don't think this is the product for you.

I bought these and replaced the conical design with this older stepped design and the leak stopped immediately. No local hardware store wants to sell this older design any longer in order to get owners to buy an entire stem/filling mechanism. The real answer for the leak (at least for two of my toilets) was the age and wear on this seal. I bought the package of ten (I have four toilets in the house) to replace them all since two of four have had recent issues. Now I have spares for next time. Better in my mind to spend a couple of dollars on a seal than to buy an entire new stem for tens to hundreds of dollars depending on the design and manufaturer of the toilet.

The software resizes the images automatically to fit the layout, but for some reason leaves the pictures pixelated and fuzzy. I took the pictures with a 6MP camera, and they look great when viewed on the computer or printed with other software, but when this software resized them they came out terrible.

It comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book. However, the kit itself is a little pricey considering that A) there's only 10 pages, B) the pages are only 5 x 7, and C) the pages are not double-sided. The software included, although as simple and easy-to-use as can be, is so limiting, it doesn't actually feel like you have made this book yourself. Instead, it's as though you're in preschool, bringing in the pictures and having Teacher put it together for you. You can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please, but there is seldom the precise one that you really want. It doesn't help that half of the themes have these cutesy \\"scrap book\\" elements that look absolutely ridiculous.However, the book itself is pretty slick once you make many, many comprimises.

I had to wash my hair immediately and color with a dark blonde to try and cover up this disaster. Now my hair is destroyed. I will say that after I had done my hair and it was bright YELLOW/ORANGE, it was pin straight. I assume that it will work great for other hair colors, but I am devastated by what has happened to my hair. I gave it one star because, it was straight afterwards.

Not only was the product a waste of time and money, but it cost me much more because I had to get my hair recoloured after.There is no warning on the packaging or the directions on the bottle despite the company insisting that there is. After contacting Organix/Vogue International, the customer service is among the poorest I have experienced. I told them that my (coloured) hair had turned an unnatural shade after following the instructions and I had to wash it out after 18 hours. They pretty much told me \\"sorry you feel that way and our directions on the packaging and bottle indicate to do a strand test\\". NOT TRUE!! If you read the packaging and bottle directions, they indicate no such thing. In fact the opposite - it says \\"safe on colour treated hair\\". When I scanned the packaging and directions and emailed them again as proof - they didn't even bother to respond.BAD PRODUCT!!! BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"I'd gotten highlights, and when I do, my hair feels like straw for a while afterwards. A couple days later, I picked this up and tried it. I could not believe the difference - my hair felt silkier than it had even before my highlights!

This will definitely be a staple in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"I am black with 4a/b type natural hair and this is the only product that got my hair straight and silky without a relaxer. I left it in for a little over 48hrs and flat ironed daily, when I washed it out my hair was in loose waves so I blow dried and flat ironed again using the flat iron spray from the same brand. My hair was light bouncy and most importantly, it stayed straight overnight.Usually when I flat iron before I can even finish my hair reverts because I live in a hot climate but its has been two days and and my hair is still straight without straightening again.Overall, I am happy with the results but I am not sure if I would use it again due to the amount of heat needed to get results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have really short hair and this product helps my hair once I have washed it and need to put some product it my hair that smells really good.

The process took me about four hours from start to finish, and I'm extremely disappointed that it was four hours of my life wasted.

I saw this product and that it's considered safe for color treated hair so I decided to give it a shot. The instructions and application were easy enough. The scent of the product was unpleasant. The appearance of my hair during the 48 hour wait wasn't what I consider leave the house worthy. The real trouble began during the wash out process after the 48 hour wait. Almost immediately, as I was shampooing my hair (in a well ventilated shower) I started to feel light-headed, dizzy, and nauseous. I finished up and my vision was literally spinning. This continued for 6+ hours post-wash. As for the condition of my hair, the cuticle is slightly smoother but the curl and wave remain. The hair at the nape of my neck was totally unchanged. It seems as though others had a good experience with the product but I did not, and I won't take the chance of using it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick on course wavy hair","review":"I used this as directed, and had disgusting, greasy, felt like candle wax hair for tow days--hate the smell of coconut so that made it worse--flat ironed and flat ironed and flat ironed like it said--ends still looked dry. looked shiney--felt dirty and gross and had to shampoo over and over and over to get the wax feeling out--so swithced back to my normal shampoo. worst part--my hair is still wavy--waste of time and money.

Had the Brazilian done by a professional once and loved it even though the straightness only held up for less than a month. Loved the shine but just can't afford it. So, very excited to have come across the product over the counter.Read the instruction but made 2 errors. 1. Put too much solution. Hair got real waxy. 2. No where on the instructions mention taking up to 3hrs. Would have waited to do the treatment after kids off to school instead of getting dinner ready. Hopefully, washing in 48 hrs will take away the wax and bring on the shine.Even though I didn't get the result yet I will definitely continue using it in the future. With practice I'll get a hang of it.Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!!","review":"I absolutely love this product!!!

I waited 48 hours before washing, as instructed. I washed with sulfate-free shampoo, as instructed. But as soon as I took the towel off of my head, every little spiral sprang right back up, as if I had never done a thing.

I saw this product claiming to be all natural and safe for color treated hair. It even says on the box that the treatment protects hair from the flat ironing portion of the treatment and encourages you to go over each 2\\" section 7-10 times. I'm pretty sure this not only fried my ends but also turned my hair ORANGE. I'm very thankful I stopped as soon as I noticed my hair was turning color and immediately washed the product out, so only a small section of my hair was affected. I have an emergency hair appointment with my stylist today and will be calling the company tomorrow to file a complaint. I WOULD NOT ADVISE USING THIS PRODUCT.

So, when I saw this product I thought I would give it a try rather then spend a couple of hundred dollars at the salon.This was a waste of my time and money. The only time my hair was straight was the 48 hours that I left the treatment on the hair. Once, I washed my hair (I did use the Organix Keratin shampoo and conditioner) it was as if I hadn't use the keratin therapy product at all. My hair was the same as it was before with the exception of the color. It definitely lightened my brown hair.I followed the directions step by step but did not get the results I was hoping for.

Ended up with a chemical burn to my ears that still hurts despite copious amounts of aloe vera applications. Also had to straighten my hair still to get rid of the frizz but it took 2x longer to get rid of the frizz and straighten my hair. Wont do it again, hope this helps others.

The product was very easy to use. It has a strong smell, but not a bed smell. I also must say that there was no way I was going to set my flat iron at 450. That's ridiculous! But also may be why it didn't work for me. I also only used a little less than half of the shampoo and keratin treatment. My hair looked amazing the first day though! Just washed it and air dried it, and poof! Frizz! It is shinier and feels a bit softer, but it did nothing for my frizz.

I have light brown hair with blond highlights and my hair is pretty stick straight. Treatment lasted about four months. With regards to the Organix product, it does take a while to apply, and if the directions are followed, does turn out similar to a Brazilian Keratin treatment. The downside is I washed my hair two days later with sulfite free shampoo, and my hair was a frizzy mess. I didn't use the remainder of the treatment as its just too time consuming for something that only lasts a day or two. My advice, save the money and get a real Brazilian Keratin treatment from a qualified stylist. Ask to speak to some of their clients and make sure they do good work. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work","review":"It did not discolor my blonde but....it didnt work. As a matter of fact I purchased two boxes and applied two different times.

Cautiously, I pulled it through a fourth time and, too my horror, the blonde sections transitioned into a deep, dull shade of reddish-orange.Even the process of blowing it out under a hot dryer has fully destroyed my color. In the sunlight, I can now see that all of my highlights have become very yellow and brassy.

I would encourage you to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard, we hardly know you","review":"While this book was funny and easy to read - there is a lot that Richard Simmons does not tell us - and even less pictures of his heftiness. (I would like to see him in his bright orange bibs at 260+ pounds.) He claims much of his family history is lost - so I guess he is compelled to lose his own personal history as well. Really, no more insight that anyone who has ever seen him or heard him speak already knows - more annoying than informative.

That was my only dissappointment. What an accomplished writer Richard is! That was a bonus (or should I say \\"treat\\"?) to have such vividly detailed, descriptive accounts. Being so squeeky-clean in content and absolutely hilarious -every few seconds my kids would hear me snicker.

After much research into thyroid conditions, symptoms and cures, I found that there are some nutrients that are required to increase the productivity of an under active thyroid, one being iodine (found in kelp/bladderwrack). Having taken this supplement for about a month, I can tell that my fatigue is leveling off and I am starting to lose weight with a my same workout routine. If you have having issues with losing weight and fatigue, and your doctor will not diagnosis thyroid issues based on a TSH level from blood work, you really should try this supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have taken this product as directed for a month. Prior to taking the product, I had a great deal of hair loss each time I combed my hair. Presently, I have very minimal if any hair loss.

(See Stacy Phillips' \\"The Dobro Book\\" for that.) However, Janet is a very clear instructor and has the good sense to include tunes you will actually want to play if you are oriented towards bluegrass/old time country rooted playing.I bought this book with the DVD and, although the production is a little grainy, the instructional value is first rate. It feels like Janet is giving you a private lesson in your living room. She's a very accomplished player, too.I was almost put off by the cheesy cartoon cover, but it came highly recommended and now I understand why.If you are a beginning dobro player, I think this is an ideal place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget's Review","review":"You are never too old to enjoy family-friendly movies.

It isn't pasturized or something and for a long time wasn't available. Now that it is, we are so happy. It looks like Brie - perhaps a bit runnier - but has much more scent and flavor. It's excellent on french bread. If you like the texture of Brie and Camembert and also like the pungence of a Gorgonzola, then this is worth a try. (Not that this tastes like Gorgonzola, but they are strong in a similar way.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alone in your mind","review":"I have to agree with the two reviewers who were less than enthusiastic. I picked this up because my husband comes from a family of 16 children. I was curious to see what Mr. Zanichkowsky had to say about his childhood. It wasn't at all what I was expecting. I waded through 261 pages of self-pity because I was hoping for some redeeming moral value, but I was disappointed. His sexual interest in his sisters disgusted me, as did his draft-dodging, thievery, and drug abuse. I probably could have understood the latter three if I had felt he was driven to it, but all I got from his personal account was that he did these things because he wanted to. It was all about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh....","review":"I can't believe I spent hours of my life reading this self-indulgent drivel. The guy should have kept this all in a journal and saved the rest of us from having to read it. It sounded like such an interesting premise, but it soon disintegrated into whiny mush. This guy has such an unremarkable life. I got sick of hearing about his lack of intimate relationships and his draft-dodging, pot-smoking, incest-driven existence. Many, many people have had lousy, abusive childhoods. Many people dodged the draft; everyone I know has smoked pot and drank and felt directionless. BIG DEAL! I sympathize with him because of the abuse, but I can't fathom how everyone's to blame for his problems except himself. For god's sake, his parents put a roof over his head, he had plenty of food, he even had toys. OK, so it wasn't the most loving household, but after he moved out, he could have done something with his life. Other than publish this boring, self important volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searingly honest and poignant","review":"This is a marvelous book. He writes of abuse and degradation without feeling sorry for himself. He tries to understand without resorting to justification or pity. I'm sure it took him a lot of therapy to get to the point where he could create this book, but it was money very well spent.If anyone wants to read more about the neighborhood he grew up in, I recommend \\"Spider Stumbled\\" by Frank Paul Venis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"You get 5 CDs for basically the price of one, plus a lyrics and chord book and, for some reason, stickers.

Beautiful packaging!!! Poster!!! Song Book!!! How is even making a dime off this collection? I guess it's his little Christmas present to all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy this on itunes!","review":"This is definitely something you should physically own.

There's everything included here...Great, New, Original Music from Sufjan...A number of Classics done in Sufjan's style - some verbatim and some new arrangements as well...plus some Hymns created with class. This is probably the best new Christmas music i've found in at least 10 years. As much as I like \\"White Christmas\\" i can appreciate an artist who stays away from the typical songs that have been remade by everyone who ever ventured to make their own Christmas album. 42 songs on 5 discs...plus stickers, memoirs, a cartoon, a comic, a songbook, AND a family portrait? Thanks, Sufjan! Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the way he does the classics...","review":"I LOVE Sufjan's music. There is a lot of music here and sometimes more is less. I think some of his compositions ramble too much and don't capture the Christmas spirit as much, but I still give the collection a hearty thumbs up for it's originality as is Sufjan, a true original and that IS refreshing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, unique Christmas music!","review":"I got this CD for my sister for Christmas and she loved it.

By the time Miss Nelson returns, they have learned to show their appreciation by behaving well. A great moral, certainly, but hardly sugar-coated: the children's misbehavior and the substitute's grouchiness are outrageous and delightful. This book is one of the most engaging I've ever read to my kids(ages 4-7)and a great success with my ADD child who normally has a hard time sitting through a story. It provides a great platform for inferencing and theory of mind work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Nelson Is A Lifesaver","review":"... we read about 9 stories a day (2 circle times in the morning and 1 story time in the afternoon before our sing along time)I often end up repeating the same books over and over because we simply run out of stories with all those circle times for the last 7 months. I saw the Miss Nelson book while browsing in a book store on my way to class(I am also a full time college student). I remembered the book title but not the story.

My son who is 4 would not go into his school one day because of Ms. Swamp. His teacher uses this Miss Swamp to threaten the class and if they are not good, Ms. Swamp will come to the class. So I don't like it at all and probably more appropriate for much older kids that can understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Not for Young Children","review":"This book has been read to my child who is 3 years old. Because of this book my chold has not been able to attend daycare for 2 weeks. This book has made him scared of everything.

In this story, Miss Nelson's students in Room 207 took advantage of their sweet teacher. They threw spitballs, passed notes, flew paper airplanes, misbehaved during story time, and would not do their assignments. Miss Nelson had had enough so for weeks she dressed as a witch and called herself Miss Viola Swamp and treated the class badly. When she finally came back as herself, she wouldn't tell her class what had happened.

The 2 men in the documentary are talking like they are having a living room, or bar conversation about information they are familiar with, and perhaps assume the watchers are equally familiar. However, it is like walking in a room after the punchline of a joke was told, and you have to figure out what the joke was about. That said, I was interested enough in the title to shell out $3, but what a waste of money. My summary- this is a totally low budget and poorly produced quack-u-mentary, with a high amount of infused conspriacy theory, but lacking any real proof or story line. What does it need to be a more credible documentary? It needs to be organized with an order and presentation of infomration that provides the viewer a cohesive and compelling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is an excellent movie!","review":"I absolutely loved this movie and I think it is a shame that hardly anybody knows about it. I have watched a ton of crappy to average bargain bin horror movies but every once in a while you find a gem that somehow got lost in the crowd. This is one of those movies. My one complaint is that the alternate ending which is included on the DVD is soooo much better than the \\"real\\" ending (that I'm sure a bunch of corporate tards made them use so they could leave it open for a sequel). I always stop the dvd when I know the ending is coming and switch to the alternate ending and pretend the \\"real\\" ending doesn't exist. But regardless - this movie is definitely a diamond in the rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Promising Effort by First-Time Director","review":"Madhouse is a low-budget movie by first-time director William Butler. But don't let that fool you, or scare you away. The movie's creepy atmosphere, solid script and direction will leave you satisfied and looking forward to future efforts. Butler is able to get strong performances from his entire cast. Among the most notable actors/actresses are Jordan Ladd (Cabin Fever, Club Dread), Lance Henriksen (Alien series) and Joshua Leonard (Chronicles of Riddick). Butler's sets are genuinely sinister and creepy, which is critical for the subject material.

Great atmosphere for an asylum, and the actors do a great job of portraying the cream of the criminally insane. More mess than Shudder Island, so like I said it's a great movie for the horror fan.The plot was good building up to the surprise at the end, although I would have like to seen the movie go in a different direction.

Unfortunately, this book falls in the latter category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short","review":"The main flaw in this novel is that the author has only a superficial feel for the 1970's. Reading this book is like reading a travel guide about your hometown that leaves you wondering whether the author has ever been there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused","review":"Susan Choi is a fine writer with an understanding of the complex layers of humanity; however, in her novel American Woman these layers rarely came together to create full characters. Details of life habits do not, of themselves, endow life. The plot, borrowed from history, is nothing without the characters: how their inner reflections shape their external relationships. Unfortunately, Ms. Choi offers a profusion of details without definition, leaving Jenny and Frazer unfocused while Juan and Yvonne remain caricatures. Pauline is her most successful character--never her own person, but always as others see her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of effort, little payoff","review":"I read \\"American Woman\\" without knowing anything about it, and was shocked to discover somewhere along the way that it was supposed to be set in the 70s. The author makes no attempt to ground the novel in a period or mindset as others have noted, and the result is a very writerly, turgid ordeal. I kept going, hoping to find a resonant character or interesting idea, to little avail. By the end, however, I did work up some outrage--fury that writing programs and their progeny have so denatured and disemboweled American fiction. Fight the power!

Having read and enjoyed her first novel, I guess I expected much more from her second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book is overrated. The writing style is verbose, the dialog limited, and the characters are undeveloped. All of the characters sound the same. There is no character development. The author needs to go back to school. Some of the sentences are very carefully crafted, even poetic but other than that the book is overrated. The book's greatest strength is that is based on a fascinating event. It's puzzling that a young author would attempt this topic. At times, I thought how could she have possibly have understood this movement without living through it? Her depiction of that time period is oversimplified and trivializes history. If you are bored and have extra time, the book is entertaining due to the Patty Hearst theme. Otherwise, I would save my money and time. The author is a frustrated poetic and not a novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Cuco-","review":"Excelente de verdad es la manera mas facil de explicar la m'sica en este cd.

This is biography-as-term-paper, rather than as a transformative effort to place a vital human being in the context of place and time, as the best biographers try to do.

I wish that they had concentrated more on the really interesting moments and left out half of what did make it into the film.

It was a smart move not to call it \\"The best of\\" or any of those hokey catch phrases for someone's idea of sample mix.There is enough Dylan to satisfy just about anyone. The first hand full of songs were also made famous by other singers and you have to get over trying to compare, unless like me it has always been Dylan first. Later you get to the good songs; He may not have personally thought so, but many of the songs struck a cord with me such as \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\\"To understand most of theses songs it would be best to buy a biography or watch one fro A&E.; However with out knowing the man behind the song they will still standout in your mind for years.Still \\"The Times They Are A-Changin\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview but could be much better","review":"This new 2-CD collection spanning Dylan's entire career up to the present (ending with \\"Things Have Changed\\" from the film THE WONDER BOYS), but it gets off cheap by not filling out each CD a bit more. For instance, as other reviewers have clearly noted, one of his biggest hits and greatest songs \\"I Want You\\" is missing. I noticed that this was the one song from his GREATEST HITS VOL. 1 that was omitted on this collection, which makes me think that Columbia deliberately omitted it so that GHV1 wouldn't become obsolete. (Is a fully remastered back-catalog in the works?) The 2nd disc nicely fills in the gaps following Bob Dylan's debatable musical decline in the late 70's in which the hits and AOR airplay began to dry up. In short, this is a good place to start, but plan on buying several of his hopefully remastered albums in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aw for chrissake people!!","review":"Aw for chrissake people!!

You don't see chapters from different Stephen King novels rolled into one........I must say that if you want to be a Dylan fan you should buy the quintesenntial quartet of Blonde On Blonde, Blood On The Tracks (my favorite), Bringing it All Back Home, and Highway 61 Revisited. But for established Dylan fans like myself, \\"Essential\\" is a way to reflect on the immense talent that this man has had. The entire album tracks his career from his early folk days with \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", to the day he plugged in the guitar to his oscar winning \\"Times Have Changed\\". \\"Essential Dylan\\" is not a must its a guilty pleasure that I think you should enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the master","review":"this but a brief glimpse into the continueing career of the one true master singer/songwriter. god willing there will be many many more essentials coming our way from Mr Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song selections!

Another current singer/songwriter from the Dylan, Chapin, and Cat Stevens school is the ultra-fantastic 28 year old talent from New Jersey, Steven Delopoulos.

I bought this album the other day at best buy for $25, and I sure wish I had looked at Amazon first because this price of $16 and some change is very very fair.

You write a bunch of drivel that makes no sense, talk your way through songs and cultivate the image of a \\"poet\\". Lots of people will fall for it, just like they fell for Dylan's contemporary Andy Warhol. I've studied popular songwriting for practically my whole life and I therefore have listened to all the major Dylan recordings; only a very few are anything but drivel.

But he belongs in poetry, not in music, or he should have at least sometime over the last 40 years taken a small share of his millions of dollars and taken voice lessons. Because I know from vocal experiences that ANYONE can learn to sing at a professional level. I mean the fact is 'as is' he's not where he needs to be and as a performer he should be not so much looking past his wealth, because I know that still means alot to any preformer, but he should be putting his first priority in making sure the people who pay his checks get the best possible product, even if he's no Freddie Mercury or Billy Joel just the best Bob can do. and he in my eyes is no true performer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmmmmmmmm.........TERRIFIC","review":"Bob Dylan is most certainly amongst the best singers of all time with more than 20 platinum albums and superb songs like BLOWIN IN THE WIND,LIKE A ROLLING STONE and SLOW TRAIN COMING.Pay no attention to the one star fool below me and get this classic.This collection is good so get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Greatest Hits From Dylan","review":"Knowing that it is impossible to compile Dylan's 40 year career into one greatest hits package, this two disc collection does a fine job of trying.

Even if you are already a Dylan fan, however, this collection is nice because it includes \\"Things Have Changed\\"(previously, it was only avaible on the WonderBoys Soundtrack).

If you have to resort to that, his talent is completely over your head. Look at this track list - 30 of the greatest songs in American popular music & he wrote every single one & had huge radio hits with many of them. Granted, there are versions of these tunes out there that surpass the original recordings in terms of sing-along-ability & pleasing listening. But that's hardly the point. So his poetry is not your thing? Then why come here & review an album you obviously haven't even purchased or listened to??

I thought Katrinka's personality was mildy ridiculous considering her mental problem and her ventroliquism.

Now I know to only use very soft, ripe fruit and it works great. My kids LOVE helping me and they stand and turn the handle. I also used the sauce maker for apple, pear, and peach sauce. I cannot believe the time it saves because I just cut up the fruit, cooked it in big stalk pots and poured it through the sauce maker.

Every time you bump the hopper, whether when filling it or just turning the handle, it lets juice leak out. And it makes a much bigger mess then needed, not to mention wasting juice. It does the job, but it just is not the quality of a Victorio Brand strainer. The tabs on the waste extension are breaking, and the juice slide thing doesn't sit on it right, never did.

The author needs to work on writing in a more mature conversation style for her adults. The plot is okay, but the constant interfering of Hannah & others in an actual police investigation is not plausible.

And when Hannah bakes her first dessert on TV, Strawberry Shortcake Swensen, she gives most of the cake for Boyd to take home, only to later discover the strawberry juice from the remainder of her cake mixed in with Boyd Watson's blood. As another murder investigation begins, Hannah gets her urges to sleuth again, and submits to those urges. Joanne Fluke has woven another great tale, along with the introduction of a silent battle between Norman Rhodes the cuddly dentist, and Mike Kingston the sexy cop for Hannah's sweetheart affection. A great novel. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"What a cozy mystery and wonderful recipes. Two things I love! Baking and reading!

Mr. Brisard and Mr. Dasquie are intelligence researchers on par with Janes, and have outlined every financial link between Saudi Arabia and its wayward children (Osama bin Laden, et al.) and elements with the current and previous administrations that they could find. It uncovers some pretty important connections between Texas oil men and Saudi bankers (and through the bankers, terrorists) and another between Hamid Karzai (the current President of Afghanistan) and UNOCAL, the main oil developer in Afghanistan before September 11th. In my opinion these are all things which should absolutely have come to light many years ago, and are of utmost importance now, because they show September 11th would not have been possible had the United States adopted a more hands off role in Central Asia, and how elements in the Bush administration are still allied with groups that support terrorism against the United States and why."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like Forbidden Libel","review":"I found this book utterly fascinating when it came out and I have followed the contents and authors closely.

You only get cards from Blue Eyes White Dragon to Pharaonic Guardian, promo cards, Japanese cards, and some animated scards. Another is the 3D battling. The monsters only appear when they attack and all you see is 3 second glimpse of the attack. It doesn't actually look they were attacking. Also this game has no story mode.

Just a series of triple duels you can play and once you beat the 15th triple duel, nothing else happens. Sure, you can get new cards by playing people over again, but what's the point if there no one else to play.In addition, your opponents are fairly easy and become quite predictable, so you don't even need a great deck to do very well.You do start with fairly integrated starting decks, which is about the only strong point.I was very dissatisfied with this game.

I felt like the directors of the show were really stretching to make a connection within the topic of each chapter. To the lesser-informed this DVD might give you some background of the world of contemporary art but it will most likely confuse you as it does.To make a long story short, I was looking for a DVD that would key me in on the artist's M.O. but really this set only shows you a general overview of their art while focusing on the artist's neuroses and not explaining the relevance of their works in recent history.My suggestion is to forego this DVD set, pick up a concise book on modern art and draw your own conclusions as you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro!","review":"I had one of these back in the '70s, loved it.

Reading this note does help some of the textual fog clear - but basically, this work seems the product of a confused mind. People and places show up in the narrative without even contextual clues as to their meaning, location or identity. I read constantly, and rarely observe such disjointed thinking on the part of an author.Too bad - otherwise the novel/mystery has potential. What were her editors thinking? Did she even HAVE editors? The dialogue is often quite clever and characters are inventively drawn. Overall, however, I am less than charmed by the use of a prostitute as protagonist. Is it really necessary?

A fascinating look at the mystery and pulp publishing field from the late 20's to the 70's. Woolrich tended to be reclusive and not always factual in recounting his life, so Nevins Jr. can only speculate on Woolrich's approach in writing, his personal life and family history. It is a very enjoyable read becuase of the way Nevens ties in Woolrich's main obsessions - the fear of annihilation, fear of losing loved ones, the feeling of the utter lonliness of the universe, and the certainty of randomness of fate - with all of his works - and finds worthy moments even in the tawdriest of Woolrich's pulp shorts (e.g. Vampire's Honeymoon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very \\"live\\" live CD","review":"Other reviewers comment on the renditions of classic songs being a little different. Well, that's the whole point of a \\"live\\" record, surely. If you want to hear the original studio versions, buy the studio albums.This, on the other hand, gives you a moment in time, a snapshot of Don McLean at his best. And there are several songs you won't find on his studio albums. There's also a great performer-audience thing going on that's better than on his other live cut. Babylon, when he divides up the audience and gets them to sing in parts, is quite something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don McLean - Greatest Hits Live","review":"This compilation of the \\"master's\\" work would seem to be as good as it gets. However, for whatever reason(s), a number of the classic McLean songs - American Pie, for one - are presented in a rendition that is noticeably foreign to the original. I was very disappointed and would NOT recommend this album to anyone looking for the \\"real\\" Don McLean."},{"rating":"1","title":"tuneless songs, trite lyrics","review":"Don McLean created one great album, American Pie. Evidently that was all he had in him, because he's never written another song I care to listen to. The songs on this \\"greatest hits\\" collection are dull, the singing bad even on the standards, and the lyrics trite: war is bad, greed is bad, love is good. There is even a kind of rap song in which McLean shows some awareness that, whatever he had, he's lost it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprising Seaman by:JPD grade5","review":"This stunninng book is about a gentle, unique, imprissively large dog named Seaman. This enormous dog was sold to Meriwether Lewis to take on his expodiation. Together,Lewis and Seaman explored the West. They fit together like a door in a doorway. Their friendship was rare. While they explored, they met Indians. The Indains called Seaman, 'Bear-dog.' This phenaminal book is for readers on a 3rd to 5th grade reading level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not cheesy at all","review":"I am *so glad* I got this book.If you're like me, you're thinking, \\"Lewis and Clark from the DOG'S point of view, huh? Too weird.\\" It's not.This book does such a great job with Lewis's personality, and with putting your child in touch with the expedition.My second grader (not an emotional person) couldn't stop reading it.It's a bit of a tearjerker -- the love between dog and man. Absolutely worthwhile, and one of the best books we've read all year.This edition is beautiful -- the cover and the dust jacket, the beautiful illustrations -- this is a very high-quality book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect entry point for Lewis & Clark books","review":"My daughter, age 8, is dog obsessed, and when I spied this book in the library, I knew it would be a perfect way to get her interested in the amazing tail of the Corps of Discovery and even non-fiction, real-life history in general. The book is very readable and accompanied by beautiful, lush, full-color, painted illustrations. Her favorite chapter is that which describes Lewis' near-brush with death while in the inadvertent path of a buffalo and Seaman's heroic alert. I read this book aloud with her, and soon after, she asked to check-out more Lewis & Clark books at the library to read on her own. Success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lewis and Clark and me: a dog's tale","review":"A different view of the Lewis & Clark expedition. Fascinating story.

I would suggest everyone purchase it.Its small size is also great, easy to put in a pocket, backpack or handbag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"This book was invaluable to us in Japan. The size made it easy to carry around and it had all of the basic words and phrases that we needed to communicate. (We did supplement with a English-Japanese dictionary for some words, so that's why I've given it 4 stars instead of 5.)The English was spelled out to make it easier to pronounce the Japanese words. In cases when I butchered the pronounciation and was not understood, I could show the book to someone who would read the Kanji symbols to see what I was trying to say.The book was organized in a way that made it easy to find the phrase you were looking for. I bookmarked frequently used pages so I could access them even quicker. This was definitely a great reference for traveling to Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good in the beginning, but after that, it's ok","review":"Just like I said. The first part of this phrasebook helps you understand grammar, small phrases, and many words, but after that it just tells you a lot of the things like sentences and more questions and answers.I recommend this if you are travelling, but if you are just trying to learn the language, I would not recommend it because it's hard to remember all of the questions, answers, and phrases it contains from about the 1/4 to the end of the book.But it was really good in explaining grammar, pronouns, and many other things.

I really liked it but it wasn't a part 3. I guess Side 1 was part 2 and part 3 was on the other side.There was another record released prior to East of Eden. I think it was called Stimulation. A couple songs sounded a little bit like the Police reggae stuff. Definately not trilogy material.Children of The Sun Revisited mentioned a Children of The Sun video/movie and... nothing.I was able to write to Billy Thorpe via his website and he responded.

Billy, for whatever reason, had a rather narrow appeal, but I am so freakin' glad that I caught on to what he was, who he was, what his music was about and how much it could move you. This recording is a classic and if you're on the fence about how it will sound or if it made the transfer from vinyl mastering to digital/CD mastering, worry no more.

This was light duty stuff, not sewing tents. I was making bags to wrap Christmas Presents in.

It felt as though I was talking to my doctor, and not listening to a news broadcast.

I am a Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship fan and have seen Marty Balin perform a number of times. Due to the poor quality of this release, it is not representative of a Marty Balin concert. It seemed like only one of the cameras (camcorders?) used was in focus, others blurred through most of the performance and the camera shake, at times, grew to be unbearable.

Bruce Cockburn's If I Had A Rocket Launcher is given Marty Balin's own arrangement.Unlike so many of the newer releases that place glitz over substance this one makes sure it is all about the performers on stage.It's nice to see the Airplane parts still flying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I watch a different DVD than you 5-star reviewers?","review":"Make no mistake, I wanted to like this DVD a lot, but there's no getting around the fact that at 65+ y.o. Marty's voice is pretty much shot, at least in a live setting. Yeah sure, the video production is amateur all the way, but if he had sounded halfway decent in the Boston show, I could have overlooked all that. He did not. I've heard other examples of this on the Mick's Picks live CD set from 2007. You find yourself being embarassed for the guy cuz he was one of the great ones. And yet his studio CD's from the past decade are pretty good.....go figure.There are some bonus tracks from other places, and two of them, Fitzgerald's 2006 and Madison, WI, 2007, are just him and Slick Aguilar, and they're not bad.

My biggest gripe is the filter. Its wicking power only lasts about 2 weeks, then the top part starts to dry out and get hard and brittle. After that, I flip it, but a couple of days later, the top is hard and brittle again. It reduces the effectiveness of the humidfier. To get maximum effect, you would have to replace the filter as soon as this top part is dry, which is about at the 14 day point.

I've gone back to Sears."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PRODUCTION OF MOZART'S FIRST OPERA","review":"This is a very innovative production that for the most part is very effective. Dance moves that could be from the movie \\"Dirty Dancing\\" might offend some, but are very effective. The brief appearance of an extra dressed only in floor length hair, which does not quite cover her, is less effective. Overall this is regietheater with a good plan that has meaning for all, not just the director.For fans of Malin Hartelius this a must have. For the first time on DVD she is cast as an older woman. She is perfect in every way.The cast is a very talented group of young singers who are new to me. Every one is very good.The orchestra is comprised of modern instruments expertly balanced. This is a nice change from the bright sound that has dominated early music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Sung Mozart at 12","review":"This is a libretto by an experienced writer of comic opera with a score by a uniquely talented 12 year old. Let us not compare it with what what the mature Mozart could do with the stimulus of an outstanding writer like DaPonte.Still as a traditional romantic farce, when well sung, it can be quite enjoyable. This production is typical of the Mozart 22 set, updating and revising words and music to fit the conception of the production staff. I did not object to the intent but found that it did not work in performance. No fault of the singer/actors; they made the most of what they were given vocally; what they were given to act, was however, to me, often written and staged to be a singular distraction from the operatic core.Clearly, viewers differ as to that judgment. If one is selecting but one DVD to buy, the reader will have to make his/her own predilections in making a choice.

The sections I use in my \\"cut and paste\\" haggadah for my seders from this and the other two haggadot in this collection always create discussion and debate. If you collect haggadot and/or use haggadot to create your own seder I highly recommend adding this edition to your collection.

The author is very articulate and the book is brilliant. Some of the main points of the book are listed below.1. We do not understand the danger of terrorism. We are dealing with a political movement with political ambitions. The terrorists are using religion as a cover.2. Our government needs major reforms. Discipline and accountability has to be a responsibility of government officials.3. We need to change our focus from national defense to national security. We need to form a national security university.4. We need better ways to respond globally to the terrorism threat. We need to rejuvenate NATO. NATO now has a global mission.5. The danger is in the Middle East.

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the plot of the movie could have been made better. Also, it is too short. I would love it if they show more scenes between Jackson and Bledel. Their love story is packed in this 20 minute scene and that (...) especially for a romantic (...) like me. The performances of the actors in the film are solid. Bledel and Jackson have a great chemistry - but I still wish that their love story could have been further explored by the director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Adapted and Executed","review":"Tuck Everlasting is definitely a one of the best films of the year, whether in acting, script, or direction. The film is almost 100 percent faithful to the book, capturing the enchanting style of Natalie Babbit's novel. Alex Bledel shows great acting talent as young, confined Winnie and an excellent supporting cast rounds out the movie- this includes Sissy Spacek, William Hurt, Ben Kingsley, and Victor Garber. Do yourself a favor and go see this film right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Family films have to be able to hold the attention of both young children and grown adults; Tuck Everlasting put me to sleep three times. The movie tries to feed off the enchanting idea of being able to live forever and remain forever young. Unfortunately Disney could not pull off the magic touch on this slacker.Almost the entire movie takes place in the woods, and while there was some great cinematography, there were almost no scenery changes. Most of this movie tried to be a period piece and hanging out in the woods all day long is a cheesy way to skip out on a budget. Disney has more than enough money to invest into something that could have been truly fantastic but instead produced a disappointment.Young teenagers might find the love story half way romantic and some people might get caught up in the forest bit, but I had difficulties staying awake and would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuckeverlasting","review":"wrong region number. it wont even play on the western hemisphere.

The characters were much more interesting, the action truer to the original Natalie Babbitt book, the sweet was sweeter, the evil eviler. It's too easy to portray evil as a leering, sneering, menacing \\"man in yellow\\". How much harder (and better) to put a pleasant face on it and let the actions speak for themselves. For all the characters it almost seems as though the director wrote down a two or three word description and told the actors, \\"This is your character; now, read your lines.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuck Everlasting - near to novel in many ways","review":"I purchased this DVD for my class to view after reading the novel.

This is my favourite part, because it has lots action and shooting. The jail break is also my favourite part because it a humorous and suspenseful. The movie is really suspenseful because of the music they used. The music makes me have different feelings. It makes me feel frightened, scared, dismayed, and other feelings.

What a disappointment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really sweet movie","review":"I haven't read the book yet, but this movie is really sweet. Alexis Bledel really shows a whole other side of her acting abilities in this movie, versus her role in the Gilmore Girls. The movie is about the Tuck family and their unique gift: they can not die. They were traveling west in the late 1700's when they stopped at a spring and drank from it. The spring had magical powers and granted them an immortal life. The movie focuses on the love story between young Winifred (Alexis) and the youngest Tuck son, Jesse. Someone discovers the Tuck's secret and eventually the Tucks have to leave, but not before Jesse has to decide between Winifred and his family. I won't spoil the ending, but overall I think this movie was well written and would be a great addition to any child or young adults collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Icing in the Oreo Cookie","review":"\`Dead Serious' is all that backs up Tuck Everlasting. If you're a person who likes a good action or comedy movie you'll drop dead after you see this movie. It's no \`Rush Hour' or \` Slap shot'. It's more like your classical \` Black Beauty', but if you're that kind of person then it is highly recommended. It has the idea of life and death. It's about a normal family who was going to settle in and they stop at a spring to refresh themselves with a bit of cool water, but the spring has a curse. Who ever takes a drink from the spring has everlasting life. For me the only expressive scenes were the start and the end of the movie. You know those Oreo cookies and the icing in the middle? Well the icing in my Oreo cookie has no icing in the it just like Tuck Everlastings middle part of the movie. This movie won't entertain any teenagers. There goes three of my rotten tomatoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but the ending was depressing","review":"This movie was great. But the reason why I only gave it 4 stars was because of the ending. It was very depressing which made me cry. I just don't like how the story is at the end.

Though I've never read the book I think I would've found it more enjoyable than the movie. Maybe it was the acting of Jonathen Jackson that really bugged me. That voice...My main question after the end. And maybe this was answered at one point in the movie but I'm not recalling it. If one drink from the spring gives them life everlasting. Why the heck are they still drinking from it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully made","review":"This is a film with mystery throughout. Slowly the mysteries are revealed and choices must be made which will influence each of the character's lives. The acting is convincing, particularlythe romantic leads Alexis Bledel, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy man; Jonathan Jackson, a young man with a secret to keep; and Ben Kingsley as a mysterious stranger whose selfish actions bring the situation in the movie to a climax. The setting is beautiful--a woods with a dark, yet cozy ambiance, and the background music adds to the mystical nature of the film.The one factor which kept me from giving this movie 5 stars was that it all seemed somehow familiar and I felt that I had seen this situation before. It does, however, pose some interesting philosophical questions and goes deeper than most Hollywood products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I am a teacher and have read this book with my fifth graders several times. They love it and I never grow tired of it. When the movie came out several years ago, my class at that time met at the theater to watch it. What a letdown for all of us! The story was changed and sexualized, I suppose, to make it more commercially appealing. The actors bore no resemblance to the lovable characters in the book. They absolutely ruined the story. It was a forgettable and disappointing movie for my students, but a long term bummer for me. If you are a fan of the book, do yourself a big favor and forget this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Best Book I've Ever Read!!!","review":"We just finished the book in class and then watched the movie.

However, the book is enchanting (and vastly superior to the movie). Unfortunately, all the changes made in the movie detract from the delightful character of the original story, so much so that there is only a shell left. If you read the book and are expecting this movie to tell the same story, it does not and you will be disappointed. If you have not read the book, I urge you to do so before seeing the movie, so the movie does not ruin what it retains of the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuck Everlasting DVD","review":"This DVD is a little disappointing if you are looking for it to follow the story line of the book. The book is about a 10 year old girl. The movie increases her age to 15 in order to appeal to a wider audience. In doing so, I believe they lost some of the real meaning behind the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i think this movie was a little over rated","review":"this was one movie i was looking forward to seeing but when i rented it this week it just was'nt as good as i thought it would be. i heard it was a good love story but i have sure seen a lot better. but the one thing i did'nt like the most was the ending it was so sad i heard so i had my kleenex's ready because i am a big CRIER at movies like this most of the time but this one i was very DRY EYED. so to me it was just over rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I liked how everything looked so real.

The movie came earlier then it said which was very helpful since I was ordering on short notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Secret","review":"Who even thought someone could live forever? The Tuck family happens to be a different family from other families. This movie was much better than the book. The movie has more suspense. The director of the movie shows this event by using flashbacks. He shows a flash back when Miles was telling Tuck about someone who was following Jesse and Miles. The director flashbacks to a spooky train scene with horror music, smoke, and fog. Right from out of the fog, a man in a yellow suit comes out of no where. My favorite part of the movie is when Miles and Jesse dressed up during the escaping of Mae and Tuck. I hope you will like the movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuck Everlasting","review":"I like the movie Tuck Everlasting way better than the book. The book is kind of plain , it just keeps flowing and nothing really exciting happens. To me I think the movie is a bit more humerous and exciting than the book. The movie has extra scenes like when Jesse and Winnie ran in the fields, and when they went swimming. There was some major changes in the movie compared to the book, Winnie was older about 15 and Jesse was 17 and they fell in love. It makes it more romantic. My favourite part about the movie was the jail break because it is different and more exciting than the book. Usually people think the book is better than the movie, but I think the movie is better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"This was a sweet movie that would be good for the whole family. The characters were real, actors fantastic and the plot was very intriguing. Though, I found it was a bit slow. I found this movie to be very one-sided, if you know what I mean. It wasn't complex at all. This could be a good thing (easy to understand), but could also cause the movie to, at times, be boring. When it comes down to it, this movie was very amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through!","review":"I bought this cd because I like their father's music so much, and i'm sure that's the last reason they would want for attracting an audience, but that's the reality! The cd has its moments but i found the music fairly weak and , truthfully, never listened to the whole thing! It is somewhat raw and poorly produced; they really can't sing - i found myself cringing in embarrassment for them on many songs. Their acclaim from better reviewers than I, is their simple, back to basics, no-fluff approach to songwriting, but I simply find their songs weak and leaning on a 'we'll do what we like in the studio' approach - ala Lennon in his early plastic-ono days; except they don't have the credentials he did! The Webb Bros. need to polish their act a bit... they do have the talent, they need to work on the craftsmanship of songwriting; perhaps reading their father's book may help!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught in a Webb","review":"On \\"Maroon,\\" Christiaan and Justin Webb blow up the mini multiplex vistas of their debut, Beyond the Biosphere, into a wide-screen panorama, fleshing out their tunes with blinding technicolor details. Much like the epic sweep of classic songs like \\"MacArthur Park\\" - written by none other than their famous father, songwriter Jimmy Webb - \\"Maroon\\" takes unexpected turns and twists that are as fun as they are jarring. With its sleigh bells, careering violins and ringing pianos, the album could overload on its own orchestral sugar high, but instead is underpinned with bleak moods and dizzying aural sensations that make for an extremely uneasy listening experience. With its extravagant shades of dark and light and its odd combination of surreal kitsch and lyrical brutalism, \\"Maroon\\" tills a sonic landscape that's truly unique. Call it muzak noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Biscotti !!","review":"I have tried many brands and Peggy's are all I ever buy anymore. I can dunk in coffee or tea and they never fall apart.

Here, the man who was a master blues songwriter in his own write pays his own tribute to some of the blues which prodded him to have a whack at it. There's a reverence evident in his readings, but it isn't as overt as you might expect given Reed's trademark (and deceptive) easy grooving vocal and harmonica style. Listen carefully and you hear the feeling rippling in, the feeling of a man who's treating this music like he's its near-equal at last, rather than just another kid whom it made want to play the blues. And there's Eddie Taylor, as usual, feeding the harmonicameister in the manner to which he was long and brilliantly accustomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modus Dei Rawked Live!!!!!","review":"I've seen Modus Dei live and thats what made me buy their cd.

For instance in one video you see a drum being hit when in the music there is a drum sound. They even show people lip syncing. Where's the mysterious story or visuals?

Aside from their albums and singles, not much can be seen or heard. American radio won't play them, American TV won't show their videos. However Enigma is one of the greatest musical creations ever. This collection of videos is exactly what fans have been waiting for. An extra glimpse into the ethereal world of this innovative group. Some of these videos are superb, others are just okay. But what some of the videos lack, the music more than makes up for it. The only things wrong with this video are the fact that it leaves out one of the best Enigma songs ever...\\"Out From The Deep\\". It's very peculiar that this one video is missing. Also, the US DVD will never be released with \\"Turn Around\\" from the Love Sensuality Devotion album. But bottom line, any fan of Enigma must have these videos.

You may also find Michael Cretu's earlier music good too - see Invisible Man, good CD even if sounds a bit 80s.One must love the quality of DVD and this DVD does the music videos great justice. Some of the first videos are a bit cheesy and have bad special effects, but the later videos are excellent.

The jokes are't that good, and a arm growing out of someone's back is not going to be enough to carry it. Judd Nelson and Bill Paxton are great actors and really try hard to work with what they have or I wouldn't even give it two stars. Want to watch some good unusual SciFi?

My 2 year old son is facinated with numbers and counting. All 4 episodes are geared towards counting and number recognition so the DVD is perfect for him. HOWEVER - unless you have an older child or have your DVD player positioned directly below your TV - it's very difficult to show your child that they need to point the remote at the DVD player - not the TV.

No matter how many times we programmed it, reset it, removed/replaced the batteries, it just would not work. Now we are forced to use the regular remote while she pretends the Mickey Mote works. Sad. For the record we have a Sony Blu-Ray player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Money!","review":"The remote is cheaply made. It only works on compatible DVD players and select episodes.

I would recommend it to anyone who has kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good ole' fashioned type cop movie...","review":"This movie is one of the best new releases I've seen this year. A good ole' fashion cop story...Kurt does a great job portraying a hard old school cop who takes no gruff from the bad guys, his ultimate goal is to see them go down no matter by what means. As usual Kurt Russell comes through with a good flick...be sure to see 3000 Miles to Graceland too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful","review":"Kurt Russell is talented actor so how did he end up in this piece of trash movie laden with over-the-top violence, harsh language and testostrone laden corrupt cops....? I should have stopped watching it when he came home to his lovely wife in a drunken stupor and spoke nothing but drunken vulgarities to her. I should have stopped there, but I thought the movie would get better but it never did. Hard to believe that Kurt Russell was....or should I say still is a sex symbol but after seeing this movie it certainly tarnished my image of him. Stay away from this movie....stay far, far, away!!!!! I'd give it negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Ugh. This is a rote, by the numbers, mind-numbing LA cop drama. You've seen the same thing done dozens of times, only better. The performances are lugubrious, the script is unremarkable. The basic premise of the film is that LAPD corruption was responsible for the riots in LA following the verdict in the Rodney King police beating case, and the film endeavors to show a slice of that corruption. The result is more of a lecture than a film, with too much emphasis put on hastily drawn characters with no apparent motivation for their actions and grandstanding socially conscious speeches that ring totally hollow. If you go into this expecting to see something on the order of LA Confidential, Colors or Training Day, you will be sadly disappointed. This film does not approach any of those on any level, except to appropriate something approximating their look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Blue","review":"Too bad too. Real potential. Balancing the actual story and then revealing the actual King case at the same time as the movie story was great. Ving was good. Kurt was fine. Kurupt was actually good also but everything else was hammy, silly, and overblown. The end was laughable, the relationship with Kurt and his wife was weak at best, and the overall script choices / direction is for the most part simply ridiculous. The partnership between Kurt and his young partner is better done in Training Day. The crossover plot choice is far better in Out of Sight. Even Kurt is better in Breakdown than in this movie. It was a fun rental, but just too implausible to watch more than once. Heck, I even enjoyed Unlawful Entry more than this, get that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I have seen","review":"I would like to mention firstly that Russell's perfomance was great, and was the only reason I didn't pull the plug on my dvd player half way thru this awful movie.When I sit down to watch a movie, I don't want to be preached at. The same politically correct formula is growing tiresome. In this case mean white hetro-sexual male cops form the good ole boys club. The movie actually goes as far as to insuate the LA riots (a true incedent) are related to the corrupt LA police force (a ficticous incedent per the lame movie).When watching a rented movie I would like a little more depth of plot. This drivel could have aired on and ABC Wednesday night movie....shallow and predictable.I you want a good lesson on how corrupt law enforcement is, and the only reason we have crime is because the criminals (rioters) have been victimized by the evil establishment this movie will spell that out for you. If you would rather watch something more intelligent steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical cop-hating flick","review":"First of all, if you've already seen L.A. Confidential, skip this movie, because it's just a cheap rip-off of it. The only difference is that there's no mystery about it -- everything is completely straightforward, and the audience just waits for the disgusting characters to figure it out.The first thing that made me angry about this film was its use of the Rodney King incident. I can't express how disgusted I am that this is continually used to show the \\"corruption\\" of police officers in our society. Of course what we didn't see was Rodney King fighting the cops, but since it's now frowned upon in our society for police officers to defend themselves, especially if the person attacking them is black, it's no surprise that the cops involved have all been made out to be Gestapo.If you enjoy movies that insinuate that all white cops are crooked, bribe-taking, evidence-planting murderers, then please rent this film. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"this can't be compared 2 training day","review":"this is a really bad copy of training day. Training day is way better than this movie. The movie was slow and sometimes really boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a telenovela than anything else.","review":"Plays like a made for tv movie, or worse. The script is so obvious and prosaic. There's drugs, sex, violence, dumb dialogue. I thought I was watching the lifetime channel for men. When has Kurt made a good movieanyways? The ending is decent and at least has a point, but damn, the first 100 minutes is like having your hair pulled out one strand at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ving Rhames is the man!!","review":"Talk about overlooked by the \\"mainstream\\"Ving Rhames is one of the most talented a versatile actors to come down the pike.He's excels in all his movies!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Blue","review":"I enjoy any film based on James Ellroy's novels such as L A Confidential. Kurt Russell is always top notch and the Rodney King setting of the LA story adds to the general film noir quality of the story. The character played by Russell goes through amazing changes and is amazing to see such acting. I recommend this high quality film.

No wonder BRING ON THE APOCALYPSE took so long to come to us (four years!)- they have finally gotten what I consider to be the perfect flow. BOTA is amazing- from the heavy guitars to the hard-hitting drums, from singer Aaron Greene's uniquely agressive voice to the thunderous bass- Forge have fans right where they should be- completely enveloped in their enormous wall of electrifying sound. Put the pedal to the metal, because Forge are back, bigger and better than ever, and it will blow you away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing & Fresh","review":"Forge blends meaningful lyrics with classic metal instrumentals for a truly unique sound. The new Album is by far their best work. The new members, John Dearry on guitar, and their new drummer Joe Smith, add an element of technicality and pure energy to the band. This album is most definently a must have for anyone who is looking for a great blend of many musical influnces and styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm-hearted nostalgia","review":"The author of this collection of short stories is a man of great heart and delicious humor. Starting with tales built on reminiscences of his childhood in semi-rural Oklahoma, Spradling explores some resonant--but ever unique--coming-of-age trials, then leads the reader through the kinds of incidents, painful and joyous, that populate all our lives. He ends with a hilarious and poignant account of how the weird carryings-on of Homo sapiens might look from the viewpoint of a most perceptive and lovable dog.Read these stories for their wit. Read them for the incisive ways they show us how it was in other times and places. Those places are mostly gone now, the times irretrievable, but, as \\"Mulberry Tree\\" reminds us, they are forever embedded in the story of America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful for infants","review":"I didn't find much usable information in this book. It basically said I can let a baby cry a little or cry a lot, but didn't give me any good steps for teaching him how to get to sleep and stay asleep on his own. I've since read a much more helpful book titled, \\"The Baby Sleep Solution\\" that does give good, concrete steps to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that easiy can be forgotten.","review":"There was a big disappointment in this book. It told me nothing new; the subjects covered have all been covered elsewhere, and very few Indian stories from the time of the battle are retold. Also, the physical size of the book, 9x12, is a mark against it, making it clumsy to handle and read unles you have a flat table to rest it on. On the plus side, though, it contains many photographs of the combatants, some which are rarely seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and lifeless","review":"Being SE Asian, I thought this would be an interesting film.I wasted a perfectly nice friday evening on this crappy film about a Pakistani ex-musician who is (illegally) selling donuts in NY.Poor direction, aimless storyline, average acting and terrible editing make it a colossal waste of the viewer's time.Avoid at all costs.1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, man had cart, worked hard and lost it the END!","review":"The movie was about a man that faced many of lifes problems because of the loss of his wife and not being able to support his son.

I have never been a regular exerciser and at 52 feel the consequences-- these simple stretches are easy to do, make me feel graceful and awake and have already made me more flexibile. I highly recommend this tape for a little out of shape, maybe a little older people who don't have much time for exercise. I use some of the stretches during the day after sitting at my computer for a long time -- it feels great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changes","review":"I didn't grow up watching the Partridge Family (it was before my time) but have loved watching the first 3 seasons. I found season 4 to have a very different feel to it. In part due to the annoying Ricky addition, and in part to the other various changes that happened. Each of the characters had a slightly different appearance while they had remained (for the most part) consitent. The other very large change, was their home. It appeared to have gone throught a complete remodel. Changes are not a bad thing, but when all of those changes happen at once, it causes a feeling of detachment from the viewer and the show.I will be watching seasons 1-3 over again, but will skip 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful with only one small complaint","review":"Get rid of Ricky, and it's a five-star rating. He detracts from the shows, except MAYBE the first one, where his presence in the story is relevant. But the rest of them are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Barney Video Instead","review":"I so love the Partridge Family but this final season ends each episode with the new 5 year-old character singing a song instead of a Partridge pop song. So don't get it unless you're prepared for tooth-achingly sweet songs sung by an unbelievably cute kid instead of the cheesy pop you love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like all TV shows...","review":"Unfortunately, the 4th season was a real let-down. Like all shows of that era (which I had forgotten about), as the writers struggled to meet deadlines, invariably one would come up with the idea of \\"Let's introduce a new character\\". In this case it was a neighborhood kid, about 3 feet tall, who wants to join their band. Two problems with that - His last name wasn't Partridge, and secondly, he had no talent.I have seasons 2 & 3, and they were very funny, but this 4th season was just uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Partridge Family fan","review":"I have enjoyed this show since I was a teenager, it is nice to get to see some of the good old shows from our youth.

As Hollywood is wont to do, it was spoiled by profanity, using the Lord's name in vain, indecent attire, and unnecessary references to sex. Why do the married couples always have to be bickering and screaming? The plot was sweet and the acting was very good, but all the aforementioned left a very bad taste in my mouth, and left me feeling like I just wasted two hours of my life. It is an old PG I guess. I would definitely give it a PG-13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"This album is one of the best albums on my short list of so far all time.

Buy this if you love well written poetic melodic beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated Songwriting Genius","review":"It's so strange that Cockburn, winner of multiple Junos (the Canadian equivilant of our Grammys) would be virtually unknown here in the U.S. He's one of the best songwriters of our day, intelligent, thoughtful, provocative lyrics abound. He's played the role of the hippy love-child, the religious zealot and, on this recording, the political activist. His songs about the violence in Latin America are heart wrenching, he puts a very real face on the horrors encountered there. Listen to the sincerity in his voice when he sings songs like 'If I Had a Rocket Launcher', it sounds as though he really could fire the rocket. This is not a recording for background music at dinner, it's a political manifesto, and it is powerful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"Not one of Bruce Cockburn's better albums, but it is listenable. \\"Charity of Night\\" & \\"Nothing but a Burning Light\\" are far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"canvas cleaner","review":"We bought a very old camper with very dirty canvas and we found this cleaner took very little to be successful, does not take a lot of rinsing and does not change the color of the canvas in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canvas cleaner","review":"The product is amazing, it cleaned a cabelas gear bag that I bought 20 years ago and had stains from cigarette smoke all over it.

I soon realized that it is priceless in that it explains the why and how as well as the what of cookery. Child's technique of presenting a master recipe then explaining on how simple additions or techniques make it something different allows a relatively inexperienced cook to see how the chemistry of cooking works. This book is nonthreatening and the illustrations are precise and not artsy. Using this book I have prepared dished I never had previously with success. It is volume well worth having and using."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia becomes a Chef","review":"This book represents Julia Child's first collaborative effort with two French friends to share the divine cuisine of France with Americans.

The horrible begging that used to start 1 hour or more before feeding time has stopped! It's true that you are restricted to feeding 1/4 cup or 1/2 cup at a time, but you can program it to dispense either 1/4 cup 3 times a day or 1/2 cup twice a day, or larger amounts 2 or 3 times a day. We never thought our cat could \\"free feed\\" or leave any food in a bowl, but now that we are feeding her 1/2 cup of (diet Iams) food at the exact same time each day, she actually leaves a little food in the bowl. I think it is because the machine is more precise than her people ever could be, so she doesn't feel like she has to eat everything all at once when she knows *exactly* when her next meal is coming.It's true that you have to reprogram if you take the batteries out.

My problem with the machine is that it is meant to be used for consistent portion control, but it seems to drop out a random amount of food each time.The other problem is that my cat should be eating 2/3 a cup per day, and there's no way to program that amount in.. It only dispenses in 1/4 cup increments. which wouldn't be so bad - I could supplement with treats or something, except that as I said above, it doesn't seem to be measuring the amounts at all when a meal is dispensed.

Losing all programming when you turn the unit off is inexcusable. I could deal with those problems, but the clock loses over an hour a day! Yes, I have fresh batteries. The unit has breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. However, there are limits as to the time you can select for the meals. Portion size is selectable, but is the same size for all meals. I wanted to have a larger portion in the morning and a smaller meal at night. The only way to do this is to assign 'lunch' a few minutes after breakfast, which can't be done. 'Lunch' can not be scheduled before noon. The workaround was to set the clock 12 hours out of sync.

The controller went out on both of them--I had it set to deliver 3/4 cup of food twice daily, but it was only putting out 1/4 cup. Not jammed, just a controller malfunction.

As stated in many previous reviews, programming is not exactly user friendly. Just takes a little practice. Keep the instructions. Take notes as you work thru programming.

It will not allow you to program 12pm or 12am...kinda weird, but my cat isn't that smart, does hinder you though when you are trying to set the time!!! Our cat was being way overfed, and this eliminates the problem of more than one person in the household feeding the cat 2 breakfast or 2 dinners, etc. I would recommend this product, just have patience while programming it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Maybe, if I had an indoor cat and could locate this feeder inside, I would rate it higher. However, I wanted to use this feeder for an outdoor cat on occasions when I was out of town for a day or two. Well, setting up the time, feeding times, amounts, etc is not simple, or at least it wasn't for me or my husband. The directions are lacking a few things!!! Then when you turn off the machine, it loses all the information you have spent hours (I mean it) putting in. While the next complaint is not related to the feeder directly, it is not squirrel proof. The squirrels ate a small hole in the top, I covered the feeder with a metal bucket and the squirrels ate around the opening where the food comes out. (Maybe it should be metal!) Then the feeder started making a loud buzzing sound, changed batteries, but still buzzed. So you see, I cannot in good conscience rate this feeder any higher than a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, but little competition.","review":"Where to begin? I purchased two - one for each cat since they have different dietary needs. One needed to be returned within a week. Great start.Whoever decided the programming method on this contraption was acceptable needs to be fired and banned from ever designing another consumer product. Petmate obviously chose the very cheapest conceivable design and it shows. These things keep horrible time, the three buttons to perform all functions are confusing and not easily pressed, and the programming is kludgy and buggy to say the lease. The minimum serving size is 1/4 cup and the maximum number of meals per day is 3. These limits are much too restrictive.At the time of purchase, there were no competing products on the market. Now I see a unit from ERGO for twice the price, which may be a ripoff but since it has better reviews I'm considering them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely unreliable","review":"This device worked fine for a few weeks, but then it started to dispense smaller than requested meals, and sometimes skipped them all-together. Reprograming it did not help. Changing the batteries did not help (and wasn't that fun, since it automatically means you have to reprogram it!). It looks like they've come out with a newer model, but I think I'll try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous. If your pet doesn't figure out how to steal from the hopper, s/he will starve.","review":"Don't buy this product. It is dangerous in several ways. I wrote a previous review criticizing this product for the following defects:1. Cat can easily retrieve extra food by sticking paw in hopper.2. Food container top does not attach securely, so it fell off, spilling food everywhere when3. My 8-lb cat knocked it over trying to get food out of the hopper,Now,4. the display is malfunctioning, claming low battery when it has brand-new Duracell batteries. It won't stay on for more than 30 seconds, and it loses all programming when it shuts off. There are several reviews from people who have had a similar problem, which I had not experienced at the time of my first review. When it shuts off once, it won't feed my cat anymore. Lame.less importantly:5. the food it dispenses (when it works) is about 2-3 times as much as it was set to dispense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fido is starving!","review":"This product is unreliable which renders it useless. After my first one would not dispense any food (after about three months) I sent it back to the manufacturer who promptly exchanged it for a new one. However, the same problem happened again after a month or so. The motor would run and no food would come out.The clock and timer are a little backwards but if you read the manual you can learn how to set it - that is not the problem. The problem is it doesn't dispense the food and if you aren't home to see it for yourself (which you probably aren't - that's why you got it in the first place) you may wind up starving your pets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this machine","review":"This was the worst machine i got ever, I bought the first one because I needed an auto feeder with a bigger case, so this was the biggest I found, it worked very well for a couple of months, after that it began behaving in avery weird way, so for example I set it to despence two rotations of food in every meal, I found that it stopped doing anything, I set it on 7 just to have it do the two I want, and after another 3 weeks it stopped doing any automatic work completely.I got the second one thinking that may be the first one was just bad because of luck, but the second one worked fine for one month, after that whenever the auto cycle starts, it works forever until it discharge all the food inside on the ground and carpet and it keep rotating forever until I press the OFF switch.So my experience with this machine is very bad, I used it to do 3 meals a day and every meal is 2 cups, not sure why mine worked this badly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TIME SAVER","review":"Setup is confusing but once up and running, it is a real time saver. My wife used to feed the cat twice a day (5:00 am and 5:00 pm). The cat was always anxious in the morning and constantly waking us up at 4:00 am to be fed. Now we don't even think about feeding time. It is very flexible on feeding times (3) and amount of food dispensed. My vet thinks it's the greatest and very healthy compared to the feeders that dump food in the hopper letting the cat eat as often and as much as he wants. I highly recommend this product. The reason I gave it four stars (I wanted to give it 4 and one-half) was because of the installation instructions. They need to be explained more clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great customer service/bad product","review":"Our first experience with this matchine worked great for about 4 months; then problems arose- - skipped feedings & incorrect feed amounts. For a fat, demanding cat this wasn't acceptable. We contacted the manufacturer who gladly replaced it; no questions asked.

The product is attractive, the customer service outstanding, but the entire unit works inconsistently and unreliably"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable, don't buy","review":"I have to read the instructions every time I want to program the clock or manually dispense food - the programming is not simple.

This item is so poorly designed, that I am suprised it took him 5 minutes to figure out how to get food on demand.If you just want to put 4 lbs of food out for your cat to eat whenever it decides it wants food, then this is the feeder for you - ME?

I already had one of those in my cupboard.I did write the customer service department explaining the flaws and my dissapointment with the product, but they never answered my correspondence.If you have 50 bucks laying around and want a nice bowl, get in touch with me - I have one laying around that I would let go for cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"We recently found out after using the product for a year that it is not dispensing the whole amount of food every time nor is it dispensing any food every time.

There is no way to adequately clean the inside, when I tried I was shocked to see how much grime had accumulated inside the mechanism.Any critter that one cares for shouldn't be getting food via this unit, eventually the uncleaned gunk that accumulates in the internals of this unit will contaminate otherwise fresh food that does through the mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"This automatic pet feeder definately NOT for puppies.","review":"This automatic pet feeder worked well the first two days, and then our 7 week old lab puppy started chewing on it each day. After seven days we had to throw it out. The directions clearly state that it is not for puppies, but we did not read that before we ordered it. Luckily our puppy did not eat the dangerous metal rod hinge, the plastic LED cover or the D-size batteries. Part of the battery cover was eaten. Our puppy quickly figured out how to lift the LED cover and what buttons to chew to release all of the food. She ate well for a week. Highly recommend this feeder not be used for puppies that like to chew.

I would recommend the Qpets petself electronic feeder instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cat goes hungry half the time or more","review":"The food I give my cat isn't all that big, but I'm still having a big problem with it coming through the feeder properly.

At 1st I got it to work after I finally figured out how to set the timer, which was frustrating to set, then it constantly went bonkers and overfed my cats evidenced by the extra \\"full\\" litterbox! I'm very disappointed in this product and am back to having my kind friends and neighbors feed my cat :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for smart cats!","review":"It was easy to program, and it definitely made our mornings more restful -- no more cat waking us up at 6am to be fed.But after about TWO DAYS our cat figured out how to get as much food as she wanted, by sticking her paw up the food shoot, as seen in another customer's video review. This makes it effectively useless. I don't know how the engineers on this didn't think to put some sort of guard in place to prevent this.Another problem is that the smallest feeding size is 1/4 a cup. The recommended amount of food for our cat is 1/2 cup per day, so we can only give her 2 feedings per day, not 3. Not a huge issue but not ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time saver... but","review":"I bought this feeder to help me stick to my cats' diet, as well as a backup when i'm out of town. For the most part, it's a great product, though i do have a few comlaints.1) I'm pretty tech savy, but this thing was a pain to set. Not at all intuitive, but still doable.2) When it gets near the end of the food, the remainder sits on the rim at the bottom, and does not empty into the hopper. This means kitty gets no food. Definitely something to watch out for. And don't expect it to feed all the way to the bottom if you are out of town more than say 5 days. Something any pet sitters should be on the lookout for.3) Only has 3 feedings/day. At .25 cup intervals, this means either too little food for 2 cats, or too much. And the individual feedings are not customizable, so all have to be the same amount of food. Needless to say my kitties were not happy to be cut from 1 cup/day to .75 cup/day. But they've managed.Overall, a good product, low price, very reliable. Glad i bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cat Feeder","review":"I set the timer, filled the storage area and have not had any problems since using it.

It's only been a month of daily use but I have been very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine","review":"it's the only automatic feeder i've tried and it works exactly as i expected it to. my cat has not managed to manipuate it to feed her when it's not supposed to, but then again she doesn't like dry food that much anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"About to buy my second","review":"I've had great success with the item. Yes, I agree that you have to get the instructions out each time you reprogram it. But since I only have to do that when I changed the batteries (which last for months) and when I was originally setting it up, it really isn't a problem.You do need to limit it to dry food; I can't see how it would work with moist food at all without gumming up the works. The minimum is 1/4 cup. If these don't meet your situation, I'd suggest one of those units where you manually measure out each of the meals for 4 - 8 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK","review":"Stopped dispensing the propper amount of food after one month. Total junk, don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, not so good in reality","review":"Thought this was a great idea; still do. It does feed on time but the measured amount it delivers is WAY off. I had it set to deliver two cups at each feeding and what actually came out was only 3/4 of a cup. My dog (who's huge) was starving all the time. Within a few weeks it stopped even delivering the number of \\"scoops\\" it was supposed to (8 scoops is supposed to equal 2 cups) and started delivering about half that. I'm back to feeding her on my own. I'm still searching for that perfect automatic feeder for long weekends away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Bistro is superb and EASY to program","review":"I had very low expectations for the Pet Bistro because of some of the reviews I'd read. Much to my surprise it was SUPER EASY to program. It took less than 5 minutes to unbox, load batteries, set the current time, program for 3 feedings, and load food into the hopper. Now Monty gets 3 1/4 cup feedings per day (instead of only two feedings with much larger quantities) and he's eating smaller portions. Hopefully he'll lose weight and become a leaner healthier cat with the help of the Pet Bistro. I love the Pet Bistro because I no longer have to worry about rushing home for feedings and the portion sizes are perfectly measured. Monty has adapted nicely to the change in his feeding routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT recommend","review":"I do not recommend this product. The design is poor and extremely easy for any cat to figure out how to get more food to fall out. The chute is wide open which invites this type of behavior. It also did not despense the correct amount of food. When set to 1/4 cup, it would only spit out a few morsels. I checked for jams, and found none. The food dish is also not a secure fit. It simply clicks in place, and can easily fall off, allowing even more access to the food. I would suggest another product. I may order the other model that LeBistro makes which I am familiar with. The chute is smaller, always dispenses the correct amount, and the food dish screws in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad programming problem","review":"I think even a computer programmer would find the programming on the LeBistro unnecessarily difficult and frustrating. On top of that, the programming on my unit stopped working entirely after the first 3-4 uses.This thing wasn't working for me anyway, since my cat could pop the lid and get into it easily. I had to cover the top with duct tape to keep him out, but he eventually chewed his way through that and dismantled the cheap plastic top.I know my cat's a freak, but I still wouldn't touch this product again with a 10-foot pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speachless","review":"Pros: Good ideaCons:Becomes a toy for dogs. Dispenses random amount from 0 cups to I have no idea. Unreliable. Check batteries often or be around for the first dispense. Confusing instructions. Lid is not tight or secure.

However no matter what I set the feeder to, it dispences 1 cup. I bought the feeder so that my cat could lose weight, but when the feeder is giving my cat more food than she ate before there's no point in spending $50 on a food dispencer. I tried to e-mail the seller and tell him/her my problem and never got a response. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The other reviewers were correct when it came to this product. Hard to program, exceeds the portion you set it to. Also, the screen on mine barely works. For instance, instead of 12:01 it will read 00:01 but at 1:01 it will read 1:01. Makes no sense. Also this product will not keep time. It looses about half an hour a day, so if you are going to depend on it to feed your animal at an exact time, don't bother. Wondering why I kept it if it sucks so bad? Well, this was the second one I had to have shipped to me, the first one wouldn't even turn on at all. Also, the only other portion controlled feeder by another company is $100 more, so that doesn't leave many options. I'm keeping it for now, but by no means do I depend on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"My wife and I purchased one of these from Amazon about 2 years ago, and it was great..I mean really great, solved all of our cat feeding issues. That one eventually died and I attributed it to two years of cat food oil going thru it. So we decided to get another from Amazon. We got it and it broke in two days..the display went out and the battery light kept coming on. So we returned it and the replacemet one didnt work at all. So we are returning that one.

Within two weeks, my \\"smarter\\" cat figured out he could stick his paw up the chute and wriggle treats out anytime he wanted. Eventually the dumber cat caught on as well, so now I only use the unit when I'm travelling and have to keep it hidden otherwise.Like other reviewers said, the programming is awful and laborous and annoying if you want to switch it on only on weekends or occassionally since it doesn't save the information and has to be reprogrammed every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work as advertised....","review":"I purchased my Le Bistro pet feeder about 1 month ago to make things easier on the person who was to watch my cats during my vacation. The item arrived very quickly, was easy to assemble, and fairly easy to program. It seemed to work like a charm. After a week however, the electronic clock began to slow, and was two hours behind the actual time. Then it began to dispense twice as much per feeding as I had it set for. I replaced the already new batteries with another set of new batteries, and still had the same issue after 1 week. Reprogramming does not seem to match the instructions. This item is fine for short term use, but not long term.... and please do not buy this if your pet has a medical condition requiring precise amounts/timing of food."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is more animals?","review":"I read several reviews before buying this product. Quite a few reviews said you could use this for a dog.. Hello!!A Dog? the lid just rests on the container, within one day the lid was off the entire plastic container was chewed and all the food was eaten. A child could knock it over. What makes the manufacturer think a dog can't get inside if he wanted too. What a waste of $. I can't even put it back together at this point. I was thinking if I could get it back together I could put something heavy on it.. or maybe rig a shoot off the bottom of the bowl and place the actual unit up on a high shelf..It's not like I own a massive dog either.. She's a mix of golden lab and boxer..she's a sweet dog, but when the opportunity to eat a lot comes her way she's all for it.In short, I am extremely dissappointed with the workmanship and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was an alternative to this product","review":"It's great to not have to worry about my dogs going hungry when I'm not at home.

They sent us a new one in about 3 weeks. We have two of them that we try and have go off at the same time. We have two black labs that must be part pig. The time doesn't stay synched very long. Batteries don't last long enough. I wish it ran on A/C. Programming it is not user friendly.

I had a problem at first regarding the timing of the food dispenser. For some reason it would dispense food about 30 minutes earlier than what it was set for, but it seems to be working fine now. You cannot set different meal sizes for different times of the day, which would be handy. Other than that, programming the feeder wasn't as difficult as the other reviews I read. I ordered two at the same time (one for the cats and one for my small dog), and they are definitely saving me some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"It took me a few minutes to figure out the programming but after I got the principle I had no problems programming two meals a day. The device can dispense up to three meals a day from sizes as small as a 1/4 cup to larger quantities.I left it for two weeks for my cat and was happy to learn that it worked flawlessly.

The second person was helpful but it took repeated calls before I was able to talk to her.The instructions she gave me were much different than the printed instructions.Once the unit was programmed per verbal instruction, the feeder would not dispense food!

But when he hops up on the bed or begins howling at the foot of the bed at 4:00 AM because he's hungry, I love him less. Being a big cat, if I leave too much food out for him, he'll just get bigger. After trying everything, I finally ordered this feeder. Ok, so the programming is non-intuitive. If you just follow the instructions closely, you can get it programmed. It is a bit odd, to say the least. It has a locking lid, and my cat has NOT tried to figure out how to get his food out. Once he got used to it, he now waits patiently for the \\"food slot machine\\" to pay out. I can actually get a full night's sleep again. This was the best money I've spent on sleep improvement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great convenience for a cat owner","review":"I love this feeder.

The clocks drift significantly (which is not that big a deal, but a bad sign about quality of craftsmanship, and kind of annoying since we have two that we would like to go off at roughly the same time) and after a year or so, they have begun to be very erratic in their behavior. Even though we just replaced the batteries, sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. The worst part, though, and I have seen this in other reviews, is that our cats have figured out how to stick their paws up in the slots and release kibble whenever they want. Since we got these to try to help our cats lose weight, this is not very helpful. We end up having to put the feeders up on the counter between meals, which kind of defeats the purpose of having automatic feeders. I don't know if there is a better quality product out there.

I got the featured multi-day/multi-times/day feeder thinking that if he had smaller portions available to him multiple times per day, maybe he would be more active (my cat's old - he's 15). I have the feeder set up to feed him 1/4 cup twice a day, but I think (as mentioned in earlier reviews), that the smaller the kibble, the less effective this feeder is in accurately measuring the portions. I like the idea behind the feeder, and I like that it doesn't need to be filled that often, but I wish it could be more exact in measurements.

My cat figured out how to jiggle food out of the chute in under 24 hours. The programming was a nightmare and when I did a manual feed, it wouldn't shut off! I had to take the batteries out. I also think it should be able to feed smaller portions. Finally, the lid on the hopper doesn't twist on securely. A determined animal would find a way to get it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good (needs a few enhancements)","review":"This product works very well! It is a little tricky programming it, but, just stick with it. The cons are 1) they need a larger unit, 2) they should increase the maximum amount of food that can be dispensed (it only allows up to 2 cups), and, 3) if you want to set the feeder to dispense at, say, two different times, you cannot have it dispense different amounts; that is, if you select 2 cups at 10 a.m., you cannot select 1-1/2 cups at 6 p.m., both have to be the same.

I had no problem with the programming. There was another review that I read that the hopper and lid does not fit securely. I had no problem with that. It does have a groove that the hopper and lid needs to rotate into. Another review said that their cat figured out he could steal a few kibbles that were left in the hopper. My cat has not figured that out yet. It would be great if they manufactor made this with an optional ac adapter. The reason I bought this was 1) my cat would wake us up early in the morning before his normal feeding time and 2) so he could lose weight on the low calorie cat food the vet ordered. Both have been accomplished. No more begging and he knows I am not the hand that feeds him anymore. Peace and Quite.

I didn't have that bad luck. I have been using this product for more than a year now and it works great. I do agree that the programming is not clear and you need to keep the instructions. I am now able to program without them, but it took awhile. The batteries seem to last a long time. I don't think I've changed them for more than eight months. My cats know what time the feeder will dispense food and often are right there waiting. I no longer get woke up early in the morning by a cat wanting food. I am able to go on one and two day trips without having to find pet care. More than that I have someone to visit them and clean the catbox.

The only time I had to worry about that is when I had to change the batteries...

After repeated trys, I was able to program in the time & managed to get the two feedings daily. Now that the time change is in effect, my cat is being fed at 4AM & 4PM - I don't dare try to reprogram it - I know I will have a task on my hands when the battery runs out & I have to start all over again. Maybe by then, it won't be needed. I even tried to go online with the manufacturer to get better directions - to no avail.

After buying the Le Bistro, she has completely stopped begging for food! She is an overweight cat so I thought it would be nice to have precisely measured meals for her. My only complaint is that when I set the feeder for 1/4 cup meals it actually dispensed closer to 1/3 cup of food. So now instead of feeding her 3 times a day I feed her only twice. Also, after reading several other reviews about people having major problems setting up the Le Bistro, I have to say that all you have to do is use a little commen sense and it's not that hard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better feeders out there","review":"The product is sensitive to motion.

In concept, it's great, however I feel there are two BIG drawbacks:1) The user interface to set it up is awful. I desing UI's as part of my job, and this unit is so complicated to set up that it isn't usable for many.2) It only works with small-sizes of kibble. He has a German Shepherd, and the adult dog food for a big dog is too big for the unit to measure. When I set it for 1.5 cups, it dispensed two kibbles.Item one is only an issue for initial setup and changes. To address item 2, we're going to switch to food with smaller kibbles and see if it makes a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was Loving it....","review":"I had my feeder for 3 months before my smart figured out the paw up the spout routine and broke the feeder wheel. Petsmart gave me a new unit no questions since it had only been 3 months. I outsmarted the cat and put a plastic card in front of the spout to limit the size of the spout and she no longer can get her paw up it to dislodge food. If you do this, just make sure you leave enough space for the size kibble you are using. My cat stopped trying to stick her paw inside.Now fast forward 4 years. Still have the same unit and it was working until last week when all of a sudden the feeder wheel on the inside sounds as if it is slipping on its cogs and now won't turn to dispense food. At 4 years, I can't expect Petsmart to help but just wanted to post that I loved my machine (5 stars!) for the last 4 years. Not being able to clean the insides is probably what wore out the parts faster.

Simple. We had to set it to a very low output though as even our two monster cats couldn't eat a \\"cup\\" worth in one day. We had to set it to half a cup twice a day to feed ours.

Two months in, it doesn't skip their meals, the cats let us sleep past 7 am, and they don't bother us for food. I'm actually amazed that my one little trouble-maker hasn't figured out how to make the food come out. The two downfalls I've found are: 1) you can only set one meal size, so you can either have 1/4 cup three times a day or 1/2 cup three times a day, and the one is too little and the other is too much; and 2) you can only set up to 3 feedings a day. We've made it work, though. We give them 1/4 cup at 6 am, 12 pm, and 12 am, and then we manually give them 1/4 cup using the feeder at 6 pm.I can honestly say that after reading the reviews, I was afraid it was going to be a lemon, but if you don't mind making some compromises, I think it is an excellent item, esp for feeding when you want to sleep!

I'm still looking for a product I can apply on my face without negative reactions since without this product, I have gotten bitten there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avon SKIN-SO-SOFT Bug Guard PLUS","review":"Bug guard works great, had a chance to use last weekend when i went wadefishing, i would recommend for any outdoor activity, No burning of the eyes or face. plus it smells good and has sunblock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice repellent cream","review":"our house got infected with bed bugs, this cream helps my toddler to relive from bed bug bites until we had professionally treated.

It also was a good sunblock and moisturing lotion. I didn't like the smell and oily feel--but that is typical of all the sunblocks I have ever used. I bought the skin-so-soft without the sun block and it smelled good and felt great (but of course it didn't have sun block)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for outdoors people","review":"I was a wildlife biologist in the tick-infested woods of NE for many years. When I wore this stuff I never had a tick attached to my skin and it kept the mossies and biting flies at bay. When I did not wear it, I occasionally had a tick attached. It protected my sensitive skin, even my face, and wasn't greasy so I didn't break out on my face as I do with other lotions!

There are absolutely NO UVA-protecting active ingredients in this sunscreen. Being that the UVA rays are the more deeply penetrating ones proven by research to cause cancer and the signs of aging, using this sunscreen could leave you completely unprotected and completely wrinkled. Who cares if it wards off mosquitos and smells like a 'gentle breeze' if it won't even protect you from sun damage! If you're going to go to the trouble of applying sunscreen, you might as well get broad spectrum protection. Skip this one in favor of a sunscreen with one of the following broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB) protecting ingredients of titanium or zinc oxide, avobenzone, Parsol 1789, or butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Best quality CD.

I think this is really the best album you can choose to enter in the innocent, young and nicely romantic world of Mecano if you never heard it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocal and Melodic Excellence","review":"The local Spanish radio statin played Mecano's \\"Cruz de Navaja,\\" a song that showcased the vocalist's pristine voice and the band's versitle musical ability. The lyrics of all Mecano's songs are truly poetic and capture with great precision sundry emotions of life's experiences. The audio quality of the vinyl album was disappointing; however, the cd mfg. in Spain by Ariola proved to be a far supperior listening experience. This album peaked my interest in the group, so-mcuh-so, that I have purchased other Mecano albums. They too have been quite impressive. Currently, I appreciate various albums that Ana Torroja has recorded as a soloist. Her songs, lyrics and vocals are no less beautiful or refreshing than her preformances with Mecano. \\"Entre El Cielo Y El Suelo\\" provides great listening pleasure and thought provoking lyrics that awakens an energized curiosity in the listener each time songs or the entire album is played"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time","review":"First time I have read this author - read the book in one sitting and was truly surprised and delighted.

Almost every piece of evidence that puts doubt on the theory of evolution has been documented and discussed. The book is easy to read and includes many pictures and photos that helps to understand many complex concepts.The only quip I would note is that the author fails to distinguish between known/proven evidences and his own ideas/beliefs. This is not a common feature of the book though.I would highly recommend this book for any one who has become disillusioned with the inadequacies of the theory of evolution. It is very concise and authoritative, and can be used as the starting ground for more detailed criticisms of evolution.This book has no creationist sympathies, it merely documents the many problems with evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sodera--more Creationist garbage","review":"It is pathetic that some see this as detailed, well-researched and authoritative: it could only be for the ignorant and extremely gullible. As a creationist, Sodera claims no commonality or relationship for humans and apes. Yet genomic sequencing has shown that human,chimpanzee, and bonobo DNA are highly similar, being at minimum 95% IDENTICAL. Add in that humans have the same blood types [except AB], the identical blood antigens, and rh factors, it can be seen that as a physician, Sodera is rather ignorant of his subject, especially as the information is readily available.Sodera also asks how an organism could know it \\"needs\\" to evolve, a bizarre and inane idea indeed, as it presupposes sentience where none clearly exists, and indicates a profound misunderstanding of science. Dogma is not a substitute for information, which Sodera clearly lacks.

I was somewhat hesitant, being that it was written a while ago and takes place in Sweden (I'm not familiar with names, locales, etc.); however, it was absolutely great and now I'm hooked!

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A current crime novel written in the 60's","review":"Although this crime novel was written in the 60's, it's still current, and yes, amazingly it doesn't feel outdated at all. It pulls you and you just have to keep on reading. You might at times get stressed thinking how come it takes so long to do this or that because we forget it happend in the 60's and there was no DNA testing back then, no mobil phones, not even fax machines! And still it is well written and the story really catches you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover Martin Beck for yourself.","review":"Like Freeling or Simenon, the Sjowall/Wahloo novels are excellent more for the excuse the mystery provides for an examination of everyday life, than they are for the excitement or horror of the crime itself. In the case of Martin Beck, he explores the frustrations and pleasures of Swedish life while solving his mysteries.This is not my favorite in the series (so far, that would be _The Man Who Went Up in Smoke_), but it's not a bad place to begin. It is hurt a bit by being a little dated by some of the concerns about Roseanna herself-- she is a great view of how many saw the hippies at the time. However, the book itself is not dated and this is not an issue that should dissuade someone from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action Transvestite","review":"\\"Running, jumping, climbing trees...putting on make-up when you get there\\" is how Eddie Izzard describes his life as an Action Transvestite. And it's true, in this movie, you get to see Eddie running around in heels and a gown, carrying a big gun. In all honesty, he is the most skilled, of the cast, in heels and dresses. And it seems like the perfect combination of major topics from his show \\"Dressed to Kill,\\" World War II and Nazi Germany, Great Britain defending itself, slap dash army make-up, there are even shades of \\"The Great Escape.\\"But this movie is definitely a \\"renter.\\" I don't care how much you love Eddie Izzard, don't buy it. Matt LeBlanc is tepid at best, and there's not enough time devoted to the supporting cast to save the film. Interesting in its own way, but even bargain basement prices couldn't entice me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matt LeBlanc is NOT a convincing woman","review":"I had to give it the benefit of the doubt, Eddie Izzard was in the flick and I love the guy's comedy. I had my first doubts when an English officer asks Matt LeBlanc for ID and his retort is that he's 21 and of age. Really now, in 1945 - wasn't 18 all you needed to be? The idea that an \\"elite\\" team of cross-dressers is parachuted in isn't really all that bad, but when the two worst looking \\"women\\" don't speak any German...honestly. There are some comedic highlights - I really could have just enjoyed the movie if Izzard and the kid were the only ones in it. However, it was SO bad that I finally reached a point where I couldn't go on...this movie and The Musketeer are the only two movies I've ever turned off mid-view. Please, save yourselves - drop the cash on renting this movie before you run off to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Matt LeBlanc thinking?/Worse than Lost in Space!","review":"All the Queen's Men was quite a disappointment considering the presence of Matt LeBlanc and James Cosmo among others!The acting is all right (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond \\"below average!\\" What a waste of talent! A shame really...The movie starts off well and then goes into \\"gay\\" gear. No further comments are needed. Nothing to see here... Move along..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing and void...","review":"Take four British blokes, toss in one American, put them all in dresses, toss vigorously with a thin plot to infiltrate a female factory in WWII Germany to steal a secret machine called the \\"Enigma\\", and you have an excellent opportunity to entertain. Unfortunately, that opportunity was missed in this movie during their attempt at \\"Some like it Hot\\" humor. Had we seen a better transformation of the guys, or seen more than five minutes of it, it might have been more palatable, but not so. Eddie Izzard is the only highlight to this movie, who's job it is to transform three gruff-looking men into passable women to pull off their mission...a task he admits to failing several times in the film. I had to agree.Buy this one to see Eddy, or listen to the flawlessly spoken German, or even because you're a fan of Matt LeBlanc, but don't buy it with the idea that you will watch it again and again, because you won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Really, pretty good, despite a typical, subpar performance by Matt Leblanc---I am a huge Eddie Izzard fan---he can do no wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS EVERYBODY HAPPY?","review":"Ted Lewis is like Marmite, you either like him or you don't. I'm very partial to his lugubrious tones and drawled (rather than sung) vocals, but the real value of this compilation is in the accompaniment. Ted's line-up featured a number of stars of the Jazz Age, including George Brunies, Frank Teschemacher, Red Nichols, Jack Teagarden, and Fats Waller. The last-named enlivens the proceedings on four 1931 sides, and takes the vocals on three of them. It's a pity that the discography, and Mark Berresford's informative liner note, are marred by typos (\\"Thin tank\\" for \\"This task\\") being one example. Despite that, it's a rich sample of his best recordings which can be recommended, if you like Marmite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Apollo et HyacinthusI loved the costumes, the baroque style of movements, and the singing. I love the intamacy of the smaller stage. Christiane Karg's mouth was somewhat annoying to watch, but what came out was nice. My favorite voice was that of Jekaterina Tretjakova.Die Schuldigkeit des Erten Gebots(The Obligation of the First Commandment)It is amazing how Mozart could create music with depth at such a young age and it only gets better with age. This was a nice production, but it was hard to keep my interest at times. The singing was good. One thing I could not understand is that how Christ could be tempted by such an ugly creature as Weltgeist(Worldliness). I wouldn't follow someone who looked like that. Maybe he was seduced by her singing.Apollo et Hyacinthus is enough reason to buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the curious","review":"Amazing what this genius did at age 11. But on a bell shaped curve comparing all of his operas and those after him it is mediocre with moments of brilliance. They look like and feel like high school operas. The gem here is soprano Karg.

I think the only thing I found interesting about this movie is the fact that the Back to the Future 3 stars are re-united in the 1800's. There were a few funny moments, however too few. For a comedy, I laughed maybe 2 or 3 times, not enough. Jack really isn't very good at slapstick type of comedy and that is apparent here. His accent was so-so, and it sounded like he tried speaking while holding his nose (nasal). He wasn't the only one holding his nose after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"just worth the watch every time","review":"This disappoints me that he didn't get good ratingsI've watched this film that I have on dvd 5 times alreadyand I always laugh at the lines in those moviesworth the time and laugh and smilingHe cracks me upthe film is touchingpowerfulfunnyand very interestingI like how it endsthe soundtrack goes well with the movieThe plot is really interestingwhen I watched the movie trailer online I wanted to go get the movie on dvd. and when I bought it I wasn't let down.

Some extremely good situations. Some good suspended situations too. And yet we regret Nicholson is directing himself. He can't see himself when he is acting and that shows tremendously in the film. It explains some slow and long sequences that should have been packed in the acting itself. That explains why the actor Jack Nicholson is too often using some faces and attitudes and gestures that we have already seen in The Shining, in The Witches of Eastwood, or in many other films. He cannot see himself and thus he cannot direct himself properly. And there were and are some extremely potential situations. There could have been, and there should have been.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going South","review":"Great Movie! \\"Take it easy Toffield, you're wrinkling up my good luck bandana\\"!

The book is 270 pages long, and the text is in French, but if you appreciate lots of photos of a multi-faceted, beautiful woman who often resembles a Barbie doll, this is the book for you.

That's when the LIVE ART was really cooking.There were many fine records released in 1971. These live performances however, SUCK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"first , I didn't see the original movie -- I've had the 3 disc LP with booklet for 30 + years ...this DVD - yes, some of the bands were 'shortchanged' and even some of those in the DVD ( Tuna / airplane for instance ) were reduced I think compared to the LP. but others seem complete ( again, compared to LP - the Dead's 2 songs for instance, and Santana.)the video part - uses the Woodstock spit screen to excess, a little distracting. and going by the video, you'd never know who was playing guitar for Santana band. I wonder if it was the manager , switch in managers or was it Carlos himself that led to that ?finally, sure it'd be nice if it was a 4 hour movie. and Woodstock shoulda been 2 3 hour movies. as a 'historic document' , valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Very Young Toddlers Only","review":"I was too quick to click buy when I saw \\"Hooked on Phonics.\\" My 4 and 6 yr old are bored to tears by this. It's very simplistic, both in the style, music, stories and visually. So far we've only tried the animal disk and each segment is so short, most with NO VALUE for a child who can already identify animals. Like the segment where a bunny hops around feeding various farm animals, the only time words are said is to identify each animal. No words show up on screen in that segment at all. THERE IS NO PHONIC LEARNING AT ALL. The children photographed on the DVD cases look to be 5-7 yr old, which is very misleading. I think this would serve the same age group as the Baby Einstein videos. Only when my boys were that age I liked the Baby Einstein videos a lot more than what I've seen of this set. I'm sorry I bought this. I gave it two stars (instead of one) because it was my mistake for not researching it more, but compared to Baby Einsteins this is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"THIS IS ONE SET OF EDUCATIONAL DVD'S THAT I MUST SAY, IS VERY ENTERTAINING.I THINK MOST CHILDREN WILL LOVE THIS, & PARENTS WILL NOT BE BORED IF THEYHAVE TO SIT W/CHILD AND WATCH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid pleasing....","review":"My son loves these videos!

However the claim which the book makes on the cover that it, \\"supplants all others, even the immensely successful 'History of Western Philosophy' by Bertrand Russell,\\" is absurd. Russell has a deep understand of philosophy, Gottlieb does not. This book is a superficial (but enjoyable) account of philosophy up to the Renaissance. If you've already read Russell (or have otherwise studied philosophy), this book is of little value. If you have not, reading Gottlieb might encourage you to read the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"1,500 Years of Philosophy Made Fun and Smart","review":"The subtitle of this book is a history of philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance, but that can be slightly misleading. It is in fact what it claims but it is also much more and a little less. The little less is that only the book's last two chapters cover the period after the death of Aristotle but anyone who has slogged through medieval philosophy will appreciate and understand the author's choices. The good news is how deftly the author, Anthony Gottlieb, covers the topics and philosophers selected. The Dream of Reason is a wonderfully comprehensible volume that glorifies the Greeks, certainly not for getting it precisely right, but for expanding the attempts to actually get it (it, of course, being a simple word covering a multitude of complex ideas.) This book is always intelligent and very entertaining.

The flap fastens with magnets which seems mostly to just keep it from flapping around, it does not keep the flap closed very securely. But the material is top notch and it looks fantastic. Highly recommended.--- Update: 2 or 3 months after getting this bag, the leather which binds the shoulder strap to the main bag split, making the shoulder strap unusable. However, the seller has been extremely helpful in taking care of the situation, and the manufacturer is looking at the stitching in their design to see if it needs to be strengthened. I look forward to getting my great bag back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but the magnets are useless.","review":"The bag is indeed quite good looking, and I've had a number of compliments.

Well, 2 hours later I was still trying to retrieve my pictures and print them. I was thrown off the program 5 times for illegal operations. My husband and I had a hard time understanding their 'easy' directions, which were incomplete and confusing. I finally gave up after my computer froze (this is a new computer).

I did not like it when people who ranted against \\"eurotrash\\" wrote that the director should write his own opera.Well Herheim has just about done that, and it is, quite frankly awful.

My problem is that the story has been completely stripped away in this production. The opera, as it was written, has a plot which may be silly, but which gives us an idea of 18th century European attitudes towards sex, intimacy and Eastern culture. In this production the plot is gone and the arias have been used as the basis of a set of essentially unrelated set pieces supposedly giving us insights into the nature of sexual relationships. The irrelevant action on stage simply distracts from the drama of Mozart's skillfully constructed arias and recitatives. The result is supposed to give a provocative view of sexuality, but to me seems to be utter foolishness. To sum up, if this sounds interesting, you might want to buy this DVD, but don't expect it to be a reasonable representation of the opera as Mozart conceived it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-traditional interpretation","review":"Taking great liberties with Mozart's opera, this M/22 production is nonetheless very theatrical, creative, never boring. It deconstructs the original story and morphs it into a non-linear series of statements on male/female relationships. In other words, forget the story. As a stage production, it is an incredible performance, an alternative reimagining of the original...which means one ought to be familiar with Mozart's vision and not accept this variation as the final word. It's not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swept Away","review":"\\"Swept Away\\" frustrated me because it had the potential to be a great movie if the story had been developed more from the emotional, character refining perspective while the couple was on the deserted island.

That piece makes it all worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw Swept Away in the theatres","review":"I was one of the lucky few to see Swept Away during it's brief run in the theatres. Madonna did an excellent job in the role of Amber. Anyone who is a true Madonna fan knows by now that she is not the best actress. But she put out one of her best performances to date in this role. It's sad that all the critics and their rumors were about to keep this movie from being widely released and seen by more people. This movie is a must see for any Madonna fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort on Madonna's part.","review":"Ok. I'm one of the few people who got to see this movie in its limited theatrical release. I actually saw it twice. I'm a big fan of M's and I had to see this movie. It got bad reviews even when it was still being filmed. In my opinion, it's a GOOD movie. It's not spectacular. It's not a blockbuster that everyone in Hollywood is trying to make. It's about romance vs. social classes. It's got a good message and I think it deserves to be seen. It's slighly off from the original which was more politically charged. The best scene is the fantasy sequence where the real Madonna comes out. It's worth seeing just for that scene. And Madonna's looking hot in a bikini throughout the whole film. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"one bad film leads to another....","review":"this is madonna's last time acting film...i don't really blame her. she continues to make really bad films and her acting just isn't that great. the plot was interesting...but the movie itself wasn't really all that special. plus, madonna does not age well in this movie. the wrinkles are starting to show on her face which make her look unflattering and old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad movie","review":"The DVD quality was fine, I suppose we are only to comment on that.

Pleasantly surprised at Madonna's acting -- previous movies had left me cold. However, very disappointed in lack of realism: how many people wear a full length sweater day in and day out on a warm deserted island? Or wear the same clothes for a month and have them look like new? No nicks, no tears, no nothing! How is it that we never see either of the two naked -- even when they are having sex? Last I checked I had to take *my* shorts and briefs off! And, the coup de grace, as far as I am concerned is hair -- growth -- the lack of, that is. After a month, neither of the two had any more hair than they started with -- head, face, underarms, legs, anywhere.Yes, modern societal mores may dictate that TV shows have women with shaven arms and legs having sex wearing underwear, but this is not a daytime soap. It's a R rated movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining","review":"Swept Away is by no means cinamatic genius, but it really is amusing.

Madonna is so bad she can't even play a rich, pampered bitchy rich lady, I guess she had no idea where to look for inspiration? The politics and class which put these characters at odds in the first movie have been surgically removed and rather bland sexual desire is put in its place. Sorry but I find if hard to believe an latin man would find the .0002 body fat, over worked out Madonna sexy. The hardness of her physical appearance should add something to her self obsessed character but her unbelievable delivery of lines is just too distracting and undermines any chance of fleshing out her role. This is a must to avoid but I will say Madonna is best when she is performing, singing, dancing and thrashing about none of which happens here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I mean this, worst movie I have ever seen.","review":"The dialogue in this movie is beyond atrocious, and at many times laughable. I do believe that Madonna can act, contrary to many other reviewers. However, her portrayal of the rich woman in this movie was so overdone and overwraught it was completely unbelievable. I also believe that Guy Ritchie has put out some good work. However, the acting in this movie is just so bad, you can't watch it.Watch this movie only if you'd like to be bored to tears, or if you need a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"iT'S NOT AS BAD AS THE CRITICS SAY...","review":"IT'S EVEN WORSE!!! Having seen the original, this remake misses the mark totally. It has no conception of what made the original the great and funny and thoughtful movie that it is. Madonna wins points as the most obnoxious character on the face of the ocean---and there is absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads. Madonna even makes the love scenes boring.

The original is excellent, this version does not compare on any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Critics are Jaded and Wrong","review":"Despite the critic's obvious bias towards Madonna on the big screen, this movie is really a lot of fun. It was getting slammed before anyone even saw it or a screening. I have to agree with Entertainment Weekly's review and give it a B or 4 stars out of 5.Madonna is completely convincing as the rich, arrogant Amber who always gets her way and goes out of her way to torture her servant and costar Adriano Giannini. After the two are stranded on a deserted island, the fun begins and the power falls to her servant who can hunt and supply food. It is rather fun to what Madonna get slapped around.The cinematography is also well done and the Mediterranean setting plays perfect. Over all, this movie really is funny and fun to watch. If people try to take it too seriously then they will and can find flaws, its not perfect. So, let your guard down, ignore the critics and see it yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as we were all led to believe","review":"I've caught it a few times on pay cable and the film is pretty funny, especially the beginning where Madonna is real b*tchy to everyone. It has more of a European style of humor, so I can somewhat understand why it did not fly so well in the States where manure like Scary Movie 3 makes hundreds of millions of dollars. The dance/dream sequence is quite well done and the ending is a bit tender with the helicopter flying away & soft piano playing. Well worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"THAT LEAN $ HUNGRY LOOK","review":"I'm sad to have to break the news to Guy Ritchie & Madonna, but this movie is an almost total bomb. It completely lacked the passion and the splendor of the original \\"Swept Away.\\" The original leading actress, Mariangela Melato, had a full breasted curvaceous figure that exuded a deep womanly sensuality. Unlike the lean and hungry look of an aging starlet whose grasp on pop culture (a culture that once fully embraced her warped sense of aesthetics and her shallow philosophy of materialism and selfishness) is simply slipping away like sand through an hourglass.As for the direction, well, there's not much to praise. Let me just say that it was less than inspired. In fact, the word tepid is what comes to mind. The original was, of course, breathtaking and much more insightful and character driven. Seeing this exploration into the mediocre makes me long for the days when trivial pursuit was not a lifetime ambition."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD MOVIE!","review":"I think it's a good movie ....

The other star is for Madonna's short dancing and singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre attempt at filmmaking by Guy Ritchie......","review":"I watched this one with a bit of caution. I was curious to see what the outcome would be. I liked Guy Ritchie's previous films, so I thought, despite all the bad press surrounding this film, I'd give it a shot. Well, here it goes...It was mildly entertaining, but it wasn't great at all. Madonna can't really act all that well, and needs to stick to her day job. She was great in \\"A League of Their Own\\", but in this particular film, you could tell she was trying really hard to make the best of it, but it just didn't work. The script by Ritchie was full of unbelievably corny scenes and bits of dialogue. The scene where Giancarlo Gianni and Madonna play charades in the cabin by the beach is unbearable...Other than all of that, the scenery is beautiful, and like I said, its mildy entertaining...enough so that you can make it through the entire film. BARELY make it through, rather.SKIP IT or watch if there is absolutly nothing else to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swept Away - Glimpse from Hell","review":"I finally have had a glimpse of hell watching this ... movie which should have gotten negative stars. Madonna, who's only decent acting job was as a female baseball player, just doesn't cut it. She should stick with her music, which is the best it's ever been, but watch this thing if you want to watch the most unintentionally funny movie in years, it's that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"respectable","review":"Ok, don't go looking for a home run here, if you do, you'll probably be disappointed. Just like with most remakes, if you were around when the original came out, and you really liked it, when you hear that there is going to be a new version coming out you say WHY???!!! Just wait until they redo The Matrix, or The Titanic, or Pyscho, oops. I just really enjoy this film. Madonna does a great job of being the total rich bitch, looking down on anyone below her. The ship-wrecked scenes are really good, and the music that is used as the two companions while away the sunny days just really gets to me for some reason--it really makes you wonder what it would be like, or it did for me anyways. Obviously they are ship-wrecked, but it seems like paradise! I also find the relationship development to be very interesting as well. cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna's Acting Career \\"Swept Away\\"","review":"Warning: Don't watch this movie while you're eating. Just the sight of Madonna's wrinkled face and mannish pecs(veins and all), will be vomit inducing. This is an hysterical bomb with horrendeous, self-conscious acting(?) by that Golden Raspberry award Champ Madonna. Just curious though why Cyndi Lauper's real life husband David Thornton was in this? He's a gifted actor who usually has some great roles in Nick Cassavetes' films. Well I guess You live and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic love story","review":"I think it can be agreed on that this movie was doomed before it was even released. Bad press and reviewers wanting to take their jab at Madonna's acting skills and \\"suckering\\" of Guy Ritchie to make a movie starring her killed it. But now that the dvd is out and i've had a chance to watch the movie, i have to agree with part amazon[.com]'s editorial review. Madonna does give the most believable performance of her career as Amber. Amazon[.com] does, however, say that the movie fails at making a valid point of the economics of capitalism, and this may be the case. I, though, did not watch this movie as a statement on capitalism, but as a love story. The style of the movie does change over and over again, and this is the only real flaw. The storyline flows fairly well, and the viewer can really see Amber and Giuseppe's relationship grow. From the funny beginning to the utterly heart wrenching end, this movie is very worthy of being viewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgive me Father for I have sinned, I promise to say 'Hail Mary' until Madonna has a hit movie","review":"Why is this movie so bad? \\"Swept Away\\" starts out boring and just gets worse and worse. I am not trying to trash Madonna's acting because heaven knows she's been called every name in the book already, but if this movie is any representation of her acting skills she should quit while she's ahead and go back to singing and dancing. Included on the DVD is the MTV special that Madonna did with her husband which is in all actuality better than the movie itself because Madonna seems more human and relaxed. I suppose all of the blame isn't Madonna's fault, but she's Madonna and she and her husband did produce it. I still love Madonna, just not this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a 0 star.","review":"Try as I might to like this movie, I could not.

But the performances here lacked spark, truth, passion, everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"What can i say it was one of the most painfull movies i had to sit through in my life. Madonna can not act at all and she needs to stop with that horrid British Accent,STOP THAT! As for Guy Riche, I knows she is your wife and all but you can do better than this come on now come on. The only plus side to this so called movie is you get to see madonna get slaped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"This is a terrible movie - if you want to see something good PLEASE watch the original. This is simply terrible. NONE of the interesting complexities are kept. This movie is TRITE in its performance. It doesn't have any direction - it doesn't know if it wants to be a comdey or drama. Madonna can NOT act and the most dramatic scenes are laughable due to her perfromance. Just see the original. Most of the dialog is inappropriate due to the era and the culture -- just let the Italians do it. This film is a waste and does the orginal a HUGE disfavor to its vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Entry in the Madonna Bad Film Festival","review":"Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, Madonna surpasses herself in this boringly pretentious 2002 remake of Lina Wertm��ller's \\"Swept Away\\" - directed in glum fashion by her then-husband Guy Ritchie. A beached whale of a movie, with no camp pleasures to be found. Ritchie and Madonna fared much better in a hilarious seven-minute short for BMW titled \\"Star\\" (2001) - one of the few bright spots in the Material Girl's filmography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie & Funny- People stop bashing it cause Madonna plays in it","review":"I heard so many bad reviews on this movie that I was just so curious that I had to watch.

The last 15 minutes finally get interesting.. unfortunately it's the last 15 minutes, so the movie ends just when I started to care about these people.The script is terrible. The dialogue ridiculous, and Guy Ritchie's direction is disturbing. The biggest mystery is why anyone would even want to act, direct or film this movie at all.As usual the critics blamed Madonna, as if one person is responsible for either a great movie, or a terrible movie. Everyone involved in this project should have passed, and so should the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Because it's Madonna.","review":"As much as I admire Guy Ritchie's work, it's been painfully obvious for many years that Madonna cannot act and only manages to secure roles because... well because she's Madonna. And now that Guy is her significant other we knew she would end up in one of his films sooner or later. Let's just hope this over-rated starlet doesn't mar another of Ritchie's works.

The story is very good (and full of messages) and the mediterranean views very pleasant.

The camera froze in the open position and could not be closed no matter what I did. I eventually tossed it because it gave me far more aggravation than pleasure. For example, turn it on and it stays on from 2 to 15 seconds, rather arbitrarily. You can set up a shot, and, boom!, the camera shuts down. Turn it on again and it fails to work. Shut it off, turn it on and then it might work (or not). I suspect the elecronics were not well thought out. Don't waste your money. This was an extermely frustrating experience for me!BTW: The manual, if one can call it that, is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend buying this camera","review":"It took me weeks to find a place that sold the film for this camera. ...

Any time a company markets a product that uses some form of media (film, disk, paper, ink) provides at least a sample of that media (or advertises clearly that it is 'not included')The Poloroid Mio, which uses an extremely scarce media (i.e. the film), doesn't come with any. And there is no mention of this.This tells me that, in the minds of Poloroid, they are marketing a gimmick that they'll drop as soon as they come up with another one. If you buy this, you better stock up on film.No small part of my frustration is due to the fact that I purchased this as a gift. When my friend opened it, he found he couldn't use it and was forced to purchase the film (and wait for it to arrive).Poloroid: you guys are party poopers; not party makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polaroid No Longer Manufactures Film!","review":"While some stock still remains of the film, it is an absolute fact that Polaroid stopped manufacturing it several months ago.

She only had one facial expression through out the entire movie, even when she was having sex. She showed no feeling or emotion. Granted, some of the dullness to her character was due to her role, but it seemed as though there was nothing underneath.Vincent D'Onofrio was the saving grace of this film, playing Claire's love and pseudo-savior.

What, no one else in this little town (except for Andie's brother) noticed that people were suddenly dying at an unexpected rate? And the editing was sloppy, which was a surprise considering this came from a major publishing house. At one point Andie laments the fact that she \\"can't lift one eyebrow at a time\\", and later she \\"arches an eyebrow\\"; then Velocover is capitalized at the first mentioning and not capitalized at the second.

This watch loses time, not by seconds a day, but in whole chunks. A half hour here, an hour there; whenever I would look at the watch, I couldn't really know what time it was. Shameful!An automatic watch should be able to keep time when worn 24/7. This one doesn't, so it's going back.

The uncle insisted she and her fiance must travel to the Northwest Territory to meet him first. They agreed.White Eagle joined them for the end of the journey. Sparkes immediately blazed between Katrina and White Eagle. Katrina was known as Shines Like Moonlight until age five. At that age, her parents were killed in a flood and the uncle sent Katrina to New York as her father had wished.Moonlight had returned as a spoiled, pampered, determined, brave, and passionate woman. White Eagle set out to claim her for his own. First there was the marquess to deal with. Then they must rescue the uncle from another tribe.***Ahhh, very romantic! Oh, how I enjoyed watching Moonlight and White Eagle go head-to-head. (I have hope that the maid, Rebecca, will receive her own story.)

The prose is not always engaging, and the dialogue can be excruciatingly repetitive: \\"Come.\\" \\"No.\\" \\"Come on.\\" \\"I won't.\\" \\"Come with me.\\" \\"I refuse.\\" ....AAARGH! I suppose that the characters' stubbornness is meant to be charming, but I just found that it made the story drag.Fortunately, the book is saved by its charming hero. I had gotten so used to misogynistic alpha male heroes that I forgot that there was any other kind! White Eagle is so sweet and loving and loyal that you can't help but sigh. The fact that the romance between hero and heroine started in their childhood made it feel all the more genuine.The setting of the story is also rich with Blackfoot culture.

I've brought the radio to my office and can enjoy commercial free music throughout the work day. The sound from this small, mono radio is remarkably clear and powerful. This includes both high and low range sounds. The remote control is compact and easy to use; actually, I prefer the remote, since the buttons on the radio are small. You can store 20 of your favorite satellite stations for easy access. Even FM stations sound great, but I rarely listen since the satellite stations are much better. The Sirius lineup is excellent, and it truly is commercial free music. (News and Talk stations have brief commercial breaks.)

She does not recognize the Constitutional right for Americans to differ on opinion and contends that anyone who does not follow her narrow vision of patriotism should be labeled as a 'traitor'.

Yet in her constant attacks on liberal Americans (without whom, by the way, the U.S. would be a dictatorship of one political viewpoint and party), Coulter never even comes close to criticizing conservatives. Nowhere in Ms. Coulter's catalogue does she criticize the political \\"slip-ups\\" of Ronald Reagan, the unabashed lying of the current administration, or the fact that this country has prospered immensely under 20th-century liberal leaders such as Harry S Truman and Theodore Roosevelt (yes, there was a time when Republicans were liberals, Ms. Coulter). This book is meant to be nothing but inflammatory in a much, much harsher sense than even Al Franken's latest or anything Michael Moore has ever done. If readers like inflammatory books, this is the one for you; if you're like me, however, looking for something fair and balanced, this is certainly not the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substance should be Apparent from the Cover","review":"By publishing a full body shot of Ms. Coulter on the cover, the publishers have made it clear that they intend to benefit from her sex appeal rather than her intellectual capabilities.

A great collection of \\"sources\\" which give the book a great feeling of authenticity.Whats that?Oh, its written as a factually based text?

As we get older, we realize just how much of society is politicized and history is no exception. Coulter points out how leftists have successfully foisted historical revisionism on a generation in a way that villifies Joe McCarthy while ignoring the treachery of Communist spy Alger Hiss and more importantly, the nonchalance of the Truman and FDR administrations in ridding themselves of Soviet informants. The book makes for an engrossing read. Coulter makes a compelling argument about the patriotic actions of McCarthy and how it was politically advantageous for the Left to rabidly demonize him long after he passed away. Coulter's trademark witty style and well-researched argumentation make it a book well worth reading, irrespective of your political leanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for Ann!","review":"Fantastic, well-written, well-researched account of the REAL history of the United States from the end of World War II to the present day.

This woman proves the adage that beauty is only skin deep. If you chose to read this, also read \\"Blinded By The Right\\" by David Hale to get a saner perspective. I'm sorry, but Coulter is arrogant, childish and riding a wave of shallow, spiteful right-wing social backlash subsquent to 9/11.

My advice to those who like this book and find it beleivable is to spend some of benefits of that precious education you have received and research the facts on your own. You will discover that if the statement made is not a bald-faced lie, then it is a bald-faced distortion of the truth.I feel sorry for people who read this book and like it I am here to tell you that you are being lied to, and that her assumption is that you are just too stupid to know better.

Weakening the American economy to the point of ruin2. Peddling to the needs of special interests only without any regard for the 99.9% of the people3. Starting a useless war that costs America hundreds of lives and billions of wasted dollars4. Causing US to become enemies with virtually all countries around the world and provoking global hatred instead of sympathy5. Getting involved in corporate scandals that made an average American investor dirt poor6. Taking environmental devastation to a whole new unheard-of level7.

It is a Radical Right thing to do, but may I remind you that Radical Right and Conversative are not the same thing. A conversative is not a reactionary, a conversative does not sling hyperbole.Even conversatives that use hyperbole well . . . such as Florence King, Arthur Herman, Norman Podhoretz, and P. J. O'Rourke as well as conversative thinkers like Walker Percy would be appalled. Indeed, Miss Coulter seems to make more of a carear out of bashing liberals than actually defining a point.

This book is 90% fiction and should not be taken as fact. People, please do some research and you will discover how twisted and one-sided this person really is.

I read the dust jacket and managed to get about 15 pages in before I started to feel ill. And I mean really ill, like \\"black hole in the bottom of my stomach\\" ill. I just could not believe someone like Coulter could exist. These books are pure, solidified hate and insanity. Never before have I read anything that I knew was written by someone with a mental disorder. Marylin Manson seems like a much more sane and rational writer that Coulter.

Take this crap seriously people. Be aware of what is going on and how twisted people can be. History shows how lies of this nature can take hold no matter how ridiculous they are to rational thinking people. Unfortunately, far too many people believe the garbage spewed in here. Watch out.

It saddens and enrages me that this book is well-read because it is composed of lies and half truths and bottomless stupidity. The hatred here, though, is what really sickens me. This is a free country and she has a right to say these things but please be sure (if you read this book) that this is nothing but hate filled lies. This book should be ignored.

If Coulter would simply stop writing these books, I think conservatives might actually have a chance to make some inroads into middle America.

Coulter takes historical events and spins them to reach predetermined conclusions. Those conclusions are not facts, just opinions (and myopic, narrow minded, mean-spirited, illogical opinions at that). If that's what you want to read, go ahead, this book is for you. Turn off your brain and enjoy. To Coulter's credit, I don't think she tries to even pretend she's objective or accurate. She's just spoonfeeding the extremists what they want to hear and she more or less admits it. Objectivity, accuracy or anything that doesn't support their narrow-minded point of view is not what they're looking for.

Hannity, O'Reilly, Limbaugh, et al, who were too good to serve their country?Fourthly, Talib-Ann claims that Liberals have brought political discourse down to the level of professional wrestling.

Very few other nation-states start wars with such alacrity, and none posess collections of weapons of mass destruction to rival the US. Since the Second World War, the US has shaped other nations to serve its commercial interests by bullying, covert operations, and outright military assault.

There is no liberal media. The right-wing pundits have actually found an interested audience in the lower poor classes who like mud-slinging Jerry Springer antics as well as the rich elite, who ultimately benefit from the right's tactics.Ann Coulter is no genius, no shrewd social or political critic, and definitely not aware of what truly goes on in this complex world. The neo-cons and their leashed dogs of the major media have found a willing and energetic attack dog who will spew their dogma to all who will listen.Let's be honest, she gets paid to get down on her knees and do her master's bidding.Read this book if you will, but if you want true political and social analysis, read Chomsky or Zinn."},{"rating":"2","title":"hack Vs hack","review":"let me tell you the book is good.

She says that, the government must do in \\"America's best intrest\\" then I say ask your marine buddys to pack their bags from their bases around the world and go home. An army is for the defense, yes the government has to be proactive, but it does not mean poking their nose into every other countries affair and try to push your clout here and there. that leads to nothing else but retaliation. for example we have problems with Pakistan , but we dont go around asking for bases in Iran, Iraq etc. This is just one example there are other issues which come under the conservative list of \\" pursuit of happiness\\" that I have not mentioned, like trade issues. guess we have to start a bulletin board or blogs for this huh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talentless, Witch-hunting Hackwork","review":"This book, as all her works, is nothing more than talentless, witch-hunting hackwork; it is the worst kind of populist tripe-and shows itself as exactly what it is-intolerance at its most egregious-which wraps itself in the banner of patriotism and concerned conservatives, while she rakes in the cake with both hands as the cash register sings to the tune of \\"God Bless America.\\" What a laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Unadultrated Garbage","review":"The first 20 pages was all I could handle.

Her book doesn't mention McCarthy's 1949 efforts on behalf of SS guards who massacred American POWS, which are a matter of public record. But since she recently remarked that she wants to move her law practice out of New York because she doesn't want to be around so many Jews, maybe this only increases his stature in her eyes.She also leaves out the part where it was President Eisenhower and Senate Republicans (including Prescott Bush, W's grandfather) who moved to censure McCarthy, after the nation saw his appalling conduct televised.There's more, of course- Harry Truman in particular is libeled by Coulter- but I don't have the time nor the space."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm going to turn myself into the nearest Gulag!","review":"After reading about half of this novel I decided that I must be the most treasonist person in the world.

I've seen her spit out her venom on TV and she's not a pleasant sight at all. She never answers challenges to what she spouts with any intelligence or directness. She evades probing questions or anything factual that clearly contradicts what she says. Instead she resorts to smarmy, witless sarcasm in that dour fashion of hers or gets hysterical.

That's Coulter all over.The second source, applicable to conservatives of good faith, is more interesting. They actually have little confidence in the value of the values they trumpet.

Many people write, \\"Coulter says what all of us think, but haven't had the guts to say!\\"There's a reason for that.

On the down side she is a not very bright jack booted shill for the most reactionary and neo fascistic sides of the GOP and her book is full of distortions and outright lies. That isn't actually the problem here. Really what bummed me out about the book is that it's just boring. It's whiny in a very pedetrian way, and ultimately Ann just isn't creative enough to back up her vitriol, it's like watching a little kid trying to provoke you, after a while it's just pathetic.

JFK signed off on Bay of Pigs, stood strong in the Cuban Missle Crisis, and put troops into Vietnam. LBJ escalated Vietnam into a full war, and he stated many times on how Vietnam was the front line of the \\"war on communism.\\" O ya, what about Truman? He just hated America, with NATO(he helped draw up the charter), the Truman Doctrine, and the prosecution of Soviet spys. He was really weak on defense when he nuked Japan, too.

This is history turned on its head. It was never so simple, dear Ann, and I suspect you know that. Is this what passes for history, while Americans are consumed with \\"American Idol?\\" If so, we are in very deep trouble. Read this book with a healthy dose of skepticism. I did. And if you could add a little knowledge of history, well - that would be an improvement over what Ms. Coulter offers. This is a book with a broader agenda than recounting history.

Ms. Coulter comes off as a bitter woman who does NOT represent the feelings of American women, or the American people. This book is nothing but spin-fluff written to give the term \\"liberal\\" a new, terrible meaning.

Now, Coulter is accusing \\"liberals\\" of treason.

I won't get into all of my various problems with it, I'm sure you'll see that in PLENTY of other reviews, from liberals and conservatives alike. But defending MacCarthyism? Statements like this alone just go to show that Coulter cannot back up a word she says and her entire book is unfounded liberal-bashing. I am all for free speech, but if you're going to knock liberals, please do a bit of homework first to back up your accusations.

While her arguments are well drawn out, she just seems to spew hatred rather than convincing statements. Obviously she has been hurt in the past by a liberal man somewhere along the line and is trying to get back at the whole left wing side of politics. For any person who likes to make up their own mind about things this book will just leave you angry. It is a sad comment on America when authors like this and books like this are popular.

Liberals have lied thier way into American lives and are deparate anti-American in every way.I was a teen ager when McCarthy was in the news and I can attest for his popularity amongst my people, Americans, not the elite intellectuals and academics or the media who hate this country. The sad case is the liberals are winning.

The book is a thoughtful arrangement off known facts which many people would rather had never seen the light of day.Ann is a wisecracker, but that's what makes her writing so entertaining. It's amazing that so many people think that they can disregard facts and events because they loathe the messenger.I bought \\"Treason\\" through Amazon, and have read \\"Slander\\" as well. ... Whatever side of the aisle you are on, you cannot deny that Ann Coutler knows what she is talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Laff-Riot!","review":"Ms. Coulter's book is remarkably funny -- albeit perhaps not intentionally so.

After years of hearing history professors drone on like idiots, finally i was able to read something that didnt make me feel like i was being propagandized. When you read this book, you will feel that you are getting a very honest and accurate portrayal of American history that actually makes sense. Any concerned American should definitely read this book- i was so captivated i read it in one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good follow-up to Slander","review":"I learned an amazing amount of history while reading this book. I am too young to remember the era of McCarthy, and it is a chapter in American political history that I knew very little about. Once again Ann, with her quit wit and biting sarcasm, is thoroughly entertaining while giving cold, hard facts about the threat of communism and the Democrats' refusal to acknowledge it. However, just like in Slander, if you aren't already familiar with some of the players in this story and the circumstances surrounding them, you will probably have to do some research on your own. Otherwise, a lot of this book will go over your head. It's a must-read for any conservative, as well as those who simply want to know more about the McCarthy era and the Cold War.

When i was given this book as a present by my Conservative (BUT not WHACKO) Father I decided to read it with an Open Mind. Too bad Ann doesn't have one. Her pitch to make McCarthy out to be good was one of the funniest (unintentionally) things i have ever read. All the Democrats are guilty of Treason (Does that include me?). I enjoyed her racist views of Arabs, thinly vieled as witty remarks. She complains about a lot yet doesnt seem to offer up any solutions to anything. Which is interesting because that's what she accuses Democrats of. I was in the Military, I suppose her and I could have a long talk about her many years of service to the USA. I was also completly distracted by the errors that should have been caught by somebody, ANYBODY! I wish i could think of one good thing to say about this book but i cant.

I think that even when she has good historical points she's privy to 20-20 hindsight and is unable (or refuses) to digest the many external variables that effected historical events.But more importantly, I'm very concerned about the corrosive nature of this kind of book on the country. I'm worried that there is a growing group on the far-right of the spectrum, perhaps 10 million people, who read this like gospel and thus live in a sort of dream-reality. It's a very unhealthy trend.She constantly says that her adversary is 'evil'. I believe Evil exists. Stalin was evil. To say that it's a common trait is an irresponsible and incendiary practice.I don't think she can be discredited, because I'm not sure she is able to feel any shame at being proven wrong.

While it was written with the same passion as Ms. Coulter always expresses in anything she communicates, I found myself tiring of the repetitiveness of conclusions, particularly in the first half of the book.Due to the author's thorough investigation of her subject matter,as well as her wit, it did hold my interest enough to finish the entire book.In short, I feel as if I was given good meals, but had to eat too many leftovers afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facts, Facts, Facts!","review":"Wow.

Period. And there were more than a few who worked for Stalin.McCarthy never targeted average folk and had nothing to do with Hollywood (which was the House---McCarthy was a senator.)Basically, the left, now as then, hates loudmouth Joe McCarthy more than the murderous Joe Stalin.

It is good to know that some people consider liberals to be a threat(The mainstream media generally dismisses liberals as irrelevant and pathetic). Apparently Ms.Coulter is so paranoid about liberals that she may be a candidate for a straitjacket if she becomes any more frightnened of the impact of liberalism on the nation.

Ann Coulter is so shrill and out of control, even die-hard conservatives are distancing themselves from this book. Joe McCarthy as a patriotic hero? Give me a break. And Coulter is as devoid of class as she is of logic, making \\"fat jokes\\" about Hillary Rodham Clinton on national TV as she was flogging her book. The First Amendment (which she otherwise disdains) gives her the right to publish this book...but people should refuse to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Arrogant","review":"Mrs. Coulter obviously has an agenda to persue. This book bashes liberals with a sharp toungue, and accuses them of being unpatriotic. However many of the arguments are just pitiful, and not backed by credible sources. She resorts to unabashed name-calling, and throughout the book it's hard to seperate Mrs. Coulter's opinions from fact. They are all mixed together in an anti-liberal stew. She actually advocates dissolving the entire democratic party. So much for balanced intellectual journalism. If you want a better book read something by Rush Limbaugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's gone off the deep end","review":"I wish I didn't have to even give it a star. As an independent, I strive for reasoned thought, not vitriolic partisanship based on poor research. Whether on the left or the right, extremists rarely rely on rational discourse. With this latest diatribe, Ms. Coulter has officially departed from the land of lucid thinkers into her own stratosphere of insanity (or extreme marketing).The contest is now on to see who can spot the most false quotations, misleading sources, convenient overlooking of contrary information, and sentences taken out of context or incorrectly attributed (her prior book Slander followed this route as well). Quantity of citations, not quality, is evidently the Coulter mantra. The icing on this cake is her indefensible exaltation of Joseph McCarthy.Thinking conservatives are disserviced by Ms. Coulter's claim to membership in their ranks.

Are their lives so empty that they need to blame liberals for all their problems? Is it our fault we are tolerant and well-rounded individuals? Is it our fault we don't go around calling our OWN mothers, wives, sisters and daughters, \\"feminazis\\" and other vile names? That we don't blame minorities for our OWN failures?That we CARE about our childrens' futures and don't want to saddle them with another Reaganesque DEBT?A question for all those particularly rabid right wingers, did Reagan's \\"tax break\\" ever trickle down to you?

She's got plenty of ammunition to show how inanity and asininity and, indeed, many instances of treasonous behaviour can be found in abundance coming from the mainstream American Left. Some of what she writes should be taken with a grain of salt. But to all too great an extent, it seems her attack on the Left is on target. If you are at all patriotic or anticommunist, by the end of this audio-book you will have to agree that Ann Coulter did us a big service in rendering this book which \\"dared to call it Treason\\".

If you require a certain level of intelligence and rational discourse this is not the book for you. Ann Coulter has a good time slamming all things liberal and elevating all things conservative [including Joe McCarthy].

This is what he had to say about Treason:\\"I am furious and upset about her book.

When trying to claim that there were only X number of articles on some news story, she uses LexisNexis searches to justify her claim. Fair, right? Wrong! Let's say she wants to search for Bush's state of the union speech. If she wants to show some point about how \\"the liberal media\\" did not cover the event enough, instead of searching for \\"Bush\\" and \\"State of the Union,\\" she might search for \\"Bush\\" and \\"State of the Union address\\" and \\"war on terrorism\\" and \\"economy\\" and \\"any other word that will limit the number of results.\\" Don't let her get away with such treachery."},{"rating":"1","title":"it counters hysterical hyperbole with: hysterical hyperbole","review":"This review is for those of you who try to balance out the accusations of the partisans by listening to both and weighing the arguments: don't bother with this one.

She is a controversial and shocking pundit, and that's exactly what we need.Every paragraph is a journey into the truth. Every sentence is full of illuminating and sensible conclusions and judgments. People that knock her are not reading the book, they are glimpsing through the pages (illiteracy will do that).

Even the literary license granted to the fiction writer does not suffice to confer any credibility to this or Ms. Coulter's other writing. It gives cause to wonder whether Ms. Coulter has any grasp on reality. Even Harry Potter ascends to credibity when measured against Ms. Coulter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can She Be Believed?","review":"She is clever and good at insulting people. But the thing is, given the fact that she distorted and lied her way through her last book, how can any of her claims in this book be believed?Furthermore, it seems to me that a woman who contributed nothing to her country but secondhand smoke and empty chardonnay bottles really has no place to insult anyone's patriotism.It is amusing reading - sort of like watching a 6 year old work itself up into a tantrum.

I recommend checking out spinsanity.com and salon.com for a taste of the types of falsehoods perpetrated in this book.If it wasn't for the boldfaced deceit this book contains, it might actually be an entertaining read. Unfortunately, Coulter is so bent on destroying liberals (or anyone with beliefs other than hers) that she will resort to anything to make her points.Skip this book.

The word is Fascist.Frau Coulter should also remember that in 1776 \\"conservatives\\" were called Tories. In 1861 they were rebels, copperheads and slave owners. In the 1950s-1970s they were called segregationists and were responsible for America's bad image whenever we ranted on about \\"freedom\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DoctorIf","review":"Once again, Ann Coulter's work makes a strong argument for the revival of both witch-burning and book-burning.

However, after reading her book I have come to the conclusion that she is delusional and border-line loco. This book is filled with half-truths and outright lies. I hope that people who read her claims research them on their own before believing her stories. When she gives interviews or participates in discussions, one gets a sense that she is rather full of herself. She thinks she knows it all, but she does not (I don't think anyone really does). Ann Coulter's ideas are scary. If half of what she preaches was practiced, I fear for the future of this country. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real nutcase who hasn't read her history","review":"Duh? Who started the policy of containment against communism?

Then of course, Kennendy sent troops to Vietnam and LBJ continued to fight against communism there. Carter didn't allow us to participate in the Moscow Olympics to protest communism.

One star too many","review":"I find it intersting that the only \\"review\\" listed under editorial reviews is the one off the books jacket. How nice for Miss Coulter that she can review herself and be assured of a glowing assessment. However, simply calling oneself an intellectual and stating that anyone who believes otherwise is a traitor, doesn't make it so. Miss Coulter is living in a world of fantasy where she makes up the facts and by doing so makes them real. Her type of rhetoric is what divides this country, making it near impossible to move forward on any issue, regardless of one's relative \\"conservativeness.\\" The author so polarizes the citizenery with her over-ripe rhetoric, that she puts everyone in an either or catagory; either you agree with her or you're a traitor. If anything, this kind of idealogically circular thinking is what is truly traitorous. Hello fascism, goodbye democracy.

I try to read books from both sides and try to stay neutral, even though most of the time I lean to the right. However, this book will not give you any information or any ideas. It is a collection of cutouts and out of text quotes from different newspapers. There are comments of highly opinionated and stupid woman, with no proper education, knowledge, and background to comment on any of her sources. Pretty much every paragraph in her book is absurd, some contain stupid blabbers, some are taken directly from fantasyland. Everything she says about Soviet Union and cold war is lies. Everything she said about Truman and Roosevelt is lies. She might be mad, but that does not make her a worthwhile reading material.

Such a neat division of citizens does not exist. Worse yet, the book leads the reader to believe that outside of the liberal/conservative labels, there are no other opinions worth discussing. Anyone who writes a book today and ignores the wealth of different positions, as can be found on the Internet for example, writes such a limited book at their own peril. It is not necessary to explain all opinions in detail, however the lack of discussing possibilities such as the New World Order and other supposedly fringe ideas is a glaring ommission. America is not a country divided into two groups. Talkshows and authors would like us to believe so to make their job easier. I am concerned about the publishing industry when a book with such a limited world view appears. Ms. Coulter does a disservice to herself by ignoring other influences on events in the USA and around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give a -5 stars for a rating","review":"I have one quick thing to say...this book just proves once again that Ann Coulter is a lying B**** who lies all the time.

This is not coming from someone who doesn't like to be hated so much by this woman. I consider myself neither a conservative or a liberal.

I think Coulter's writing style is not one which attempts to explain anything, but rather expresses her own vicious contempt in the hope of drawing an audience. This is Jerry Springer gone political. It's a shame she has been so successful in this endeavor, as it lowers the standards of political debate and cheapens public discourse.There are Democrats in this country and there are Republicans, the strength of the country comes from a RATIONAL balance between the two, and disagreeing with John Ashcroft does not make you treasonous.

Please note the sarcasm.There are other conservative writers who, while I may not agree with them, do not twist the facts. Coulter does boarder on insane.

Humility in victory is always admired, but you'll find none here. Instead, you find what could have been 300+ pages of sound perspective turned into 300+ pages of prideful prose. Though she describes some wretched people in her book, she over extends the reach of objectivity when attacking some (George C. Marshall comes to mind).

Speeking as someone who grew up during it, I can tell you that it most certainly did happen and its effects were devestating. McCarthy was not a loyal American, and as the prosecuting lawyer said during his trial, McCathy was the only man in the united States without a speck of decency.What Ann Coulter has given us is not a conservative book, but is unstudied filth that only has evidence that she creates out of her mouth.A shame for both Liberals and Conservatives alike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give less than 1 star!","review":"This woman should be down on her knees thanking liberals for existing.

This book represents the worst of America, not because it is conservative, but because it is propaganda designed to inflame the passions and anger of both liberals and conservatives, thus selling books. The anger it incenses is the worst kind - hate born of ignorance and prejudice. For those who believe in America and a conservative idealogy, they would be better served reading more informative, mature material. For those who are of a liberal leaning, they would be well advised to ignore this particular work.

Hardly a winning format for the left when engaged in debate.The left attacks Ann but never impeaches (!) her credibility, as the facts are there and fully supported.Ann is a conservative with a sense of humor and a pleasure to read.Insightful, energetic and completely unashamed to be American, Ann's book is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze","review":"Many reviews have been posted concerning the content, I'll focus on the style.One word: boringI am an open minded person, and I believe the truth lies in the middle.

Mencken noted that for every problem there is an answer that is clear, obvious, simple and wrong. And Coulter finds just that answer to every problem she sees. There is always someone to demonize, something to overlook, and someone to glorify merely because it fits her party line.By this same logic, we can see that many of history's traitors are today's heroes. People such as Galileo, Copernicus, Columbus and Einstein were traitors to the conventional wisdom of their days - and we are all the richer for it. What Coulter cannot admit is that often, conventional wisdom is wrong.The real traitor here is Coulter herself - who believes that the freedom of speech she herself feels free to exercise should not be exercised to criticize the almighty government.When will modern conservatives (who, after all, aren't nearly so conservative as they are intolerant) realize that hyperbole and dogma are not a substitute for reasoned dialogue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"First as tragedy, now as farce","review":"The latest offering of recycled McCarthyism from the Anna Kournikova of the far right.For true believers and the intellectually dishonest only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I browsed through \\"Treason\\" in a book store.

She argues all right, but her argument is largely circular, and it has absolutely no facts to back it up. In the first few pages she claims a US senator lauded Bin Laden for his work on child daycare centers. Who? When? What was the context? It did not get any better.

Meanwhile, those of us on the left tend to be fat and unattractive ... like me. Looks are what it's all about today. My other observation -- borne out well by the contents of this book -- is that, when one is physically unattractive, you tend to have to work hard to get things in life; the beautiful people, on the other hand, tend to get things handed to them.

While there will always be freakishly extreme views on both the right and left, what bothers me is that no one on the right is willing to say that this profiteering priestess of extreme right wing radicalism goes much, much too far.

But in Coulterland one should never let the facts get in the way of the bucks one can rake in by catering to the lowest common denominator.I'll give her this. Coulter knows her audience and knows just the kind of red meat that will get them marching into bookstores (where they no doubt are shocked to see that there are so many different kinds of books for sale) but ultimately this is not a compliment.

The same time this Republican was having affairs with FBI agents she was on the FBI payroll and giving classified information to her Chinese bosses. Now that is treason.

In her book \\"High Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\" she called for the assassination of President Clinton. Last year, in an interview with George Gurley in the New York Observer, she said: \\"My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times building.\\" She told David Brock that she wanted to leave her law practice in New York because she didn't want to be around so many Jews, and her racist remarks about Arabs are everywhere.

She's taken boring bits of history and filled a book with them. She spends 125 pages (out of 300) explaining how liberals lambasted Senator Joe McCarthy. She fills the book with tidbits of innuendo that lead one to believe that no liberal can be trusted with anything, ever. She plays up and exaggerates facts, and plays up and exaggerates fictions. My belief is that Ann was seduced and deflowered by a liberal Democrat who then dumped her, and so she's got a chip on her shoulder about liberals and Democrats. That, or she hasn't had good sex in a long, long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to the fundamentalist choir","review":"I firmly believe that she has made a very compelling case that Republican Presidents tend to act with honor and with America's best interest at heart when it comes to fighting tyranny and terror and that Democratic Presidents tend to act without honor and without America's best interest at heart when it comes to fighting tyranny and terror, thus the apt title of this book \\"Treason\\".Come on. To assume that to disagree with the Republican party line is treason is not only simplistic it is insulting. As I recall FDR was a Democrat and took opposing someone fairly out there on the tyranny scale rather seriously. Factcheck.org has a good analysis of both Coulter and her detractors. But, I'm sure the converted will pass non-partisan analysis off as liberal media spin.

She is the kind of conservative woman who has never suffered, always been pampered and has nothing better to do with her life than to try and tell others how to live theirs (and, of course, her hair is never out of place either). How this woman has been published when doubtless other good authors are still starving is beyond me. Please, Republicans, find someone else to spout your hate-filled litany.

And that liberals are constantly working against our country (I can only assume that by \\"our country\\" she means conservative ideology).She guages being patriotic as \\"writing a patriotic song\\" and \\"serving in world war 2\\". I doubt she's done either. (Though she does have an idea for such a song \\"Good-bye Walla Walla I'm off to Smash Allah\\") so being a patriot is promoting hate for the religion of others.

Bravo, Ms. Coulter! The LaBrea tar pit of vitriol bursting from liberal reviewers--including those masquerading as \\"Republicans\\"; we know better--further reinforces the truth of Coulter's judgment that liberals are hateful creatures. One might argue about Coulter's sarcastic style--I personally would prefer that she tone down the constant, biting quips in her works--but if the style inflames the political left and emboldens the political right, it has served a worthy purpose.

We need a book that exposes the Left's continuing cover-up of bad deeds by left-wing spies in high places during the New Deal, the Fair Deal, and Joe McCarthy's raw deal. McCarthy set back the just cause of anti-communism; this book sets back the cause of setting the record straight.Two scholars from Yale, Haynes and Klehr, don't have Coulter's talent for trouble or her avidity for headlines.

However, I did wonder what the point of this book was. She expresses her anger but she does not really back it up. When she wishes to dismiss an opposing argument, she merely labels the person or group making the opposing point as \\"stupid\\" or \\"morons.\\" We are not talking about literature that will be appearing in Political Science classes in the future. I don't want to be ugly, even though this book can work you up, whether you like it or not.

An apparently talented attorney gone berserk with hatred that is almost comical in its vituperation if not for the deadly seriousness of the author's intent.In a country that prides itself in the freedom of expression, I welcome this outlet for the deranged and hateful propogandists of the right. I believe that most thoughtful readers will be so offended by this screed that they will rightfully conclude the source of such diatribes are wrong and unbalanced in their mind.

But don't go by me, you may like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCarthy Good?","review":"Anyone who would try to claim that Joseph McCarthy was a good senator should be committed to an insane asylum. McCarthy was a proven liar and was proven to be a liar on TV. Apparantly Ann didn't see that and wants to rewrite history. Either that or she believes that making up rediculous stories about people in an attempt to discredit them is a good thing. Which brings us to the main point of her book and that is to tell lots of stories about how liberals are bad. I have to question the validity of what she says since a lot of these stories are extremely over the top and after a while she sounds like Joe McCarthy herself. The thing is there is really nothing in here that states Republican policies in government are correct, it is all about be critical of people who don't agree with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascistic sludge","review":"Is this woman insane or just a fembot? Either way this book is hateful and wrong. Tell me which is more patriotic: to believe and defend the right to speak out and dissent? or the belief that liberals are treasonous? Liberals are treasonous!!!?????? Gees....I thought I lived in a free democratic society. Hmmm...guess Ann has set me straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hateful Book","review":"This book slanders liberals. It says Sen. Joseph McCarthy is a hero for making false claims against innocent people. And anyone who wishes to engage in democratic debate and not just go along with conservative ideas is a traitor. This is a very sad book. I cannot believe a book could be so hateful. But then again look at her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"I hoped this book would shed light on contemporary events with detailed analysis of the right wing agenda. Unfortunately, I think this book is more of a rant than an analysis. Ann, just as in Slander, uses the repetition make truth strategy that she has inherited from Savage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann's lost her mind","review":"If you thought it amazing that her last book was allowed to be billed as \\"non-fiction,\\" you will really cringe upon reading this one. You see, Ann has morphed her rage against liberals into fury at anyone left of George W. and Ashcroft. But she doesn't give researched examples or solid arguments -- surprise, surprise! -- but offers, instead, a hysterical screed that effectively labels more than 50% of Americans traitors. One thing is for certain, this book is not about anything but ANN, and of all the people you could read about, she's most certainly the least interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open a history book people","review":"Please.

Read and see.","review":"Although I am familiar with her columns, I have never read one of her books. Before reading this book, I was concerned that her style, which is well suited to column writing, might not translate well to a full length book.It turns out I was wrong. The book is an easy read, full of information that few people today will be aware of.This book will make dogmatic, knee-jerk Democrats wail. However, if read by more open minded folks, this book might just encourage some to take a closer look at the actual events of the \\"McCarthy\\" era rather than just what \\"everybody knows\\" about it.If you grant her her point, doesn't honesty require her to be outraged as she is? Yes. But the liberal sob sisters and fellow travellers will demonstrate their complicity with treason by not even admitting this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting more","review":"Buying a book thats been in the top ten doesn't mean it will be a good read.

However, it's well documented that her books are packed with erroneous citings and distorted facts. I honestly don't know how she gets away with it. And the hateful tone? It's either a shrewd way of keeping people's attention or else the woman really is mentally unbalanced. (I'm hearing more and more people speculate about that; I mean, she actually uses the phrase \\"scrawny pinko\\" at one point.)Also, I've heard more than once that Coulter considers herself a real foxy babe. Think about that, look at the cover of her book, and you'll see that she's clearly existing in an alternative universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last No Political Speak","review":"Ann Coulter is articulate and smart and simply uncovers the truth.

(I'm a conservative, but I don't listen to Limbaugh - or, I'm a conservative but I can't stand Hannity; or I think that Couter chick is nuts...) Thanks to these infotainers, to profess to being \\"conservative\\" grows increasingly synonymous to proclaiming yourself to be an imbecile - really!These high profile bafoons are doing a number on the credibility of the republican party.

I think not!","review":"To the reviewer who described Ann Coulter as an intellectual, I can only say, I think not! She is the worst kind of person in that the facts never stand in her way of her vitriolic and inaccurate blather. I listened to this on tape and I was so angry at times over the overt prevarications she uses, passing them off as facts, that it made me want to scream! The fact that she can call the invasion of Grenada a huge success (island with the population cleveland, 12 service men died due to friendly fire versus enemy fire and 8,000 medals of bravery given to only 7,000 men and Regan slept through the whole thing?)The woman needs to be slapped silly for the inflamatory prose she excretes in the name of patriotism and the American way. She is an embarassment to Democrats and Republicans alike! I am a liberal Democrat and how dare she assume that I am not a patriot! How dare anyone assume that! It is slander!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive tripe","review":"Coulter's a schmuck who has done the conservative movement a grave diservice by defending a thug like McCarthy. Who's next?

His name was given to him by plague ridden infidel liberal Ottoman Turks, who are now writhing in agony on stakes-Ahem!-who love Wallachia or they will be executed-\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book people...","review":"From all the jibes going back and forth, you would think this is a great work of political theory. It isn't. It's a poorly written, factually suspect, hastily compiled work of mere opinions. Liberals will hate it because it is clearly biased, and only the dumbest conservatives will believe all of the things she says in here. If you have to read it, wait until it gets in the bargain bins (and it will). The sad thing is that, since this book has managed to generate so much controversy, this woman is bound to be published again. Like Morton Downey Jr., like Rush Limbaugh, even, I might add, like Joe McCarthy himself, Coulter and her opinions are a fad who will fade in time and no one will even remember what all the fuss is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann should learn to read before she writes","review":"I bought this book thinking that I would finally read something intelligent on this topic from the conservative perspective. Unfortunately, Ann seems to have decided that it's easier to simply make up a lot of so-called \\"facts\\" rather than taking the time and energy to actually research what are fairly easily obtainable historical data. Shame on her. She's giving us conservatives a bad name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suck it up...","review":"Ann has it right. The liberals in our country have always been for redistibution of wealth, confication of arms, re-education via political correctness, etc.They ARE the losers in the cold war and they continue to push their bankrupt socialist / communist agenda. The liberals know what best for everyone and consider themselves 'elite'. To them I say, get your hand out of my pocket and get lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Rhetoric","review":"This book in the long list of un achivements by Mrs. Coulter is another opinion piece not based on the truth just smear.

Indeed, conservative writers Dorothy Rabinowitz and David Horowitz have criticized her for being so over the top as to give her detractors credibility in their attacks on her and her adherents.Her contribution to the further polarization and invicivility in discourse is, however, plain to see. For those who buy into her rhetoric as the gospel, there is only one just point of view, and the world is easily separated into black and white. To sum up: a childish rant for those who prefer not to delve into the nuances and complexities that make up life and history."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this one out of morbid curiosity","review":"What I saw was a person who knows very little about history and makes the assumption that anyone who doesn't share ANN COULTER'S morbid worldview is not only un-American, but treasonous.I suggest that anyone who actually believes her dribble also read the \\"I Hate Ann Coulter....Reader.\\" They will see just how little truth and accuracy mean to Ann Coulter and just how warped she is.This book ranks right up there with the publications Joseph Goebbels came up with for the Reich of his boss.

One of the least coherrent and morally repugnant books ever written. You'll feel robbed if the book is sent with a 50 dollar bill taped to the cover.

Ann methodically dissects the Liberal mythology surrounding them all (and more).

Unfortuntly, Ann Coulter's rambling, ridiculous screed is nothing more than her hateful rants.

It's just a cynical way for her to make her book controversial and thus put more money in her pocket. Does she care that she is tarring well-meaning people (who in many cases ARE and WERE right?

Why pick on Senator Joseph McCarthy, she asks? Granted, she points out, McCarthy was evil and embarrassing. But who sanctioned him? Ann correctly points out that it was you and I. What I like about Ann is her ability to see subtleties. Whereas you or I might think, \\"liberal\\" or \\"conservative\\", Ann sees through the soundbite simplification and sees the complexities. Ann knows what a tough world it is that we live in, and that if we want to get anywhere we had best toss our silly \\"liberal\\" vs. \\"conservative\\" absolutism out the window. After all, Ann writes, paraphrasing the bible, \\"let he who is free of sin cast the first stone\\". \\"Let's start seeing problems for what they are!!!\\" Ann says, \\"instead of letting our preformed hackneyed ideologies lead us to a fake truth.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny Stuff","review":"I got a good laugh out of the review called \\"got them liberals on the run.\\" I really hope that it was a sarcastic joke imitating right-wing readers of this book.

Those of us in the military sweat, sometimes bleed and sometimes die in order to protect the Constitution and protect America's freedoms--for both Republicans and Democrats. After nearly 20 years of service to God and Country, it truly saddens me to see this particular author so vilifying the 40% or so of the country who are Democrats. Further, she tries to take away through innuendo (it's \\"unpatriotic\\" to say this or that) that what those of us in the military are willing to die to protect. What's worse, she does so with unsubstantiated claims, some of which are down right false--too many to even begin addressing in a forum such as this.But that's the hard thing about freedom--we Democrats in the military fight to protect this author's right to say these things, too. I just wish she'd realize that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth often hurts........","review":"Ann has opened the door to the mis-deeds of decades from some very important people including Popes as well as well known figures from Washington, D.C.

She does a great job of insulting anybody who may, simply because they must be delusional, disagree with anything she believes. Unfortunately - she's just not a very good writer.When I started reading this book I was outraged that this could even be published, then it just got funny (it appears she puts Reagan slightly above God in her pantheon) then she finally convinced me (around the time she recommends just dropping a nuke on Iraq to solve the terrorist problem) - if being a traitor means that you believe the well being of the entire human race, and the future of the world, is more important then some American billionaires then I'd say she has made a very good case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't throw stones in a glass house","review":"It's odd that the conservatives, who always claim that they are somehow \\"saving\\" America from the \\"evil\\" liberals, are the ones who write books attacking the patriotism of anyone who does not share their political beliefs.

She claims there is this massive liberal conspiracy, which leads me to wonder why our government is firmly controlled by conservative interests, and she resorts to base name-calling of former President Clinton.Her book seems one shade away from suggesting that all of \\"THOSE\\" kind of people be rounded up and placed in camps \\"for their own protection and the protection of the country\\".A good read in the sense of seeing just how radical the radical right is becoming, right up there with \\"Mein Kampf\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be taken seriously","review":"For all her zeal in providing citations, Ann's conclusions are obviously colored by her ideology rather than by the facts. Her arguments that Truman and Marshall's actions at the beginning of the Cold War \\"accidentally\\" protected the world from communism require mental acrobatics beyond the abilities of most people, as well as require the convenient neglect of a significant fraction of the historical record.

It is irresponsible to even treat this book as nonfiction.I am at a loss as to why so many Americans are quick to embrace Coulter's apologist view of McCarthyism.

She outlines the ridiculous statements of Liberals and Liberal news organization in their contradictory statements involving the Iraq wars, and it really is funny --- their alarm at the Axis of Evil statement, their voting for the Iraq war before the mid-term elections, but then equivocating afterwards when it was safe to work against it., etc.She takes a satirical look at the various Hollywood \\"experts\\" which is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"facts","review":"The only treason is the treason of the person that wrote the book.

At least O'Reilly appears to speak from a platform of educated scrutiny, not a shrill cry for attention by spinning tall tales. I managed to get through this book in one reading, but not without a lot of head-shaking and several smirks. Coulter's from CORNELL? The college, right?Thanks for the laughs, Ann....but readers are best advised to save their money for \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" if they want quality fantasy.

Sadly, it appears that many will not be as observant of her liberal interpretations of \\"fact\\" and will read this as a non-fiction piece of historical analysis.The book should come with a \\"literalist warning\\" label, advising readers to read the tome as a postmodern conspiracy theory of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun read for robo-conservatives with mid level IQs.","review":"Coulter is fun for Republicans with IQs in the 100-120 range.

It should appeal to people with the same desire to blame and vilify - without the pesky influence of self-reflection or responsibility.The ultimate lesson of \\"Treason\\" is not that there are liberals hiding in the bushes to abort your babies and spit on a flag, but that anyone with an agenda can grasp for bits and pieces to \\"prove\\" whatever they like.

Slander, her bestseller from last year, quickly became notorious for its errors and distortions of the facts (a quick google search will lead you to these). In Treason she takes her attacks to a new, and altogether astonishing level.Describing everyone with viewpoints that differ from hers as traitors, Coulter states that she believes that liberals are intentionally attemtping to destroy the United States. She explains to us what a patriot Joe McCarthy was, and how those who support freedom and liberty are guilty of Treason.Coulter in general, and this book in specific are prime examples of the worst in American political commentary. Rather than attempt to present a viable viewpoint, Coulter distorts facts, takes quotes out of context, calls her opponents names, and lies (with lots of footnotes). Personally, I'm of the opinion that calling ones opponents names does not serve to further any just political cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"More right-wing garbage","review":"Joseph Goebbels would have been proud of this book.

It was well played out. I thought it followed the book really well too. It did not leave much out which made me very happy. Jo makes this movie comes alive with her wild personality. Laury and his funny attitudes also made this movie lovable. Out of all the characters in this movie. Jo and Laury were my two favorites. I love the book and the movie too. The book was BETTER.Laury and his boyish looks, Jo and her tomboyish personality, Meg and kind works and personality, Beth and her quiet ways and Amy and her spoiled ways, all thess characters made this movie come alive with fun, laughter, warmth, kindness. It was a great movie to watch on a cold winter or snowy day. Makes you want to be a part of the kind and happy family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bag","review":"I've had this bag for a year now and it is awesome, I am very hard on my pures but this one has held up and held up, it has a few rub marks and stains on it now but it just looks like distressed leather, very nice, well worth the $100 I spent on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"read this","review":"I love the song of daniel. when you read it, you feel like you are sitting next to daniel in the cemetary, the details are so vivid. it's the first book I've ever read that I literally couldn't put down. I read it in one day, and would recommend it to anyone who needs to read a book they will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"a touching story","review":"... I set out to read one of his earlier novels - a touching piece entitled The Song of Daniel. It was a very heartfelt and sincere story about a young man named Daniel Mitchell, living in a world of his own. It was a peaceful life - an escape from reality that he created for himself, after he had been exposed to unspeakable violence in his early childhood. This realm of Daniel's remains untouched, until he meets worldly and somewhat cynical Rebecca. As a result, they learn much from each other. In this masterpiece, Williams has conveyed Daniel's thoughts, vulnerabilities, and deepest fears with such an indescribable intricacy that puts us in his shoes. Finally Daniel deals with the uprising of his past in his own way. I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice collection of tunes","review":"The other reviews have explained the genesis of this album, so I won't repeat it--but I have to say, I continue to be amazed at the amount of great music Blue Note didn't issue at the time it was recorded. This is a really nice collection. Stanley is, as always, a pleasure to listen to, so laid back, but in a gutsier, more muscular way than Stan Getz (who I also love). And the Duke Pearson arrangements are wonderful. Such beautiful harmonies and textures. I'm really digging the sound of this \\"downsized\\" big band (most cuts feature nine or ten players). The harmonic richness is there, but it's never overpowering, and it consistently avoids big-band cliches. If you like Stanley's \\"Rough 'N' Tumble\\" or \\"The Spoiler,\\" then you will dig this set. Same general instrumental format, all Duke Pearson arrangements."},{"rating":"1","title":"This whole series is very weak.","review":"If you want a good yoga workout, don't buy any of the tapes in this series.

The answers in the back of the book cannot be counted on to be correct. E.g., Game 32 has an incorrect answer in the back of the book. I'm a mathematician by training. When the GRE test had an experimental test on logical thinking, I scored in the high 90's. I'm good at this kind of puzzle and enjoy doing these, but this set is awful. You might try works by Martin Gardner instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this even applicable in real life?","review":"Are these puzzles even applicable in any real-life situation?

This set contains the albums Horowitz at Home, Horowitz in Moscow, Horowitz plays Mozart, The Last Romantic, Horowitz the Poet, and the 1985 studio recordings. All of the music is superb and you will see it frequently released in Horowitz compilation cds. I highly recommend this collection for any Horowitz lover or as a collection to get into Horowitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album of the 90's no one ever heard","review":"This is a fantastic album! It is unfortunate that no one knows of this band. At the height of grunge 2 Minutes Hate released this diamond that was melodic enough for lightweights yet hard rockin enough for us hardcores.

After the Playskol one was put through the ringer by my 3 year old, we needed to replace it. We ended up purchasing the new Video Now. It was actually cheaper at Wal-Mart than the Playskol one. Anyway, the screen is better, the sound is better and the picture is better. The flip screen is pretty neat too. HOWEVER, it seems like it is made cheaply and that was very clear when after having it for less than 1 week it died!!! We tried new batteries and even the adapter, and it just does nothing!

Several times when my daughter has gone to watch a disc the screen stays black and you can hear it but see nothing. It is so frustrating for her and myself. Also, within a few days a big orange blotch appeared in the middle of the screen and will not go away. My daughter says it doesn't bother her and she still enjoys it when it is functioning properly.

They have all the cartoons memorized from when they aired on TV anyway. They love the screen being bigger than the older version, and they like the color picture. It's a small price to pay for cheap entertainment.

Why, yes, actually, we do indeed.

The Salisbury cousins do an admirable job of covering the sled-dog relay, and relating the dangers involved in the relay. Since the story of the relay, while compelling, is a relatively quick one to recount, the authors \\"fill-in\\" with some Alaskan history - especially that of Nome - and with descriptions of how the natives of Alaska survived in such a seemingly harsh environment. The political machinations that went into deciding how to deliver the serum (by plane or by sled relay) are also thoroughly covered. \\"The Cruelest Miles\\" is a fitting tribute the heroic men and dogs who helped to save Nome.(Special thanks to the reviewer who actually met Leonhard Seppala - great review!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldnt even finish it","review":"The book went off on random stories/ tangents on every page.

I was so anxious to read this book because the subtitle said it was \\"The Heroic Story of Dogs and Men in a Race Against an Epidemic.\\" But I'm afraid the subtitle was like a promise not kept. That is, while this book did include this information, it just seemed to be slipped in here and there with a whole bunch of other stuff. The writing went all over the place.

It's as if the film was new and I was watching another \\"The Artist\\". I also like that I have the choice of the music score to accompany the film, either full orchestra or just organ. As for the movie itself, this would be considered the \\"Titanic\\" of its day, judging from the \\"making of\\" extras included. Lots of costly painstaking special effects, the studio execs didn't want to undertake the project. But the director William Wellman stuck with it and his efforts paid off.

The duet with Peabo Bryson is especially nice and to my surprise Cybill holds her own on the track. I have to say \\"Shot Through The Heart\\", \\"Push For You\\" and \\"Bend\\" are my favorites though. When I hear these songs I can't help but to swept away in a time warp to the era we call the 80's. The simplicity of the arrangements showcase's Cybill's voice quite nicely. Furthermore, the instruments (especially the synthesizers) sound nostalgic rather than dated.I was surprised I hadn't heard of this CD until 1996. I'm equally surprised that the songs weren't hits. There's some really great material on here. Although, I don't listen to this CD on a daily basis it's a nice treasure to stumble acrosss in my music collection every now and then.

It immediately reminded me of The Natural-a great baseball story, even if contrived, and non-historical and different than Malamud's book. When Miss Madison crosses the finish line, it's the same feeling as Roy Hobbes rounding the bases under arcing light towers.Heck, how many good boat racing movies have there been?

At least not as hard and fast if compared with shorter up-to-date video footage you can find on the internet. It is nice to see some of the old boats in action though. The plot may be based on a true story but will put any child to sleep. Even I had a real hard time watching the whole thing.

I have to admit the distaste that it produced in me to find the author comparing in the same paragraph Neo-nazis claiming that their was no Holocaust to people upset about the removal of prayer due to the fact we think this to be as \\"godless\\", also the right that we have as revisionist to verify our true history? (p12 bottom, 13 top)I understand that a school must remain neutral and keep the peace. But to teach in this book that groups like this are trouble (the third group as he calls it) and will bring only warfare to a school leader is downright bias.

Perhaps built on a bad day so maybe you would have better luck.Otherwise, It's got a lot of cool features like stereo sound, tone control, auxiliary out (so you can hook it up to a stereo amplifier), the ability to play more than one record.

I did the whole workout and felt very relaxed and gently thorougly stretched out at the end. I bought this workout so that I would have two 20 minute yoga stretching workouts to add-on to other high intensity workouts.

Scott Thorpe, the book's author, says that rule ruts are like railroad tracks: if you want to go to where the railroad track goes, just follow it. But if you don't, you have to get off of it. In short, break your own rules of thinking.While Albert Einstein is the perfect person to reference in the contextualization of the book's premise, it runs out of steam rather quickly.

This CD is a good place to start!This package contains selections from the group's 1938-39 Decca records, which were mostly re-recordings of their earlier Victor records. Carter Family enthusiasts may find these tracks a bit too polished and \\"finely tuned\\" to capture fully the sparkle and originality demonstrated by The Carters on their late-1920s recordings. However, I feel that the tracks on this CD show The Carter Family at the apogee of their vocal and musical talents. Sara's voice brings warmth and feeling to even the most maudlin lyrics (\\"Little Joe,\\" for instance), and Maybelle's guitar playing was never better than it is on these songs. But, be warned: you will want to hear (and buy) more of The Carter Family's music once you listen to this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!","review":"The best thing ever, I just power washed the siding and cleaned the gutter-have a two story house, and felt safe with the ladder-Max. The top of the ladder-Max rest on top of the roof and not on the gutter, so my worries of the ladder slipping or going sideways was eliminated. This device is worth every penny. Every one who have an extension ladder should have a ladder-Max. I'm a frequent shopper of amazon but never bothered with product review, but with this product I just have to spread the word. If you value your safety get the ladder-Max. I used this device with a 28 foot Werner extension ladder with the leg level, also I got from Amazon-not a scratched from shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Engineering","review":"I bought this for my 30' extension ladder and what a difference. It was very easy to assemble and fit into the ladder, and it makes cleaning the gutters and painting on a 2 or 3 story house much safer. I can use the rubber extensions to slide the ladder along the house, it grips the roof nicely, and makes for a much more stable experience up on the ladder. And it comes back off the ladder with ease when I'm finished. Cool product, worth the expense"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now feel safe working 30 feet up","review":"Bought this for my super-tall house ladder. Working 30 feet above the ground never felt so secure. Standoff is the perfect size to keep the ladder off of the gutters while putting up Christmas lights. I could finally string lights right past the ladder without moving the ladder! The biggest plus is that the ladder is rock solid once in position. The big con is that, extending a 30 foot ladder with this attached is impossible without a second person due to the topheavy load this puts on the ladder. I'd give it the 5th star if it could somehow be lighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A women's point of view","review":"I'm a 53 year old woman and purchased the Ladder-Max Stand-off Stabilizer so that I could do my parents gutters on their 2 story A-frame home by myself.

Have already lent it out and was also told how safe they felt on the ladder doing their own gutters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakes and Bounces","review":"The pins that fasten the stabilizer to the ladder do fasten the two together, however, being pins only, they allow the stabilizer to slide recklessly from left to right. For me, especially at heights, this can be terribly disconcerting. As a builder I've used and owned far better stabilizers that don't shake and bounce like this and I'm quite surprised this one is so popular. Overall, while well made, I think it's poorly designed and unpleasant to use. I give it a two-star for the quality materials but I would not recommend this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives me confidence when working on a ladder","review":"The stabilizer took a few minutes and an extra pair of hands to assemble, but was easy to attach to the extension ladder.

I still love the CD and listen to it all the time, without skipping any songs. I later purchased Essential Guy Clark, but did not like it nearly as much, the production was lousy and the songs just did not hit me the way the songs on Dublin Blues did. I hemmed and hawed on picking this new one up, but finally did a few weeks ago. Glad I did, this is a wonderful album, very similar in style to Dublin Blues, good tunes and good stories. I guess if you have a winning formula stick with it. The songs have a warmth to them that makes you feel like you are sitting around a campfire or pub listening in person. The stories are all entertaining. Definitely worth the price, and I don't skip any of the songs on this disk either. Tornado time in Texas is my favorite so far, always turn that one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Work","review":"Guy Clark is an aquired taste but he's a craftsman. He's like a guy that makes custom wood furniture. You may not like the piece but you know that it was well made, of good material and more than a little sweat. I was particularly taken with Magdalene, Broke His Funny Bone and Analog Girl. The arrangements are spare but appropriate. I find myself whistling more ornate Mexican rifts in Magdalene which has very simple ones. OK I am a sixty's folky and I like texas music. All of these songs have something to recommend them I just picked out the three that are currently running around in my head.

Not for the faint of heart or the easily squeemish, his books remain groteque and fun and this latest Fillerbunny keeps going strong. He addresses the reasons for a lack of merchadise with his name on it. He makes it clear that he's doing this for his own reasons and we're along for the ride if we want to be.

However, to me, this album is a disappointment...Soul-less and too polished (YES I understand it's essentially recorded live with little to no overdubbing!) but I stand by my point. The album is almost entirely devoid of the \\"Frankisms\\" that make his stuff so special and enduring for me... No disrespect, but I really couldn't care less about the credentials of the session musicians, the producer, or the history behind the studio that it was recorded in...I'd much rather him go back to the mobile studio with some no-names and bang out some more quirky songs...that's what makes Frank... Frank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lull me, Frank. You da man!","review":"Like pretty much all other output from this man, Honeycomb is heartfelt and true. It does readers a tremendous disservice to ever refer to his music as \\"country.\\" That notion is plain ridiculous. Just as he mastered -- along with the rest of the Pixies -- the art of uniquely conveying youthful angst, he has come to master the folky twang of plucking on heart strings... and once given a chance, you simply have no choice but to believe his every verse and musing. That said, I must admit that, for me, Honeycomb simply fits in the middle there, somewhere among the rest of his folkier solo work. For my money, it doesn't get any better than Teenager Of The Year. Still, Honeycomb is a wonderful album, even blowing away lesser works like \\"The Cult Of Ray.\\" I just wish he would leave cutesy li'l ditties like \\"Song Of The Shrimp\\" off his albums. They don't help to garner respect from the fickle listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeycomb is Outstanding!","review":"Honeycomb is a far cry from Frank Black's beginnings with the Pixies, but give this album a chance.

Be warned, this is not a 'rockin' album. If you need music to be distored or 'tough' sounding this is not the record for you. However, if you have even the slightest appreciation for southern soul or American Roots music I don't see how you could dislike this album. Of the negative reviews I've seen from the Frank faithful, I can't help but think these are individuals that just can't find easy going music appealing. Whether this be the need for music to be tough to affirm image, or just the uniform lack of diversity in popular music these last dozen years, I urge the seasoned music fan to purchase this album. The musicianship and subtle instrumentation of the album are breathtaking, and Black's subdued and soulful vocals are quite impressive within the context of this new musical voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep inducing","review":"Oh boy... couldn't agree more with the reviewer that said that he didn't care about the backing musicians or producer..... it seems that people are interested in this record for everything that isn't to do with Frank Black.Oh well.... listening to this I can see why he decided to re-form the Pixies.... by the way I loved his first two solo albums but the cracks started appearing in the quality control dept already in The Cult of Ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have I been????","review":"Wow. I just finished listening to this cd for the first time and it blew me away. It's my new favorite cd. Funny thing is, I have never heard one Frank Black song before (that I know of), and have never heard the Pixies. I have heard OF them, but have never bothered to get to know their music (even though Curt Cobain excitedly endorsed them). From what I hear, this disc is a departure for Frank Black, so I'm sure I can expect much different offerings if I dig into the Pixies catalog. But dig I will because I am smitten with this cd. Someone used the word \\"organic\\" to describe it-perfect wording. It's organic. It's also fresh, fun, and soulfully mature. I am positively thrilled to have discovered it.

Greg Kinnear (who gives an excellent performance) states on the comment track of the DVD that body doubles were used for his \\"sex\\" scenes and Willem Defoe says he was angry that he did not get to do the \\"sex\\" scenes. Seems an indication of the opposite types of men they are.The documentary on the DVD goes into detail about the police investigation and the actual murder and is much more interesting. That was the only thing that saved the DVD for me.Usually I'm a fan of Greg Kinnear but watching him in this film was like seeing a well liked personality like Mickey Mouse play Jack the Ripper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawed portrait of a flawed man","review":"Greg Kinnear gives one of his better performances as late Hogan's Heroes star Bob Crane, a man who lost everything from his starpower, to both his marriages, and finally his life because of his sexual addiction. At the center of his addiction is John Carpenter (no, not the director) played by the always excellent Willem Dafoe who provided Crane the technology to film their deeds while Crane provided the women. Director Paul Schrader (writer of Taxi Driver and director of American Gigolo) gives a flawed but hauntingly amusing look at Crane's life; whether or not it's all fact can be left up to the viewer, but Auto Focus is carried by the solid performances of Kinnear and Dafoe. The DVD itself has a number of solid extras, including a documentary on Crane's murder and commentaries including one with Kinnear and Dafoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre.","review":"This is a very carefully made film (as it has to be to drum up sympathy for Bob Crane). But ultimately its just another movie about a guy who was so likeable we're supposed to overlook everything else. This is the same premise as Catch Me If You Can--a much more enjoyable movie. In both cases these guys are charming but totally sleezy.Had he not died in the way he did, brutal and unsolved, no one would even think of making a movie about him. Mild controversy aside, Hogan's Heros is as memorable as My Mother The Car.I love Greg Kinnear but he neither looks nor sounds like Bob Crane. None of the other players fit either, with the possible exception of the guy who plays Werner Klemperer. The Richard Dawson character is totally wrong and Wilem Dafoe doesn't seem like he even lived in that era.Oh by the way, there's nothing funny in this film. How could there be? As for sympathy If Bob Crane ultimately died of a (fulfilled) craving for sex, I hope to go the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"less of a review and more of a question","review":"i never saw this film in the cinema, it came and went at the local art house before i gave myself half a chance to see it. the other day i purchased the DVD and after all was said and done, i came to realize something a bit strange. what i want to know is (from you folks whom actually saw it back then): were certain scenes in the film digitally blurred in the theatrical release or is that just exclusive to the DVD? this information would greatly affect my review since censorship, especially in a film of this type, would defeat the purpose of its addition to my collection. if anyone would care to clarify this for me, i would greatly appreciate it.on the plus side, i always get a kick out of seeing rita wilson in any film. not too many people know that one of her first acting jobs was as a cheerleader on the original \\"brady bunch\\" television program (one of greg's many hotties)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down!

I enjoyed this latest Schrader offering even better than American Gigolo. Kinnear is perfectly cast as Bob Crane-the \\"Ward Cleaver\\" father figure corrupted by power and sex. Willem Dafoe is at his slimy best portraying the parasitical hanger on John Carpenter. The scene in the nightclub where Crane breaks off their relationship is particularly chilling and Dafoe comes off as the creepiest movie villain since Richard Widmark some 50 years prior. This film is not so much a biography of a man as it is a chronicle of temptation and lust; and it is gloomily filmed and expertly cast. Oscar nominations for the two principal actors should certainly follow and ones for directing and screenplay as well. The best movie I have seen thus far in 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but so what?","review":"It was only going to be a matter of time before Hollywood made a film about the life of Bob Crane. Is it entirely accurate? Probably not based on comments by his family on various websites. Perhaps they are protecting his seemingly seedy image, but at the end of the day evidence has been found to suggest that Crane spent many hours producing home blue movies.The film explores some interesting themes - the cost of fame, the bad side of money, and the value of friendships. Greg Kinnear is excellent as Bob Crane, and William Dafoe is equally as good as the sleazy friend.At the end of the film I thought \\"what a sad existence Bob had near the end\\" but in a sense he was really happy with how his life ended up. Porn became his world, his obsession."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film seriously dents Paul Schrader's reputation .................","review":"It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's not insightful, it's not entertaining.

Franklin is always a fascinating tale, as his own Autobiography has shown for centuries, and Wood captures the tale of artisan of lowly origins turned into a diplomat at foreign courts with great skill.

This video is a great substitute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A short Intro to an Instrumental Icon","review":"Sarah Bareilles breaks new ground at the Fillmore. Her instrumental(piano) and vocal combinations provide a subtle ambiance for a soothing experience. At times, her direction in lyrics doesn��t quite reach her capability as an artist, but in a few songs she does demonstrate a descent vocal range. In other songs, mass message marketing is overbearing and takes away from the piano vocal combination. Overall, I think she could produce a great albulm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God I found it...","review":"I find this DVD/CD presentation to be one of the best I own (I own many...). Sara is extremely talented and has an incredible voice. The production of this concert DVD took everything into account, including its audio and visual quality, its presentation and compilation as well as capturing Sara's amazing vocal talent. It's extremely creative, fun and emotional.The inclusion of the 'houseboat' performances is really a kick, as is the integration of these 'houseboat' performances into the concert footage. The videos are really fun and creative. Being able to listen to the concert in my car is really cool, thanks to the included CD.I was, am and continue to be blown away by this particular concert DVD. Nice job!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Talent-Beautiful DVD","review":"If you don't know Sara Bareilles you will after seeing this DVD.

Some discs need numerous rebooting of the player in order to play the discs. Only major problem for me was buying the blu-ray series but later finding out its not all in blu-ray (checked season 1,2,8 so far). An extra $30 i didn't have to pay. I would suggest buying the complete series in DVD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but Medallion was better....","review":"I was an avid fan of the show while on the air and in syndication. As such, I was tremendously excited to purchase the complete series as this would allow me to enjoy all my favorite episodes at my leisure.I was not able to enjoy my favorite episodes at my leisure for the following reasons:1) the quality of the DVDs is horrible! The background noise and ambient sounds in almost all the scenes drown the main characters' dialogues. You can't follow the story if you can't hear the characters speak!!2) the story telling was full of mistakes when you are able to watch episodes back to back. This was a big distraction from truly being able to enjoy each season in its entirety.If you need your fix of Vinny and the boys, I would watch the show on syndication to have a more pleasurable experience than purchasing this box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable?","review":"At least two of the seasons are unreadable on every DVD player I tried including my laptop.

There's also more to it than just coloring in pictures - there are lots of fill-in-the-blanks sections to test your knowledge and review major ideas. This is where the only criticism lies....if you don't have the textbook (or a good knowledge of the material) then some sections will be hard to complete. Answers are provided, however, so overall, it is a really useful book and offers more than you might first assume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy helper","review":"This is an excellent review for anatomy class. However, it is not really a coloring book, it is a study guide/workbook. There is another study guide that has the alot of the same material...

My teacher had both listed as recommened and since I ordered them both through Amazon merchants over a month ago, I can not return one. There are some slight differences, so I will just use both for extra extra review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product reveiew","review":"The book was received before the final due date of the shipment window.

I opened the first bar and notices the chocolate covering was whitish (signify the emulsifiers are breaking down) I bit into it it was nasty tasting like something that was very out of date and stale.

I was very disappointed, the bars did not have any type of creamy texture that you get from peanut butter. I had issues actually swallowing a bite from the bar. I needed to drink a glass of water while I ate to even finish it. The taste of the bar was okay at best, I mean it faded after a few moments probably due to the massive amount of water it took to finish it. The bar did have little chunks of peanuts so that was pleasing but other then that it just wasn't very good. I wanted to like this but I don't so I can't recommend this item to anyone who is just looking for a quick bite in bar form that isn't a candy variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really healthy bars, tasty too","review":"These bars are great, they are really tasty and definitely have good flavor.

These seemed simple and are advertised as chunky peanut butter. Nowhere in the description, title or picture on the package did it mention chocolate. I now have a box of protein bars that I cant' take hiking with me, because they melt.I'd rather find a simple gluten-free, high-protein bar that I could eat in the morning without the chocolate. Seems impossible to find. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste terrible and didn't help me lose weight.","review":"I bought these in bulk so had no choice but to try them for quite a while before giving up. I just noted that I agreed with review of Ms. Hampton. They are loaded processed peanut and cocoa butter fats, which can't be good. I did not lose any weight but gained. It wasn't until I switched to a rice protein drink that I lost and I know it was the bars because I didn't make any other changes but to substitute the bars for the rice drinks.I also tried all the flavors but none tastes good. I will not be making any more orders of these bars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Think FAT. Awful tasting and high in fat.","review":"My husband kept buying boxes of these to take to work (thinking it was a good thing) so I also tried them. Every flavor tastes awful with the peanut butter being the least awful.The worst part, though, is we both GAINED weight and his cholesterol went through the roof. That is when I checked the ingredients to note that, though sugar free, they are very high in fat - 8 grams of fat per bar! And this is a bad fat because after my husband stopped eating these, his bad cholesterol went back down.Bottom line is there is NO substitute for eating a sensible, healthy diet of REAL FOOD and getting exercise. No such thing as a meal in a pre packaged bar that is healthy and certainly not these. If I am going to eat something unhealthy (as these are) it better taste really good to be worth the sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I live on these things...","review":"I have tried many of the Think Thin bars and the chunky peanut butters are my favorite... not to sweet and a good consistency.

However, those with a large appetite will surely love how filling they can be. It is almost hard to believe how good these taste. I was cynical when I read the ingredient list compared to the other reviews. 20g of protein, sugar free yet tasty? All I can say is that all the positive reviews are correct. They are really yummy yet have a great nutritional value. I keep a bunch in my office at work, and will use them to snack on mid-afternoon to keep my energy and focus up. Admittedly, sometimes, I will eat two."},{"rating":"2","title":"a better protein bar","review":"These bars have proven to be a good choice. I bring them to work.

I discovered these bars at Costco (unfortunately, they no longer carry them). I eat one for breakfast every day. I also bring a bunch with me when I am travelling so I don't have to eat junk food on airplanes etc. These are so filling and so large compared to other bars. I love that they are also gluten-free. They do taste like a candy bar - that's the best part! I don't feel like I am dieting. This is my favorite flavor, although I also eat the Brownie Crunch to mix it up. You will not be disappointed! I've gotten many friends and coworkers to eat these too. Everyone loves them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flavor with lots of protein, but there is one problem...","review":"We love these bars because they are low sugar and high protein for a reasonable amount of calories. However, some of the bars seem to be old or dried out, and one bar was very strange looking with spots all over it. I couldn't find an easy way to get a partial refund or replacement of only one out of ten bars, so that one bar was simply a waste of money. The product itself is excellent, but we're unsure whether we ultimately save money by buying it from Amazon when we may randomly have to throw away bad bars.Bottom line: awesome product, but there are some issues with quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these bars from Amazon","review":"ThinkThin are great bars. Amazon delivers either stale bars or bars that have been left in a hot warehouse. I used to take delivery monthly -- no more! The last 2 shipments were bars that were so dry that they crumbled when the package was open. I cancelled my standing order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Taste!","review":"Sorry, folks, but it looks like I'm the only Amazon purchaser of this product who thinks it is absolutely terrible. The peanut butter flavor is barely discernible, and after every bite, there is an absolutely horrible chemical after taste. I can't put my finger on it, but it is truly nasty. (I also bought a box of the Cookies 'n Creme, and they actually tasted even worse!)Please understand, I have no hidden agenda, but honestly if you're looking for a great tasting energy bar I highly recommend the Kashi Go Lean Peanut Butter bars. Admittedly, they are much chewier, but at least they taste like peanut butter and they don't leave that disgusting after taste. Sorry, just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"These bars were stale and tasted horrible!

I consider protein bars a treat in my current sugar/gluten-free diet, and this one fits the bill. Delicious and satisfying, the consistency and flavor are great (very natural taste, in my opinion). Just sweet enough, and 8 grams of fat clearly comes from the amount of peanuts used - shouldn't be a worry in moderation."},{"rating":"2","title":"good alternative","review":"These bars are a great alternative to typical protein bars. They are not full of sugar and carbs like most other types. They taste good and are filling. One bar was not enough for a full meal for me, but with a piece of fruit or a small salad or something, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got Progressively Worse...","review":"I love Think Thin Bars. Love them. I eat one every morning. This crunchy peanut butter is my favorite. \\"Subscribe and save\\" seems like a bargain, but by the time I was six months into the program, the bars I was receiving were bloomed, chalky, and gave every appearance of having been stored in a hot place, which certainly compromised the quality and eating experience (and maybe even the nutritional value, like the vitamins). I cancelled my subscription, and am back to buying them at a higher price at my local grocery store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid protein bar","review":"thinkThin protein bars are extremely tasty and filling! Over the years I have tried several brands and flavors of protein bars but thinkThin's exceed taste expectations and are sustaining for several hours.

The headline says it all -- this tastes like paper. Its bland, chalky and gross. I don't know why it's called \\"chunky\\" peanut butter, since it has zero texture.

Not the tastiest bar so I usually have other brands in my selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SOY FREE","review":"This bar came up under a search for soy free protein bars. When you're allergic to soy, you should be able to put 'soy free' in the search engine and actually find soy free items instead of finding a mix of soy free and non-soy free items. The same thing happens when you search for soy free chocolate. If I wanted to have to read the ingredients for everything, I wouldn't use 'soy free' in my search phrase.

Especially for someone who really doesn't like chocolate as much as the rest of the world. I'd eat a snickers bar, peanut butter cup and a twix but that's pretty much it. Chocolate cake yuck. Ice cream. Yuck. So it was real tough for me to find a tasty protein bar cause they love covering them in chocolate (though I have found some other flavors such as this) but they aren't in large quantity. SO I read the description and it said chunky peanut butter. The coating is coca which doesn't takes like the dark chocolate coating i've found everywhere else. These bars are tasty. OMG. Almost like a recies peanut butter cup but a little thicker. I could eat these all day long and are perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I buy these bars at Whole Foods all the time but saw them on Amazon for about $5 cheaper and thought \\"what a deal!\\" The bars were covered in a white film and tasted stale.

When my friend gave me these Chunky Peanut Butter bars to try that she purchased at Whole Foods in California, I thought they tasted like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups - delicious. The two boxes I received from Amazon.com were horrible. Each bar was encrusted in white - looked like mold. It didn't taste like mold but it was tasteless and gross looking. Some other reviewers complained about the same thing but I hoped the bars would be more like my initial experience - high protein and delicious.

(Seriously...ugh)...I kept hoping that the movie would redeem itself. It was like a really really bad indie movie that tried WAYY too hard to be indie with it's useless dialogue that went nowhere empty plot holes. I hear this movie won some awards? Realllyyyy...I don't know what type of drugs are cool with hipsters right now, but they must have been way wasted. It was like the directors just wanted you to hear their ipod playlist.

Just long slowly panned cameras, close ups of lips that may or may not be getting ready to say something meaningful or not. The living girl in the film has her mouth permanently open in surprise,shock,strong emotion, or ready to bawl. The dead girl (the zombie one,not the living catatonic one) has the best role. She barely moves and doesn't speak. Did I mention that there is a lot close ups and treacly music? Yup..scene after scene after scene.

Perhaps a plot appeared in the second half of Jinxed and I missed it, too bad.

It was apparently shot on a similar Sony digital camera system that Lucas used on the last Star Wars movie. But the picture on this film is only decent and looks quite fake and bright. In other words, it looks as if it was shot on digital video. Why they even bothered with that amazes me since this was obviously a very low-budget movie to begin with. The sound is also very poorly done, i could not even understand most of the dialogue throughout the film.

Grainy, badly done filming, over 95% of the movie was dubbed over instead of actually having the actors act. You can see the wires attacted to the actors when they are yanked backwards after a fake punch. And the plot stunk. It was a combo of Blade wannabe, Blair witch-ish documentary style and other stuff. The main character started out cool but turns out to be a real dork.And the villian. oh please, he looked like a reject from the a B-movie vampire movie. At least some B-Movies are funny to watch. This one is like a terrible carwreck. Don't waste your money. If I could give this movie a 0 I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst vampire movie in the world?","review":"Hmm, what can I say about this movie apart from that it's best to avoid it like the plague? Unfortunately this is just one in a long line of vampire movies I have watched and been utterly disappointed by. It seems that many movies of this genre start out with a good premise but fail to deliver the goods and this movie is an outstanding example. The script and acting are incredibly poor and at times so ridiculous you have to laugh. It's obvious they didn't have a big budget for this movie, but honestly, is there any point in making a vampire movie if you're going to shoot the whole thing during the day because you can't afford to shoot it at night?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is as bad as it can get!","review":"For a pure definition of bad, this film is it. Bad acting, bad storylines, bad everything. I sat and watched this movie and was awestruck that producers actually put money to this film.

There is something to be said for the cinematography, it's not standard b grade... it's actually pretty good... but yes... unless you're like me and willing to spend an hour and a half on watching a pointless movie that gives little or no gratification, by all means, rent it or buy it... To call this the worst movie ever is unfair... it's not entertaining enough to be the worst movie ever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood and Bullets","review":"This is a low budget vampire action movie.

As it is I had to force myself to read it. Also, I was so sick of Sarah chasing after Jarrod I wanted to scream. Not to mention the end...Jarrod all of a sudden realized what he had??? Please!

It is, by far, the best book on Open Source written to date.As someone involved with open source strategies at a large corporation in the computer industry, I found Donald's book to be objective, insightful, and current which reflects an intimate knowledge of someone on the inside.The level-headedness of this book makes it an essential read for anyone trying to understand the counter-intuitive nature of open source or protect themselves from the FUD, emotions, and convoluted conversations that plague Open Source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be classified DEFECTIVE","review":"Arrived and returned the next day.

I would say that this is an understatement: it is not even domestic grade as far as I'm concerned. The 2 AAA cells are loaded from the top of the tool (the white end on the picture).

I don't think it's really worth the money. It works better with 220V than 110. Put next to a live insulated wire it will chirp an light. However, if testing a wall socket, forget it.

Eckhart's work is suburb as his character manages to be both a caricature and a very real person. This is a portrait of the last days of Big Tobacco's arrogance before the states came in and nearly broke them. Nailer's speech to his son's class was absolutely hilarious as was the send up of the talk show used for the introduction. This is a truly equal opportunity spoof because it casts aspersions on practically everything and everybody including politics, the press, big business, and even child custody arrangements. Nothing is sacred here which is just how it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Satire","review":"This is one of the best written comedies I have seen in a while. Not only does Thank You For Smoking owe a lot to Christopher Buckley for writing the novel it is based on, it owes a lot to Aaron Eckhart who was a perfectly cast lead in this movie. I'd always enjoyed his work as a character actor in the past, and this role gave him a chance to show his leading man capabilities.The rest of the cast does really well for the most part with some good characters to play. Just like with Batman Begins, Katie Holmes is probably the weakest link in an ensemble of veteran pros. The dialogue is sharp and quirky at times. Overall, some smart subtle jokes.The movie never gets preachy on the issue of cigarettes to where it takes a side. The real message here is to educate people and let them decide for themselves, and to think for yourself. I'm not a smoker, but all I can say is, whether you agree or disagree with smoking laws, that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"The trailer looked like this movie had a ton of opportunity with such morally bankrupt characters for a serious laugh, hypocrisy and deep questions, but the script isn't all that good. The acting is fine (except for the kid who just doesn't sound like a kid) and strangely Rob Lowe's character is the most interesting one in the whole movie. I was too disappointed to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Me Want to Start Smoking Again","review":"This is a wag-the-dog satire, with a sly humor that is not put into films these days. The narration is used with percision when describing the horrid position the protagonist, Nick Naylor, occupies lobbying for virtually all tobacco industries. The one-liners between people like the MOD squad, Merchants of Death, comprising of Nick himself, the lobbyist for firearms, and the lobbyist for alcohol, made me giggle like a little school girl. The only thing that keeps this movie from getting five stars is that it seemed to end abruptly. I wanted more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Parody of the Tobacco Industry","review":"This movie focuses on a tobacco industry lobbyist, the \\"sultan of spin,\\" a man named Jack Naylor, who wants to excel at his less than scrupulous job while at the same time being a role model for his son.His son seems to be fascinated by what he does for a living, and doesn't seem to be disturbed by his father's flexible moral base. The movie is meant to be tongue in cheek, Naylor lies for a living because \\"it pays the mortgage,\\" a line that a less than scrupulous reporter reuses on Naylor after sleeping with him and airing his dirty laundry in the paper the following week.I would say that \\"unscrupulous\\" is a good word to describe both the movie and the majority of its main characters. But that's what makes it an effective, biting, sarcastic take on the lobbyist world, and on all those who put their personal interests ahead of everything else, including their own families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got out of 1st gear","review":"I watched the first half of it and since it's 1am I decided that I would trade the other half for an hours sleep. I guess it was kind of a good example of how lobbying works and it could have been a pretty good show.There was just virtually no exciting moments to it just kind of drags along."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak satire, no one in the movie even smokes.","review":"can a movie satire about a murderous industry that kills thousands of people every year be pleasant? this movie is. it's basically a lite comedy with no real bite. the actors are all good and the story's mildly amusing but no one in the movie is ever seen smoking. a satire about the tobacco industry and no one is smoking! i didn't read the novel the movie's based on, so i don't know if it's stronger but this movie's very weak and disappointing. you might almost think the tobacco industry was composed of decent people. everybody lies right? is that the message of this movie? the tobacco industry has knowingly killed millions of its customers. how funny or amusing is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick, Arrogant, Stale, Nanny State Non Sense","review":"The Eckhart character is deliberately hobbled and stereotyped as a debater in order to make the ridiculous and shrill nanny staters look dignified and credible when they are not. A high school debator could have made a better promotion. For example, like so many involved in statist leftist causes designed to limit individual freedom, there is a refusal to learn anything about the marketplace and how it works-mainly out of an absolute abhorrence of capitalism. Big tobacco is Big, for instance, because they sell products people want. It is nearly impossible to create a need rather than meet it. This is why tobacoo companies now sell smoking cessation aids, etc.I can just hear the comments coming in, so BTW, championing freedom and allowing that adults like to make their own choices is not \\"whining.\\"This movie just reeks of a truly repellent smug self-consciousness that feels instantly overwrought and tired. Note: you can't be funny and politically correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"The spin starts here","review":"This movie is really about spin. The tobacco industry is used to showcase how PR can make anything, even a lethal product, acceptable to the public. The insane thing is that you find yourself cheering for the spinmeister himself! A great cast including Katie Holmes in a sexy, hilarious role that makes you wonder why she has settled for being Mrs. Tom Cruise. Robert Duvall is terrific as the tobacco exec who falls victim to his own product. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An uneasy comedy","review":"The \\"joke\\" here is a tobacco lobbyist encouraging us to be free thinkers while knowing he can manipulate those thoughts. At last, a movie that both Ralph Nader and Karl Rove can enjoy!On the upside, with so many movies conveying the message, if you're really good looking you'll always come out on top, here's a movie that tells us being clever is just as important, if not more so.Oh well, I'm making it sound as if its not funny and there are some funny bits."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars Very Funny may have an agenda","review":"When I first heard of thank you for smoking the title turned me off. I'm a nonsmoker and I think like most people? that cigarettes are death sticks. Once I saw the trailer I was more interested because it looked pretty funny and Aaron Eckhart is an actor I find interesting. I watched the movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it, it was quite funny and it also makes you think about the issue. What it came down to was would you make something harmful illegal or would you let each person make that choice for themselves. I believe in the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Funny","review":"I think this movie is great. I find it exceptionally funny. If you look, you'll notice that you never once see someone smoke a cigarette during the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a credible inside close-up of the Cigarette Industry","review":"Thank You For Smoking is entertaingly persuasive. Corporations which jeopardize consumer health need all the protection they can garner. The type that demands the likes of lobbyist spokesman Nick Taylor; a confident, outspoken, ambitious affiliate of the Merchant of Death. The triad of population control. Go figure.This movie is satirical. Nick does a lot of talking to protect cigarrette companies and the circumstances he gets into are credible. It all makes you consider the larger picture; the proliferation of harmful substances; including, regulation and the standards that protect them. They have to be protected by the likes of Nick; otherwise past inititiaves to protect deadly products would not have persisted as long as it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of movie!","review":"Although released in 2006 it's just recently that I watched THANK YOU FOR SMOKING and have to say that I was completely blown away.

Sarcasm, and pure logical reasoning within this movie. Amazing acting. I saw this movie awhile ago and it was definitely worth renting again. WATCH THIS MOVIE! It is an incredible performance by all actors (Katie Holmes is kind of annoying and very...bitchy), but the rest fo the cast is excellent. WITTY, smart, and to-the-point. This movie takes swings at the current political regimines of the U.S. I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"Great movie and renting and viewing was super easy.

Besides being hilarious, this flick is a how to in BSing.Anyway, the acting was on point, especially Aaron Eckhart, who until I saw him in this film, that I finally took notice. In this film his character Nick Nayler is not a one dimensional character who is just a quick witted, smooth talking, lobbyist, but someone who is also a caring father... Aaron is great in this film.So, I highly recommend this film for its smart writing, great acting and one of the messages it sends out which I hold dear to my heart...\\"Don't be a mindless follower, but instead, think for yourself?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"To be honest, I bought this movie to see more of Katie Holmes' acting since the last I saw of her was in \\"President's Daughter\\", which I did like immensley. I was very disappointed in this movie - not only because it had very few scenes with Katie in them, but because it seemed to \\"wander\\" without a firm ground for plot or for the characters themselves. I lost interest a fourth of the way into the picture and never regained it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoking....","review":"because it is on fire in my backyard! Sorry, not into the feel angry because the tobacco companies are making a lot of money!

Junk movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but not as great as I had expected","review":"\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" is a satirical comedy about Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the tobacco industry, focusing much on his relationship to his son. Nick is a great character. He's a nice and likeable man in spite of his job. He is, in his own words, \\"morally flexible\\". He does his job in order \\"to pay the mortgage\\", something he has in common with most of the characters in the film (kind of reminds me of \\"Showgirls\\" when Gina Gershon says \\"We're all whores\\"). The movie succeeds in being neutral and avoid moralizing. The characters are good. I haven't read the book so I can't compare it.The 8,1/10 rating on IMDb made my expectations high, and it didn't quite live up to them, but it's still a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective 06/03/2011","review":"I too, have the exact same problem with my DVD - Starting at chapter 17 movie becomes pixellated then unwatchable thru most of the rest of the movie.

Hopefully if I get a refund and the posted RaroVideo response on this site is correct - I will reorder the DVD again.

Starting at Chapter 17 of the disc, the picture freezes and seldom moves throughout the rest of the film. The audio continues, but the picture advances very slowly at random intervals, usually landing on a single frame for an extended period of time before moving to the next. Essentially, the last third of the movie is completely unwatchable.

So I say to my friend, \\"listen to this, this is pretty cool,\\" but he's taciturn, non-committal. I was riveted. So I left with Astral Weeks and Country Joe's Thinking of Woody Guthrie. Astral Weeks is one album that simply entered my aural mind and took up residence. I can hear it anytime, anywhere, no ear buds necessary.

Van Morrison created an album of such great hope and inspiring wonder I have tears in my eyes just thinking about it. There are few works in music that can move me to that kind of emotion: Grace, A Love Supreme, and this Astral Weeks. If you love good music (if you are reading this you probably do) then you must fork out the...$10 to buy this. It is different. It is sublime. It is a complete masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, stunning, soulful","review":"This album doesn't have the immediate payoff of a single... a real rarity for Van. If you like his poppy, fun songs, I'd recommend one of his greatest hits collections.This album is thoughtful and mellow... very powerfully evocative. His voice is so resonant and supple. There's just something important he wants to tell you... you can tell by hearing him. It has the power and emotion of gospel music or soul music... but mellow and golden like a good Irish whiskey.The backing is a laid-back, folky jazz that has a remarkable timeless sound. Listen to the sample of 'Sweet Thing'. That's a very indicative song... also the most accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time","review":"Regardless of how you look at it, Astral Weeks has established a following of critical acclaim. While I can't say it's the best album of all time (I'm inclined to think Revolver), few can argue its importance and timelessness. Despite all the praise, Astral Weeks is not an accessible rock-and-roll album, like any of the Beatles work. It's not rock at all. It's nothing, yet it is everything. Don't expect to hear instantly memorable songs. Some tracks aren't even songs, just snippets of sound and a stream of consciousness. Like a fine wine from Bordeaux, this album needs lots of time. I must have listened to AW at least a dozen times before it started to click. It defies passive, background listening and you simply cannot understand this album unless you give it unwavering attention. If you don't like it at first, give it time. Give it lots of time, because there are few works in popular 20th century music that must have been made in heaven (think Davis's Kind of Blue)."},{"rating":"2","title":"all time classic","review":"I could use a lot of words to describe the merits of this album but as a matter of fact only one word is needed: magnificent!

And it might take a couple spins to appreciate it, but the listener who takes the time will be MUCH more rewarded by Astral Weeks. A few years ago I picked up Astral and Moon at the same time and Moon hardly gets spun. For my money it pales in comparison.Moondance was obviously Vans labor of love. He produced it and enlisted some two dozen musicians, and it is very well produced. But a big part of the beauty of Astral Weeks is its simple production. Van went into the studio, laid down the album in 2-3 days with 4 or 5 musicians, and it was done...and the magic comes through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, some of the astral-Celtic sound","review":"It's hard to think of Van as an introverted mystic, but this is where it all started. Yea, he had a first life as a Belfast bluesman and some time on Bang records when he produced one of the great pop singles of all timee, but this documents Van's summer of guitar. If you don't study this album, you're not a Van fan. As a matter of fact, find it on vinyl and digest it in twenty minute doses of mysticism.Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Morrison shows he is a musical genuis","review":"A classic album and of the most underated and underappreciated album of all-time. Hard to believe it was not a big seller. The muscianship is impeccable on this album and every note has meaning. THis album grabs you emotionally and won't let you go. In fact it is not a pop album at all but really a Jazz album and a great jazz album at that. A must album to listen to. A real gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"He just caught it out of the cloud floating by...","review":"With great art like this, it is nearly pointless to analyze the quality of the songs, or the meaning of the words. Someone said this is music of a particular time - that time being the 1967-68 period when the Summer of Love turned into the Long Bad Trip. Astral Weeks transcends the time, but it's as good a guess as any that Van caught these thoughts in his net as the cloud bearing them floated by. It is so dense, so personal, so real, that if ou pay attention you can smell the wet wool of the schoolboys' coats as they traipse in to visit Madam George.For an American parallel creation, check Love's Forever Changes - another particularly haunting tho much, much darker collage of impressions gathered from the collective unconscious of that time.Has so-called popular music produced two finer achievements since? I'm stuck as to what they might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Astral Weeks and Big Pink by the Band are ties as the best popular music albums of all time.

You have to have this in your collection. If you already know about this, then you should consider getting Bang Masters as a companion album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckered by the reviews","review":"Lester Bangs' essay on \\"Astral Weeks\\" is one of the greatest pieces of writing (music criticism or otherwise) I've read, and of course after reading it I had to hear the album. Other critics have similarly gushed its praises, as many of the reviewers have here.Every year I read that essay and return to Astral Weeks to hear what I *must* be missing. And the answer is always the same: beats me. This makes pleasant background music, but every nice hooky moment is offset by the overall meandering sprawl. In any event, I know that you're going to have to hear this thing - maybe on my deathbed it's virtues will come to me as an epiphany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why records are made","review":"It's easy to see join the club of Van Morrison enthusiasts when we're talking Astral Weeks. Simply put, it is a record that reminds me why we make records: to make us feel something. From scratch. Few cds in the collection have the ability to conjure me from a couch, but Astral Weeks' thrilling roughness, merciless grooviness and downright seriousness can actually make me dance without wondering how I look... which makes this record a dangerous one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"In 1968, Van Morrison, teamed with a collection of local jazz musicians and spent two days in a New York City recording studio to record Astral Weeks. The lack of time invested in the project and the jazz section's unfamiliarity with Morrison and rock music are fairly evident. The tracks, eight of them taking up forty-seven minutes, start out mildly pretty but sprawl out for a generous multitude of time with little development. Occasionally Morrison's brawny vocals will rise up and draw in the musical pap bacl from dullness, but never enough to save blatherers like \\"Madame George,\\" \\"Ballerina\\" and \\"Beside You.\\" The spring-ish title song and the passionate \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\" are Astral Week's only thoroughly enjoyable moments. Morrison's lyrics are vastly overrated. They are occasionally sweet, but too predictably sentimental to be very striking. This overrated album sounds like what might have been a mildly enjoyable work stuck in its earliest, roughest demo stages."},{"rating":"1","title":"early Van Morrison","review":"My son-in-law and I are both fans of Van Morrison, so after reading a review of his earlier 'Astral Weeks' I purchased a CD for each of us.

I bought into the hype when I first purchased it but I gradually came to realize that I couldn't stand it. The overly lengthy songs and vocal \\"improvisations\\" drove me batty. Morrison's vocal mannerisms are highly repetitive. He seems to have a few signature vocal \\"licks\\" that he uses again and again and again... This album killed any budding interest I had in Van Morrison. Best left for the retirement set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanity Morrison","review":"You love 'Moondance' and you think 'It's Too Late To Stop Now' is terrific. But you've heard 'Astral Weeks' is the big one, the very zenith of Van-ness. Everyone's told you it's great, the critics routinely rave. Here's the news: they're lying. 'Astral Weeks' is one of those Emperor's New Clothes affairs, like the complete works of The Doors and most Stanley Kubrick films. It's deeply, deeply boring, but because we're meant to - like, you know - dig it, man, we all claim it's one of the most profound spiritual experiences of our lives. It's not. It's mind-numbing hippy tedium from a stolid Ulsterman who really ought to know better, given his background."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ho-hum album","review":"I was already a fan of Van from his Moondance album (which I rank among the top 10% of all classic rock albums I own) when I picked up Astral Weeks ... But after giving it several chances I've found nothing special about it.The music conveys a languid mood that shifts back and forth between blues and jazz. That's good, but there's nothing novel in the arrangement and there are no standout performances. The music's simply adequate. Same with the lyrics. They don't reach out to themes of social consciouness, fire the imagination with evocations of time and place, or touch upon fundamental truths of the human experience. The best lyricists of the late 60s and early 70s did this. Morrison achieves it on Moondance. On Astral Weeks one track (Like Young Lovers Do) comes close, but the rest are just someone singing. Without anything special happening musically or lyrically, the album is simply mediocre...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of genius.","review":"I can still remember the first time I heard \\"Madame George\\" playing on the radio, in a sculpture class at Monterey Peninsula College in the late 60's. I was hooked immediately and I have owned the album in its' various forms ever since. That it took only a short time to record is testimony to Morrisonsenormous talent. More even than the lyricism or Morrisons inspired delivery, it's the music itself that holds me to this album, from Harold Mc'Nairs'flute to the violins, the bass, the mandolin, the whole of this record is a great work of art.Listen to \\"Beside You\\" on a cold, gray, overcast afternoon, the kind where you just want to take a nap, and you will never forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the ...?","review":"The customary juxtaposition of the existential with the metaphysical may lead one to believe there is more going on here than the VanMan improvising for 45m on a few of his favorite themes.

Alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just boring","review":"\\"Astral weeks\\" is a record that many praise and call a masterpiece. In my opinion it's just a boring experience from the beginning to the end. The songs are way to long and they seem to never end. I'm thinking about selling my copy.If you're curious of Van Morrison, you should buy \\"Moondance\\" and \\"Tupelo honey\\" insread - two much better albums, all aspects included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!","review":"I don't really like any of the songs on this album......I think they're slow and boring. Moondance is a MUCH better album. I appreciate many different types of music, but this album is just plain weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums ever...","review":"Good thing this was recorded before Van seized too much control over his records. Only wild, far-flung jazz guys who had seen it all could help Van materialize this. Props to the producer. And, thanks, Van.If Moondance was the album that Van ultimately wanted to make, Astral Weeks is the album that GOD wanted Van make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not My Desert Island CD","review":"This isn't the CD I'd take to a desert island with me...this is the one I want to either be buried with or go to the Arterlife with. A work of true genius unlike any in the annals of pop music and as thoroughly original as, yes, Sgt. Pepper, this album is THAT good. There was never any music like this before Astral Weeks and there hasn't been anything like it since. Everything about it is perfect, everything about it is unique. Even Van the Man never came close to repeating this...it's as if the angels granted him this one moment of the sublime. Though there are songs on St Dominick's Preview that come close. But enough! Words do not suffice. Astral Weeks speaks, groans, purrs, bellows, growls and soars for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all been said","review":"This album, every song, has been reviewed to death. The title song is outstanding but most of what Van does is outstanding. I have read reviews of this album over the years. Most speak of the bluesy soul wrenching songs Cyprus Avenue and Madam George. These are wonderful songs. But, I'm a romantic. I could listen to Sweet Thing and The Way Young Lovers Do, forever. More importandly, although we own more than 20 Van Morrison albums, the three that are played repeatedly are Astril Weeks, The Best of Van Morrison Volume 2, and Poetic Champions. This is a \\"must have\\" CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Early Van","review":"If you are considering this album, by all means get it. It has some excellent music. Sure, it's a bit uneven, but you get a sense of the true power and imagination of the young Van Morrison in this incredible work. Great lyrics, interesting instrumentation, and of course, the powerful voice of Van.I'm especially fond of the songs Astral Weeks and Sweet Thing. They have such wonderful passion and exuberance! They are tunes that are truly timeless. The rest of the album is fine, but have the flavor of the time. For anyone who wants to experience Van Morrison, this album is indispensable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Well, what can you say about this cd by now? It's part of pop's history, it is part of many people's life. Ethereal songs, sensitive lyrics, and the record that launched a remarkable carreer.I still prefer \\"Veedon Fleece\\" to this cd, as Van's masterpiece. But I guess \\"veedon Fleece\\" is the one for the conoisseur, and this one the masterpiece for the masses.And yes, I have all this man's Cd's, you should have them, at least half of them, all his 70-80's cd's are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful album","review":"This product arrived on time and in good condition.

I never realized the importance of the bass guitar until I experienced the competing bass and vocals that flow through this entire album. It has never been duplicated by Van or anyone else.

Francesco Cafiso, now 23, was, in my opinion, another Paul Desmond. I'm not impressed by the fact that he was an accomplished alto man at an early age. Most great jazz musicians usually are.I'm going to keep this short, & just tell you that what impressed me most was the maturity he showed in his handling of a ballad. In the business of jazz we say that \\"anyone can learn to play fast, but it's the ballads that separate the men from the boys.\\" I was most taken by his work on \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams.\\" His handling of \\"My Old Flame\\" was absolutely gorgeous as well.If you are a sax lover, you'll find that there is MUCH on this album to love.

Substandard singing and unmemorable melodies abound here, and if you think that the track \\"Up All Night\\" bears more than a passing resemblance to the huge 1986 club hit \\"Baby Love\\" by Regina, you're not imagining this. The song was in fact penned by Regina Richards (aka Regina), and its similarity to the ever-superior \\"Baby Love\\" is anything but subtle.

Bunch of crap if you ask me.For the price, it isn't bad. The normal HP power supply unit is around $80 and this is less than $20.

I purchased a second one and the tape player worked for about a dozen go rounds. The device then developed other intermitent problems. Not possible to have such thing repaired locally and the cost of shipping it back to Sony in CA along with repair costs are prohibitive so it's in the basement awaiting the next bulk trash pickup.All this said I guess I will buy another one because it does serve it's purpose.

It began a little slowly, but gained momentum quickly and soon had me unable to put it down. Dr. Gilbert, the psychologist and diarist, delivers an in-depth and intimate portrayal of the mental make-up of the Nazi's on trial at Nuremberg. I came away from this book feeling as though I had been at Dr. Gilbert's side throughout the trial, speaking to each defendant individually on a daily basis.A real \\"fly-on-the-wall\\", behind the scenes view of the Nuremberg trials. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating account of the trial","review":"I litterally ate that book. It was that good. Learning and reading about how those characters lived the Nuremberg trial kept me glued to the book.Goering's bullying tactics, Frank's ambiguity, Keitel's weak stand, Rippentrop's unfathomable approach and despair, Speer's \\"cards on the table\\" strategy are just a sample of what the reader will experience going throught this marvelous work.The only thing I found a little annoying toward the end was the repeted holier attitude of Gilbert. But that was a thiny price to pay.I suggest you buy Gilbert's book and then treat yourself with \\"Spandau, The Secret Diaries\\" by Albert Speer.Spandau is what happened to those who were sentence to prison terms.

I think it important for future reader that they are aware that this is hardly a complete account of the trial itself. Other books (The Nuremberg Trial, by Ann and John Tusa for example) achieve this well enough. This book brings you into the cells and lets you hear what the defendants thought about the whole situation, until you become familiar with their different personalities. I would recommend reading some other book before this, to gain better knowledge of the trial, but definitely I would not miss this one. It'd be like reading a book first, and then having a chance to meet the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"in my opinion this book is not accurate about those nazis and the psychologist is in my opinion too much of an prosecutor compared with the nuremberg interviews from goldensohn this one cannot compare at all even the few images inside the book are pretty bad quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lewis Ross guitar ensemble","review":"I bought this CD as a Christmas present for a Lewis Ross fan.

It feels sticky, the comb gets stuck and tangled and the hair ends up pulling out. If I can't do it when it's new, how could my daughter possibly do it. Also, wetting the hair and setting the rollers seems like a drag. Maybe a much older child could handle it, but by then they aren't really into Ariel anymore.

What kind of motivation is that?In addition, the story did not offer any motivation for the knight to fight the dragon in the first place. There was really no conflict. Therefore, they did not overcome anything by working together in the end, except perhaps their own ignorance. Even at that, though, the knight and the dragon do not finally come to any deeper understanding about each other.If the author wanted to help children understand that we should work together, why not show the knight and dragon working together to solve a problem?If your child revels in the brave deeds of St. George and other knights, he or she may be sorely disappointed.This knight and dragon are wimpy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Knight and the Dragon","review":"The product was inferior and did not match the description for a used book included in the posting."},{"rating":"2","title":"So-so","review":"Ok kids book.

The Scriptures used are given in their entirety at the end of each chapter, and are difficult to distinguish from the rest of the text.

And this is one of his best. So many to choose from and each one a little different but the vibe here and especially the great songs make this essential. After this one check out Veedon Fleece one of my long time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Morrison - His Band and the Street Choir","review":"Side One: 1. Domino 2. Crazy Face 3.

I'd always liked Van Morrison, but was on the young side to be overly familiar with his songs unless they were played on the radio a lot.\\"I'll Be Your Lover Too\\" blew me away, and it's worth the purchase price just for that song.

A family of witches, each with their own specialty.In Charmed we have Anastasia story. She is the cousin who is an Empath. She is also a healer because of her strong empathatic feelings. After be turned away by her first love when he found out what she was, Ana has stayed away from men to protect her heart. Then widow Boone Sawyer moves in next door with his young daughter. She fears telling him what she is, then fate steps in. This was my favorite out of all the Donovan stories. It is so good. Emotional and loving.In Enchanted we have the story of Liam Donovan a witch and a shape shifter. He goes to the woods to be alone to think about an important choice he is going to have to make. Rowan Murray goes to the woods to find herself. They find eachother and she discovers so much more about herself. This story had a lot more \\"magic\\" in it.

It's not worth my time. This is the first Willie Morris book that I have read. I can't imagine all of his books were like this. Hopefully Taps is the result of bad editing. The words and language he uses is so out of place for the story it's laughable. My husband was tired of hearing all of the bad passages each night. I guess if you like the author you will like the book but if you have never read him before try something else first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely end to a remarkable career","review":"I had tears in my eyes as I finished this book, knowing that it would be the last love letter from the South from Willie Morris.

God bless Willie Morris--he will be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite tedious....with lousy ending","review":"This is a very slow paced story with really nowhere to go. The acting was quite atrocious, including Vivien Leigh's. Her performance was simply laughable and unconvincing, especially her reactions to Warren Beatty when he was being an ass to her. Beatty was definitely miscast, since his Italian accent was very bad, and he wasn't good looking enough to play an irresistible gigolo. Come on, why would rich American women lust after a scrawny, beady-eyed, fat lipped Beatty?

I think I saw it at a very impressionable time, and this could account for the disappointment. Neither Vivien Leigh nor Warren Beatty 'cut' it this time and Lotte Lenya's 'camp' performance is probably about the best part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivien Leigh is like Robert Redford,","review":"She doesn't have to pay or go begging for attention. That inside deliciousness means she has and will always have the world at her feet which means casting her in yet another post war film depicting the Ancient Italians as predatory, parasitic and useless people hints that the story is not what it appears on the surface. In any case, this movie along with Light in the Piazza would have warned off or encouraged American audiences that for some inexplicable reason, the American dollar goes far in Italy and with Italians and makes the Italy's deep and wealthy culture less intimidating to American travelers.She's so pretty with her pointy smile and her newly smokey voice and her pretty precise enunciation. It's very satisfying to see Vivien Leigh in color.Lotte Lenya is naturally creepy in this film. I would think she wouldn't have had access to Americans because there is something of a constant rage running through her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an outstanding book for sculptors","review":"First off, buy this book.

I quickly discovered that sleep would be a thing of the past if I expected to defeat the little blighters. But then I found Sluggo and my problem was solved. Apparently the slugs love this product, eat it, then can't eat anymore, and quickly die of starvation. Best of all, it's safe to use around pets and children.

I bought a 2.5 lb bottle for $30. There are a lot of earwigs and sowbugs in my garden and the earwigs especially seem to do a lot of damage to my ornamentals. I have been using Sluggo Plus for over 2 months and it seems very ineffective against snails & slugs so I still need to use plain sluggo. I also just found 3 earwigs inside the flowers on my Daturas that are still closed but ready to open any day. The earwigs are causing them to fall off before opening.

It took less than a week for them to learn the system, and, two and a half years later, when I count my kids (9, 7, 4) STILL cease and desist.Sometimes I also use the approach (Ask, Act, Attend, and Amend) outlined in \\"Time-In\\" by Jean Illsley Clarke to enhance my children's thinking skills and their ability to reflect on their behavior and consequences, AFTER I get compliance from them with 1-2-3. While I don't use the \\"Time-In\\" book verbatim, I still like its emphasis on teaching kids to think and internalize WHY good behavior is important, particularly as children get older. \\"Time-In\\" is a quick read, too, at 71 pages.However, I still highly recommend this book for solving most disciplinary problems for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got us turned around in a positive direction","review":"The concept this book taught us of disciplining without emotion was a true awakening for us. We were always getting louder with more threats and longer time-outs...none of which were working to stop the misbehavior and we were becoming more and more frustrated as parents. This book helped us get the cooperation from our kids that we had not been able to achieve before we read this book. The tone in our home has become calmer and we have had more \\"fun\\" time with our children. For our toddler we also found THE POCKET PARENT to be an even more helpful guide as it is exclusively written for parents of 2's, 3's, 4's & 5's in quick bullets of advice for addressing challenging behaviors.These to books have changed our daily communication with our children for the better.

Worked like a charm for my pretty normal, mildly ADD middle child. Same for my third child. However, my oldest child who happened to be Bipolar and what his psychiatrist described as 'the most severe case' of ADHD she'd seen in 20 years' practice, was able to foil it every step of the way. If it was 1-2-3 ...he'd laugh and say, yeh, right. Remove additonal privileges, he'd laugh and walk out of the house. Oh, no....does NOT work for every child.And by the way, what is with the sappy sitcom, upper middle class folks they have in the tapes?

Counting to three, does nothing but try and get them to shut up.If a child is soiling when put in time out, that child needs attention and love.

I have to disagree. It took me a long time to get through the book because it frankly was irritating.

I was going to give it to my cousin to use but I have decided to keep it and just buy her a copy. My youngest whom is not old enough for the 1-2-3 method, will grow up knowing what it is and that it has an effect. I am telling everyone about this book.

Any time that a child is engaged in a disapproved of activity, the parent gives two warnings followed by a time out. The first warning is indicated by the parent saying \\"that's one.\\" The second warning is indicated only by \\"that's two.\\" Finally, the parent says, \\"that's three\\" and sends the child to his or her room for a time out. The strength of this book is in its simplicity. Faced with misbehavior, a parent knows just what to do. Knowing what to do makes it much less likely that a parent will act out of anger and frustration with yelling, scolding or criticism. Knowing what to do also makes it less likely that the parent will act inconsistently with discipline. Because misbehavior triggers 1-2-3, the parent is less likely to ignore an infraction in one instance, or overreact in another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work if your child is stubborn and sensitive.","review":"First of all, this book is incredibly long-winded and repetitive. He could have explained the technique in a few pages, but rambles on and on. It reminds me of when I used to write papers in high school and used pointless examples just to try to fill the pages. The writing is also a little too condescending for my taste.It looks like this book changed many people's lives, but every time I tried the counting method with my son, he would scream \\"No, don't count!!\\" It didn't matter how I set the stage, or how much or how little I explained. The more we counted, the more bent out of shape he would get. And, pretty much, he would not stop the behavior until we got to \\"three\\" and then he would scream and throw a fit.

It really makes a difference for our preschool-age girls. Both have very different temperaments (sensitive & dramatic vs. strong-willed and defiant). It seems that the authors anticipated our children's reactions and this helped for us to be prepared and handle appropriately. When our home feels chaotic, it is because we are not applying this simple and effective method that brings order in a firm and loving way.

It simply is boring - there is no music or sound, the studio is white and has the feeling of being taped at home; the instructors voice commands are poorly done - for example she repeats ad infinitum to breathe \\"long & deep\\" - and to do that in a short raspy tone!

I received the triangle that is similar but is $15.11, it does not have the mirror but it was packaged in the box that the $24.95 one comes in. I was then told they did not have the $24.95 in stock so they would have to send a return label, which they did, and refund me, which they better. I read another review on here where they received the cheaper version but I do not think they realized they ordered the expensive one and received the cheaper one.

Great fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and pretty easily entertained. I read all the glowing reviews, and thought this would be a hit. So far, this hasn't been the case. The toy itself is bright, cheerful, and very very durable. I also like the fact that it doesn't need batteries. However, apart from a few things to spin, and a few shapes to fiddle with, there really isn't anything to sustain her interest. At first I was pleased to find a toy that wasn't at all noisy, but, given the lack of visual stimulation, I don't even think that that's a bonus. Also, the picture on Amazon of the toy shows a mirror at one end - the one I received had a boring spinner with a dog and a bone on one side, and a kind of \\"cage\\" design on the other. I think it's supposed to be an optical illusion when it's spun, but it doesn't work at all. Hopefully she'll find it more interesting as she gets older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley Hardware 40-2126 Bifold Door Top Pivot & Roller Guide","review":"I bought these to replace the worn out original installation hardware on my closet doors and they were an excellent choice.

For better or worse once I begin a book I must finish it, even if I feel punished by doing so. The book starts out promising enough. While not a believer I still enjoyed Zola's description of the mystery of the Catholic Mass. While I was brought up as a Catholic I really never believed in God and certainly never knew all the nuances of the Mass. It is certainly complicated. But the hundred pages or so he spends describing joyfull plants and flowers and trees left me irritated and quite annoyed. He did not need to spend a hundred pages describing the Garden of Eden and man's temptation. A few pages would have sufficed. You get the idea. I'm surprised Zola went so far off the mark here.

Drawing solely from scientific literature using proven techniques that do not require high technology, Woodmorappe proves that the critics' attacks do not hold water.I have seen anti-creationists get very angry over this work, but I have not seen them make even one dent in the scholarship found therein (saying something is filled with \\"poor logic,\\" etc., and showing it by example are two different things). Apart from minor updates to deal with new techniques and any new attacks that are dreamt up, this book should remain a classic and a handy reference to refute critics for many years. A must-have reference for origins scholars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent research of how Noah took the animals on the Ark.","review":"I've had many questions about how Noah could take all the animals on the Ark and live in it for more than a year.

John Woodmorrape has done an excellent job of dissecting and refuting the latter. The most common reasons given why the biblical account is wrong (size of the ark, number of animals, taking care of animals, etc.) will have to be rethought or abandoned. A very thought provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, scholarly study.","review":"John Woodmorappe has done what many have been waiting for, for many years. His recent publication provides the scholarly study that is so greatly needed. No doubt, some will deliver ranting against this fine work, but let them attempt to attack the science, and they will surely fall short of toppling Woodmorappe's well defined approach to the issue of Noah's Ark.

Anyone who has an interest in the biblical Deluge as history or myth needs to read this book.

I eagerly await its release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest?","review":"There are a lot of graphs and unsubstantiated figures and it's all fun to read through and show your friends for a laugh.However, there is nothing from a physical perspective: how a wooden ark could have been built so large, the atmospheric conditions and pressures that would have arised from the deluge, or even where the water came from or where it went.The whole point of the book is to show that the events could have happend as described without the invocation of ad hoc miracles. It seems that this leads the author to omit vital topics rather than invoke such miracles. I was very disappointed in the omission of key topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immerse Yourself in the Workings of Noah's Ark","review":"This book is a scholarly work and a Scriptural work on Noah's Ark and its function.

Though perhaps not the best reading material for someone trying to give up junk food, _Candyfreak_ was a delight from start to finish. Almond claims to have eaten candy every day of his life.

Plus, Almond helps you discover several new candies. My wife and I held a candy tasting party after reading this book. Delightful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummiest read you could imagine!","review":"Recently I watched a program on the Food Network that showed how Easter candy is made. There was nothing appetizing about the industrial pipes glurping out brown gunk, cesspool-like vats, and pinched-looking workers in clinical head coverings. And yet Steve Almond describes this same world and it shimmers with exquisite sensual detail. (Does the word \\"enrober\\" turn you on? It might after you read Almond's account of luscious sweets being cloaked in chocolate. Industrial? Not on your life.) I delighted in every aspect of this book, from the hilarious delineation of various candy addictions to the affectionate discussions of the confectionary creative process. Wonderfully stimulating to every human sense (including the sense of humor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this book! I was a candy freak as a child and it brought memories flooding back. It was informative, hilarious, well-written, honest and entertaining. It's kind of a dangerous book though, I've found myself spontaneously daydreaming about the candy of my youth ever since: Smarties, Sweetarts, Like-Um-Sticks, Jolly Ranchers, Zots, Marathon Bars, Hot Tamales. Trust me, you'll have your list, and you will too. You will also love being taken to the small candy companies with Almond as your quirky, hyper-observant, generous guide. I read the book in two shots and have been talking it up to everyone I know since.(Along with Candy Freak, I'd bought David Sedaris's new book and put it down after several ho-hum stories. I was thankful I had Candy Freak. Should have started it first.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left unfinished","review":"Enjoyed the first few chapters-they were nostalgic and fun.

I got bored and didn't even finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud good!","review":"As a fellow candyfreak, I have to give Mr. Almond credit for his hilarious descriptions of tours in the candy factories. He is not afraid to confess about his strong urges to eat the ingredients he encounters in his exploration of unique candy from some of the smaller companies still in business. Two thumbs up for this laugh-out-loud detailing of how these sweet treats are made. Loved it and would highly recommend. P.S. I do not know the author and he is not paying me for this either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A seasoned and in-depth survey of the candy business","review":"Author Steve 'Almond-joy' has a sweet tooth to say the least, as Candyfreak exposes: while his prior book topics have ranged through heavy metal music to literature and erotica, Candyfreak presents the author's personal exploration of 'vanished candy bars'. His visits to the candy factories and originators themselves provides a healthy dose of mouth-watering descriptions blended with insights into the politics, sociology and flavor methods of the industry as a whole. Anticipate not just a singular celebration of candy, but a seasoned and in-depth survey of the candy business as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some shining candy moments but please, no politics","review":"The parts about candy are fun but I can't believe the author became political and stupidly at that, while also condescending to candy eaters.

The remaining 2% of the book is revealing that Almond can't really focus on anything but his nuts.

To compare Steve Almond's self-conscious running off at the mouth to Hunter Thompson in any manner is like comparing a month-old plastic gallon of 2% milk to a little jar of imported clotted cream. The \\"tour\\" was minimal, the interviews amateurish and more focused on the interviewer than the subject, and the writing dragged and dragged some more. I was not amused."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest book I've read! And it's informative.","review":"I should start by stating that I don't read nonfiction. In any given year, I read 40+ books, and rarely are any of them nonfiction. But I've now read Candyfreak twice. It's hilarious. Plus I feel like I learned so much about how candy is made, etc. I want to tour all the candy factories myself. I've recommended this book to tons of people, and I'm currently in charge of a book club discussion of it where we have tracked down all of the candies to sample. I've shipped Valomilks to friends in other parts of the country (I'm in Kansas... birthplace and home of the Valomilk).

If you don't, you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scrumpious book","review":"What do you picture as a candy freak? In the biography \\"Candy Freak\\" by Steve Almond, Steve Almond is a candy freak. Steve Almond has eaten at least one piece of candy every day of his life. He visits many different candy factories over the course of the book. Steve Almond is the main character. I dont really think that he likes sour candy as much as chocholate because in the text, he does not go to a candy factory that manufactures sour candy. I think this book is best suited for late middle school to early high school students.Now ask yourself, who do you think is the candy freak?"},{"rating":"1","title":"awfully amateur writing","review":"it's pretty amateur writing-- a better edit would have helped a lot, and some stronger direction for the author. (in the list of links in the back of the book, the description for one is \\"This person rocks my world.\\" --um, you couldn't give us anything more than that? like, why?) the stuff about the author's childhood is mildly intersting; it's a lot better when he finally visits the chocolate factories. the descriptions of the owners of the factories is great and the interviews are fun too... that's where the book really picks up."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book version of a twizzler.","review":"I really wanted to like this book. And, in fact, I did like parts of it -- the parts where the author was doing straight reportage. It was fascinating to learn about the different types of candy and how they are made (I love candy too). However, I didn't like the overall tone. It's high irony. The author undercuts himself, and also undercuts everyone he talks about, so every single person looks slightly pathetic. That's okay when it comes to the author -- he can choose how he's perceived -- but it's vastly unfair to the other people in the book. I don't think I ever want to meet this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge disappointment","review":"I chose to read Candy Freak because I thought it would be a humorous diversion for a few hours. While Almond's book shines as he gleefully discusses his love affair with the cocoa bean, he left me bitter when he discusses world affairs. I literally threw the book across the room (where it still sits at this moment) after his progressive tantrum on page 204, about 4/5ths of the way through the book. The majority of people reading this book I would imagine do not care about Mr. Almond's politics. Why he would choose to interject them in a book about his love of candy bars is beyond me. There are a few belly laughs and tons of chuckles in this book, and I would imagine if you are of the same political persuasion as Mr. Almond the political diatribes won't bother you too much. But since I specifically picked up this book as escapism I cannot recommend it to those who are trying do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I thought this would be a lighthearted look at the candy industry and to some extent that's what I got. There are some interesting tidbits about the candy industry and the people associated with it, but the overall tone of of the book is kind of dark and mean-spirited. Then as others have observed there are the countless references to the author's personal likes and dislikes. Yes, it is indeed a semi-autobiographical book for adults with four-letter words and drug use which is fine if that's what you're interested in. That's just not what I expected when I bought it. If you can relate to Almond's negative worldview and his extreme left politics then you might enjoy this book, but otherwise you'd be well advised to avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter aftertaste","review":"Like overly bitter chocolate, this book tempts you with a delicious idea but leaves you ultimately unsatisfied. It's really more of a journey through the underbelly of Steve Almond, a place I never intended or wanted to go. For example, what does the fact that he once used (or may still use -- it's left unclear) marijuana have to do with the candy industry? Not a thing, but we're \\"treated\\" to lots of tidbits like that throughout the book, which in my opinion reveals more about the author's vanity than it does the candy industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Joy with this Almond","review":"It does have a few humorous stories in it, but much of the content in this book isn't suitable for kids -- unless your last name is Osbourne. I thought the book was just about candy, but it's really as much about the author's philosophical and political views as anything else. Where it wasn't offensive, this much of book was downright boring and it's definitely not something I'd recommend to a person of any age group. Oh, and to the author, here's a hot tip: just because you eat candy doesn't mean you have to have bad teeth. Some new technology has come onto the scene in recent years that can help with that and you might want to look into it: it's called a \\"toothbrush.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"too many cavities","review":"ho hum. there are some wonderfully funny moments here, but mostly you end up feeling sorry for this guy, for his endless search to find, really--love!--in the form of something wrapped and packaged and sold for change. the endless diatribes don't quite jell. all in all left too many cavities in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Almond Joy in this Book","review":"I have read this pablum and feel I am owed the 4 hours it took to read. Mr Almond please send me a refund. Your political diatribes overshadowed some marginal writing about the candy industry. Your own paranoia about the Republican party and politics in general were as distastful as an Almond Joy candy bar.

As a film buff, I have long awaited a high def anamorphic transfer of Ran, one of my fav films of all time. The low number of this Limited Edition run makes this an incredible buy, considering that the disks alone are likely valued at near or around [high amount] by themselves. Add to this the included collectibles (photos, poster, etc), and the decision to buy is a slam dunk for me.I saw the Kurosawa doc on PBS last month, and for Kurosawa fans it's a \\"must see\\" for sure. I had planned on buying the doc by itself, but then I saw this listing.

The method is very intuitive and doesn't rely on grammatical explanations. They use a lot of English at the beginning and gradually switch over into using more and more French.

The torrential downpore where she is on a swing and meets up with and gets oral sex from a man were cut. as well as a subsequent scene involving another man and good old fashioned 70-1. where several frames were visible showing complete felatio.Be careful which version you get.

The sound shifts volume, and there is one segment several seconds long with no sound at all. There is no plot whatsoever, the acting is atrociously bad, the film is an editing nightmare (by the director, or the company releasing a heavily censored video, I don't know). I even had trouble tracking this film, and when I rewound, I got a blue screen.

The poems presented in this book demonstrate that women in the 17th century were equally as passionate and brilliant as their male counterparts, which is another reason that I give this book five stars.

I am in no way saying it's hard to use, in fact it's easy to use, however, some people can't handle more options than \\"on\\" or \\"off\\", so if you're one of them then yeah, it's hard to use for you.

Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.Throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellboy Animated Statue: Abe Sapien","review":"Great representation of a great character!

It was his personal feelings about these people, not short biographys of actors. Some of it was interesting but I could care less if Viola Dana was promiscuous or Patsy Ruth Miller was a racist. I'm interested in their films, not who they slept with and whether they were nice to him when he interviewed them.

It could have been a decent cult kind of cannibal movie if the pace and editing of the movie had a little help. Some scenes just drag on way too long. Not scenes with people talking. Scenes of the woods and people walking. The same overhead shot of a bunch of trees is shown several times. Folks walking through the woods. Zzzzzzzzz. Wake me up when someone is being eaten!The ending is very stupid and unexciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannibal Sideburns-!","review":"Folks, the \\"cannibals\\" in this unintentional comedy appear to have been recruited from a local pool hall: they all have different haircuts, none of which are even remotely convincing - and at least one \\"cannibal\\" has sideburns! They jump around with sticks, hooting and chanting like it's a pledge initiation. It does have a few decent gore scenes, but it's hard to keep from laughing. Fortunately I love really bad films, and I'll buy this new version. I just wish I could share it with Mike and the 'bots."},{"rating":"2","title":"its good","review":"i got this game and play with my brothers. we like it. you fight enemies on diffrent levels and collect shen gone wo. other guys says its buggy but i dont think so. you have to target with the anilog buttons so its kind of wierd but we can do it. you then go in the xiaolin shodowns to win wo. enemys are kind of the same it would be nice if there was more."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!!!!!!!!","review":"i liked the show but hello this game stinked i payed 50 dollers for this a while back and now its 19 now thats messed up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems with this game!","review":"first of all there are so many bug and glitches on this game youll blow up for instase sometimes you walk backwards and when you win a showdown sometimes if you pick another players shen-gong-wu it chooses a different 1the last thing is the enviorments are little,easy to eat bosses,YOU CANT DIE!! just to make it to easy and there are few levels i even if you like the show i advise you DONT BUY THIS GAME!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasteful and graceful","review":"The length of this necklace falls in good proportion to a typical V-neck sweater.

There's a sense of profound resentment ... that permeates the entire book, revealed by the ... attempts to discredit the (yes, material) advances Chile has made in the past decade. It seems that Pinochet's main crime is not the horrific human rights abuses that occured under his regime, but rather the meteoric rise of Chile's economy and standard of living. For these successes, and the embarrassment they engender on the rest of the continent and in dinosaurs on the Left, Pinochet and the \\"Chicago Boys\\" can never be forgiven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicken Soup books are always great","review":"I've never been bored or disappointed by any of the books in the Chicken Soup for the Soul series.

While I have only used sections of this book, it seems to be easy to use and contrary to what an earlier reviewer said, both section names and page numbers are listed in the table of contents. The book is tiny, perfect for carrying in my backback and holds a ton of information. The only problem I have with this handbook is that there is an updated MLA pamphlet that is included with the book and it is harder to understand. Also, the book really should be brown just so the books shows some sense of humor (just kidding). I would highly recommend this book to high school students as a quick reference guide for writing research papers and projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"A needed refresh in the world of managment books","review":"Wright's _New Business Normal_ is a much needed update to any leader's classical management library in post-dotcom-bubble, post-globalized and far leaner technology business universe.

I like disaster movies that don't involve evil but just silliness and real bad luck. The family relations seem quite realistheric for a nice family. The quakes and explosions were exciting and realistic looking. I think the acting was generally good, especially the son, the one assisstant to the head guy. I really like the 'hero'. I remember him from Bones as Booth's brother.It was not realistic which is reassuring. If I wanted realism I would read and watch programs like the killings at the movies out west or watch all news shows. Keep in touch with reality but don't consider it entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Enjoyable for what it is. Fairly good acting and effects. However, one major problem is that the military controlled all the actions and police functions. No call was ever made to the police, sheriff, mayor or governor.

The last version I had was the 2000 EA Sports and the new version is drastically improved. Career mode on the 2003 version is fun and challenging.

On a scale of 1-10 it comes in at 10 plus! The gags are absolutely hilarious and one can tell that these two lead characters are really enjoying themselves immensely! Lisa Kudrow's sarcasm quips were priceless! Sure it looks like a takeoff on the Soprano's but with more of a comedic theme. It being a matter of choice - my husband and I agree that this was superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of DeNiro's Worst Movies","review":"I liked Analyze This and purchased Analyze That for that reason. Unfortunately, Analyze That is not funny (with a few exceptions), has a contrived plot, and frankly is an embarrassing movie, one of the worst I have seen recently. Crystal and DeNiro have both done alot of good work; unfortunately, for both of them this movie is a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker","review":"This movie was terrible.

A total waste of acting talent and my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself.....","review":"This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.

This sequel is worse. There is no enough materials here for Robert de Niro and Billy Crystal to work with (it's sad to see more and more movies with Robert De Niro that do not deserve his talent). I have seen already all de Niro facial expression in the first movie (where it was funny) and it just doesn't work for the second time. The plot is quite pathetic. Lisa Kudrow, unfortunately, doesn't do very well here.

For an economist, Noland can actually write lucid prose. More importantly, he is not lost in the world of \\"pure\\" theory which tends to have little to do with the real world. His evaluations of difficult policy issues were insightful and well reasoned. He seems to know the country and its problems first hand. Very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO IVORY TOWER - Lacks info on real experiences in DPRK","review":"Unfortunately the book is based on academic and Washington DC think tank sources opposed to actual research in North Korea. A more useful approach would have been for the book to be based on actual recent research in North Korea as well as other transitioning economies in Asia such as Vietnam, Laos and Mongolia. Access and visas to these countries, as well as to North Korea, can be made in Beijing from which there are easy flights. North Korea is a fascinating country and well worth the visit. It is disappointing that this book, like so many others today, rely on secondary sources instead of direct research. This seems to be a trend among American books from Washington DC. Perhaps in Europe we have different set of standards for our academic research so maybe I am being unfairly critical."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate analysis of a critical issue","review":"This book is a delight - the author combines serious economic and political analysis with rich knowledge of institutions and history on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, he knows how to write. He makes sophisticated arguments seem easy. For readers concerned with the future of South and North Korea, this is essential reading.The book consists of a thorough overview of the current situation on the peninsula with a brief but insightful review of the historical processes that have brought us to this point. It distills in a accessible manner the vital insights from the author's formal models of the Korean economy.

The blades are extremely sharp and this case allows you to store and retrieve the blades without cutting yourself. Throwing these blades into a drawer is NOT an option.

Using a philips head screwdriver, I firmly screwed the mounting bracket onto the wall. Finally, I used a flathead precision screwdriver to mount the towel holder. I centered the towel holder's bracket at 24\\" above the counter so that the bottom of the ring reached about 18\\" from the counter. I used a level and there was some adjustment possible at the final stage of mounting the towel holder, easily leveled by lifting up the ring and holding the level across its diameter.

You either have to reboot on a card change or go into the device manager and scan for hardware changes. Switching the SATA controller within the BIOS from IDE to ACHI did improve the stability of hot swap a bit, but still not flawless hot swap as a USB reader offers.Finally, the build quality of this isn't great.

Addonics claims the device is constrained only by whatever UDMA CF is used, which I now don't believe. I read/write to SATA disk at 68-70 MB/sec, so it must be the Addonics device that's slowing things down.Hot swap doesn't work, or at least I couldn't get it to work with an Intel 965 chipset and ICR9 2920 SATA controller. Consequently, you have to power down before inserting a new card in order for it to recognize the new card's parameters - a huge inconvenience.

I played UT2004 and perfect dark and didn't expirence any ghosting on the screen. Also another review said in reference to resolution that 1280:1024 was a bit blurry and all thats the lcd could support. That is completely wrong, I admit that 1280:1024 is blurry in 16:9 (1152:864 looks the best) BUT the lcd can handle resolutions of 1600:1200 but that is all dependent on the capabilities of your video card.

No woman I have known would let a man who used her as a teen, go home and let him be a straddle of her in two minutes and kissing her deeply with his leg between her legs five minutes later. Also, everyone in town knows she is a \\"secret agent\\"??? A very poorly written book.

Both separately told me the same thing - that the book asked far too personal of questions. Neither was willing to fill it out. It asked questions about their feelings about their childhood, feelings about marriage, etc. I had not wanted to record their feelings, but rather more historical type of data such as the cost of bread, the local scenery when it was all orchards, etc. If the book were full of more factually-based questions as opposed to emotionally-based, it would be more suitable.On the positive side, it is a beautiful looking book that would keep well for generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great present for my father","review":"I bought this as a gift for my father's 65th birthday. He has enjoyed researching our family ancestry for decades so I thought he would appreciate how nice it would be to have everything about his life documented first hand. It is a beautiful book, much larger then I thought it would be, with gold trimmed pages. I love all the topics it covers with thorough questions in each chapter. This certainly will take him quite a bit of time to complete, but will give him something to do possibly for the next few years!

My friend and I also made the shotgun in the book and we took it to a gun smith. He said that he is glad that we didn't fire the gun because it is the most dangerous weapon that he has ever seen. He said that the nail that is used as the hammer in the gun would have flew out with enough velocity to shoot clean through our skulls. I don't recommend that you use the munitions in this book unless you know exactly what you are doing, because this stuff is very rugged and dangerous.

For folks with just a little time, we suggested they read chapters 2 and 3 to get the gist of it. If they had more time...we suggested the read the whole book.

Those chapters compare two process control models: the \\"defined\\" model, which is the basis for most methodologies, and the \\"empirical\\" model, which is the basis for SCRUM. Knowing the difference between these process control models, and their implications when applied to software projects, is essential when trying to understand why so many projects fall apart under pressure, and why Agile techniques, including SCRUM and XP, are improvements on the way we've been doing business.Ignore the few faults this book has (it could have used a thorough copy-edit pass, illustrations that weren't low-res screen shots, and a complete index), and you'll be rewarded with a book that dense in timely, useful information, with case studies to back the theory up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tool when implementing Scrum","review":"I've been a ScrumMaster for over 3 years now, and I still use this book on a constant basis (that's my fault, not the book's!). :)While there are newer books, including Scrum for Project Managers by Ken, I find this book to be the closest to the cookbook many people want and need when implementing new methodologies and processes.If you're thinking about implementing Scrum, this is the one book you cannot afford to pass over.Good job Ken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband likes it so far","review":"Little weird to review a book before actually reading it.

While her previous Kate Austen books were delightful mysteries, this one brings the series to a new level of excitement with more plot twists than a reader would imagine possible. Any reader who thinks they know the extent of character Kate Austen's sleuthing talents, will appreciate again her strength and depth in every chapter as she finds herself in peril after peril. Love-interest Michael finds himself in peril on the job in this title, too. Anna and Libby continue to enhance the Kate Austen stories with their realistic personalities.

As the old saying goes, no good deed goes unpunished, Kate is kidnapped and that is just the beginning. Any number of twists and turns, including Kate under suspicion of murder, carry us through this book. Most of the story follows Kate, but periodically we also follow Micheal as he struggles to solve Kate's problem and a few of his own. It is well told and fast paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder Among Strangers","review":"This is the 4th installment of the Kate Austin mysteries.The story begins when Kate stops to help a stranded motorist and ends up kidnapped her self.

The relationship between Kate and Mike Stone is tested, as it has never been before.I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout this book. Just when I thought a problem was solved, up popped another. It was a very well told story and fast-paced.

I fully understand that meat doesn't have a \\"negative calorie effect\\", but there should have been a disclaimer that this book was from the vegetarian point of view and it wouldn't contain any information about how to integrate \\"the foods that cause you to lose weight\\" into any diet. However, the book was fairly inexpensive so it's hard to complain too much ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foods That Cause You To Lose Weight review","review":"So far I like the book. I am not sure of my thoughts on the vegan lifestyle as it applies to me, though, and didn't realize the book was vegan based when I purchased it.

The video quality isn't constant and differs from episode to episode as is the audio quality. In some episodes there are colour problems and a few audio pops here and there but hey that is to be expected from a show that aired in the early 80s.

It's obvious that the person packing this hat does not know how to properly pack this item or just doesn't care. Packing material was put at the bottom of the box and then the hat was laid on top. The hat had to be pushed down to close the top of the box, which bent the hat at the top and at the brim. You would think The Golf Warehouse would have fixed this by now!

It is not \\"complete\\" by any stretch of the imagination.This is a very brief introduction (103 pages of text) to a very large topic. Some aspects of German research are treated in only the most cursory manner - the Lutheran church covered in a chapter of a single page while the Germans in Canada are dealt with in only 3 pages.The section on German record types leaves the reader wishing for more information. Which is the feeling the entire book gives \\"I wish there was more here\\".While this book has been updated to reflect the reunification of Germany, this is not Angus Baxter's best book.

The opposition is supposed to get tougher and tougher as play goes on until you meet the 'big boss' at the end.

Surely, I could see my own mom and her good graces toward me, but I also gained a sense of what makes my wife tick with her mother and my kids. If you want a sneak peak into the complicated dynamics of mother and daughter, and how all of those feminine mysteries work toward the greater good, I think this book is the ticket. The words are terrific and the author's artwork speaks louder than pictures ever could.

Three, how the story seems to automatically prompt an interesting conversation with anybody who picks it up.

This book may have inspired and launched a thousand novels in succeeding generations, but outside of aspiring modern writers who need either justification or inspiration, it really has no place. It's irrelevant, completely unfunny, and as unintellectual as a neo-con's talking points.My bias: Joyce and Sterne belong in the same bowl to be devoured by artists and fellow writers and happily ignored by most consumers of literature. Maybe we aren't smart enough to enjoy it, but we are intelligent enough to get it. It's just not that fun to struggle through. These are mostly pointless words penned as amusement and should be treated as such. There's little of humanism to reveal here, so let it be what it is: the recreation of a mind unburdened by survival or love. Too bad so much ink was spilled on so little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs some work.","review":"This movie is based on a true story, though it also contains many factual inaccuracies. In addition, there are some serious technical problems. For example, in at least three scenes the microphone boom can be seen at the top of the screen. The film is supposed to be filmed in Nebraska and Wyoming, but appears to have been filmed somewhere in the southwest. The scenery is all wrong. The acting is weak and the script thin. Clearly, the budget was too low to do it right!What Charlie Starkweather and his girlfriend did makes a facinating story, but I was very disappointed by this attempt to tell that story. So much more could have been done with better research, better writing, better acting, better props, and better editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst...","review":"This is a horrific testament to poor filmmaking; the script is a mere collection of murder mystery/romance film cliches.

Being a true story, I was curious, especially since this movie is about a serial killer. With quotes like..... Before Dahmer, Before Bundy, he was the most feared, I really wanted to see this movie even though I am not familiar with the name Charles Starkweather. Turns out he and his young girlfriend went on a murdering spree in Nebraska and Wyoming. It is said that they killed 11 people. It is also said that this movie inspired Natural Born Killers and Kalifornia. It was just OK for me. The acting wasn't bad. Brent Taylor gave a good performance as the deranged Starkweather and Shannon Lucio gave a good performance as the equally deranged girlfriend, Caril Ann. This is a movie just worth renting, not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exaggerate violence!","review":"This movie has an exaggerate and free violence.

It's focused on about eight people, the main character a woman in her thirties who runs a tofu stand on the village's only road. It deals most of all with the fascism of the reforms, with both pathos and lightly ironic humor. We watch as the villagers and the 'reformers' live out their lives, going through oftentimes dramatic changes, and how the village is essentially destroyed by them - while at the same time, how they live on, finding joy when and where they can. Are villages traditions evil? Who has the right to decide what is a proper way of life? To what extent are those in power willing to go to enforce a 'correct' way of living? How do plain old people deal with all of this? These are some of the questions the novel poses and answers. Gu Hua's prose is lively, quite moving, and his subject utterly fascinating.

Two coats of polish last about two weeks. Touch ups to cover any chips are easy -- the polish blends right in to the existing coats. I highly recommend this color. It is great for spring and summer -- nice and warm, without looking \\"light\\" or whimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"Colors are exactly as described and shipping was very prompt! Very happy with this purchase. Too Hot Pink to Hold'Em is a great summer color - hot pink with the slightest hint of peach. Great beach pedicure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"i love this color but the one i recieve was in very bad condition. ive never had a nail polish that was so watery, i can't even use it. i do reccommend this color but not from this site, just buy it at a store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It ! have it on NOW !","review":"i am a kinda girl than never really purchased alot of nail polish , But my big sister got me mini O.P.I for christmas and i fell in love . i cought this color on my own and just used it for the 1'st time , works GREAT ! i love O.P.I"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too watery... Not really a fan of \\"sorbet-like\\" shades by OPI","review":"I'm just flat out disappointed in this color... I always apply nail strengthener and base coat to prime my nails, and I still had to pain 4 coats before I achieved solid color. I really do hate sheer nail polish...I realize it's a new formula for \\"sorbet-like\\" shades, but I didn't like the way it looked. I may need to paint a pale, opaque shade on my nails first and give it a second try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is one of the prettiest coral colors I've seen in a long time, and I was excited to try it. The only problem is that it's more of a gloss color and it's not very creamy. I had to apply four coats to get the opaque tone I wanted. It's a bit see-through. But after all those coats, top coat, and a drip dry-- my mani lasted for over a week with no chips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am THRILLED!","review":"None of my local salons were selling this color, so I was ecstatic to see it on Amazon for a reasonable price! It is just what I wanted. It's my new favorite Spring color!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right color!","review":"The product shown in the picture is a completely different color as the actual product. OPI is a great brand and the product works great, it's just the wrong color! I expected a reddish pink and this is more of a coral color!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep thoughts in the English countryside or writers conceit?","review":"This book didn't fill me with any deep insights except possibly into Naipaul's conceit. Despite some occasional beautiful description this book doesn't do much. Naipaul's pontifications on the \\"common people\\" approach the truly condescending as he attempts to \\"understand\\" them. And yet it all seems geared as a justification for his own preoccupied ruminations. I just don't think it's Naipaul's best which is when he's got a real story to tell, his own or someone else's. I'm just not that interested in Naipaul's thought processes. Or maybe I just don't like them, either way he's written better. Possibly if he wasn't so self absorbed and inherently elitist I could like him better. When he uses his sharp mind for a better purpose he writes more interesting books."},{"rating":"1","title":"brilliantly written pointlessness","review":"Another reviewer said to read this in the winter, so I did. The rain and drizzle trapped me indoors so Naipaul had a captive audience. I didn't relish the book or the characters, nor did I think the attention to detail to be much of an inspiration. I was kind of amused with some of the ideas, and kept thinking there was a bigger, sublime hidden message that would eventually jump out at me. Finally in the last few pages he tells us what motivated him to write this book, but even then the purpose sort of lost me. His attention to explaining simple things in elaborate detail show that he's an accompished writer, so I find it quixotic that so much energy went into a book with such a flat, unemotional, nearly pointless ramble of words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention to Detail - VERY BORING","review":"I just finished reading Miguel Street by V.S. Naipaul when I went to a nearby used book store and picked out this book - thinking they would be similar - WRONG! This book pays so much attention to detail - to every person, blade of grass, plastic bag, dead cow, etc. that is takes forever to even get into the plot of the book - when does the interesting stuff happen? The first half of the book could be condensed into 20 pages - no problem - I understand his need to give an account of the surroundings upon his arrival - but COME ON! It is way too much - to be honest with you - I gave up reading it because it became pure torture - and I feel like it is not worth the $5 I spent on it. Disappointing. But - if you get a chance - Miguel Street is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbarian set to rate?","review":"I truly feel the part of the Philistine in writing this review.I bought the book to increase my culture.I bought the book in appreciation of a Nobel Laureate.I bought the book because I felt I shouldNone of these reasons were good enough reasons for me to spend time reading it.The book is painfully slow, and difficult to read. The plot is nearly non-existant, but that can be overcome. The author's point was elusive, making me wonder why I read this. I've known root canals to be less painful.If you are into Naipul, this may be the book for you.If you're looking to get into \\"The Great Books\\", start with another.Maybe I'll try again in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite cookbook ever!!","review":"This is by far THE BEST cookbook I own (& I have a lot!) - several years ago when my family decided to change our eating habits for the better, we chose this cookbook from the shelves of a very large bookstore, hoping the variety & detailed information were what we needed. Boy, was it--just about every cooking or food question I've had over the years has been answered in these pages. . .there's detailed charts on different types of foods (veggies, spices, etc) & information about uncommon foods (natural sweeteners, soy products, etc) but most importantly are the actual recipes. From the basics to the unusual, this book has something that I can either use directly or easily adapt to how I eat or what ingredients are on hand. Whether you're vegetarian, vegan, limiting carbs, or just wanting to eat better, this book belongs in your kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the game","review":"I think this is a very boring game. The deer are always at the same place,so you know where the deer are. I have finished all of the hunts on the game in about a half hour. If you want to buy a good hunting game buy Cabela's Big Game Hunter 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection of impressive remixes","review":"Collecting several remixes of tracks from New Forms, this nicely conceived full-lengther includes the work of Photek, Grooverider, Krust, Kruder (of \\"& Dorfmeister fame), Nobukazu Takemura, and others. While I don't think that any of the material is unreleased, this is a sure bet for fans of D&B, jungle, or simply inventive electronic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Resource","review":"Shipping wise, it took a little while to get this book- but after opening the cover I have found it to be a great resource. It gives you all the basics and quick references for basic information you may need to know at the drop of a hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Little Ones","review":"My 15-month-old son has loved this book since I began reading it to him at 6 months old. The colors and pictures really keep his attention and as I read, we count the characters so that he can learn his numbers. The rhyming words have certainly helped his vocabulary. Now he can even finish each sentence for me as we read the book together! He loves it. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"We enjoyed it!","review":"I got this book for my son when he was 2 years old. 3 years later, he still loves this book and read it by himself from time to time. This book is a good counting book, encouraging kids to express their feelings and educational!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversized even for adult....","review":"My wife and I purchased the VIDEONOW XP Interactive Video System for my son this Christmas however when we did Walmart was out of the headphones. Well I was on Amazon one day and decided to look here. I ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived. My 5 year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders. No matter how we tried that is all they would do. My 12 year old daughter decided to try them with her mp3 player with the same result! I am able to wear them however even with my 30 year old head (size 8 1/4) it is still loose. These are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse. I would just go ahead and pick up some other company's aftermarket headphones for your child. If Tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good nylon washers","review":"As described.

The shams are large enough for a jumbo pillow, so the effect on the bed is lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I bought this for my 6yr old son and he absolutely loved it. He was so excited when he opened it. He is on the taller side for his age and it fit him great. He likes to wear it to bed so I've washed it a lot and it still looks like new."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING WARNING PURE JUNK!","review":"I bought 2 sets of 4 ohms versions speakers Thinking that the postive reviews where right (More Postive then negative) And boy was I wrong. Lets start off I had them hooked up to a INFINITY REFERENCE 475A amp that produces 75 watts RMS X 4, The amp was half way up, I would say 37.5 watts RMS X 4, Three days latter 1 was toast, In the next 2 days one kept losing the tweeter, I took the door apart to find the tweeter came unscrewed, I went to screw it back in after peeling the sticker off the back of the speaker to find the screw, It was stripped out then I had a problem with the back one 2 weeks latter it only worked when It wantted to I soitered wires to the terminals, So I knew that was not a problem, Now I had 1 speaker working, But removed it to start over, They sounded Like they cost CHEAP, Ive been doing this for 14+ Years in many cars and trucks And tried to go cheap and got burned! Do your self a favor and spend a little more now to save you latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price great sound","review":"I have a jl audio w7 13.5 and just bought these 6/9\\"s to hold me over!!
