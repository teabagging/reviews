Sometimes I'm dubious of products made in China (what can you buy that is'nt made in China) but I was pleased that it had such a solid feel. The aligator clips have strong springs, the trigger seems to pull smooth and also has a strong spring, and the body seems almost to be made of bakelite (tough resin). The included instructions gave good examples on how to hook the starter up to different makes of cars, which was a big relief. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE INSIDE THE PAPER INSERT IN THE BLISTER PACK, DO NOT THROW THE PACKAGING AWAY!

If the 80's taught us one thing, its that new technology may offer a better signal-to-noise ratio and pinpoint accuracy but it results in sterile, soulless music. I love the spontaneity and energy of their 1970s-early 80s albums the most, but on HYF they really toned it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe it's the same RUSH...","review":"It's hard to believe that the same magic heavy band that bring 2112, FAREWELL TO KINGS and CARESS OF STEEL are the creators of Hold your fire...In my opinion, this is the most uninspired moment of ALL RUSH career...There some ok songs like force ten or open secrets, but the rest could be associated to lame 80's pop bands! Really love RUSH, but this is not a good rock album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush's worst album","review":"This album is a good example of why the music of the '80s sucked so bad. Even the great band Rush incorporated too much technology and lossed their 'hard rockin' edge. Ditch the keyboards Geddy, and put those hands on the bass where they belong. Thank goodness Rush made an attempt to go back to their roots on each subsequent album by downplaying the keyboards and cranking up the guitars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What the hell is this?! Sounds like a hard-rock band trying to play synth-pop music! Many songs don't leave a lasting impression because they're much too convoluted and Rush don't allow the melodies to shine. The guitar-playing actually doesn't fit into these cool synth surroundings, and some tracks like \\"Open Secrets\\" and \\"High Water\\" are even ruined by Alex' ugly guitar-riffs. \\"Tai Shan\\" is one of Rush's worst efforts, the music and the trite lyrics remind me of some bad new age noodlings. I like Geddy's beautiful vocal performance on tracks like \\"Second Nature\\" and \\"Mission\\", and \\"Time stand still\\" is a decent song with some more straight-ahead playing. But this album really doesn't catch fire with the exception of a few moments. \\"Hold your Fire\\" is the statement of a band running out of good song ideas and inspiration in the mid-'80s. If you're interested in '80s-Rush, avoid this album and get some of their early-'80s stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen carefully","review":"This easily one of my favorites from rush. the songs are almost all first rate and alot more emotional than past recordings. my only gripe is the recording. one of the reviews on here says thats it's their best recording. it is most certainly not. if you where considering this one for reference material you should look elsewhere. this may sound like the best blaring out of a fisher-price boom-box. but in my room it does not. the ludicrously overblown bass on lock and key proved that. in many other parts it sounded very conjested. \\"counterparts\\" however has an absolutley amazing recording. and i have over $5,000 of audio equipment to prove that, just so you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Complex Band","review":"When I was young and first listened to your first album (RUSH)I was to young to relize what lied in the future for your band.Since your first release did not include Neal Peart (Professor),I was sceptical at first ,until (Fly By Night)was released.I have enjoyed every album since.I'm anxious to hear your New C.D for 2000.I listen to your music everyday and night.Keep up your good work.A fan Dave Kroeger"},{"rating":"2","title":"melodic, powerful, lush,intelligent rock--one of Rush's best","review":"Hold Your Fire is the culmination of Rush's 80s synth-era rock--and I love every moment of it. For those that complain of HYF's synth-heavy 80s sound--do you forget that this is a product of the 80s? No man can escape the time in which he lives and be completely separate from it. Every era has its great creations and its poor impersonations. Rush's HYF represents some of the best of 80s pop music sensibilities. From the steady, driving opening of FORCE TEN, to the centerpiece Mission, and closing with the heartbeat rhythm of High Water, HYF is a well-conceived and produced work of art. The recording, mixing and overall production is just right, and has many Rush fans, including myself, wishing that the same could have been done for their most recent studio album Vapor Trails. If you are a new fan of Rush, and are looking for your next Rush aquisition, pick up Hold Your Fire and you will fall in love with that late 80s Rush sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"middle period\\" Rush","review":"Others have said it well, so I'll keep it short, but I did want to give a brief nod to a Rush album to which I somehow find myself returning more frequently than I do to most of their more heralded releases. I should probably mention that I regularly listen to Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, et al. In other words, I have nothing against synthesizers gone wild. If you do, you might have issues with parts of _Hold Your Fire_. I'd only suggest that such issues are easily surmountable, and that surmounting them is worth the effort.The finest and most anthemic songs here -- I'd nominate Force Ten, Time Stand Still, and Prime Mover -- use synths, sure, but they're by no means dominated by them, and their lyrics are right up there among Peart's best efforts. Geek rock? Heck yeah. Maybe just go with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinder, Gentler","review":"This album on the surface seems less daring than many previous Rush efforts, though one could argue it is one of their most mature musical enterprises. The album is well-balanced, flawlessly produced and well executed. Most die-hard Rush fans are invariably left feeling the band goes soft on these recordings. But what they lose to some extent on \\"edge\\" they gain in creating consistent musical atmosphere across all the songs. Geddy Lee's vocals are less piercing than usual and in general the album has a calm confidence to it. As always, Peart has something of value to say in his lyrics and Lifeson, as has been his trend for years plays to the strength of the song, rather than making the song fit his guitar playing. Not their best effort but worth more than one listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"True art evades the masses","review":"Rush is my favorite band of all time. I own all of the studio albums and the live albums. I have listened to all of them over and over again, and this is the one disc that I would choose over all of the others if I were forced to make that choice.Every song is beautiful and well-written. Any \\"Rush fan\\" who rails against this record is not a fan of the band as much as they are a fan of a certain record or time period. This record is Rush to the CORE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush - they are like wine - older and better!","review":"\\"hold your fire\\" is a rich and powerfull pop-rock album with memorable bass guitar riffs and a lot of synthesisers.compared to \\"grace under pressure\\" or their other albums it is a true gem and an album most emjoyable from their whole 80's discography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare yourself for the synthesizers","review":"Emotionally driven lyrics, highly atmospheric production, and riding the swell of new wave, HYF is the best of 80s Rush. Prepare yourself for the synthesizers though, they are very prominent and certainly date the album, though no more than Hempisheres is dated by its classic 70s prog-rock qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gem from the power trio from the Great White North.","review":"This 1987 release by the legendary Canadian power trio is one of their best discs of the 80's.Having not listened to this cd in quite some time I gave it a listen. I forgot what a great disc this is.As usual, it is full of great thought provoking lyrics from drummer Neil Peart and well written music by guitartist Alex Lifeson and bass player Geddy Lee to accompany it.The disc leads off with \\"Force Ten\\" followed by \\"Time Stand Still\\" one of the singles that was released on the radio and has a guest appearance from Aimee Mann, then lead singer of Til Tuesday. It's one of the many gems on the cd.Give this eighties treasure from one of the most underated and probably the greatest rock band to come out of the Great White North a listen. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"overlooked album --- bad release timing?","review":"It is probably more an issue today than it was in 1987, but major titles can get lost in the critical shuffle when they are released at the same time as higher-profile albums.\\"Hold Your Fire\\" hit the record stores the same day as Pink Floyd's \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\", the bands first album post-Roger Waters. So Floyd hogged all the industry's press and attention. Did \\"Hold Your Fire\\" ultimately get a little lost in the shuffle?I am a big fan of about 2 or 3 songs on this record (and \\"Time Stand Still\\" is one of the lamest music videos of all time, but there's another one out there that's even worse), but somehow the rest of the songs don't hold up that well for me. \\"Tai Shan\\", for example. Heck, I even went to Tai Shan mountain in 1999 and still can't get excited about that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best","review":"This is not Rush's best album. Though not bad, it is far from classic.On the surface it seems to lack everything that most like about Rush: long songs, guitar solos, significant instrumental passages, etc. However, there's still plenty to like. The lyrics and drumming are still great, the band is still tight, and the structures are more complicated than they first appear. There are several standouts as well: \\"Force Ten,\\" \\"Mission,\\" \\"Prime Mover,\\" \\"Lock and Key,\\" etc. I do wish guitars were more prominent, but such is the nature of Rush's third era.If you want the best Rush, get 2112 through Power Windows; all those albums are great except Grace under Pressure, which is on the borderline. Come to Hold Your Fire only after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold Your Fire, Chronicles, Counterparts","review":"I was disappointed with the disks. They skip, skip, skip. Not the Herb Alpert selection, just the RUSH disks I've purchased. It must be the manufacturer, but it is still disappointing nonetheless. I will probably look elsewhere for music cd's and save, at least, on the shipping and handling costs.Thanks for asking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change In Direction.","review":"Although Hold Your Fire isn't my favorite Rush album, it still marks the end of the electronic era. They use just as much keyboard as they did on Power Windows but you can hear more guitar in the background starting off from Force Ten. The guitar blends well with the synthesizer and it's a good hard rock track. Time Stands Still is a much lighter track and has a lot of '80s techno in it, although there's still consistent guitar in the background. Rush start to show some change in their sound and it's a step up from Power Windows, which was still good but it sounds a bit dated. Hold Your Fire is just a sign of things to come on Presto. There's several good tracks but my personal favorite is Open Secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"plenty o synth","review":"synthesizer heavy, this melodic work is pretty easy on the ears. a departure from their hard rock roots, there is still plenty to chew on here. aimee mann provides vocal backup on \\"time stand still\\",which was a radio and mtv favorite(when mtv still played music videos) when the song and album were new-still holds up.ten songs on this one,and once settled in for some listening, nary a stinker in the bunch. this album proceeds well from song to song and although the three instruments(bass guitar,guitar and drums)take something of a back seat to geddys moog stylings, there is still a strong presence of all three friends from the north moving through. similar to the previous album \\"power windows\\",\\"hold your fire\\" is a well done and welcome encore. their next album \\"presto\\" goes for a little more rock throughout,so enjoy this album in all its glory-there hasn't been any going back.four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush - 'Hold Your Fire' (Mercury) 2 1/2 stars","review":"Review no.124.Originally released in late 1987,this has never been one of my favorite Rush albums,as I'm sure I probably don't stand alone on that.By this point in time,I personally thought that Rush had almost become like a parody of themselves.Also grateful that this faze didn't last within the band.Tunes that are 'okay' are \\"Force Ten\\",\\"Time Stands Still\\",the rather dark \\"Prime Mover\\" and \\"Lock And Key\\".Sorry,but 'Hold...' simply didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"TASTELESS","review":"If you don't know Rush, it's better not start with this one.

Force Ten is a fantastic song, of course (but then, most Rush album openers are great). But the rest is a different story.See, the other 9 songs might have actually been a reasonable diversion on their own if spread out on other albums. But lumped together, it is an absolutely nauseating effect. One generic adult-pop song after another. When the songs are slow, there are no good melodies - when they attempt to rock (which is rare), there are no good riffs.Now, the argument can be made that the lyrics and 'artsiness' of the album make up for it. From a certain perspective, this could work ... not for me, though. Don't get me wrong - I don't mind artsiness in and of itself. When artsiness and pretentiousness are combined with good or great music, the results can be stellar. BUT, when combined with mediocre or worse music, the final product becomes revolting to the core.And that is why HYF gets 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"80's Explosion","review":"I have come to the Conclusion that this band could fart on tape and there will be some people out there that will call it \\"some of their best work.\\" Let me put it this way.Most of the songs on this record would fit in nicely on one of those 80's compolation CD's that Martha Quinn does the ad's for on TV.THis is THE worst RUSH record in the collection,THere are NO good songs to speak of.There is just nothing good to say about this record so I wont try.If you are going to buy a RUSH cd for the first time do yourself a favor and Pick a different one...try \\"2112\\" \\"Counterparts\\" \\"test for Echo\\" or \\"Hemispheres\\" ...leave this one on the shelf where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY COLD< FORMULATIC< COMMERCIAL","review":"RUSH is not the best band in the world, like some reviewer below said.

I was never convinced of the romance that the story claims to portray. I saw a young, easily influenced girl looking for a father figure (as her own father paid her little attention)and a womanizing, pig of a man (who happened to be a talented artist) that used her to fill some empty spot in his life.

I should be able to upgrade the pressure release valve with standard brass fittings (I'm guessing here), so no heartburn there, and it *was* a relatively inexpensive tool that gets you up and going right out of the box.

Three videos(over 5 hours) of Michael Flatley dancing and discussing his music career for under $15 is unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor videography","review":"Although the dancing is excellent, the disgustingly unprofessional videography makes this recording impossible to enjoy it. There are few shot blocks longer than 4 or 5 seconds, with some of them as short as 1 second. At that rate of change, there is simply no way to focus on, much less comprehend, the complex choreography happening. It's as if the video editing crew has taken over the performance and made it their act, not the dancers'. Sometimes I am even forced to watch the progress of Flatley's nostrils roaring across the stage.I bought Feet of Flames and Lord of the Dance. Both of them are identical shows, but with different audiences. I ended up so frustrated watching what could have been a beautiful, engaging presentation, that I fried the DVD in the microwave.Videographers are mostly unimportant to an art.

Older kids probably wouldn't mind cutting it out themselves but there are quite a few very difficult, detailed cuts. One cut needs razor blade as it is to slit along the window of the stand-up scene.

So far it's removed everything I've tried it with.I've seen several negative reviews here, and I can't help but wonder if they were running the drill the wrong direction. Either that, or they were using it on a screw or bolt that was rusted into a metal object to an extraordinary degree. I can imagine a screw rusted into some metal device that just isn't going to come out with this or anything else, no matter what. I've been fiddling with tools for 50 years, and I think this is the best damaged-screw removal tool possible -- not a magic bullet that'll do 100% of your problems, but probably 99%.It more than pays for itself the first time you use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, wish it worked...","review":"I bought this to remove some stripped screws.

This playhouse has so many more features, especially for little boys, and was considerably cheaper. I am so glad we got this one. This is the first one I've seen that gives more options for boys instead of just playing \\"house.\\" There is the schoolhouse/firehouse, gas station, grocery store, and sports walls. The first thing my son did when we set it up was gas up his jeep. I can see him playing with this one a lot longer that others because of all the options. It was fairly easy to put together but you do need 2 people to secure the roof. For the money, this is definitely the best value out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's Endless Adventures","review":"My son really enjoys his new playhouse. He is only two years old, so he has not yet mastered the basketball hoop. I would recommend this product to other parents because of its durability.

However, it is not overly durable if you use it as an outdoor toy. The stickers that come with the playhouse quickly peeled off within a few months of play. This was disappointing, because they really added to the decor of the playhouse. The plastic shutters ended up cracking and one shutter fell off...plus the color of the shutters turned very yellow and foggy over time. The basketball netting also did not last and frayed very quickly. My children (3 & 5) loved the store side of the house, and would hand out food to mom and dad all day long. They also enjoyed using the gasoline pump to fuel their bicycles and john deere tractors. The creativity of the toy is fun, but I would recommend keeping this indoors to maintain the appearance of the playhouse. I would also forego using the stickers if you are going to put the playhouse outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and durable","review":"I ordered this playhouse for my child care and had it blow across the yard and into our fence in a widstorm. The only part that broke was a piece on the door which we decided we didn't necessarily need to replace. I would suggest popping out the plugs and putting about 2 inches of pea gravel in each of the walls to give it some weight if it's to be used outside. Great fun for children up to age 4. Tends to be too small for school age children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for beginners in time-series analysis","review":"This book is without a doubt the most readable text one can find on time-series analysis for the breadth of coverage it contains. For those hopelessly lost in the matrix and vector notation of Hamilton's \\"Time-Series Analysis,\\" Enders' book should give you the understanding you need to begin studying Hamilton in earnest. Enders' book contains some terrific examples of impulse response functions and VAR (vector autoregression) analysis that you won't find in Hamilton.The only down side to Enders book is that it isn't really complete. There are a number of topics, such as the Kalman filter, that Enders could have done an outstanding presentation of, but didn't. Hopefully, he will reconsider such topics for later editions. Meanwhile, the beginning student is unlikely to regret their purchase of his first edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite good but...","review":"OK, the book is not that bad, it explains the theory clearly BUT it is \\"applied\\" and there is no solutions to the exercise books in the authors webpage (although they do include the data sets for the exercises). I know it's common nowadays to edit books with math exercises without a solutions manual (or at least a pdf file online) but it doesn't change anything.So yes, it's a good book to read, but how will you be sure you understood what you've read if you can practice it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chiang of the time series","review":"As the other reviewers pointed out, the greatest quality of the Enders's book is its readability. It is, most certainly, a very good introduction to the topic. It is getting old, though. The developments in the time series literature have been pretty fast and a new edition would certainly be a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Applied???? Ha. The author goes pages and pages and more pages, dense with theory, formulas, etc., before he gives an example or actually puts it to use, often times using computer-generated data rather than an actual, real-world problem. That's not applied at all!!! The back cover clearly says \\"Assuming only a basic understanding of multiple regression analysis...\\", meaning it is by no means a PhD level book. So pay tribute to the stupid book title and cut all the unnecessary theory. You are better off getting Elements of Forecasting, by Diebold. The two overlap very much, covering the same things, for the most part, but he's a lot better explaining things and he actually applies the stuff, and the exercises at the end of the chapters are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference","review":"This book is an excellent reference guide and a must have book to everyone interested in time series analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"sailor moon novel 1","review":"if you want to know what the book is about and not the the complants read here.I think this book is great.it tells you how a normal middle school girl Serena Tuskino(japanese Usagi Tuskino) meets a talk ing cat Luna.

Horrible, horrible, horrible.","review":"I have heard that Stuart Levy is not a very big fan of Sailor Moon, and this has proven it for me. He seems to be rather out of touch with the show, and the writing style, to me seems awkward and stiff. It mainly focuses on the DiC dub, but adds two missing episodes which were never aired in the US. I found it rather short, and uninteresting. It defenitely shouldn't be rated Young Adults, (too short a book) but the things Mr.Levy mentions (Bloomingdale's, Miami Vice, Interveiw with the Vampire, Monteblanc) a young child may not have seen to understand. I'd advise Sailor Moon fans to stick to reading the manga's, they're much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTE: Category--Young Adult","review":"The book is super for its intended market.

Every time I read the name Serena, I cringed. What's wrong with the name Usagi? So what if it doesn't sound American? Why is that so bad? And second of all the word scouts make me cringe. It's not scouts, they're not girl scouts..., it's senshi, sailor soilders... soilders!

It is sooooooo much better. Not to mention the original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A way for Americans to appreciate Sailor Moon!","review":"This novel is not an easy thing to rate. If you're a purist, then you will probably find the Americanization of Sailor Moon (or rather, Sailormoon) offensive. And yes, this is a highly Americanized novel. However, for those of us who can see past the cuts to the true genius of DiC's dub, this novel is a good collector's item. Yes, it is written for eight-year-olds. Yes, it shamelessly omits all references to Japanese culture. But Sailor Moon is not merely an anime cartoon; it is a world-famous cartoon, and it's time America gave it the proper respect and treatment, updating it for wide release. This novel deserves four stars, despite the basic rewrite; it can be funny and it brings Sailor Moon to a whole new level and audience, something that most of us fans, at heart, have always wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no way to go under one?","review":"I cannot believe this!

The many color and black and white photos show both people who go there and various parts of the town. The detailed maps also give me confidence that I'll be able to find what I need. Even though my French skills are lacking, given the author's tips, I'm confident I'll be able to find plenty of places and people that welcome Enlish speakers"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a large paper blog,","review":"I would not suggest anyone purchase this for any reason.

Nudism and naturism has nothing to do with this much overly sexualized account of this resort destination. The author is sensationalizing this laid-back place as a modern-day sexual nirvana which is nothing close to the truth.If he's writing a guide for the sexually-deprived I can understand and not agree with him. \\"Cap\\" is far more than that and the truests know it. I don't look forward to bumping into folks who take this as truth.It's unfair to the families and innocents who go there for the concept and comfort of plain nudity.As Bernie wrote - experience for yourself and skip this book,,,,"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Surprised At The Number Of Reviewers Who Trash This Album","review":"Although this early 1980s Winwood release has been overshadowed by some of Winwood's better known albums from later in that decade, this is still a great album.I actually prefer Arc Of A Diver to some of Winwood later work, like Roll With It, which is better known and was more commercially successful. This is a really good album. Those reviewers who are trashing it should give it another listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music from Winwood","review":"I had this album when I was in high school, and it took me several years to get around to replacing it.

It is very strong and does \\"work\\" but I have had some issues with it! You have to make sure where you are adhering it is COMPLETELY dirt free or it will soon come up. It stayed on some of my porch steps and not others and when adhering we had some issues getting it to stay on some steps. It has lasted but is starting to crack and tear on some steps. I would say it was worth the money and since you get 60 feet adding more in places is no hassle, I just expected more from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was very disappointed about this book. I find it poorly organized and lacking in content. It basicly consists of very long lists of items, and each item occupying approximately one line, and containing only very little description, and there are very few photos. Everyone who has tried knows that evaluating antiques is very tricky, and even from detailed descriptions and pictures it can be close to impossible. These lists are rather useless unless accompanied by lots of details. Perhaps for very specific items, i.e. china, glass, etc. it could be useful, but I think it has very limited use for furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Didn't work for me.

This is not a book for beginners -- no advice on grammar -- but it is perfect for those who have been in the business awhile and miss the days when they got feedback from teachers and actually talked about issues deeper than deadlines and story lengths. There is deep thought here -- but it's not just philosophy; Stewart shows you how to make concrete improvements in your own writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"sheer distilled genius","review":"I've not seen a better book that explains the craft of newspaper/magazine feature writing.

This is the book I use in the classes I teach on magazine/newspaper feature writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still following Follow the Story","review":"I'm not one to read a book like this straight through; it is rather one I read snippets of from time to time. I find it most helpful as far as good tips to follow when writing/editing my own non-fiction articles. Although I agree with some other reviewers, that the author would have done well to give examples from the writing of other writers besides himself, I feel that the examples he gave were clear and at times exactly what I needed to hear in order to improve my own work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Story to Follow","review":"I am astonished at the superficiality of this book. I am a fan of Stewart's, yet he continually finds himself unable to say what he seems to be trying to say. Several \\"as mentioned in the last chapter\\" passages refer to items unmentioned. Still, he's a smooth writer. Maybe next time his agent and his publisher suggest a book (his own confession), he'll give it the same consideration he's given WSJ pieces brought to him as editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit The Whining!","review":"Too many people knock this scroll saw for mostly reasons that are silly and lacking in basic mechanical knowledge. This saw will perform as well or better than saws costing three or four times as much. In particular, squawks about vibration are easily cured by bolting the machine to a firm foundation. If one will take the time and check everything, coming out of the box, tighten all fittings and set the proper alignments, they will enjoy many happy hours producing fine projects. The sanding wheel, the tool attachment, the placement of controls and the ease of operation make this a helluva bang for the buck. Pay more and you get less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better from Dremmel","review":"I was trying to upgrade from my 16\\" Craftsman and I am afraid I made a big mistake. I could not control the vibration on this machine no matter how I bolted it down. I tried the suggested carpet pad but to no avail. I have sent this back for a refund, thank goodness that Amazon allows me to do this. I will try to save my pennies and go for the DeWalt or perhaps save even more for a HAWK. I am extremely happy with all other products I have from Dremmel but this was a disappointment. I also had problems with the light and the hold downs as was stated in another review. This is certainly not the scroll saw I was hoping for.D. Allen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"Bought this tool to get into scrolling and make Christmas presents. I'm very dissapointed.

The saw arrived coming out the bottom of the box and parts were broken (which I subsequently had to order from Dremel). My experiences with Amazon of late have been awful. The manual for the saw had been taped to the top of the box lid and was an older edition not showing the current parts for assembly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It died...","review":"Well, it worked ok for awhile.

CROUPIER delivers. The writing is grade A and the acting is superb. Clive Owen plays Jack Manfred. He should've been nominated for his role in CROUPIER. He plays a writer looking for material for his first novel. Not getting anywhere he takes a job his father lands him at the casino. A life he is all to familiar with. Jack portrays the gambler's life only from the dealer's perspective. Looking for a way out he gets sucked right back in. Jack is a perfectionist, a natural, and he's always calculating the odds. Everyone knows, when gambling there are no guarantees, but what Jack learns is that, even that is not a guarantee. Forget about the overbudgeted Hollywood films and check out the sleeper hit of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"stylish","review":"Being something of a sucker for anything the talented Clive Owen appears in, I looked forward to seeing this film. I had also heard excellent things about it-both stylistically and in terms of the plot/story. Owen plays a would-be writer who can't seem to write. His absent father calls out of nowhere to offer him a position as a croupier at a casino (a position he held in South Africa). As the intrigue of his position at the casino escalates, Jack (Owen's character) realizes he has great material for writing right in front of him. Croupier is a stylish film, and Owen carries it brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack can be my croupier","review":"I use to work in casinos while I lived in Vegas for 11 yrs...I was addicted to craps, black jack, live keno, bingo & slots. But if I came across a man like Jack, man oh man would I be at his table as much as possible! I enjoyed this film and Clive always shines. He is a natural!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of hooh-hah about nothing","review":"Didn't get this at all. Must be a jazz thing, about the apotheosis of cool. Owen is not a hard man, he is your best friend's kid brother. He is milk and cookies.This film got a retrospective showing at a West End indy rep with director Hodges pencilled in to talk about the trials and tribulations of getting the film made and distributed. I didn't attend. That's the kind of existential guy I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flabbergasted - all about the numbers?!","review":"The fact that 24 out of 25 reviews on this site hold that this movie is excellent causes me to seriously question the the overall competence of the human species.This movie is not smart. Its attempts at dramatic tension fail. There are so many anomalous scenes that are jarringly bizarre, and yet they don't work together at all. In the last ten minutes, the screenwriter transparently feels a need to cleverly tie back all the characters together in a random collage of uninteresting, undeveloped people. It wants to be Usual Suspects, but is more like... Nothing comes to mind. This movie is horrendously written, bizarrely edited, and will make you long for the two hours back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Guy's Movie.","review":"Well, of course their are no car chases (that's a joke) but this is a film most men will love. What there is in the film is an excellent plot that's so clever it ought to have a PhD from Harvard. I guarantee that the ending will surprise you. The lead character's travails are fascinating and will cause many a man to feel envy. I personally never thought much about what it would be like to be a dealer, or croupier, before I saw it but I gained an honest appreciation for what their jobs entail by watching it. Its also a film for writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"There have been a few movies that just blindsided me, far exceeding my expectation and leaving me in a state of daze. Pulp Fiction was one. Then there was Trainspotting. I missed the release of Croupier in 2000 because I was on the road all the time, but I got to watch it on DVD just now. Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh no ! Will I be sad if I watch the DVD version ?","review":"I rented this film as a VHS and was astounded ! It is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. I added the DVD to my collection right away -- but I haven't viewed it yet. (I thought I'd save it for a special treat.)After reading the reviews at Amazon, I'm scared to look at the DVD version, lol. Who could have toyed with the sequence of scenes that unfold one after another like cards being upturned on the table ?I'm not one to latch on to a movie star, but I am a big fan of Clive Owen after seeing this and \\"Gosford Park\\". I can't wait to see \\"Beyond Borders\\", too. (The Paramount site for that film isn't working right, does anyone know how to email Paramount ?)Also, does anyone have specifics on what was lost in the transfer to DVD ? Sounds like I'll have to purchase the VHS. Thanks for your reviews of this one of a kind enthralling movie experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The roll of dice","review":"Incredible film. It's about a man who knows how seductive the spin of the roulette wheel can be, and tries his best not to be seduced by the throw of dice. And then comes the ending, and you realise that either way he loses out. Brilliant stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"HANG ON TIGHTLY...","review":"Jack the croupier lives by one rule: \\"Hang on tightly, let go lightly...\\" However, no matter how zen-trained a reader is, it's not easy to let go lightly of this book which contains draft No.9 of Paul Mayersberg's screenplay and is dedicated to the memory of Jean-Pierre Melville. It is a very insightful companion to Mike Hodges' once obscure now cult-movie, and a must-read for its numerous fans, since it offers more than the mere \\"transcript\\" of a final cut. A very interesting chapter -- titled \\"Annotations, Memories and Notes for the Curious\\" -- confirms why CROUPIER is the thinking person's film noir par excellence. As a bonus, the book is illustrated with B&W photos from the film featuring Clive Owen, Alex Kingston, Kate Hardie and Gina McKee. Food for thought meets eye candy... leaving nothing to chance. Hang on tightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD","review":"I am a Clive Owen fan and first saw Croupier in the theatre when it was released and I have been eager to own a copy on DVD ever since. I just bought the DVD listed above and to my complete disgust, this version of Croupier has been both edited for content and formatted to fit the television screen. The content editing is so severe that it leaves the story without a plausable ending. I was so disappointed because Croupier is indeed a five star story and I had waited some time to get this film on DVD only to feel utterly ....DO NOT BUY THIS DVD...you will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film - Bad DVD !!","review":"Croupier is a fantastic film, but, this DVD has been edited for content to the degree that the story doesn't make sense.

Totally engaging. Great characters,one of his earlier films, but a winner..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do people gamble?","review":"This is an enigma of a film. There's an underlying love between him, now in London and his father, in Sun City, South Africa. He wants to be a writer. He lives with a woman he doesn't really love. He needs money. He used to be a croupier in Cape Town. His dad arranges an introduction. He's offered the job. He starts. Wheels start turning; wheels within wheels. The roulette wheel and his head, the latter turning between himself - Jack - and the central character of his writing; Jake. It's a mild thriller, with additional reflections on the types of people who gamble. There's a gorgeous woman and a nice twist to end the story. It's a young Clive Owen. It's a good film and his own final love is a surprise.Ian Hunter.Author of \`e-Love'."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Vastly overrated in some quarters but nonetheless a pleasing-enough slow burn thriller from the director of Get Carter, Croupier is short on action but long on style, with a performance by Clive Owen that placed him number one in many people's \\"next Bond\\" lists; as long as you don't go in expecting a modern masterpiece you're likely to leave happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect","review":"The colors are clear and distinct which makes stitching evenly so much easier.

Songs like \\"Tenderly,\\" \\"Mona Lisa,\\" \\"Like a Lover,\\" and my favorite, \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye (The Promise)\\" put one in a state of pure relaxation and a desire to be with the one you love. Earl's playing is so melodic and filled with so much emotion, you're completely taken in by his artistry. From first song to last, you're hooked. The flow of this CD is simply beautiful. One of my favorite periods in Jazz is the '70's and some of the best artists (Noel Pointer, Grover Washington Jr., David Sanborn to name a few)who came out of that era of Jazz-Fusion continue to be my favorites. Earl is one of them. I've got a lot of his work and this is what I consider a classic. A must have for Earl Klugh fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One Klugh to have when your having only one.","review":"This simple,laid back CD never fails to engage me emotionally.

The recording quality is also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even non sailors can survive with the Coast Guard handy","review":"I liked this book, because it meant that if a duffus like Hodding Carter could sail from Greenland, I could too. After all I know how to sail. As for proving that its difficult to do, well, he finnally admits to realizing that they don't call Maine \\"Down East\\" because its lower than Boston, its because its \\"Down Wind\\" and when you sail a mostly square rigged vessel, its really hard to go \\"Up Wind.\\" So Hodding proves that while its possible to go from Greenland to the New World, it was a pain. So any Vikings would have abandoned the effort as not being worth the trouble. Ok. But other than a vague feeling these guys should all have died at sea with their general lack of sailing or open boat skills it was a fun read. I doubt I would have gone along though had I been asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something just a bit shy of an Epic Journey","review":"I first became acquainted with the author and his quest from the earliest published excerpts in the Land's End catalogs. Crossing the ice choked Davis Straight in an open Norse boat is no easy feat and such a story well told could be a great book. Somehow the author missed the boat in this book. The development of the individual crew members never really does more than scratch the surface. The maps and photos are interesting, yet the book does not sustain one's interest. I had earlier read and highly recommend Tim Severin's The Brendan Voyage. It's the true story of the crossing of the North Atlantic in a replica leather boat in the effort to recreate the ancient Irish monks journeys from Ireland to North America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restore your health and eliminate headaches, among other things","review":"My holistic doctor recommended this to me to restore the minerals leached out of the body when sitting in front of a computer screen all day. Put a few drops in each glass of water you drink (or until you can just begin taste it) add vitamin D to your diet, and you'll feel MUCH better. I also have a friend with migraine issues and her doctor told her to take Magnesium to reduce them - it seems to be working! But, honestly, isn't this better than taking pills? You bet it is!!!

One feature I found to be interesting is the accumulation of the time you spend riding. You get the trip time plus the total time you have spent riding the bike on all trips while using this computer. Similar to the trip mileage and ODO mileage. Only complaint is about the mounting of the transmitter. Topeak gives you a single band strap which snapped when I tried to tighten it. I think it would be better to have a mounting bracket that would use 2 plastic wire ties. Had this broken at a point where there was not enough left to wrap the fork I would have had to find a whole new bracket.It's a good computer at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sellin, not enough tellin","review":"I enjoyed reading this thin slender book, although it was a bit thin on the ground as far as giving game, and then wham, \\"THE END.

Since sex is the issue here we have a right to insist on advice that comes from useful experience. Lesbian sex can never be more than mutual masturbation. Without any first-hand knowledge of penetration the authors have little to offer the hetero reader. I would look further for a good sex guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore review #1","review":"A word of advice---Ignore the first review. It was obviously written by someone looking for an easy fix to a classroom assignment. No plot? Well---I guess that's because it's a book of essays written ABOUT McCullers work. The author HATES McCullers for having written it? She didn't. It's a series of essays analyzing McCullers' work. The collection was gathered (that is edited) by Clark and Friedman. If you want critical work about McCullers instead of the ramblings of someone who obviously put no thought or knowledge into a response, get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORST BOOK IN THE WORLD","review":"NEVER EVER READ THIS BOOK!

After living in Holland for 2 years, I can't drink any other. But do not buy it from this seller. The shipping and handling charge as well as the charge for the coffee are just plain RIDICULOUS. You get a tiny little package (250 gm or about 1/2 a pound) for this price and you'll be charged nearly twice that amount just for shipping. Go to a Dutch-American website and buy it instead. There are plenty of websites with FAIR prices for 500gm with decent shipping. Of course this coffee costs more, it's imported.

In translating the story onto film, the producers have erased the political themes and have made the African background meaningless.

Sure the animal photography is good, but you can get all that and more in \\"The African Queen,\\" which at least does not trash the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the books instead","review":"This film is interesting and somewhat effective as a piece of cinema. That said, its story is so far removed from van der Post's indiosyncratic novels (upon which the film is ostensibly based) as to be almost unrecognizable. Only one connection to the two novels remains: both the film and the books are set in Africa. Beyond that, just about every other element of the books' narratives has been changed, usually so that the film follows some shallow Hollywood plotline, but at the expense of van der Post's encyclopedic knowledge and love of Bushman life and culture. As a result, the film is watchable, but its destruction of the novels is almost as complete as the razing of Hunters Drift by poachers in the film version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!

One was good - another was poorly made! Hence your chance of being a happy customer or an angry customer is 50-50!This is a typical example of this type of product being made in a half-automated factory made mostly by hand. The one with a poor quality (pictures are uploaded) had slots that were uneven in depth, the sleeves were cut in slightly different sizes, so some shelves wobbled while some were too tight to even remove as if glued on. One corner didn't align which makes this particular one too embarassing to be used in anybody's office. Probably made by someone on his/her first day on the job. The better quality one, on the other hand, was probably made by someone who had been making this a long time - very consistent through out.

Now listening to it, its still fresh got bite and attidude that very faw bands of this type has got. Its also got great tunes and punkish hooks that travel across your mind all day repeating minute by minute. It is gospel in its message but that is good as it bites against the majority way of thinking. Its intelligent and yet gets away with being edgy.In my view, I love The Sex Pistols, The Stranglers, Ian Dury and The Clash etc and this lives very well with the best of these in attitude, passion and quality.

Director Mike Judge's previous effort was a scathing indictment of corporate America where the workers are dispensible and reports have more value than the psychological well being of the employees. \\"Extract\\" is a more genial exercise whose laughs are more subtle but not less satisfying. Judge here seems to be championing family entrepreneurism where the boss has an open door policy and knows the names of his employees. This film was dumped on the market during the waning days of summer. It's almost like the studio wanted this film to fail. The studio may have treated \\"Extract\\" like a lost child but don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"This is a very well done film. Judge once again puts out a well done piece that dosen't seem to make much impact with critics and audiences. Office Space and Idiocracy are so much fun, and Extract continues that. Bateman is simply excellent in the lead role, perfect. Mila has really grown on me, she was \\"cute\\" for the 70's show, but I'm glad to see her moving up. One little nitpick I had with this was the \\"stoner\\" character. Don't know who played him, but he was too much like a skin head meth dealer, loud, obnoxious, violent, etc. Didn't seem like your friendly pot dealer dude. Good to see Affleck trying this role out, I like the job he did. So, overall, excellent film, the writing, acting, all very good. cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extract","review":"Joel, the owner of an extract manufacturing plant, constantly finds himself in precarious situations that steadily worsen by the minute. First, his soon-to-be floor manager acquires a serious injury in a machine malfunctioning accident that subsequently endangers the wellbeing of his company. Second, his personal life doesn't fair much better when he takes the advice of his bartending friend Dean during a drug-induced brainstorming session on how to test his wife's faithfulness. Finally, compounding these catastrophes is new employee Cindy, who happens to be a scam artist intent on milking the company for all its worth. Now, Joel must attempt to piece his company and his marriage back together all while trying to figure out what he's really after in life. The story is fairly simple but eventful and effective. I laughed out loud several times. The running time is at 90 minutes. It makes for a nice movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"This is just so bad. I didn't think Mike Judge was capable of this after the brilliant Office Space. Bateman plays his role well, but he is surrounded by unfunny characters weighed down with unfunny dialogue. The storyline is quite forced, and nearly every scene is uncomfortably reaching...and not making it. Affleck has never been funny, just doesn't have the timing and vibe as a comedic actor. There isn't a single character in this film that measures up to the many fine portrayals in OS, least of all the masterful performance turned in by Gary Cole as the incredibly smarmy Bill Lumbergh. Even the best moment in the movie -- the sweatpants getting tied up -- isn't as good as it is in the trailer. I don't remember laughing during Extract, I only got a few mild chuckles out of it. Judge is obviously a gifted guy, I'm hoping this effort is the exception to the rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Slow and boring.

Its not gonna top Office Space, which is my favorite, but I liked it better than Idiocracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extract is amazing like air","review":"Mike Judge is the man behind Office Space, the greatest comedy that came out of the 1990's. Jason Bateman is one of many cool stars in Extract that prod the film along into new cult status. A comedy with dark aspects and hilarious situations. Did I mention Mila Kunis? Or Gene Simmons? J.K Simmons - no relation, also makes his presence known.

I find this CD very satisfying in terms of it's more modern funk, soul and pop sounds.Laura's slap style electric bass playing and arranging on numerous tunes is fluid and rapid, and nothing close to traditional sounding (unless your tradition is Bootsy Collins, Sly Stone or Victor Wooten). And her voice is really interesting, sweet and unclassifiable.. forget Amazon's reviewer's comparison to Tracy Chapman or Odetta, as Laura's register is much higher and her inflections much less gospel/folk-like. Also, her lyrics on \\"Bad Feeling\\" and elsewhere are really funny, and not very \\"traditional\\".

Rather than be repetitive, I'll just give one more reason to buy this album: my favorite, the fantastic and unique Louisiana swamp infused/tribal beat/country yodel song 'Capricorn & Hominy'.

Laura Love's voice resonates with deep, grounded, beautiful clarity which unknowingly draws you into her songs. This album keeps you listening, as the songs range in variety and beat. It's hard to describe the general tone of the album, as her songs vary. I'd say there's a mix of bluegrass, folk, and one song even borders on celtic/folk. It's just really neat, foot-tapping music.

I guess if you like the whole Creed sound then they might be good, but I never liked Creed. 12 Stones just has a weak rock sound that never catches me and pulls me into the music.

To us, music is lifeblood so perhaps you can understand my disappointment when I heard 12 Stones new release, Potter's Field. I listen to their debut album from start to finish often and I felt they had something that set them aside from the rest of the bands pouring from the woodwork these last few years. The new release has not proved it to me. I find it mostly uninspired, not consistently rhythmic and I personally like to hear the singing over the guitar. I have listened to this CD continually and it has not grown on me and probably won't. If I was pressed to, I'd select The Last Song, track 2, Far Away, track 3, Bitter, track 6, and Stay, track 9... to download. I really would not suggest spending good money on the CD unless you're simply a die-hard fan who'll buy anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not the same","review":"12 Stones' debut album is my favorite ever.

They are better than 50% of the bands on radio today. Good work guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 Stones Albums are both excellent","review":"I own both 12 Stones CD's and they are fantastic. The way they blend guitar and drums is incredible and Paul McCoy's vocals are reminiscent of a mixture of early Scott Weiland from when he was with Stone Temple Pilots, and early Soundgarden, with the emotional intensity of Kurt Cobain when he sings.This is a band who is coming of age musically, Photograph is excellent but hands down my favorite songs by them are Faded Away and Eric's Song... just great stuff!Ana"},{"rating":"1","title":"The real victim is the reader!","review":"There is no way to tell if this book is any good because it is written with such complicated language that it is incomprehensible. We would be greatly served by Dr. Mercadante if she were to write on the same topic in language that at least a college graduate could understand. I couldn't help wondering whom Dr. Mercadante was trying to impress in choosing her words; I say this because the book is advertised for everyone, including the layman.

I dropped the original and it broke in half. I was very surprised but decided to try this one. Although I have not used it yet, on first observation I am very impressed. The small tip that drills the pilot hole for the screw is very sharp. It is in the shape of a V with each tip of the V sharpened to a point where I am sure it would actually cut you if you were not careful. Quite a change from the original. The shaft that slides into the drill chuck has flattened sides to lock in better. The only question I have is why does it have a left hand twist? It must have something to do with stepping on the patten rights of the original. Other than having to run my drill in reverse I am sure I will be very happy with this one. Hopefully it will not break in half if I drop it.

There is a beauty here in the Boolean expressions that is sadly not appreciated by enough programmers.Along the way, Brown explains Karnaugh maps to good detail.

Picketers surrounded cinemas protesting it, decrying the morals-corrupting influence of depraved \\"Western values\\". Actually the sex scene is extremely tame by American standards. What made this film truly revolutionary was the heretofore prohibited portrayal of toxic family life, including grinding poverty, alcoholism, domestic violence, despair, and youthful rebellion. The film may be ground-breaking, but it is also ear-splitting in its stridency. None of the characters are likable enough to care about what happens to them. As other reviewers have mentioned, the acting is superb. The film accomplishes its goal, but it is enough to see it just once."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will see a side of Russia you won't see on Television","review":"If you were around prior to the fall of the Soviet Union them you may remember how eastern European and Russian women were depicted. The image of the East German female weightlifter who would put the Rock or Arnold Schwarzenegger to shame comes to mine.What made this movie interesting is that it was one of the first times where you could see Soviet women depicted as women, as well as the crushing poverty that many still face in the Former Soviet Union.If you are considering meeting and dating foreign women online then this is a recommended film for you. Not so much as a cautionary talk but rather as an eye opener.Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Milestone of Perestroyka","review":"I've seen this film long ago in the former Soviet Union when first video-clubs were officially opened. People wathed this poor quality tape about SU everyday life and at first so close the sexual act with Natalya Negoda as Little Vera in soviet film was shown. It is hard to imagine how great was the influence of this one scene to youth in country where \\"sex was not at all\\".

After the movie, the same people who thought they'd be able to see explicit sex scenes ended up sitting around the kitchen table discussing the movie over vodka and pickles as if it were an obscure painting of the Peter and Paul Fortress.Whatever, the movie gave me, as a United States citizen, an insight on Russian family, lifestyle, fears and hopes. To many Russians, it seems they consider the film effluvium to be dismissed as they are probably used to so much state-sponsored affect flotsam and jetsam. But to some of us \\"uneducated\\", it was enlightening and funny/ironic toward the end, with that \\"HAAA! HAAA!\\" attempt at mental escape.Not to mention, Natalya Negoda is hot!

Assembly is fairly simple if you've worked with a table saw before, but it's helpful to have another pair of hands available to hold everything in place while you're making adjustments.Just make sure you spray the table surface a couple of times with WD40, let it sit for a few minutes, and wipe off the factory wax coat.

I thought that the stories would be global and realistic stories about people and life. I was wrong. The stories are certainly global, and the author describes beautifully each city in the book with intimate knowledge, but the collection of stories are more like fairy tales and fantasies. I did not fully understand many of the stories, but the book kept me reading nonetheless. Overall, it was not a bad book, just different.

That's fine in small doses but it doesn't add much to understanding characters or life in general. The \\"plot\\" device of 13 people stranded in an airport could have been something interesting but there is only one of the passengers who is given any identity at all so, an interesting situation is wasted and we know nothing of the people who are telling these stories.

However, don't make the mistake that I made in buying the Passport DVD \\"Plan 9\\" with the 40 minute Ed Wood story. The basic reason is that in this version you will spot the capital letters PIP stamped in the lower right hand corner in every shot. Unlike some people, I don't have to have the initials of the company that produced the DVD staring me in the face when I'm watching it. You cannot remove these initials.

I just wanted to say that Lugosi is not in this movie so don't buy it expecting to see him. He has a couple of clips (well, actually you only see his eyes) but my teacher told us that he died two days into filming so they got another guy, supposably director Ed Woods' doctor, to fill the role.

Most of the time, bad movies are pretty funny. But Plan 9 goes beyond bad/funny into the realm of pain, which also includes long dental surgery, torture, and startvation. Don't get this movie, not even to see how bad it is, it's not worth it. It's funny at first, but it drags on, and on, and on. I gave up after 2 and 1/2 hours!

Wood Jr. was a bad filmmaker. And this is a bad movie. It is so bad it's entertaining and fun to see. I had quite \`high' expectations on this movie, because I had heard so much about it, about how bad and funny it was. And so it was, but maybe not really as funny as I thought it would be. But it is worth seeing. I love the bad actors and the vampire girl, played by Vampira (aka Maila Nurmi). And all the plot holes. But what really makes it so bad, is that it really is serious. I think Ed Wood really had a message he wanted to tell with the movie. I think he wanted to tell us to be careful and not push science to a level where we create things we can't handle and that can be dangerous to us.I'm not really sure how to rate this movie. The filmmaking is worth one point out of five, but the entertainment is, I guess, worth a four.

All things considered, its really not so bad.The REALLY terrible films are movies in which the star's Diet Coke requirements are greater than the budget of PLAN 9; movies that cost millions and yet deliver nothing in the way of good direction, acting and production. Is PLAN 9 really worse than DEATH BECOMES HER or ISHTAR or Barbra Streisand in anything? Taking the cost and talent factors into account , I'd say PLAN 9 comes off looking like King Lear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen Up","review":"While the movie is obviously bad, it is also incredibly funny and just entertaining to watch. However, I have to point out some things that are still said by people and reviewers. Yes, this is supposed to be the worst movie ever made. What is ridiculous are people and reviewers who write reviews spouting this and condemning it. Bad movie?. Of course it is!. That's why it's famous. That's why it loved by people. Don't go and write a review saying what trip it is. Everyone has known this for the last 40 some years. Why do you think people see it?. What do you think most people say about it and already know about it?. We know this, so keep your snide remarks to yourself because they were already dated since the 50's."},{"rating":"1","title":"...but five-star in terms of entertainment value","review":"I've read the other reviews, and none can completely capture the essence of \\"Plan 9.\\" If you have not yet seen this movie, there is no adequate way to describe the numerous engaging faux-pas and blunders that make us all into Ed Wood Jr. fans.

But that's why we all watch it, isn't it?It is indeed terrible, full of blatantly incorrect \\"scientific\\" information. It is worth seeing just for the speeches towards the end - completely hysterical!However, I would like to point out that the *documentary* of Plan 9, which is included in this version, is at least as poorly made a film as Plan 9 itself. The documentary is a farce.

It really does have tinfoil saucers on strings burning and stock footage galore. Everything about this film is horribly done, from the alien circus costumes, really bad terrible effects that make sets made from Lego child building blocks Oscar worthy, really bad editing where characters in one position are in a totally different one for the next cut, dead leads that are replaced by extras who hold up a cape over their face to hide themselves, the brainless story that makes no sense, to the Solaronite Bomb speech that should go down in film dialogue history for being so mad that it could be true.Critics panned it and couldn't believe how something this bad could be made. Tim Burton filmed the Ed Wood director biopic for good reason. You have never seen anything like it before and should feel grateful that you never did. Like I said, it's so bad it's good.

Don't bother watching it alone-- you need to be with family and friends, and challenge each other to identify bizarre dialogue, ridiculous \\"plot\\" twists, monumental errors in consistency (the same scene will switch from darkness to light several times, to cite but one example), and spectacularly inept special effects.

In this movie you have my fellow Hungarian countryman Bela Lugosi who women used to swoon over when he played Dracula and the incredibly HOT Vampira. A lot of this movie is set in a cemetary which is obligatory for any good Horror Film. If given the choice I would rather watch this movie than try to read one of Stephen King's bloated , overwritten books. I keep on getting abusive Emails about my reviews. One of them is from an illiterate guy who thinks that Stephen King is \\"God\\", another is a fan of the Pet Shop Boys and I have one woman writing to me who is in love with David Koresh.

Nowhere else will you see sheriffs (and their deputies) scratching their heads with their pistol barrels, or flying saucers that wobble so violently that their occupants must be jellied, or hear such inept dialogue (\\"There's one thing for certain, and that's that someone murdered the sheriff, and someone is responsible\\". And that's one of the *better* lines...)But the real reason to see this DVD is the \\"Flying Saucers Over Hollywood\\" - a gem in it's own right!

You'll even invite your friends over to bask in it's stupidity. The highlights of this film are, of course, the stringed pie-plates (or hub-caps, depending on who you ask) serving as flying saucers, swinging back and forth over a fake landscape; Big ol' Tor Johnson, with Orphan Annie contacts, struggling to climb out of a grave, knocking over a cardboard tombstone in the process; and thespian ham Dudley Manlove, as lead alien Eros (!), having a royal hissy fit at the ignorant Earthmen (\\"Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!\\"). I must admit though, the sight of Vampira advancing towards the camera is a little creepy, even for this low-budget laugher.

Just to point out a few of the copious instances of crap, there are: gravestones made out of cardboard that one of the main characters keep knocking over, spaceships made of two pie tins glued together, acting that rivals that of a gradeschool drama troupe, and some corny plot about aliens wanting to take over the earth by resurrecting the recently dead to make a zombie horde of a whopping two.

The acting, story, scenery, special effects, and costumes were terrible. The dialogue was even worse. The lighting was even worse than that. Surprise, surprise, the makeup was good. No other redeeming qualities in this thing except that it's SO bad, you feel sorry for the director and for some of the actors if these were the best roles they could get.

If you watch the interviews which come right after the film, it becomes less awful when you realize Ed Wood made a halfway decent film with what little he had to work with. The Blair Witch kids did as much forty years later, but nobody laughed at THEM.

Interesting mini stories through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of interesting stories","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book. It is filled with stories of many different types of inmates. It would have been nice if the author had added more material on how he specifically avoided trouble with other inmates. He talks about his approach and philosophy, but not about specific potentially dangerous interactions he has had with others. It is difficult to believe that no other prisoner \\"tested\\" him, \\"disrespected\\" him, tried to assault him, etc. If he encountered these situations, then how did he deal with them without getting into trouble with corrections officers and also without being perceived as \\"weak\\"? On day 1, did he simply help an important inmate with paperwork, and then have an easy time with other inmates from then on? He tells stories of how other new inmates had to deal with difficult inmates - I wish he were more specific about his. Other than that, it is a well written book and an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bottom line...","review":"Exceptionally well written book. As an educator, I found it disturbing to learn that those who truly want to change their lives are not given opportunities. I suppose the justice system has been taken for a ride by so many that they become numb to the feelings of all once behind bars. I have always been a firm believer in once you do the crime, you must do the time. My belief on that hasn't changed even after reading the book. Our lives are all about choices. Unfortunately, you will pay for the rest of your life for the crime, no matter how big or small.The content of this book I believe to be very true. I have stepped inside a maximum security prison one time, as a criminal justice student and the day to day life Santos wrote about, does not surprise me one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"Well, I ended up skipping pages sometimes. It could have been a much better book. I think the writer should have wrote more about his own experiences, feelings and such. I was glad to get to the end of the book, although, I have to say that by the end of the book I really liked the guy.He is serving a sentence that is much too harsh for his crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many better books out there","review":"I have read many, many books about prison, prisoners, prison life, not to mention some friends that I have in prison including a lifer or two. This is my least favorite book so far. I think the writer is trying to prove something about himself and goes way overboard with it. He writes things like \\"...each man lives by his reputation alone, not by meritorious accomplishments\\" wtf? I was bored from the first chapter and I'm still bored in the 7th. If you've ever watched \\"lockup, lockup raw, or lockup extended stay\\" then you already know all the stuff in this book. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"A mixture of murder mystery, humor, fantasy, and philosophy. Heck, I don't even like half those genres and I thought this book was fantastic. I had never read any Terry Pratchett novels before this book, and not only did I have no trouble getting into the story and understanding it, but I've been hooked ever since. Incredibly well-done - in the complexity and interest of the plot, the character development, the quirky and often subtle use of humor, and the deeper and more serious topics it periodically touches on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Further proof of Pratchett's brilliance","review":"Many others have gone on about how funny Pratchett's work is. Certainly, this is true, his work is some of the best comedy in existence, and this book is no exception. But his humour should not overshadow the other aspect of pratchett's writing; his brilliance. This book isn't just great comedy, if you look close you'll also notice that he has created an excellent detective novel, in fact I'd put this on a level with any agatha christie or sherlock holmes book any day, if not higher, i think Pratchett does better work in areas like character developement and action.The man is more that just a funny writer, he has range and depth. I believe that while he certainly has single, distinctive style, he is capable of excelling in any genre he should choose to write in, God help us all if he ever decides to write a strictly \\"serious\\" novel, although if you strip away the jokes from this or many of his other books, you'll see that he already has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, entertaining and well, enjoyable...","review":"I liked this book. When I first picked it up, I knew pretty much what I wanted. I was looking for a nice Vimes episode, something to fill up the boring hours in between an otherwise pretty dull life(in otherwords, holiday time). The first couple of pages didn\`t seem so engrossing, but as the story progresses, it becomes more and more addictive. On top of that cunning old Pratchett seems to have a dislike of chapters, and when you see only four small and insignifigant asterisks seperating you from the next scene, it\`s like a heroine addict sitting and staring at a loaded syringe(no I have had no such experience). The plot is intriguing, with a murderer walking (or stomping) free on the streets of Ankh Morpork, Vetinari on the verge of death(amazing, huh?) and Commander Samuel Vimes on the loose, trying to find the questions to answers which he knows are floating around soomewhere. For Terry Pratchett(especially Vimes)fans, this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can you say...","review":"It is a Terry Pratchett novel: Duh, It has to be uncommonly humorous.

Whether it's Vimes, with his dogged determination to see justice served or Carrot, a true believer in the good in all (Sometimes they just need some help finding it and Carrot is always there with a helping hand and a werewolf girlfriend.), these characters seem to bring out the best in Pratchett. This one introduces a dwarf named Littlebottom who has been asked to leave the Guild of Alchemists and who is now brought in by Vimes to discover what's behind the white substance at the scene of a few murders and what's killing Lord Vetinari. With Littlebottom hiding a secret as well, this proves to be a great mix of an interesting mystery, a discussion on the nature of religion and free will and...golems.

After reading that one you'd have to progress to \\"Men At Arms.\\" Then you can get around to \\"Feet of Clay.\\" I know it's unusual to be assigned homework before you read a book, but believe me, it'll be worth it. \\"Feet of Clay\\" is another highly enjoyable book in the City Watch series. You'll find yourself laughing out loudly with every footnote, one-liner, and inside joke. Get these three books right away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true \\"theatre of the mind\\" comedic listening experience.","review":"Terry Pratchett is the funniest writer working in science fiction and fantasy today! Feet Of Clay is one of his best comedic fantasies and has been wonderfully translated into an audiobook \\"theater of the mind\\" experience complete with golems, dwarves, a werewolf suffering from Pre-Lunar Tension, and more. With its manifold textured plot and memorable characters, Pratchett again demonstrates his singular wit and whimsey, as well as a gift for satire that is second to none! Nigel Planer's splendid narrative skills does full and complete justice to Pratchett's unique abilities to craft and spin a yarn that leaves a smile in the mind long after the book done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but packed with things to think about.","review":"I really loved this book, and it was really nice to find out that I'm not the world's only vegetarian werewolf.

What are you waiting for?If you have been reading Discworlds novels before, don't waste your time with my opinion, just go get it!This is definitely one of the best books P. ever did.

The Scorpions reveal their pure rock energy and their love of music is shown. This is the release that helped the Scorpions get recognition in the US. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to feel their heart race and hear guitars chase the emotions of Klaus' voice and the words he is singing. I also recommend looking over albums that were previously released and definitely overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock you like a hurricane","review":"With their 1983 release \\"Love at First Sting\\" the German metal band The Scorpions toned down a bit from their early RCA recordings and added more pop to the mix. Love at First Sting came along at the time when hardrock and pop metal began ruling the charts. The album is full of rockers, with a couple of ballads thrown in. Songs like \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" cemented the Scorpions legacy, guarnteeing the Scorpions would be rememberd over twenty years after the release of one of their best albums.Besides \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\", other highlights include Big City Nights, Coming Home, and Still Loving You. If you're a fan of the 80's popmetal and hardrock, Love at First Sting belongs in your music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Improvement","review":"This remaster is definitely worth picking up. A huge improvement over Deadly Sting. All the songs have an increase in sound quality, in all areas. The only flaw is some static, which is pretty much in the same places as on Deadly Sting. Great liner notes too, talking about problems in the band at the time, the demands of the producer, and opposition to digital recording. If you've never had this album before, this is the version to buy for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scorpions rock you like a hurricane","review":"\\"Love at first sting\\" was Scorpions most commercial album, at least up till the time for its release. Maybe it's also their best album ever, besides \\"Animal magnetism\\" and \\"Blackout\\". The songs are very strong - catchy and melodic but still guitar driven. Klaus Maine has a good voice and Rudolf Schenker is clearly a very talented songwriter. There's just one or two tracks that don't reach the same height as the rest. So, turn up the volume and prepare yourself for a pleasant time with quality rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music, Bad Print","review":"I am an old Scorpions fan, and always considered \\"Love At Firts Sting\\" one of their best albums of latter era.

How great was my disappointment wheh I have heard this CD! The quality is quite similair to what I had on my old tape - low record level, high frequencies are not audible. In short - you've got nothing of Mattias Jabs and Rudy Schenker guitars, quite a little of Klaus Meine voice, which was good back then.I've heard Scorpions live this summer on private concert in Moscow: they performed mostly the songs from this album, and even given all those years passed, they sounded better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scorpions rock","review":"First off this album is great and the guitar work on it is amesome and klaus singing is amazing rudolf schenker is a amazing rhythm guitarists and mathias jabbs is amazing at lead so is uli jon roth which was the scorpions lead guitarists in the 70s their early work anyways dont pass this album up get it now also rudolf schenker is the brother of UFO AND MSG GUITARIST MICHEAL SCHENKER I THINK ALL OF THE SCORPS ALBUMS ARE GREAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"You either love.......","review":"Hard scorps, or pop scorps.

The right leg gets a bit of a workout; the left is completely forgotten. That's poor quality control in my book and I was very disappointed.So, if you're looking for something very easy and don't mind stopping and rewinding the tape during the second segment - enjoy.

The book's policy relevance is global and has only increased in the years since Sclar wrote it. Armed with a solid body of evidence, Sclar confronts and debunks the preposterous, faith-based propaganda with which proponents of privatisation impose market discipline on public services. Another wonderful thing is that Sclar writes in plain English rather than in the verbose, distracting, abstract dialect that many scholars tend to use, so Sclar's points are clear, powerful, and comprehensible to the general public. This book is a tremendous asset for those who advocate public control and provision of essential services."},{"rating":"2","title":"great kit!","review":"This is a great kit.

Present at the creation of The Paris Reivew in 1953, twenty years earlier, when he was a close friend of Peter Matthiessen, Mathews has, since 2003, been the Paris editor of The Paris Review. Matthiessen was in C.I.A. and used The Paris Review as his cover. The Paris Review was funded entirely by C.I.A., according to Matthiessen, who related this to his friend, novelist John Sherry. It is fascinating to see all the literary journals and book reviewers falling all over themselves to praise Mathews as a great avant garde writer who is really joking about the C.I.A. connection.

However it was WORTH EVERY PENNY when at one point we were hiking through the rainforest, it was hot and muggy and I used this little guide as a fan! It's sturdy construction made it perfect. It was a life saver! Honestly, I was so glad I had ordered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too skimpy to be useful","review":"This is effectively a foldout brochure (laminated) with only a few animals/birds, and very little information.

For die-hard bird fans, you'll need the BIG Birds of Costa Rica book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither very complete nor very well illustrated","review":"This fold-out pamphlet offers tiny pictures, scant details and more birds than anything else. It also emphasizes what tourists want to see (including very rare species) at the expense of what they are likely to see, so calling it a guide to \\"familiar species\\" is rather optimistic. This publication is not really very useful. Better to have separate guides: one for birds (there's one available in this same series, but I'd recommend a proper field guide to Costa Rica's 900+ species of birds) and one or more higher-quality, expanded guides covering other wildlife (mammals, reptiles, amphibians, insects)."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly unhelpful, full of contradictions","review":"This books gets 2 stars rather than 1 since it does provide some summarization of the various eastern and western views regarding death and eternal life.The author's own viewpoint is poorly argued. For example, Hick suggests that the traditional Christian doctrine of the immortality of the soul is untenable due to the emergence of the scientific mind. Hick suggests that anything which cannot be demonstrated as being in accordance with empirical science should be discarded. However, Hick then goes on to say that ESP, clairavoyance (sp?), and other psychic nad paranormal phenomena should be counted as reliable evidence for the existence of life after death (I wonder what empirical scientists would say about this). The author then turns to the eastern religions and panentheism to provide a picture of what eternal life may be like (but without any convincing arguments). On the whole, I think that this book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find this book!","review":"This is the absolute best book for a new (and even a seasoned) manager. It is no nonsense and helpful, without being wordy and boring. The bullet point format makes learning and using new skills easy. The chapters are a great reference for every day management issues ranging from hiring to smoking. It is out of print, but worth your time if you can find this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing","review":"The cover of this book gave me reason to expect that it would focus on the story of a family afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and the transmission of the disease through the generations. Instead, the majority of the book reads like a gigantic journal article. The author (a doctor) throws in a mere smattering of human interest here and there, but it's simply not enough to make the story interesting.

A strong double feature from Marengo and actually their first but not last as they have many now available and gearing up to release more double features soon.If you like 'B' drive-in horror movies, their \\"Attack of the Giant Leeches\\" is also the best quality DVD print around.

However, if you are new, these tapes are great. The instructors are down to earth and their cueing is excellent. They are very thorough in showing the proper form in which to do the poses. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is there is some editting which is obvious, but not disruptive to the practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"What a joke! I don't mind that this workout has no chance of giving me a six-pack -- that's not the point of yoga -- but I was expecting it to work out my abs at least a little. This is a total waste of time. The first 20-minute \\"workout\\" is totally useless; the second makes you work a tad harder, but still not enough to warrant the ($$$) this DVD cost. After years of daily use, maybe you stand some chance of toning your mid section with this tape, but if you're looking to see an improvement in this lifetime, go another route. People praise it for being easy; of course it's easy! It's not working! I'm trying Pilates next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a workout","review":"If you are interested in this DVD you should check it out at the library, rent it or borrow a copy. It's not much of a workout or even a good yoga session. It's 2-20 minute sections, but there is no challenge and it's rushed. I would recommend Rodney Yee - Abs for Beginners instead of this one. I have a decent library of yoga/pilates DVDs/VHS and this one ranks lowest."},{"rating":"2","title":"I prefer the second program","review":"Compared to power yoga routines I'm used to, these are shorter and easier workouts, but not necessarily worse. More time is spent on the ground, though I didn't really feel the ab emphasis that I expected. In fact, I found both programs more relaxing than strenuous. I prefer the second program, finding it somewhat more challenging. In the first session, Al talks more than Jennifer does in the second, which distracts from the postures for me. Maybe it's just me, but tabletop pose was hard on my shoulders."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor to average","review":"I found this tape extremely boring.

The entire book was torn away from the hard cover and all of the pages were bent like it had been thrown. I'm sure that, at least, the latter part was due to the under packaging of the product.

The stories are dated now, being set in a 1950s prep school, but they remain hilarious. This series should really be much better known.In this book, Jennings keeps a diary, whilst all kinds of hilarious things happen around him. The author shows his understanding of boys in showing how none of the diary entries really bring out the drama of the school term! Indeed many entries are impenetrable without some knowledge of the events described.Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK","review":"This is a profoundly moving and important book, and I cannot recommend it too highly.

They might have gotten a little too bluesy for mainstream hairband fans near the end, but \\"Heartbreak Station\\" gave these guys some credit as a legitimate rock n' roll band. Besides, Led Zeppelin, who was looked upon as gods in the heyday of hair, are also considered a blues act.Anyway, this album is a nice addition to anyone's 80's rocker collection. \\"Shake Me,\\" \\"Nobody's Fool\\" and \\"Shelter Me\\" are all here.

The Solar Eclipse of the century has occurred, and with it came the Dead Moon Circus.

There are only two bad things about this book: It's over too fast, and you have to wait for _days_ that seem like _years_ for the next book. But don't take that the wrong way! It _is_ a good book! The only thing in the whole series I don't really get is Zircon, the snail lady's(Zirconia, the Soul Hermit) little eyeball with wings. But, hey, who cares?! You've got romance, action, some comedy, myths, magic, and extra short stories. Naoko Takeuchi, as far as I know, is the woman who created the timeless magical girl series.

Better than they did on the show anyway! It's nice to see the return of the outer shenti's, and the SMSS manga really develops Chibi-Usa's personality, since she is more or less the star of this series.

The drawings are so beautiful, and I'm glad they kept Sailor Pluto's name as Setsuna. You have to know what's going on in the series if you read it, but it's an amazing story still the same, and even the villains are awesome.

From about the half-way mark, to where I quit (about page 240 out of 300+), it's all literary/poetry criticism, references to countless Russian authors, various philosophers, etc. It's like a boring dream where you drag on and on from boring meaningless sequence to boring meaningless sequence, always wondering if it's the narrative of the main character's book, or Nabakov. This was just too much.It might be fine if you're a Russian literary historian, but for regular folks, I just can't recommend this one.

Also a lot of characters in the actual series we love make an appearance as an \\"alternate\\" version in our world. The movie also made it's own opening and ending which i thought was very cool. Al is trying to find Ed after they got separated and is in his human form now ( and never looked better i might add). There's also some new characters, the main one being a young gypsy girl named Noah.

I must admit, it doesn't have the perfectly wrapped happy ending that I hoped for - but that's part of the whole point. The world isn't perfect (something that both Ed and Al comment on) and the resolution of their story lines isn't immediately perfect, but after thinking about it, there was no better resolution.I wish there would have been a little less of the \\"set up\\" and a lot more \\"alchemy action\\" but still, a very enjoyable movie overall.

From the pocketwatch to clothing to even seeing a bootleg version of this movie about 11 months ago. I must say that I was disappointed. The ending of the movie ruined the WHOLE FMA series for me. I don't want to put in any spoilers (and I won't) but the entire movie was good up until that ending. It's happy in a sense but just wrong, way off track, and bad for the cannon.Now, leading up to the ending, this movie is pretty good. The story line of Ed was boring in parts but was 'creative'. It was really fun seeing Al in human form! Took a bit to get used to but when he fights, he fights better than Ed in the series.I adored this show. But if I had my way, I'd go back in time and not watch it. I'd rather have it end as it did in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preview","review":"I got to watch the English dubbed version of the Japanese Movie. This ought to be a nice continuation of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they do this????","review":"Why didn't they release this version the same time as the non-limited edition? I just bought the original movie release. If I had known about this upcoming version, I might have waited.It's bad enough that many movies get re-released a ridiculous number of times. But to sneak this in for a first-time release is just wrong. Anime doesn't get the kind of free media coverage as mainstream titles, it's wrong to expect that fans are all going to do the extensive research necessary to find out pre-release dates for curveballs like this.It's time to stop marketing DVD product with the assumption that everyone is rich and doesn't think about how many copies of the same title it is sane to own.BTW, the movie is very good but not a perfect ending to the story. For the most part it rose above the level of extended TV episode, but FMA's standards for \\"TV episode\\" were high to begin with.I hope there's more to come. And that it's marketed better when it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see movie!","review":"I haven't watch it yet but I order it and going 2 be getting it in 2 week or so. I got hooemistk up with the show when my friend show my. You must watch FullMetal Alchemist episode 1-51 first before watching this movie so you wont be confused. I love love the show and was so sad at the ending of episode 51. If you love anime you would really love this. There is 4 part to the whole show. First watch FullMetal Alchemist episode 1-51. Than if you really love that the next part is to watch this movie The Conqueror of Shamballa. After that there is other season: FullMetal Alchemist: Botherhood. Than there is the last movie The Sacred Star of Milo. You won't regret watching those!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost","review":"It is usually a bad sign when there is a guide included to explain the movie makers reasons for making the movie and to explain the lesson they want to teach. The movie does give you a conclusion for the anime. There is little to laugh at in this movie, the directors are to focused on making their point. They have decided to make the anime and movie more \\"real\\" than the manga and as such have lost the light hearted humor and in their attempts to be \\"realistic\\" have created inconsistancies that can not be explained.The music and animation are excellent.

The worlds depicted, the graphics, everything is just so amazing and is the most intriguing part of the FMA series.

Shipped fast and wasn't expensive. Thanx Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the FMA story...","review":"FMA was the first anime I ever watched and I loved every minute of it. The story is complex and emotionally engaging with lots of twists and turns that keep you watching. This movie is a great addition for those seeking answers to some of the unanswered questions in the series or if you want a little more \\"closure\\" to the story line. In my opinion the movie did a great job at both. The blu-ray quality was great and it has lots of extras! I recommend it for any FMA fan.

I was very satisfied with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL end to a great series","review":"After such a great series, I had high expectations for this movie, and it failed them all. All of the build up of the series came to naught, and all of the groundwork laid for the science of alchemy was ignored.

I honestly think if you are a true die hard fan of the series, there isn't much to like in this movie. There is zero character development of the villain. Envy is a dragon wtf? All principles of alchemy are ignored. What a joke. I have no idea how people rate this movie 5 stars? I can only think that half of them haven't watched the series or something. HUGE disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending to a great series","review":"To be brief, Fullmetal Alchemist the movie is all anyone could hope for in an ending to this great series. Most anime seems to end abruptly or fizzle out, but not fullmetal.I wont go into detail as not to spoil the film but if you liked the series and were left hanging by its end, this movie will set everything right.The only remotely bad thing I can say about this film is that because it is basically an ending to the series, it does not really stand up well on its own. If you haven't watched the series then there will be alot that you dont understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid ending of a GREAT anime series","review":"The Conqueror of Shamballa is the final installment of the Full Metal Alchemist series, and takes up where Ed has been trapped in pre-World War II Germany. Without giving away the details of the movie, I will say this movie only earned 4 stars, because I expected the movie to resolve the issue of the humunculi and scar, and it BARELY touches those two topics it was such a small segment of the story. I was surprised even by the handling of Ed and Al's father...it was a very shallow ending. I think they spent so much time setting up the story about the rise of Hitler, they missed a great opportunity to delve into the wonderful story they had already created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good! But should have been a 3rd season instead of a movie","review":"After watching the first 2 seasons and seeing how they ended, I was dying to see the movie and find out how it all really plays out. The movie was really good, except it moved way too fast. I honestly believe that this shouldn't have been made as a movie. I think this should have been spread out over a 3rd season because the movie covers so much in just a few hours and you feel like so many things were just rushed through too quickly. It's still a great movie though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See","review":"If you are a fan of the Fullmetal series, then you'll definatly enjoy the movie.

The buttons are tiny and challenging to manipulate.Worst of all - his reception is TERRIBLE! When I call him I frequently get his voice mail. His phone frequently will not get a signal. While this could be due to his location, I've held his phone in one hand, and my phone in the other hand. My phone acquires the network without trouble; his phone usually will not. He formerly had Tracfone and had much better reception with a Nokia 1100. I think his 6030 may be defective, and I urge him to return it for a different unit, but he doesn't have his receipt any longer, so he's worried about trying.It's too bad he didn't sign up when they were still using the 6010."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ek Tha Tiger","review":"I was a great story line.

Still, Salman was the big draw for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my all time favorite romance","review":"Kate Hathaway is one of the best in really making her characters seem like real people.

They also do not do as good a job as Lillias in describing the movements so that you need not try to watch the screen while doing the postures. Some of the postures are helpful, but you need experience and some review of the tape before you can perform the sequence easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"... - I gave this away after a month, although I had little previous yoga instruction. If you do this once or twice, you won't want to do it again. The length (only 20 min) is too short to provide a \\"power yoga\\" practice, and the segments are too disjointed to combine into one longer workout. I found Al's instruction to be inoffensive, but Lisa's tone of voice is annoying and condescending, and I've deliberately avoided the other Yoga Zone titles with her as the instructor.For someone who already has some familiarity with yoga looking for an introduction to power yoga, I highly recommend David Swenson's Short Forms also available from Amazon. His practice is based on the classical Ashtanga style from which power yoga is derived, and it includes a beginning 30 min practice, a longer and more advanced 45 min practice, and a short 15 min practice along with a guided relaxation. His tape has plenty of room for growth, and it may prove to be a staple - it definitely has for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"When I read the title \\"Power Yoga\\" I assumed that I'd be getting an intense workout.

You also get a good typical Scorpions ballad in \\"When the smoke goes down\\" (a formula the band used several times later).

Among those, this stands out for being particularly vapid. The conceit of being a work of fiction that teaches allows the authors to ignore the need for research or data. The fictional account also allows them to avoid taking any repsonsibility for presenting alternate viewpoints or expressing doubt.Most management books have a theme that could have been confined to a ten page article, which the authors instead run out to 200 pages to make a book. In this case, the messages of \\"more to life than work\\" and \\"treat employees with respect\\" would have better been presented as a five paragraph essay.Nice cover photo of the woods though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book Emphasizing Time Series","review":"This book contains one of the clearest discussions of the CAPM model that I have found anywhere.

That being said, it definitely made me switch to the Hanafi madhab. Although many of the rulings of the schools are similar, it is very apparent when reading the manual that Shafi fiqh is easily one of the most conservative of schools. I still respect the school, but there are certain elements of Shafi fiqh that I just have to disagree with (such as the ruling that one can wage jihad simply to eliminate disbelief from a land--this is contrary to all other madhabs views on when one can wage jihad).Another thing to remember: this is a primary text, a foundation for Shafi fiqh if you will.

Meaning it was written in mind for students just out of high school, adult learning and where English is a second language. The main topics are covered for A&P, but it distinctly lacks detail. What I mean by that is, it does a good job covering anatomy (the pictures are really nice), but the physiology aspects of the human body is not covered very well. For example, Kreb's cycle in Herlihy's book is a one sentence mention. It's not even discussed. The book just doesn't compare to Elaine Marieb's Human Anatomy & Physiology edition.

Until I got to know Ridillo and their music I was convinced that I didn't like funky music. What I like most, is the sexy voice of the vocalist, chorus etc. There isn't a single boring song in the ablum. You haven't heard Funk music until you've heard it come from Ridillo.

The way in which it is putting individuals in charge is by allowing them to maximize off the potential of writing books of how everyone else can become \\"in charge\\". This book is typical of the trite nonsense sputtered by those who would like to lead unsuspecting consumers, into believing, that there is in fact a key for understanding the world and getting what you want out of it. There is no such key. This understanding is much harder to derive than simply reading rubbish of this sort.

I was expecting them to take up the palm of my hand by the size of them in the photos. They are only approximately 1/2 ounce according to the packaging, and about the size of a golf ball. $8.00 for half an ounce of perfume is ridiculous, not to mention the fact that they overcharge for their shipping on top of that.

If you have seen the movies then you will recognize certain aspects of the show as the movies were just made from certain episodes (or vice versa, I am not sure). Shadow Skill is a great series for those who love martial arts mania. By this I mean the very unrealistic style of martial arts which is a common element of many anime. The story follows Elly Ragu and her adoptive younger brother Gou Ban and is primarily about Gou's growth as a warrior.I highly recomend this series to anyone who loves anime or not-so realistic martial arts flicks.

If your printing envelopes, you can easily get 500+ envelopes out of 1 set of cartridges, and you can print ALL 500 in about 15 to 20 minutes.

Right now this her her favorite one. This video contains singing, drawing, and telephones.

It uses classic Sesame Street music like, \\"Rubber Duckie\\" and \\"Sing, sing a song.\\" Another great part is that when the audience is asked, \\"Do pineapples sing?\\" the background music is from the TV series \\"SpongeBob SquarePants\\"(I think). That's probably because SpongeBob lives in a pineapple.

It takes place in England circa the timeframe it was written, and you are not sure if the character is really off his trolley, or just an ordinary Joe driven to crime using rats instead of a revolver. I was following this faceless character as he himself does not have a first or surname, and I almost felt as though I was right behind him, a confidante to what he was doing, thats how well the writer drew me in.Treat yourself to a great story and I bet you will probably keep turning pages till you finish as I did.Oh and by the way, without spoiling anything I wanted to mention that the conclusion of the story as opposed to the movie ending, sent a long freezing chill down my spine when I read the last lines of it. Delicous and creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Somewhat Biased Reveiw","review":"I admit I only read this book because I adore rats (as pets of course!) That being said I still enjoyed the book for its other qualities. I found it intriguing very few of the characters had actual names, most were given nicknames like \\"The Girl\\" and \\"The Book Keeper.\\" It kept things simple.The book itself is written in small diary entries, of course in the first person, which can always add a certain depth to a story. I found that it had a lot of psychological commentary (perhaps accidental?) about hysteria and the over exaggeration of stories into myth and legend.I think this was a funny read but not scary in the least. Maybe that's just my take on it. Other rodent enthusiasts are sure to adore this little story but I'm not so sure if anyone outside that audience would or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"transition piece","review":"This book, the sequel to Return to Isis, is not as good as the first, but that could be due to the fact that the characters are already familiar. There's none of the drama of the first book of discovering who these people are, unless you count the villain who shows up in this book and you don't see enough of her to get a feel for her except for pure evil. The third book in the series probably has the excitement as Kali has to deal with the villain and Whit has to deal with that. There is some development of other characters, so this very much has the feel of a transition piece. It seems as if this was a two book idea that got divided into three. The story is interesting though and has the comfort of familiar figures and watching them develop. Like any series, you have to read it to understand where the next one is going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump For Joy","review":"This stuff is amazing.

I have heard others say there were some possible defects with it missing portions of the miniseries and so forth. I was finally able to get it to work and what I saw was appalling. This miniseries makes a grotesque mockery of history and what really happened at the Leo Frank trial. Dozens of people did not stand up in the middle of the trial and start singing with the result of the trial coming to a screeching halt.

Thanks to her obsession, Earth has a chance to send out a crew to alter the course of the asteroid, but only if a myriad of things go right.The plot of this novel is somewhat slower than her last one, owing to the deeper development of some of her main characters, especially computer nerd Jimmy Poole.

Maybe Scorpions developed into a pop metal band along the way (at least according to some people) but that is not the case when it comes to \\"ANIMAL MAGNETISM\\".

I really was surprised when I heard this much heavier music than what the Scorpions made before. Awsome, really, and ofcourse not every song is heavy, but seven are. The best song is Animal Magnetism en the worst is Lady Starlight, but that is jsut because I dislike ballads (mostly). Make It Real really woke me up, and the next song rocks like a hurricane!!!

It's the exact same guitar melody! But hey, by Toby Keith's standards, it's really not a bad song. Probably because he ripped off someone who actually has talent. Also, this was back before he turned into a crazy flag-waving pseudo-political pro-Bush wacko, so he didn't annoy the hell out of me quite as much back then.But um, listen to the album \\"Sister Sweetly\\", by Big Head Todd and the Monsters. Toby thought enough of it to rip off a song from it, so you should listen to it too.Edit for Kevin Sloan: if you really can't hear the similarities between those songs, then you are the one who is on crack.

It is chock full of mistakes and anachronisms that will mislead anyone not already immensely experienced in Win32 programming. Its pedantic language (\\"What did we learn?\\" and \\"Our new and modified data structures\\") can only appeal to elementary age schoolchildren.

But I do believe people saying that part of the book is \\"cut and paste\\" from somewhere else, they just don't make sence at all... I started notice the problem in Chapter 2 where there are quite a bit of typo and wrong information about the CD. Once I get into Chapter 3. This situation become worse, there are tones of code segment which I have no idea where to put. I could never find any makefileX in any directory (according to the book). What kind of publisher or author is this? At least they should take some time to check the consistency between the code and the CD... I DO NOT recommend this book !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Code is quite confusing but some topics are a bit helpful.","review":"Its a book thats aimed for a person who has a lot of time to waste in the understanding of code not making any sense, especially the code pertaining to terrain generation, which is very confusing and without any explanation. Secondly this book focuses basically on the retained mode and just copies the documentation of DirectX5 SDK help for immediate mode. One good thing about it is code and explanation handling of joystick and sound. Apart from it I don't find it any more useful. One can learn better reading the SDK help and code for other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Money!","review":"This book is nothing more than a rewrite of the D3D SDK documents. Funny it mentions the chrome wrap feature but never expalins how to implement it. There is a good reason for that and that is because the book is a word for word reprodection of the SDK, the SDK doesn't expalin how to use the chrome wrap either! No one writing code for D3D is writting a book they're too busy developing apps and Games. Sorry but its true you got to learn D3D the hard way and that is by doing and reading the poorly written MS SDK docs. At least the SDK docs are free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing book for anyone who wants to program in directx","review":"This is the best book on directx, on the bookshelves to date! If you've ever wanted to learn to use Directx to program for games, walk throughs, well just about anything this is the book you need. The author keeps up a great web sit where you can download more scenes and any updates to the CD. The source files are well documented and the author has been kind enough to even help me out a couple of times when I ran into a problem trying to come up with a new feature! So if your looking for a book to get started using Directx look no further, cause you've found it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dont bother to read this rubbish\\"","review":"The book is 820 pages.

It all starts to fall appart after chapter 1! The code on the CD and the code in the book are not the same. What is there is badly written in a very difficult to understand style. Some code dosent even work, requiring modifications. Overall it gives the impression of being an unedited, inconsistant first attempt at writing a book on the subject. Takes too much effort to read and understand! The second edition is badly needed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad coding style, poorly organized, good information","review":"The sample code uses variable names very poorly. You constantly have to verify what types of object instances they represent, and whether or not they are pointers. You cannot just read the text without the sample code. In fact the samples only loosely adhere to the chapter contents. But with extra effort you can piece the general disorganization together and gain some benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Retained Mode / Bad Immediate mode, Bad coding","review":"I was disapointed that there was so little discussion of D3D's immediate mode. Especially since immediate mode is by far the most commonly used mode in current products. I was also disapointed in the examples which didn't compile correctly. The code had few comments, although some of it was discussed in the text. The retained mode sections were fairly easy to follow, and could allow a beginner to get something on the screen without much effort. A serious drawback to all books of this type is that you spend a lot for a book that describes an outdated format. I bought the Direct3D version 3 book a few months ago and now DirectX/Direct3D is up to version 6. There should be some sort of rebate for current owners who buy the latest edition of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why wont it compile!","review":"I bought it, and when I compiled the first program I was excited, but then I found some serious typo's that kept me from following his chapters. He refers to some files which just don't even exist on the CD, \\"makefile\\" was one such file, and this file was to be used to create all subsequent files in the book. I finally thought I had figured out how to compile his code and then I got linker errors. Maybe there is a library I needed to include or something, but he didn't explain anything about setting up Visual C++. So all in all I never got past chapter 3. Sad but true, I think the author had done a good job, maybe I needed something a bit more fundamental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something I was really looking for.","review":"I'm actually programming a Role-Playing Game and thanks to this great book, I found the answers to many of the questions, that nobody was able to answer before.

Granted, it does shed some light on a few things for beginners, but not much. The code is cluttered and confusing. Much of it, especially the intialization code, is not explained. After comparing the book to the D3D Retained Mode docs, I quietly put it on my shelf and haven't touched it since. You can learn just as much from the docs. Besides, the new Direct3DX Utility library that shipped with DX7 is easier to learn, and the docs are easier to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE CHEESE","review":"CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE.

Anyone who knows even a touch of direct X knows that retained mode has been abandoned for a couple of years, not a surprising as it was very rarely used and certainly not used in game development. I find it hard to believe that this book is still being sold, let alone at this price. Save your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Power = MS Examples + explanation + mistakes","review":"This book was very good for explaining what was needed to write a D3D Retained mode app. What Kovach explains, he does very well, but there are some things he just ignores. Unfortunately, some of what he ignores is his own code. You'll outgrow this book quickly and turn to MS's examples, but you'll get up to speed with D3D RM quicker than with just the SDK examples. Its a shame that there were several mistakes, mis-matched and extraneous code, and \\"black holes\\" (his collision detection code needs major work, and I couldn't port it out of his examples.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A copy of Microsoft's documentation put and sold in a book","review":"First off let me just say that the book is 819 pages long, but the tutorial, explanations, or essence of the book ends on page 349!! The rest of the 400+ pages is simply a directx reference (every directx function with a two line description and the parameters they used in the functions). Who cares about the reference, this is something easily found on Microsofts webpage, in fact, word for word! The first two chapters are essentially the same as the microsoft example (again code is very similar). It throws alot of info at you, very fast, I've reread three times and am finally grasping the code though concepts are well explained. Examples are good but have WAY too much extra code that makes you go and weed out the relevant info. Author does promptly respond to email questions! All in all, this is probably still the best book out for direct3d though the microsoft samples and examples would do just as good of a job and you save $40.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was alright. I had to look over some of the code though..","review":"Basically, it was a good book. The code the author gives you, is somewhat confusing and some of the lines are totally pointless. The author really doesn't go into depth of any subject, but covers just a little in every area like: Texture mapping, animations, sound, and crash collision. I had to rewrite most of his code to my own, but I didn't mind because it was for experience. One thing that I found REALLY useful was the refrence of Direct3D RM on the back of the book. If you need a good refrence and overview of game programming, then buy this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless, Simple Useless","review":"I really feel sad for the trees that had to be sacrificed to print this book.

He never caved-in, as most of his peers did, to work for Disney but chose instead to live by the gun, selling his work and his demonstrations, in order to make a living.

I bought two of these and one of them fell apart the first time we set it up. I was able to fix it, but it took 15 minutes and it is loose now. Also the mesh is really thin and poorly attached. My 15 lb. dog was able to push himself through it and pull it off the frame the first day. If he can I'm sure a toddler could too. Also now there are staples exposed on the broken one. I have an old Safety First gate I've had for 12 years and we use all the time which is still in great shape. I will stick with those in the future. I would not buy this gate again or recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"Shoddy workmanship, very flimsy, and loosely rests against two walls. It's not intuitive, the latch to adjust the with of the gate is flimsy and not secure, and the whole thing just topples over. Does not keep anything out--pets, kids, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"When trying to expand or collapse the gate it falls apart. I have other gates that are better constructed than this one....wont buy from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the butt to use.","review":"If you are blocking off a door not used much than this is ok. If you travel through the doorway often save your self time and aggravation and spend the $50 to $60 for the gated style gate. It is so worth it and just as safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad decision","review":"This gate is useless. Don't be fooled by the free shipping. This gate doesn't stay in place for a second by itself. It is complete waste of your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"truly junk","review":"I ordered three of these. All of them are very flimsy and don't stay secure in doorways. There are also no instructions on how to use them, so I don't know if they are faulty, just poor quality, of if there is some magical trick that might make them functional. (there are instructions on the box, but for all three boxes, North States covered their instructions on their shipment label to amazon). When I contacted North States (during business hours), there is only an option to leave a message and no customer service person on hand to help. I truly regret this purchase because I need to hassle with the return and still need to shop for security gates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make them like they use to","review":"Worked well for about 3 days before it started to fall apart - only moved it about twice a day. Have had to use pliers to bend the fasteners back to their correct position. Screws started to come loose. Snaps on top keep coming apart and have to put them back together. Used this product several years ago when my youngest was a toddler and they held up OK then. Don't make them like they use to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay closed","review":"Bought the gate hoping it would fit. It gets 2 starts because it fits the space, but the bar doesn't stay down, so it keeps popping open and falling over. I've had to duck-tape it closed and it's still not doing great with that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flimsy excuse for a gate","review":"I cannot recommend this gate to anyone under any circumstances. It is extremely flimsy and shoddy in construction and would not bar a child or dog from entering a room.Furthermore, although the description is technically accurate, unless your doorways are PERFECTLY square, the gate will not adjust at all. Therefore, get out a carpenter's square before you order. And I do mean perfectly square. If your house is as much as 1/64 inch out of square, either the upper or lower knob that supposedly holds the gate in place will not fit tightly enough to keep the gate in place. It is by no means as adjustable as the product description. If you have an older house, definitely give this product a pass.Oh, and by the way! Be sure that you can return the gate THE DAY BEFORE YOU GET IT for a full refund. Yes, that is right. It was shipped on the 8th, reached me on the 13th and I had to return it on the 12th for a full refund.Linda J. Holland-Toll"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the dogs out!","review":"I bought two of these gates when I rescued a dog. He was not potty trained and I needed to keep him blocked into a manageable area. They arrived quickly and did the trick! They contained him and I was happy with how securely they closed into the doorways!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STOPPERS!","review":"If you're trying to carry a child and keep your dog back with the other, this gate is NOT for you. As you're lifting the latch to move it if you let it open all the way up it will fall apart. It then take 10 minutes to line up the wooden frame with the metal brackets to get it back together. Don't waste your money! Spend the extra $5 and get the better one, promise. This one's NOT worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesh child/pet gates","review":"These gates are a good buy for a small or regular door opening. I've found that they fall down and don't stay secure when you open them wide to fit a larger opening. No problem at all for regular door openings or staircases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Function at a Great Price","review":"In our experience, the two gates fit perfectly and are easily adjustable. Just what we needed to keep a new puppy out of the carpeted area of the house. We're ordering a third for the stairs - she's learning to get around way too fast! For a basic, low-priced gate, it's tough to see how this one could be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Simple to Use, Works Good","review":"We had one of these years ago to restrict puppy from stairs and also used it to barricade him in bathroom when we were out of the house. These gates are easy to adjust and use. Now, 15 years later we needed another for our new, seven month old, Scottish Terrier. You simply measure the door or opening and then set this into the gate's adjustment notches and it is ready to install. Rubber bumpers protect your woodwork and the tension pressure can be adjusted for firm fit. The wood surfaces are smooth and nicely finished, the plastic web is soft but strong. Inexpensive security for babies...human and canine. A plus, these gates are made in the USA. Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"This gate does not stay tight in the doorway. Because it is not spring loaded but instead works on a racheting principle - if the doorway doesn't happen to fit the rachets exactly it either dosen't fit and falls down because it is either too big or too small. I am going to buy another gate - one that is spring loaded.

This album is nothing but crap! Phil killed Pantera! Pantera was everything! What more could you want? Anyways, this cd is like nothing but Phil singing fast punk rock lyrics. It sucks! If you want a real album, check out Damageplan. By the way, Pat is a lot better than Phil. I hate Phil with a passion. I hope his heart explodes from all the heroine he has been taking. I am not gonna buy any SuperDope Ritual cd's because it is a complete waste of money. Maybe you people will get your heads out of your @$$ and realize that this is complete crap. DIE PHIL DIE!!!!!

If you really like listening to any Metallica or Pantera or Mudvayne or even Slipknot....DO NOT GET THIS JUNK!!! I bought it because I like a little metal sound and most everyone here reviewed it well. This is real old school metal, which is OK if you like it. But if you want music that has melody and good guitar that stands out in the middle of the songs, and drums that make you sit up an mimic the drummer, buy anything but this CD! Phil shoulda crept away instead of embarasing himself! I'm sure the older SJR CD is the same trash too. If you have a CD burner like I do, at least you can burn a few copies and sell them to burnouts who like crappy sounding music to get your $$ back. I made the mistake, learn from this review!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superjoint Rip-off","review":"This will be straight to the point, this cd SUCKS! This sounds like some lame ass punk band TRYING to be metal.

The only reason this band got publicity is because Phil is in it. I don't know why, but some people think Phil's a Metal God even though he's really just a nazi fascist junky who changes his image every 2 seconds. He's also a big reason why Dime died. I really hope this band falls to pieces so American metal won't be crushed until its unbearable to listen to. Hopefully this band will break up soon so Phil can go into rehab and all the other morons in the band will realize that they can't play instruments. Awful band, awful album. 0/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Phil leave Pantera?","review":"Phil Anselmo needs to drop the drugs, man. In Pantera, he was good, and now this crap? His vocals are too low; listen to Cowboys from hell to hear his good vocals. And Hank williams jr as a metal musician? Do yourself a favor, fellow CD buyer. Buy Reinventing the steel or Cowboys from hell or Far beyond driven. Don't buy anything by Superjoint ritual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil Anselmo is lazy!","review":"Phil Anselmo needs to stop doing side projects. The first Superjoint cd was okay and now they put out this piece of crap. This cd sounds like a low production, badly recorded henry rollins want to be cd. It's like a bad punk cd. I wasted 13 dollars on this, no one else should suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a lethal dose of metal!!","review":"This is a kick ass metal album. Phil Rocks. Pantera is better but this stands toe to toe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Phil / Bad Music","review":"I bought this album to follow Phil Anselmo. His lyrics sound good and hardcore but the music lacks any headbanging rhythm. Too many tempo changes to follow. Phil should stick to vocals only. Leave the guitar to Dime. Ohh wait he's not in the band. Too bad for Phil. I only listened to it about three times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately a breath of fresh air","review":"Where to begin... Well if you are a die hard Pantera fan you must buy this album with a degree of understanding, There are no amazing guitars period, just thrash speed and breakdowns. The drumming although heavy could not lick Vinnie's balls on a bad day. Phil himself takes somewhat of a different yet amazing aproach to his vocals.Now all this may sound somewhat negative but do not [freat]! In an era that is producing little to no quality heavy music Superjoint ethrals you with some bad ...thrash/punk/hardcore styling. Lyrically Phil takes a step back more to the roots of emotion and anger rather than just stating dominance in metal as Reinventing the Steel did. Overall, rock it, blast it get the juices flowing and love it for what it is.. blistering heavy music that is not afraid to spit in your face and kick you in the gut"},{"rating":"1","title":"A toothless beast.","review":"I get that this is meant to be a downright raw, heavy blast. It's meant to be spirited angst. Yeah I get that, but in the current music scene there's thousands of bands trying to out-nasty each other, to out-f**kyouup each other, and Superjoint Ritual surprisingly seem a little tame. Tame, but at the same time quite unlistenable. This is not due to an immense vile speed and heaviness, but more to do with a lack of interesting writing and an overall grating, muddy sound. Phil's voice begins to irritate me after a short while, and the instrumental work is oddly one-dimensional, varying predictably between speedy thrashes and slow not-quite-heavy-enough dirges. So, it ends up neither taking my head off, nor engaging my head. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprogressive/unimpressive","review":"Astonishlinly unoriginal... While there is some potential here, this album manages to sound both like a \\"demo tape\\" and EXACTLY like their last album \\"Use Once And Destroy\\". I mean, how many times can use say \\"1,2,1,2,3,4!!!\\" before each song??? I love that Phil Anselmo fully embraces old-school metal, but heavy metal is also about taking music to the next level and pushing the envelope... There is no envelope here, just a bunch of old letters stuck in a drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRUTAL","review":"As I stated in the title this album is brutal. If you like pantera and down, and only like them for the music you probably wont like superjoint ritual. If you are a diehard Phil Anselmo fan than this is a definite album to have. This album is heavier and faster than the last one. I gave this 5 stars cause it kicks.... ENJOY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks","review":"This band suck, and worse of all I made the mistake of buying this album. Somehow I thought it would be somewhat good but I was wrong. It has no melody, there is just nothing good about this album. If you like hearing some idiots howling like morons all through the album then this album is for you, but I just would not waste my money on such garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me","review":"I read these reviews first then I listened. In no way can I take seriously a discussion of musical style or lyric content concerning this disc. Vocal quality ... there is no quality no talent needed to produce that gutteral nonsensical sound. Musicianship, none is present here. Lyric ... simplistic deluded are the only words to describe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight up fast, aggressive, harcore metal at its finest!","review":"First off, to anyone that likes Damageplan, they are so damn stupid. Damageplan is uninspired, unoriginal, cliche as s**t, and flat out terrible. Superjoint on the other hand, is incredible! Unique, hardcore, kick ass metal that is brutal. I had the distinct privilage of seeing Superjoint just the past saturday. It was almost like seeing Black Flag back in the day. F**king incredible! Anyways, this cd is great. A continuation of Superjoint's great sound. Sickness, Dress Like a Target, Waiting for the Turning Point, Personal Insult, and Destruction of a Person are stand outs. Every song is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What are these other people listening to?","review":"I can't even describe how bad these guys are. It seems as if they picked up their junk and everyone tried to play the worst riffs they could think of and then they put it all together and Phil started screaming over it. Actually some songs, such as \\"Destruction of a Person\\" start off decent, but then out of nowhere an aweful off-time circus riff comes in with Phil talking over it and then it further degenerates into another crappy riff and Phil starts screaming. The musical transitions don't fit or make sense, and they try to play heavy music with an oldschool punk sounding drum and guitar tone. The whole sound is very sloppy and very disorganized. I see that this will prevent it from becoming \\"corporate\\" or mainstream or whatever Phil wanted it to be, but it sucks. If you liked Pantera, Down, or any other hardcore or rock bands, don't waste your time with Superjoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Really Boring. Linkin Park is better than this junk.","review":"really boring. just a bunch of pantera-like riffs and some angry guy screaming on top of it. Perfect music for your angry little racist high school kid or music to drink beer, play cards or pork your wife in your trailer.Highlight of this album: Phil Anselmo doing more drugs and leading to self destruction. Its a good feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy, but nowhere near as good as their first","review":"The firt superjoint ritual album (use once and destroy) is much better then this one. Every song on this album starts out differently and then ties into the same guitar riffs. It sounds like every song could blend into each other and create just one song. There are only two songs really worth listening to, waiting for the turning point and dress like a target.Don't be fooled because of Phil as the vocalist, this is his worst product easily.Get any Pantera album instead of this, or any down album or use once and destroy, that is a fun one to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!! 1234!!!","review":"This is the WORST cd ive picked up in years. It sounds like a bunch of no talent kids trying to play metal. Every song starts with 1,2,1,2,3,4..... how annoying is that.

I hate them. I bought their first album to give them a chance. I listened to it one time, and never picked it up again. Pantera and Down are a hell of alot better.

Also, there are moments where you think \\"This sounds like it could of been on Use Once and Destroy\\" but thats a good thing. This album also has a few punk influences on it. If you liked Use Once and Destroy you should deffenatly go out and buy this album. Its worth it.

Maximizer offered to make it work on a stand alone computer for $50 per half hour. Further they crippled a lot of features available to work with SQL server. Besides a horrendous installation and a space consuming block of cement this program no longer has any value. You can't adjust column width or many other things that you could do in previous versions. Avoid this like a plague.

I highly recommend the macro lens. It enables you to take astounding shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This camera is fun! I got it with the 1G Ultra SD card, and it is sooo much faster and easier than my old camera. It's easy to navigate, the screen is large so pix are easy to see, although it is a little grainy. I enjoy the features and different settings. Should be foolproof picture taking under varying circumstances. I like that it has a viewfinder, which is very hard to find nowadays, so when you are in the sun, you can frame the picture and not guess if you are pointing the camera right. And I wanted a better zoom, and this has it. I think the longer zooms are not as steady. This one has been great. The movie mode is even easy, so I can catch the kids quickly when I want to.

I'm very happy with this camera.

All I can figure is that these are the kind of people whose idea of photography is to line the family up from tallest to smallest in the driveway on holidays and flash away.This camera appears to me to have been designed by an egghead who values pixels far above f-stops.The camera's programming is guaranteed to give blurry pictures anytime you shoot without a flash in anything less than full sunlight. Let me give you an example: I just stepped outside at 4pm on an overcast day. It's daylight outside, but no direct sunlight. I turned the flash off and pointed the camera at grass, light colored wood fencing, and a white dog. You know what the camera used? f 5.6 & 1/12.

Various reviews pointed me in the direction of this one. It was definitely the right choice. She took to it right away and uses it all the time. The only negative issue seems to be the fairly frequent occurrence of red-eye with the flash, and her software's redeye reduction doesn't help much. But she thinks there may still be remedies for that if she explores further in the directions. What she said, though, is revealing: \\"even though there is that problem, this camera is way better than my friends' cameras.\\" Two things she mentioned as being better were the larger screen for viewing the shots, and the video function."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOVICE LOVE'S THIS CAMERA!","review":"Based on all the wonderful reviews I read on the A540 I choose this as my first digital camera, and glad I did! Awesome camera for the money, and the most important factor to me was the big 2.5 LCD, I love it! Simple to read instruction manuel had me ready to start shooting in minutes! Believe me,if I can do this anyone can! The first week I took it with me to \\"Bobby Q's\\" birthday bash and it took fabulous pictures in a dimly lit restaurant. I passed the camera around for everyone to review photo's and they could't get over the quality of the pictures it took. I could use more zoom so I'm purchasing the Opteka 2.2 Telephoto lens, well worth the $30 extra dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I researched before I bought this camera, but after using it a month, I'vebeen very disappointed.

There are many more options than I will ever use, but why complain about that? I have been very pleased with the picture quality, zoom capabilities, screen size, and ease of uploading the pictures to my computer. Our batteries seem to run out often, but I always carry an extra set and it isn't a great expense since it uses two AA batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera LENS mechanism BROKE after 13 months!!!","review":"We really liked this camera until yesterday and we got the famous Canon Lens Error. (do a search on the web for Canon e18 error). My wife took a picture of the kids for Christmas and switched the camera to play mode to review the shot and it blacked out the LCD with a message that said LENS ERROR, RESTART CAMERA. She did so, and it started making a grinding noise. The camera is now junk and not worth fixing. THANKS CANON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but Mighty! The Canon A540","review":"Great little camera, very powerful and functional in a very small package.The viewfinder is great to use on sunny days when you can't see the view screen. The features are many and easy to use. The 6mp is more than enough for 5x7 or 4X6 prints. I have a 2gb memory card enough for more 1000 pics. The only downside is the weak flash and very slow recovery time. If you plan to shoot a lot of distance flash this camera is not for you, if you plan to shoot rapid flash sequences this camera is for you. The 4x optical zoom is not very powerful so if you do a lot of distance shooting look elsewhere. Every other feature is outstanding. If you can get the camera for under $200 do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great image quality, but batteries seem to drain quickly...","review":"The image quality is amazing and all the features are really good. Quality-wise, you can't really ask for more at the price. However, it is pretty bulky and, it might just be the old rechargeable AA batteries I'm using, but I always seem to get terrible battery life.Edit: I found the source of this problem. My rechargeable batteries were 1850 mAh, I switched to 2500 mAh ones and they last forever. This camera is flawless for the price with that issue out of the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Powershot a540 6MP","review":"I bent the lens on my wonderful Nikon Coolpix and was unhappy to find that it was no longer made. Repair was to be $175. For the same amount of $$ I purchased the Canon. What advances in 2 years! A big viewing screen that occupies 3/4 of the camera back. Very simple operation with options for high tech changes. The camera is quite narrow and fits easily into a shirt pocket. Most amazing is the ability to take movie \\"shorts\\" with sound! Picture quality is excellent. Hard to imagine a better camera at this price - or $100 higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get It While You Can!","review":"This jewel of a camera is a steal at as low as $165.00 online. I've got several more expensive Canon digital models like the S3 IS & SD550, but none of them seem to take pictures as sharp as this one does. You can dress them up with all the bells & whistles you want, but in the end, image quality is what matters to me & this one just gets it done. Plus it is a pleasing compromise in size between the tiny easy-to-shake Elphs & the larger Canon models that you can't carry in a pants pocket. And even though it's the bottom of the line price-wise, it still gives you the option of attaching a wide-angle lens to it. And it runs on AA batteries/rechargeables for even more flexibility. In this case, cheaper is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The pictures taken indoors are bad. Too many red eyes , despite using red eye reduction. Will not recommend this product for indoor use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"I love my power shot A 540.

You will be pleased with the picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Trust Warranty","review":"Nice little camera that took great pictures. After 2 months, with camera in mint condition, lens cover suddenly wouldn't open completely. Sent in (extremely well packaged) for warranty repair and Canon said it would cost $93 to fix because the lens ring was dented and it wasn't covered under warranty. When I protested it was in perfect condition, they said they could give me a 10% discount on the cost of repair. I asked Canon to return it to me unrepaired. Amazingly, it now contains a very visible dent in the lens ring. No dings, dents or scratches otherwise. I guess this is how Canon can avoid doing warranty repairs. I trusted the Brand, but won't again. If considering buying, do your research. The internet contains lots of information, including a threatened class action suit, against the Canon A series cameras because of lens problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PowerShot A540","review":"Pretty decent digital camera.

Thinking it was about time I learned about digital photography, I bought this camera on the advice of friends. I have not been disappointed. Its size took a little getting used to because, when compared with an SLR, it's a little small. But this camera certainly is not small potatoes when it comes to easy of use, cost to operate, and quality of pictures! It is a little slow in the area of recovery between shots, but that's hardly a significant drawback. This great little camera can be had at a great price and produces great results. What more could you want?

I think this is a reasonable machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Camera - Bring Lots of Batteries","review":"This is a great little camera. I really enjoyed learning about all of the different functionalities - including playing with the color swap, which allows you to select a color in a video and then then change everything from that color to another color of your choice. Great pictures, good manual control, good automatic control.The problem is that in five days of playing with it and taking maybe 20 pictures and maybe 10 minutes of video, I went through 8 sets of Duracell batteries. So when I got home, I bought some 2400mAH NiMH rechargeables. Took 5 pictures and the next morning it said my batteries were dead, so back to the store it went (I got it from Best Buy, which I will never do again. Their return policy is 15 days for cameras and a 15% restocking fee if it's opened. Costco has a longer return policy on chicken salad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"canon a540","review":"So far, so good. I just have a problems with directions. Aren't any of these books written by people who speak English??? It took me an hour to figure out how to stop the flash. But as soon as I opened the box at Christmas I was able to use it and the pictures came out great. I am sure with a little more reading and working with the camera it will be even better. I had an Olympus...really easy to use and this one comes close with a few more bells and whistles. I am happy with it so far! I am not great with all the computer stuff, but have been able to take, save and print my own pictures just from previous experience.

I also find that I hate having to flip a switch to go into review mode, as the lens retracts. That's completely lame. I have also found the menus to be non-intuitive, especially around picture management (delete, etc).

Buy a 15 minute charger and you are all set. No need to buy li-ION batteries.Cons:- After handling the Elphs, this one looks a little bulky, however I have not complaints with it's size what so ever.- Is an old camera so is definitely slower between two pictures, again I have had not complaints with that.All in all, for the price this is a great great camera.

I've been looking for it on CD for quite a while. It is definitely the best effort from Pentangle, and one of the very best of British folk-rock ever. The lead singer's voice is clear as a bell, and the band (including John Renborne at his best) is magnificent. The full length Jack Orion (the entire second side) is incredible, and is available only on this disk. If you get only one Pentangle disk, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Pentangle never disappoints with their music. When you hear a song by them, you know it's going to be just beautiful. This album has 5 songs on it, the last of which is around 20 minutes long, and the highlight of the album. The first four songs are all very good, but the last track \\"Jack Orion\\" vastly overshadows everything else.The only reason I gave this four stars, is that collectively as an album, Pentangle has done better. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for getting started in Visual Anthropology.","review":"I got this book after a long held interest in visual anthropology.

Oddly, it's the way he weaves into his message a host of Christian references that feels both lovely and subversive (never mind that much of that may have been the only way Capra could find to wind up this story, an ending he was never really happy with).Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper are the perfect pair, with Walter Brennan lending his acting genius and James Gleason turning in a really good performance. Sadly, this movie has never been restored and every print I've seen looks like a transfer from a second-generation 16 mm copy, this version included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empowering","review":"This is a book that in spite of its title, stands clearly outside of the bunch.

The diatribes that go on at times against current law and society are, far from being destructive are thought provoking and also empowering against the forces that be, as he eloquently blurts out the injustices that go on many a times and the ways that one can deal with them as an individual, a citizen, and most important, a self-respeting person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised!","review":"Was I surprised by this book?

Spence never even comes close to delivering the alluring promise of the title. For example, he advises the reader to practice public speaking in front of an audience. Fine. And if you can't find an audience for practicing? He advises you to \\"create\\" one. He actually suggests that you go into a restaurant, stand up on a chair, clink a spoon on a glass to command attention and announce to the room that you need to practice speaking to them so please indulge you!!! Is he nuts? You'd get pelted with bread-sticks until the waiters gave you the bum's rush and heave-ho.

Among the good ideas were:1. Truth is powerful.2. The use of stories helps involve the listener in a way technical arguments alone cannot.Among the bad ideas were:1. Words are virtually irrelevant- the tone conveys your message.2. The truth can be found in emotions, not logic.3. You can win every time merely by denying your opponent your permission to beat you.I had heard that one should keep one's argument as pure as possible thereby avoiding to needlessly alienate people through issues unrelated to the main point. The author contradicts this completely by sprinkling his liberal ideology throughout the book, making it significantly more difficult for non-liberals to keep reading.In the beginning, the author says that this book is itself an argument. Well the argument failed to win this reader, and thereby contradicted its title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad advice","review":"The author redefines \\"argue\\" as \\"communicate\\", then tries to tell you how to \\"win at communicating\\". He does this by presenting a lot of half-truths and monologues borne of a critically incomplete understanding of even his own example situations.

One positive note is that the book contains numerous resources for parents and teachers including books, organizations and websites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parent Educator reviews this book and give thumbs up","review":"As a parent educator I am amazed at the lengths children will go to be mean and cruel to one another. I bought this book to share with some of the kids I work with. It is well written and fun to read aloud or for young readers to do by themselves.It is especially important to get into dialog with children about the effects of harmless teasing and taunting that can escalate quickly to bullying situations. Many do not understand about boundaries and what is considered bullying.Caring adults will want to make sure their children know what he or she is and is not allowed to say and do on the computer. Rules and limitations can be set based o a child's age and maturity level.Kindness and respect must be modeled and taught in order for children to recognize and practice it.

Great for educators and parents alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK FOR YOUNGER KIDS","review":"I liked the cartoon explanations in this book, and the way the author explains that bullies are \\"self-esteem vampires\\" He goes into gang violence and what you should do about it as a child. He also goes into name-calling and general nastiness. I just wished that he would not have said that most children who are picked on, are shy children. In my experience, it is the children who are different in someway (race, religion, opinions, dress, hair color, braces etc..) that brings on the teasing. This book does not address that issue very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept - but lacks practical advice","review":"This is a book a child can read, and will gain comfort that he/she isn't alone in being bullied. I don't feel it fully addresses bullying or gives practical step - by - step advice. It doesn't provide several - step senarios. As in, if you've tried our advice and it didn't work, go on to do this next, if that doesn't work, do this next. I was hoping for a book that would address the issue comprehensively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullies Are a Pain in the Brain","review":"This book was purchased for my almost 12 year old son who had been recently bullied.

I would classify it as Urban Jazz mixed with pop. its hard to come across music as good and refreshing as this. Swing out sister has stood the test of time with brilliance, and could have been huge in the US, if more promotion was put into them. its a shame that many Americans will not ever hear of this group. It is a great cd, but at some times it becomes a bit bland, and i could see how it could get a bit tiring after hours of listening to it. Dont get me wrong, its a great album and for anyone who is a fan of them, you should get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"back to the woodshed...","review":"As you age, your supposed to be less impulsive. A lesson, that with the purchase of this CD, I clearly have not learned. I heard the terrific update of \\"Stoned Soul Picnic\\" on a \\"jazz\\" station and within ten minutes or so I had ordered it. I had the first two SOS albums and liked them, so I thought 'how could I go wrong...'Well folks, not one of my better ideas. The basic tenant of songwriting is melody. The melodies on this CD come in a distant third behind overly ambitious arrangements and some of the worst engineering I've ever heard in a modern recording. I can't hear the music for the music, and I wish I could. I would love to hear these songs presented in a simple, clear and dynamic form. SOS's music is full of an optimism that is sorely lacking in pop music these days, but the overproduction keeps me from getting to it. SOS Unplugged? What a concept. In the meantime, I've learned my lesson with the most expensive single I ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly forming","review":"2 1/2Well meaning but ultimately fizzled Soul throwbacks vacillate between funked finesse and waiting-room sheik."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Music Perfection.","review":"With the nineties nearly over, its safe to say Shapes and Patterns is the best pop cd of the decade. If you like air candy, gorgeous melodies, multi-track harmony vocals, and first rate musicianship, then SOS is your band. These songs will stay in your head long after the music is over. Producing pop music for adults, SOS, like Crowded House, are a class act. \\"Somewhere in the World,\\" \\"We can Make it Happen,\\" and \\"Better Make it Better\\" are instantly hummable. The 5th dimension cover, \\"Stone Souled Picnic\\" grooves, but \\"Always\\" outshines them all. If you love pop music, you can do no better than Shapes and Patterns. Buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing Out Sister...","review":"A few years ago, I was in the Buena Park Tower Records and heard Swing Out Sister's \\"Stone Soul Picnic.\\" At the time, I just wasn't ready for their rendition of the song.

Last month I was in the local Apple Store and the song \\"Somewhere Out of This World\\" came on. Immediately I liked it and so used an app on my device to \\"listen\\" to it and determine who it was. I was suprised that it was Swing Out Sister. Like some others here, this CD made me purchase every other CD in the catalogue - including the hard to find \\"Filth and Dreams\\". This CD is fantastic and I can't believe it wasn't promoted more when it was released in the 1990's. There are some real gems here. My favourites are \\"Somewhere In The World\\", \\"We Could Make It Happen\\" but \\"Somewhere Out Of This World\\" is one of my favourites. This is a great CD and it's highly recommended by me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Purchase","review":"I heard great reviews about this camera but my experience was not good.

Takes great indoor pictures at restaurants with bad lighting, and great long distance shots. I would have loved to have a viewfinder, like other cameras, this feature is great for sunny days where you can't really see the large lcd screen. Also, got a great deal, $30.99 at Sears on clearence, talk about a steal."},{"rating":"1","title":"All around cheap","review":"I bought this camera about 3 months ago. The whole time I have had it, I've been frustrated with the quality of the picture. It has some great features on it for sure, but the optics are horrible. I can't take any shot indoors without a flash, no matter what time of day it is, and how sunny the room is. I think the problem is that it doesn't get to a wide enough aperture (especially zoomed in). I tried manually setting the ISO to 400, but it didn't help, and the pictures came out noisier than Hillary Clinton.Bottom Line, if I wanted another cheap camera, I would go with maybe a 5MP camera made by Canon or HP. I think that I would find that the pictures would actually come out better. (not an overstatement)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but no optical viewfinder","review":"I bought the camera and used it to take a few photos in the house. It is easy to use and has many features for such a low-priced camera. When I took it outside to take a photo of my snow-covered house, I found a problem. It does not have an old-fashioned look-through viewfinder. The digital viewfinder screen is large and easy to see in the house, but not bright enough out in the sun. Therefore it was difficult to frame my image. I am taking it back to where I bought it (for $99.58 + tax).My 5-year+ old Canon Powershot Elph has far fewer features and a much smaller digital viewfinder, but I will buy some new batteries and use it for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lesson in \\"Lost History\\"","review":"John Mulhall's book is an excellent historical review of history as we may not have known it. With excellent documentation and quotes from people who had major influence in the events that have shaped our present-day situation, we are presented with American politics that have long escaped attention and public scrutiny.

This book works to bridge the gaps that most companies will overlook (such as boring job titles that send the wrong message) and Beckwith does it in a clear and concise manner. Buy this book!

Like many other Live albums, this is kind of a greatest hits collection. Hits like 'Rock you like a Hurricane', 'No one like you', 'Holiday', and 'The Zoo' are even better than their studio counterpats. The sound engineers made a great job, even though most of the songs were recorded in different parts of the world you'd never figure it out until Klaus screams the name of a city.All in all, a great album.

All the songs really come alive here."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME","review":"When I first bought this on Chrome tape this album freaking ROCKED. Whoever remastered it was a total @#$%^!!! Needless to say the version includes 6 string sting but it was done with such low volume that Klaus sounds like hes an act in a bowling alley. This thing was so loud it would rip your ears off and jump up and down on them and make them bleed. It is one of the best albums I have ever owned. So the fidelity is not there. Anyway I just opened it on you tube with my volume at 100 percent. That was as loud as it should be at HALF volume. My CD is just not even half of that half loud. Digitally remastered = the suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compilation that doesn't fit","review":"This live album is perfect to have, in only one CD, the best of Scorpions in his era pos-Ulrich Roth. The trouble is: the era pos-Ulrich Roth is not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scream On","review":"To tell the truth, the Scorpions sound pretty bad even when they're in the studio, live they are simply punishing. Famed for the guitar heroics of Michael Schenker, the band really does not offer much else. They fill in all the appropriate blanks for an eights metal band, bad hair, bad singing, bad lyrics and plenty o screamin. Similar to UFO, AC/DC and Black Sabbath, they will probably please fans of that sort of noxious noise.

There are relatively few projects and the instructions are not that well illustrated and it is very costly for the number of pages. I took a course in Peyote Stitch and the instructor used the Well's book. I would therefore instead recommend the Carol Wilcox Books (both of them). The first (Creative Bead Weaving) has fantastic instructions for all types of peyote and the 2nd (The Art and Elegance of Beadweaving), has the most beautiful projects imaginable. In addition both books cover many other forms of beadweaving. They are about twice as big and cost less and are truly inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until","review":"you put it in the water. Worked for about 30 seconds after that.

I have a confession to make. I judged this book by the cover. It really stood out from everything. When I read it, I was so glad I made the purchase. I judged right! These stories show the male side of relationships. I thought I knew everything about men but even I learned something! LOL. This book shows some of the macho side of men but it also goes into the emotional, sensitive side that women don't get to see so much. Some of the stories were funny, a few were sexy, and a couple of them were amazing! All around I was very pleased. I love reading stories by Black male writers.I commend Mr. Travis Hunter, Mr. Michael T. Owens, and all of the beautiful Black men who shared their work.

None of what I experienced in Bhutan was even mentioned in this uninsightful video. I feel this video is very misleading, lacking in depth and would not prepare a prospective traveler for a visit. The people, culture, architecture, dzongs, enlightened monarchy, building of roads, the relationship of the country to China and India -- these are just a few of the topics not covered in the video. The video was worse than a waste of time and money: it was a poor show. PBS should be ashamed to have their name associated with such a shoddy product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awake To Devotion and Hope","review":"For all Christians and those who BELIEVE - A MUST SEE MOVIE!! At times we may complain about our own sacrifices and pain when in reality we forget why perserverance and patience is so important in life.

Treat your heart, soul and mind to this beautiful food of love, devotion and sacrifice - your faith can only increase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I purchased this video hoping for a believable, moving version of the life of this beloved saint. What my family and I encountered was a poorly done movie, with very little attention to detail, and obviously cheap in its production. This was so obvious that we were moved to laughter, for example, when we noticed that one of the leading characters always wears the same red costumeand never ages, even when, according to the plot, 30 or so years went on since the first moment of her appearance. The acting was equally dismal. This film may be good to entertain children, but not for adults that seek some level of inspiration through a video version of the life of a great human being as San Martin de Porres was. This film dishonors his legacy and memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mala","review":"Contrario a los comentarios anteriores, esta pelicula es bastante mala, actores fingidos y dialogos rebuscados.

The Twin Sink Drainer is so lightweight that it slides around on the counter, kind of like a flat Frisbee. The Twin Sink Dish Drainer wire is much thinner, and has a silverware cup which does not effectively hold the knives and forks without them falling out. As I said before, this new product material is \\"for the customer's benefit\\".

In the first book, a bored suburban woman develops a penis. She doesn't develop a true, honest to God, do-I-dress-left-or-right one, just a nub. There just is not a lot driving her, either. She just seemed like a sad little person, who never goes anywhere. In the companion story, a macho man develops a vagina on his leg. To use the AOL-type acronym, WTF? Why not commit? Why not put it where they generally are located? You certainly won't find one on someone's leg!Both stories were too weak. He doesn't wake them up completely switched in gender, he does not really show how society treats men and women through the fresh eyes of someone who has undergone a full transformation. He just makes these oddball half-baked chimeras and has all of the consequence of the mutation be a result of their own internal ruminations.Best ignore this one and enjoy his other, more entertaining books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooh, I'm scared.","review":"There's this woman, right, and she grows a penis!!

Ramon Novarro is excellent as the young nobleman of Israel who is betrayed by his Roman friend and must learn to beat the Romans at their own game. Eventually he comes under the influence of Jesus Christ and turns his life to a higher purpose. The famed chariot race is indeed a masterpiece and the sea battle uses real ships, not props.

It's almost like he's hoping either the lead singer will die early or the band will become really famous eventually, and he can claim dibs on their first documentary. Moon does the right thing in bringing the music to the forefront, but it hurts the interviews, which I could barely hear or understand. Tons of time is wasted on meaningless scenes of NYC or nearly empty rooms. They hyper saturated color is annoying to watch. No one is as dramatic as Moon makes The National out to be.

This was the Crue's second album, after the brilliant Too Fast For Love in 1981. This is just as good as its predessesor. It is heavy, loud, and Cruish. In other words, one of the best albums ever. This was before Motley Crue went pop metal(they would on their very next album), so they do wear makeup and gaudy costumes, but they play hard, furious hard rock, not the light metal anthems they would later play.

If you are into early Crue buy this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best stuff","review":"If you are going to buy one Crue album, this is definitely my choice. If you can get past the makeup, outfits and the goofy satanic theatrics, you should really enjoy this if you are a hard rock fan. Not the most thought provoking piece of work, but it is not supposed to be. It is just pure adrenline. Some of my favorites that never seem to make it on any of the greatest hits collections include Red Hot, Too Young to Fall in Love and a killer version of Helter Skelter.A must-have for any fan of 80's metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last of the true Motley Crue CD's","review":"This CD is the last of the non-commercialized Motley Crue CD's.

Sadly Motley never captured the magic that they had on this album again. Vince's voice is angry, almost like a growl, Mics riffs, Nikki's song writing ability and the pounding that Tommy gives the drum kit all make this the perfect metal album. If you're just getting into Motley than I would suggest starting your collection of with this album followed by Too Fast For Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazeing","review":"SATD (shout at the devil) is a great cd. i was blown away when i first heard shout at the devil when i was about 5 years old, ever since then ive LOVED the crue, i still do 8 years after hearing them for the first time. everyone should love them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminally underrated classic album.","review":"Before hearing this I was thinking that only 2 songs were going to be great (the title track and Looks That Kill) because I thought that they were just another hair band that had a couple songs that I really liked.Yeah Id say those songs are the best known but still the whole album is awesome.I mean so what if they looked like women?Its just prejudiced to think that if someone crosses dresses then that means they arent any good.I absolutely love this album and even though the debut Too Fast For Love comes pretty close it is their best album of all and deserves a place in music history as one of the greatest rock albums of the 80s.This is music as it should be simple and fun and occasionally sleazy.Theres not a song on here I dont like.Buy this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one changed my life!","review":"A buddy passed this cassette to me in karate class when I was 14.

Honestly, this music is pretty pointless. Its for guys who have small **** and need the music to compensate for that. I think these guys need to spend less time in wardrobe and make up and more time at the thinking table when they write this BS. As with all these stupid bands, 1990 was just about the end.

Sweet St. Louis was the most slow moving, and uninteresting book I have read in a very long time. Not to mention, every character with the exception of Ant, was extremely annoying. I think Sharron did an overkill on the line that brought the two together, \\"A piece of you....\\". Along with the fact her character asked far to many questions.I am sure there was a lesson to be learned, but I certainly learned nothing. Perhaps, I would have if I could relate to the characters, but fortunately, I don't know anyone as annoying as those characters.I hope the Omar's sequel to \\"Fly Girl\\" is a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Piece Of Me For A Piece Of You","review":"That line is what brought two people together.

The book was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was madness","review":"Tyree's last book Single Mom was a nice break from the normal type of reading that I do, but Sweet St. Louis was just plain silly. This was the slowest moving book I have ever read before in my life, finishing this book was like getting teeth pulled; you don't want to do it, but since you have already paid for it, you really don't have a choice. How many times could Sharron remind Ant of the silly line that he used? How many times would he fall for it? And for the record, I don't know anyone like Sharron or Ant. This was just madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!!","review":"I was all set to read yet another well written book by Mr. Tyree. Well, that I didn't get. I agree with the reviewer who said they only kept reading to see what,if anything, of interest was going to happen. I remember finishing the book and being happy it was over. I did laugh a few times, but overall, I didn't enjoy this book. Wouldn't recommend it AT ALL. Not giving up on Omar though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ...!","review":"I was a very big Omar Tyree fan..until I read this.

Borrow it from a friend!","review":"I have read all of Omar Tyree's books and I was so disappointed to have spent my money on the hardcover version of Sweet St. Louis. This book was so boring I could hardly keep my eyes open. I found myself skipping over paragraphs just to get through an ever dragging chapter. I am a big fan of Omar Tyree but this book was truly a wasted effort on his part. Maybe even a lack of effort on his part. Personally, I don't think he put as much time into this so called novel as he did in the others. Flyy Girl, Single Mom and Do Right Man were great! Sweet St. Louis has left me with a sour taste in my mouth and I will be hesitant when it comes to purchasing another one of Omar's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your looking for a Sweet Love story with many twists....","review":"Omar Tyree portrays the life of four young African-Americans who endure the ups and downs of the dating game.

I love the realness the Omar manage to display because we all know a Sharon or an Ant, or ask yourselves, are WE those characters?? I could really relate to both sides.

After just reading \\"never satisfied, how and why men cheat\\" by Michael Baisden this was very refreshing. The book does start off a bit slow but it's soooooo good. I read it in a day and a half. The only thing is that it takes sooo long, for the main characters to hook up. And once they did it was hot, but the end left me guessing about how Ant and Sharron's relationship would turn out. This needs a sequel, but then again after reading 4 the love of money.... (I don't know)but for the romance lover's this is a good read and worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader from the Chi","review":"I have to be totally honest. Of all the books of Omar Tyree this has to be the worse. I loved the others but this one is very slow and kind of narrative. It gets juicy in some parts then it's like dull. I would recommend it to a writer that wants to get some pointers of what not to write about. Why couldn't he just say STL instead of St. Louis International Airport? Things of that nature is what made this book a little dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world?!!!","review":"Omar, what in the world were you thinking hon? Did you really get input from those on your \\"shout out list\\". If so, I need to call them. This book is slow, the characters immature, story-line drags AND well....this just AIN'T(yeah I said ain't) a good book. This is probably one of the worst books I've read in awhile.

I missed sleep because I couldn't stand to pick it the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess","review":"I loved Omar Tyree when I read Flyy Girl, For the Love of Money, A Do Right Man, and Single Mom. But he must have been on something when he wrote Sweet St Louis. I love to read and have read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books, and I love every one of them. But Sweet St. Louis was boring, did not catch my attention at all, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I feel that Tyree has much more potential than this book and hope that his other novels are better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Remove His Computer From His House!","review":"If someone would please do me and the rest of the readers a favor and remove his computer, word processor, notebook, pens and pencils, we might be spared another Omar Tyree novel! After reading the dreadfully boring College Boy, I didn't think Omar could possibly write another novel as bad as that one. While not quite as awful as College Boy, Sweet St. Louis is a close second. Filled with page after page of long, boring narrative, this book took forever to go anywhere and forever to get to a point (assuming that there was a point, that is). I won't be reading another book by him again as there are way too many better authors than him to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow!!","review":"Sweet St.Louis was a horrible love story.

Since I took this book out of the library, I can be glad that I did not pay for it. I did not finish this book, because I kept falling asleep while trying to read it. For those of you who want to read thisbook, my advice is to borrow the book from the library. This way you won't lose any money if you are disappointed. For the rest of you who are brave enough to read this book, I suggest also, that you use it as late night read -- you are bound to fall asleep before you finish each chapter.

Nothing too out of the ordinary in this book. Tone's and Celena's characters helped to add some excitement to the monotony - but in the end - the story is too predictable and there just wasn't enough to keep me intrigued.

These flags are probably 1/4 the size of the Invisible Fence brand flags and are VERY poorly made. Even the poles of the flags are made of very flimsy plastic that is extremely difficult to even place into the ground.

Little did we know that these readings would bring loads of laughter, fun and, by the time we sat down to our Christmas meal, impectable manners by young and old (ages 7-70) alike!

It advises that \\"parents just need to lighten up\\" rather than teaching kids to respect their parents.It's written to teens, but rather than raising them up to a higher level, it panders to their own immaturity and lack of tact.Waste of money ... it's on its way back as I type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book-","review":"When my son was approaching his 12th birthday, he was forgetting the good manners he had before - everything was a \\"joke\\" for him, however, I was afraid he could be offending people, friends, with his behavior.

Since then, every night he was reading a part. A week later he confessed that this was a great book and he thanked me for it. Any guidance from parents sounds like \\"nagging\\" - this book guides teenegers (and pre-teens)giving them good tips.

Given that I had toxemia and was swelled up like the Stay-Puft marshmallow woman, that was the last thing I wanted to hear! I don't think it's especially true, and is certainly unsupportive. The book also induced some moments of paranoia in me, particularly the section on which drugs are safe/unsafe in pregnancy. She lists sulfa drugs as unsafe, and I was prescribed one of them for a UTI in the beginning of my third trimester. You can imagine the panicked call to my OB after I read that. Pass this book by.

It is my prediction that as these guys continue to work together, each CD will get better and better. Broken Boy Soldiers is a great start for an excellent band. Some of the best songs are Hands, Level, Blue Veins and Steady as She Goes (duh). Intimate Secretary is quirky and fun, and Yellow Sun is just happy and a good song.You should buy this CD.

Fabulous! Truly these musicians enjoy what they do and each others company. Only through genuine collaboration could such a creation happen. They had me from the first song to the last. The style is definately not that of amateurs. Well produced but not to the point that it sounds plastic. In fact one thing I love the most is how they have retained a slight raw edge that was quite refreshing.

I have Get Behind Me Satan by the White Stripes and I do like it, but this is far better. The collection of songs is so different that it truly is like listening to a Zeppelin album. Zeppelin was often pigeon-holed as a heavy metal band, which is so untrue -- they played such a diverse mix of music. FINALLY a band that is doing the same.

Bottom line, this is a side project that will not likely succeed.N.B. - I saw these guys play live at the 2006 Virgin Fest near Baltimore, MD.....they were disapointing. However, another band that played Virgin Fest, Wolfmother, got the crowd into it and played a hard, driving, and deep set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Is Better","review":"The music is overproduced, the melodies are boring, and the performances seem uninspired. None of the songs are great although some of them are ok.It reminds me of a failed version of what XTC did as The Dukes Of The Stratosphere- talking their love of 60's psychedelic music and wearing their influences unabashedly on their sleeve.If you are expecting anything close to the originality or energy of A White Stripes' album this will be a big let down.P.S.- I had no idea that Jack White could do such a dead-on imitation of Robert Plant (a la Immigrant Song) on the title song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, overhyped crapola","review":"One decent song & 9 songs of vapid filler.

Just listen to the White Stripe's first 4 albums. Rolling Stone magazine said this was better than your best Foghat album. I listened to some Foghat at the store. It's not.White should stick to his original band & do some producing on the side. The Raconteurs were compared (for some odd reason) to bands of the 1970's. It sounds exactly like all the other pop that comes out now. The song \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" was good. Maybe better than most of the songs on the White Stripe's Get Behind Me Satan. Everything else on this album was... well, bad. Long story short, I sold it back after 3 listenings.So, don't believe the hype & don't waste money on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Do Emile Male's Work Justice","review":"This book is composed of excerpts from Emile Male's more weighty tomes on French religious art.

Mr. Bass captures a spirit and heart in Monte Carlo that bridges between the fantasy world of super-wealth and the dreams of individual shortcomings. The style fits the narrative (I don&#65533;t agree that it&#65533;s confusing nor do I think it&#65533;s sexist). It&#65533;s plain fun, a fantasy reminiscent of 1950&#65533;s sensibility (with a modern sexual appeal) captured in a Cinderella spirit that works for both the male and female reader (guys will get a kick out of the &#65533;debonair&#65533; ladies-men who are just as sad, shallow, hopeful and full of life as the female protagonists).

The authors treat the broken heart as a universal phenomenon, one that every human goes through at least once in their lives. I found this insight very comforting, knowing that there were millions of other people with similar feelings. The authors clearly speak from experience. They are consequently sympathetic towards the broken heart, but that does not stop them from offering a gung-ho program for people finally to start healing themselves and learning to love again. This book also offers helpful advice on how to establish an effective physical platform from which to initiate the psychological healing process: eating right, exercising, etc. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Sari","review":"My ex boyfriend used to adapt a quote from the old movie LOVE STORY when he would joke and say 'Love means always having to say Sari' I hope this translates so you understand.

I was disappointed. Maybe I've read too many of these kinds of books so there was really nothing new to be learned. I found the advice a little too impersonal and clinical. There were a few good points that I made notes on but on the whole not a real help to me. (I found \\"Getting Past Your Breakup\\" by Susan Elliott much more impactful for me.)

Well, it *was* easy to read because it is very clearly written, and very direct and focused. It took me longer than expected to read because the SUBSTANCE of the book is so compelling. The chapters and exercises really hit home and provoke a lot of contemplation and action. I have already ordered a copy for a friend and highly recommend this book to anyone who has either recently lost a love relationship, or who hasn't really recovered from the hurts of one or more past relationships, recent or not so recent. This book basically says, YOU are in charge. YOU do the work. YOU need to recognize where you are and what you CAN do about it.

If, however, you find the kind of tips and hints found in most consumer magazines today to be superficial and simplistic, then pass on this book.The authors also make some ridiculous statements that undercut their credibility.

Check any decent dictionary: mourning can occur anytime loss occurs, not just when someone dies."},{"rating":"2","title":"For both sexes","review":"Coping up with a break-up is difficult, let alone healing a broken heart. Break-ups can be forgotten but a broken heart is difficult to mend. Sometimes it would really take a long time for it to heal.

You don't feel as if you have to read everything in depth.While that's not my biggest purpose with film editing, it has a helpful ending when it comes to editing scripts.The biggest takeaway that *I* got from this book? Cut in the movement and keep everything continuous. Sometimes that will actually require removal of frames, but it does wonders for flow.Many say that this book is a must own, but I actually found a good deal of these tips in other texts.

This is the first recording I've picked up of her singing from the mid to late 1950's. What impresses me most is how she sings with great security and an exceptional awareness of the meaning of the lyrics. She is accompanied by backup musicians who are talented enough to be supportive, but not intrusive. The best compliment I can pay is to say that this is one production to which I want to give repeated listening. While a fine restoration job has been done, the overall sound quality falls short of contemporary standards. For Carmen McRae fans this is a truly worthwhile disc.

Pecksniff and his daughters are marvelous creations that make one cringe with embarassment while laughing at their incredible selfishness. Tom Pinch is another character in a distinguished line of \\"too good to be true\\" Dickensian personalities, but he is shown to suffer and grow into a believable human being. The American episodes are biting in their satire, but overall they are on the money. Dickens' contempt for American armchair philosophers and \\"freedom-loving\\" slave owners fueled some of his most pointed social commentary. As always, there is a happy ending, but the plot is more complex than anything Dickens had written before. I have read Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, The Old Curiousity Shop, and Barnaby Rudge, and Martin Chuzzlewit ranks right up there with his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Dickens' best","review":"If you like Dickens, Martin Chuzzlewit is definitely worth the read. Like virtually everything he wrote, this novel is engaging, emotional, and intensely human. It follows a pattern that is bound to seem familiar to those acquainted with Dickens, and has a very Dickensian happy ending; but then, that is what we love about Dickens. There is still something to be said for virtue, and it satisfies our sense of justice when it wins out in the end. That isn't a very modern sentiment, but it is an undeniably good one. This isn't the first book I would recommend for someone wanting to pick up a little Dickens (Tale of Two Cities, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist would probably all come first), but this is worth the read. I give it four stars only because I think it is second-tier Dickens; but second-tier Dickens is still first-rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martin Chuzzlewit","review":"Martin Chuzzlewit one of Dickens's more obscure work, met me with great expectations of works that I had previously read, I dove into this book in earnest. However the long-windedness ultimately resulted in a bit of disappointment. Though one ought not dismiss Dickens' lesser-known works; this is one that could be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martin Chuzzlewit","review":"To send an abridged recorded book without notifying the customer (see your web site; no mention that I could find) about the abridgement is not the sort of business practice I've come to expect from Amazon. I sent it back, of course, hence a waste of time and money not to mention trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like heaven!","review":"Cheap monitor that sounds fantastic. Does it's job well.

Worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Good!","review":"The speakers do a great job for what they are. You might have to tweak the bass boost a little to get it exactly like you like it. Definitely good for PC speakers. Somewhat heavy duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"really nice set of speakers","review":"I got these speakers today. I hooked them up to a behringer xenyx 1002 mixer and my sony boombox. They work really nicely together. The speakers have very nice high sounds...and a boomimg bass. The only problem with them, is that they have a little bit too much bass. I some times have to turn the bass down. But that is not a big deal. These speakers are worth it for the money. They are plenty loud for the 7 watt each(speaker) built-in amplifier. They also only have 1 little \\"sweet spot\\". If you are right between the speakers, and have both of them pointing at your ears, then they sound VERY nice. But if you move away, they sound fine, until you get about 2 feet away from them to the side. Then you can hear the difference. But if you position them right, you don't really notice the difference. Very nice speaker for the price. I reccomend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Wanna Comment 'Bout One Song","review":"Never heard it. Just wanna comment that \\"Heaven Help Me,\\" by Deon Estus (produced by George Michael) is one of the best songs I've ever heard from a bass player. Nice lyrics and melody.

C'est tout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaven part III","review":"couldn't agree more that the only reason for purchasing this CD is the song \\"heaven help me\\" by deon estus w/ george michael. i couldn't be more disappointed that this song hasn't been picked up by more labels for some sort of 80's compilation CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Heaven makes it worth it\\"","review":"I bought this CD solely because of the superb and haunting track Heaven, by Deon Estus (w/ George Michael). The rest of the songs on the CD are obscure and did not really interest me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One song truly stands out....","review":"I originally purchased this CD for a friend who wanted a copy of \\"Heaven Help Me\\" by Deon Estus. The entire CD is dull in comparison to this one song. \\"Heaven Help Me\\" is hauntingly beautiful, especially with background vocals from his friend George Michael.No other song truly stands out except this one. Deon Estus' original solo album is now out of print, so if you're a fan of his, I'd get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HURT NO MORE! THIS WORKS FOR ARTHRITIS PAIN","review":"My 80-year-old mother has had osteoarthritis for as long as I can remember. In the past five years, she has experienced nothing but pain--24/7. Her doctor tried her on anti-inflammatory drugs but they upset her stomach so badly that she was even admitted to the hospital with a possible ulcer. She was taking Tylenol--but it didn't touch the pain she had. I bought Mom this book three weeks ago, and that very day she called her doctor for an Rx of Celebrex. It was amazing to us that within 7 days, she was able to move around more--without hurting. Now, 21-days later, she is out with her friends, going to the mall, and even babysitting my children again. This book DEFINITELY HAS THE CURE FOR ARTHRITIS PAIN!!! I cannot believe it's possible--but it is. If you hurt from arthritis pain--you do not have to hurt anymore! READ THE BOOK--take Celebrex!!!

I take two a day and do the program to end pain as this book describes, I have had NO PAIN in 2 months--it's amazing. I'm active and have lost 15 pounds because I can walk 3 miles a day again.

They were all either too big, too small, too \\"industrial,\\" too flimsy, or too ugly (she's a girl, what can I say?). We saw this one on-line and it looked just right. It has proved to be the perfect case. It is just big enough to carry a few documents in the side pouch. It is well constructed, well padded, and has a comfortable shoulder strap. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinks way too fast","review":"Its very very small, and it sinks too fast. It gets trapped into the small spaces of the gravel and most of it is wasted.

I however, love it and think it's some of Jon's best work. It is my \\"Desert Island\\" CD and I am buying a new limited edition 3rd copy because my original was stolen, and I gave my 2nd to a special person. It is the CD I find myself wearing out at work - I can listen to it all day without getting tired of it and definately the one I would recommend to a non Jovi fan looking to buy something different. (I would also recommend \\"These Days\\" a Jovi album that didn't do to well in The US)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop Playing it","review":"When I got this I had just seen the movie and I place the cd in the cd player and man this a cd for everyone. I love all the songs on here it wonderful I think he did a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrics that will reach out to anyone with a heart","review":"I absolutely loved this album, I love the usual Bon Jovi stuff - and usually Bon Jovi is strong with the melody - But now Jon went solo and wrote one of the most deepest and meaningful albums I've ever heard. Most of the songs have slow and a kinda dark melody to them and the words from especially songs like - \\"Little City\\" (My all time fav.), \\"Aug. 4:15\\" and \\"Destination Anywere\\" make up a truely great album everyone should listen to at least once (although I listen to it very often because it's one of those albums, that u can never get tired of!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohne Jon BonJovi wär die Welt ärmer!","review":"Jon BonJovi, jetzt solo, liefert mit \\"Destination Anywhere\\" eines der besten Alben der Musikgeschichte. Einfühlende Songs vermischt mit rockigen Songs ergeben diese Klasseleistung."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't puke, but I almost fell asleep.","review":"Downer subjects don't require phoned-in, numbly arranged songs -- look at Counting Crows. Once or twice, Jon starts to try to let loose with the amazing vocal instrument he spent years building, but he can't break loose from the sludge of pedestrian arrangements -- a drummer that sounds like a mid-priced machine, backup singers that sound like a sampler. There is no energy or soul to this album -- unless you define soul as \\"I am miserable and telling you about it.\\" For those familiar with the artist, this is like the worst half of 'These Days', only with none of the musicianship of the Bon Jovi band to even begin to carry Jon through. I shoulda bought Richie Sambora's album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best ever YET","review":"I'm not much of a writer, but at least I can say this. This one is very different from what we've been hearing, and it suits my taste much better. This album proved Bon Jovi is still one of the best,if not the best, band around these days, but nothing more than that. Let's hope that these guys keep bringing us great stuff like this in the years to come..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sounds","review":"The way Jon Bon Jovi style is these days is a little softer not so hard rock, but it is still great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic, Brilliant!!!","review":"I've had this CD for a while and just never gave it the attention it deserves. I've been listening to it all day on my iPod. It's an amazing creation! Pure Jon; pure poetry; full of the kind of fine sensibility that informs all of his best work! I want more of this. Jon, it's time to make another one like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Review","review":"Count this as 2.5 stars. Highlights: Every Word Was A Piece Of My Heart, Destination Anywhere, August 7, 4:15. Lowlights: Queen Of New Orleans, It's Just Me. Jon Bon Jovi experimenting and going for a pop sound. While I can appreciate the album and what he's trying accomplish unfortunately it seems like it came out when his voice was at it's weakest - I don't know why. He just doesn't sound anywhere near as good as \\"These Days\\" and didn't fully regain it until \\"Bounce\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I like him best with the rest of Bon Jovi and his collaborations with Richie Sambora. It's an Ok CD, nothing to write home about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Natural Progression","review":"I'm a long-time Bon Jovi and Jon Bon Jovi fan, and I admit that I didn't like this album the first time I heard it. It isn't the same stuff we BJ fans are used to. BUT, now I love this album fo the same reasons I didn't like it the first time I heard it. It's mellow, muted, and introspective. It appeals to the adult in me, whereas pre-These Days albums appealed to the teenager in me. Jon grew up, just like the rest of us, and his writing has done something I didn't ever think it could do - improve. This is a very good album; it's worth listening too just to hear \\"Naked.\\" (Because after all, we girls STILL feel butterflies in our stomachs and picture Jon climbing out of a deep slumber in our beds when he uses that husky speaking voice!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Neglected Gem","review":"I bought this cd when it came out, and loved it right away. I still listen to it regularly, and continue to be amazed that none of the tracks were ever released as singles. \\"Midnight in Chelsea\\" and \\"Queen of New Orleans\\" are just two of the many great songs that are better than a lot of the junk that makes it onto the airwaves, so the lack of attention to the only solo release from such a major talent is inexplicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"mellow,no spunk, i'm sad that bon jovi broke up","review":"they lost it after fame,bon jovi,along with sambora went from action to soap operas,very dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTLY AWFUL !","review":"Is this for real?

It should be called Destination down the tube.I'm a diehard Bon Jovi fan from New Jersey and I cannot believe he released this tragedy.I love all the CD's from Bon Jovi but this solo by Jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.And for Richie,Bryan and Tico, please don't let Jon out of your sight again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well kept secret -- Leave it that way","review":"As a born-again Bon Jovi fan (last 4 years or so), I was surprised that I had never heard of this CD until recently. When I bought it, however, I realized why I hadn't heard of it. It's, well, pretty dreadful. Why someone who is surrounded on a daily basis by the musical talents of Richie Sambora, Tico Torres and David Bryan would find it necessary to seek out a different band is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HOA Book","review":"This book is well written without a lot of \\"fluffy\\" space filling verbiage.

They do NOT look out for homeowner rights. HOA's are a cash cow for their members, thus they have every intention of furthering their spread throughout the country. The book glosses over the inherent problems of the private government system for that very reason. That being said, if all board members had to read this before proceeding to wreak havoc on their neighbors, it would be a good thing. Most board members don't know anything and don't bother to learn. HOA's can be very scary places, and you can find yourself trapped in a bad one quite easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Yadda Yadda Yadda","review":"This entire book is the equivalent of the prelude in a beginners HOA book.

My favorite devil will always be the first, Lord Pluie.I must admit, the excessive dress changes (from school uniform/civilian clothes to wedding dresses to skimpy fighting outfits) did get on my nerves, as did the girls tendency to get the attention of the bad guy first AND THEN change into their alter egos. Good thing they always win, or they would have had problems.Maybe my problems stem from the fact that I am no longer in the target age group.

Needless to say I had to return this because it was just too big and uncomfortable. The item I got was just not what I expected. I wish these would come in sizes instead of one size fits all, I think it would have worked had it been by sizes.

I don't, as I think the music is more important than the standard rock n roll lifestyle (why is Gram's story any more interesting in this regard than that of Mick Jagger, Jim Morrison, Sid Vicious, Led Zeppelin, etc). Little is mentioned about how Gram tried to meld rock, country, soul (never mentioned!), and gospel, what effect this had on rock and country, who his musical antecedents and followers were, and so on. The actual music on the albums is barely talked about. It's all about his life and not about his music. If that's your bag, buy this.

As Emmylou Harris remarks in this DVD, \\"People should remember Gram by his music, not the way he died.\\" Or the way he lived, I would add.There is little about Gram's music on here, which is very frustrating. Chris Hillman makes a few remarks about Gram's songs, and they show short clips from the Flying Burrito Brothers videos. Especially frustrating was that they showed more of the Eagles \\"Take It Easy\\" than of any of the Burritos' videos. Ugh, the Eagles.Another problem with this documentary is that there are only the interviews - there is no narrative of any kind, even though it claims to have been \\"written\\" by Sid Griffin and the director.

No disrespect to Vince, he's really great, but singer John Corabi is deeper-voiced, and that's part of what makes this album so unique. He adds a little more anger and spirit to the sound. It is also an extremely well produced album (by Bob Rock). The sound is incredibly powerful. The riffs have a lot of depth, very Sabbath-like, in fact, Mick Mars never sounded better. But the best part is Tommy Lee's drumming. He has here one of the greatest drumming sound ever recorded in rock and roll history. And he's a kick*ss drummer... Violent, agressive, groovy, wild... he's the man. He's not very technical, like, for example, Neil Peart (Rush), but he is soooooo entertaining! The songs are pretty well crafted, certainly not as catchy as the Dr. Feelgood-era songs were, but more serious and mean. You just never mess with Nikki Sixx... A surprisingly great rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think what you want, but...","review":"I have about 1,500 cd's in my collection and after nearly 10 years, I still think this is among the best cd's I've ever bought (if not the best). When it was reissued, I bought that as well for the extra songs and those are great as well. Every single song here is very good. If your a fan of hard rock or the crue, you should really have this cd. Nothing disappoints on this disk. John Corabi was more than able at not only replacing Vince Neil, but out did Vince all the way through. Johns voice, singing, and guitar playing is great and it helps bring out the musicians in the rest of the gang. Highlights are \\"Misunderstood\\", \\"Uncle Jack\\", \\"Loveshine\\", \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\", \\"Driftaway\\"..., well you get the point. F*%k Vince. Long live the Crue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album! But the band should have changed their name during Corabi era...","review":"As a big Motley Crue and Vince Neil fan I kind of found this album a bit sacrilegious. But I have to admit it is a damn good album. In essence, perhaps the temporary split between Vince and the Crue was a good thing being that Vince's solo albums were tremendous and I guess that inspired Motley to turn up the power for their own album. Sadly, I traded this album in quite a few years ago. The funny thing is, if it was under a different name, I don't think I would have. It's just that no one replaces Vince in Motley Crue!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hard rock epic or heavy metal epic?","review":"This album has hard rock and heavy metal elements in it. It is one of the crue's best albums ever maybe even their best. This album has a very epic sound to it. Even if you don't like motley crue you will still like this album if you are a hard rock or metal fan. If not then you are not a hard rock or metal fan. Tommy's drum playing here are some of the best too. John Corabi is an amazing singer/song writer with so much talent. What are you waiting for buy this album, if you don't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Crue disc ever made","review":"Vince Neil can't hold a candle to John Corabi. Corbai adds another element to the Crue that i wish lasted longer than just one disc. I had a chance to meet John Corabi after he was dumped by Nikki Sixx and told him what i just said.

If you don't have it, get it. you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Corabi, Rocks!!!!","review":"This is Crue's second best album (after Shout At The Devil).

Where's Vince Neil? Initially, I dissed this record because of Neil's absence. Then I listened to it. It's a different sound -- more grunge than metal. However, different doesn't have to be bad. For the music, Corabi sounds perfect. This probably would not have worked if Vince was with the band. Sixx is still the primary songwriter so it's still Motley -- only harder. To the uninitiated, you wouldn't know it was Motley Crue if no one told you. Recommended, but only after you get the original Crue records."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"With xylitol?\\" That's misleading labeling...","review":"There are a lot of reported benefits to xylitol, but Trident is just using it as a marketing gimmick here.

If you don't know the history of the lady or the genre then it's hard to take the seemingly 'la-de-da' reviews for her with any weight.

No, I don't think so (I actually prefer the other female Gilberto, Bebel, though I like Astrud's works). Are there other artists that deserve their own Finest Hour releases? Again, yes. But bear in mind that this is supposed to be a release for US audiences of what one record company thinks is the definitive work of one of their artists.

It has become enshrined as a results-oriented, experimental philosophy. Novack points out that although the starting point may be sound, empiricism is no longer adequate to understand the world, human society, and how to join with others to change history. None of these last points are recognized as possibilities by the self-indulgent and indecisive empiricism promoted by capitalist institutions today. Dialectical materialism, on the other hand, looks at the root causes of events and takes a moral and political stand with a confidence based on scientific knowledge. Academic philosophers will not read this book and probably couldn't understand it.. It's written for you, the working class activist who wants to become more effective by understanding where you fit into the history of ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsettling","review":"A disturbing desperation on almost every page.

If you are expecting insights into his movies or TV shows, you won't find it here. Instead he goes back--as far back as the early 1900s--to tell supposedly funny stories about the theatre and movies. Most of the stories are second-hand and he admits that many are possibly not true! He also tells some dirty jokes and shows very little class. A major disappointment, not what you'd expect from Tony Randall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Ancient, poor translation","review":"I purchased this and regret it. The translation is from the early 20th century and this volume is from one of those discount publishers that use writing that has fallen out of copyright. They don't even disclose who the translator is -- but he or she did a poor job.Much better is to purchase Hollingdale's translation (or probably any modern translation) of the Untimely Mediations. Use and Abuse of History is the second essay in that volume.The work itself, of course, is incredible. This review is about the translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation","review":"This is a great introduction to Jeff Beck. From the mid to late 60's to the late 80's a large chunk of the mans career is covered. Many different styles are covered from blues based material down to more Jazz-Rock based stuff such 'Blue Wind' recorded with the the Jan Hammer group in 1976 and 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' recorded a year earlier. Whatever style he plays Jeff Beck always lets the soulful side of the guitar come through. There is a much more comprehensive 3 CD boxed set available called 'Beckology', but if you're really unsure about whether to take a chance this is as good a place to start as any."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best of the best","review":"I brought this Cd 2 years ago from the gift shop at the National Zoo in Washington, DC.

It looks just like the regular Little Golden Book on the screen. It opens and the words are just as they are in the paper book (a big plus I think) and highlights the words as it reads. It flips pages just like a paper book.This is a good find!

However I would have to rate this book with 4 stars. Simply just becasue I didn't like the beginning. The beginning part of the story is very boring until you reach the middle where all of the action starts. To me Margaret used tons of details and quotes in the beginning such as, \\" retreating, like precisely spaced bloms in a park garden, they rose on long green stems that curved elegantly at the top, then blossomed into hoods of deep crimson.\\" That was one part that really got me involved in the book, with the words flowing all perfectly together. However, she used to much detail to set the stage. To me it seemed to take six chapters till we finally got to the action. Some people might like that, but personally I am not one of those people. so if you stick with the book I assure you that you will not be disappointed int the end, because this book has a fantastic and puzzling ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one weird ride","review":"This was a very well writen and entertaining book. Margaret Mahy does a great job in spreading out the action and discribing all of the caricters. The setting is one that most people can not relate to and I think that makes it more interesting. The book may be a little bit confusing but that is only because the caracters themselfs are confused.Ellis, the main character in the story had just come home from college and is trying to get over is best friends suicide. This book is about 24 hours of Ellis first day back. The 24 hours of exacly what he needs to cupe with his friends suicide.The book was very exciting and action packed. Full of car chases and drinkig, along with lust, and an incredibly weird neiborhood.

This book promotes more of a home version of factory farming. With suggestions like penning your animals up instead of allowing them to graze on pasture and one way of disposing of unwanted buck kids is to \\"drowned them in a bucket of water\\". I hardly see how this is in Story's \\"theme\\" of harmony with nature. JD Belanger's eliteist attitude is also very annoying. Also to contradict his rants, woven wire works fine, you can keep a buck with your does, its cheaper, easier, and BETTER to put your goats on pasture (if avaliable). And its OK to sell an undesireable goat to someone for a pet as opposed to destroying it as he suggests.

If they did, it would get a lot more attention because it's simply entertaining.The DVD has been out-of-print for quite awhile and expensive to get.The 80-some minute story moves along very fast and has good characters. Robin Riker, as \\"Denise Gore,\\" has a great face and - at least for me - alone is worth seeing the film. The same goes for Amy Dolenz, who is a lot of fun as \\"Wendy.\\" Alan Thicke amazed me with his violin talents.The only bad part is the special-effects, which are poor considering the year this was made (1993) but it is still a very good B-movie that should appeal to kids and adults. I read someplace were adults wouldn't like this, but I'm up in age and I really enjoyed it. However, I wouldn't have little kids seeing this, though.I hope this comes back on DVD because I'd like to see it again.

To end a series in a way that actually insults the readers is hard to do, but Johnstone did it with this one.

I have enjoyed almost all of the books, but to end it like this is an insult. You had the most powerful and well-trained army in the world in the most secure section of the country. Yet in this book it was like we were dealing with a troop of Cub Scouts. To kill Buddy in the manner that it was done was just a total waste, and to kill everyone else with a virus from space come on. If Mr. Johnstone wanted to start a new series then do so, but to ruin this one to do it was just wrong. If you wanted to kill everyone off then do it in one last all out battle to end all battles the rebels against the rest of the world! If nothing else let it end as a stand off with the rebels in the SUSA and the rest of the world on it's own.

I agree that the authors been in a rut for some time and that some of his later books were becoming repetive but I'd hoped that he would snap out of it. I'll probably buy the first book in the new series but after the way he ended this series I'd hate to get wrapped up with a new series and be let down this bad. Space spores killing off the entire rebel nation??? Buddy Raines killed in such a disrespectful manner??? A complete lack of buildup for who is supposed the be the primary character in the next series? If spores have landed all over the world why would Rebel forces leave established positions and regroup in Mexico???"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real shame","review":"As I read all the other reviews, there isnt too much that I can add, as many others, I have been with this series since 1983 when \\"Out of the Ashes\\" began the great adventure. During the last few books in this series, I noticed that the \\"feel\\" I got when reading what was my favorite series was that the end was near. I can understand bringing the series to an end, but have to say that it could have been done with much more grace. I had to review the book several times to see if I could find what happened to Cecil, Ike, and many of the other characters that has been with us all along. There was no mention of these characters, what happened to them???Jumping from destroying the bad guys in Canada to where Ben dies just didnt have any kind of flow too it.

I grew up on this series and to end it like this is a slap in the face. I will never read Johnstone again. The killing of Buddy was a joke as the TEAM never went anywhere without the unit. This one time he was a alone. The attack by the blackshirts? Never before was anyone able to enter the SUSA undetected, but this time multiple times by multiple units? Then a virus from outer space just to start a new series. The old crew could have retired and let Buddy and his group take over where Ben left off!

I must say the last edition of the series is TERRIBLE! I should ask for my money back! It looks like the author simply got tired writing and decided to let some ghost virus kill everyone off. The author didn't even have the energy to develop the virus and give us a good death scene for the popular characters. The lead character, Ben, has beaten all sorts of odds in this series. His death in this book was bland and without feeling. I guess this is what happens when someone writes for the money and not for the fans. Ben should have died of old age telling stories. No action death scene was appropriate. My advice to similar fans is DON'T BUY any more of Willian Johnstone's books! I will not read the new series!

The reason we like this one so much is of the high quality glass bowls included and the assortment of beaters that are included.

The top part that slides up for easy bowl removal popped right off. I was able to reattach but very annoying that it only had so far a range of movement before it popped out of its socket. Then, the button that you push to release the beaters did not work. I couldn't remove the beaters!!! I pushed the button several times to release only for it to release the beaters and the button fell INTO the machine never to be seen again. I decided that was it. Wrapped it back up and sent it back to Amazon TODAY! I'm going to suck it up and buy a Kitchenaid or Hamilton Beach. Just say no to Sunbeam!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"We had high hopes for this unit as we didn't want to spend the money on a KitchenAid. The unit looks nice out of the box, but you can tell from the weight that there isn't much substance to it. When we mixed a cake, the beaters kept falling out of the head and into the bowl. We packed it up and sent it back. Amazon was swift and efficient in getting the product returned and our money back. Thanks Amazon.We eventually bought the KitchenAid tilt-up mixer and it has performed well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I think I got a refurbished unit. It has a lot of scratches and stains. I'm really disappointed with what amazon sent me. I want to return the mixer but since I live in Japan, shipping to the US would cost me almost the same amount or even more when I've purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mixer","review":"This mixer works very well, especially for the price. I was not going to spend a few hundred dollars for a Kitchen Aid so decided on this one. It has dough hooks and whisks along with the beaters so it does everything I could ask for in a mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service","review":"I ordered this from Amazon and did not open the box for two months because my oven was not working properly and I was waiting on it to be fixed. The mixer did not work from the minute I opened it. The bowl did not rotate continuously and the beaters did not snap into the mixer. The manual instructs you to call the Sunbeam number. It is an automated system and one of the option is \\"does the bowl not rotate properly.\\" They instruct you to call a service provider. The nearest one to me is over three hours away. The employee told me that if I could not bring this in, I could ship it with the invoice and my complaint. I had to pay $19.00 to ship this. I should have opened the box sooner and tried the mixer so that I could have returned it to Amazon. I still can't believe that a good company like Sunbeam gives such poor customer service. I will never buy another Sunbeam product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo. sooooo bad","review":"After I bought it I told my daughter and she said that she got one 4 years ago and it did not work. I thought that they would have had to improve it by now. First of all the beaters do not have a shaft going throiugh the middle and a tiny bolt holds them together at the bottom. This seems to weaken the beaters. I tried to cream butter and it threw the butter out of the bowl in chunks. It was sooooo bad. I was very digusted at how badly it preformed...... nothing like the older mixmasters. I took it back and ordered some older models from Ebay to give as gifts for my kids. Even the refurbished ones that are from the 40s or 50s would definately be better to purchase than this terrible, but attractive piece of work! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had two burned out about a year after purchase.

I use it mostly at Christmas season. The last one I had for two weeks and the motor burned out mixing cookie dough (not stiff, as I finished beating it by hand easily--and I am 82 years old!!.).

As another review said, triple your recipe and hers burnt out, so did mine. Smoke wisped out of the front and it ceased never to spin again. Sad part was it wasnt even spinning fast, medium slow to be easy on it.I have an old sunbeam handmixer, about 20 years old and it works fine.

You need a magnifying glass to read it though. As some other reviewers mentioned, I too find that the mixer does not get everything off the bottom. It's like the beaters are up too high. I will leave at 4 stars because of this. It is still a pretty good blender though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I love this mixer! This is the first time in my life having one of these at 66 years old. Have always had a hand held unit.

This was exactly what I was looking for as it does everything I need it to do. I am very pleased with it. My only reason for the rating of 4 is that the glass bowls are very heavy for me to lift when pouring batter into the pan. I know that stainless steel bowls are available but I chose the glass bowls for there durability and sturdiness. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunbeam 2371 Mix Master bowls inferior","review":"I have been disappointed with Sunbeam 2371 MixMaster mixing bowls. I ordered this inexpensive mixer and set up the mixer to discover the larger mixing bowl had a hairline crack. Amazon was wonderful to send a replacement immediately which I checked out carefully. There were no cracks in either of the bowls included with the mixer. However, I used the mixer one time with the larger bowl and put it through the dishwasher...only to discover that a hairline crack has appeared on this REPLACEMENT mixer's large bowl. Something is amiss here. Bowls to be used in today's kitchen need to be a much higher quality than this AND dishwasher safe. Very very poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow pace good for baking with little children ... until it breaks","review":"I bought this strictly for nostalgia, as my mother had the original model throughout my childhood. Hers was all metal, this one all plastic, and it shows.I've used the mixer a few dozen times in three years, always for cakes or icing. I never had confidence it could handle any kind of thick batter. But for my purposes, it was perfect -- I wanted the slow, not-scary rotating bowl for baking with my daughter while she was 2 and then 3. She could stand right next to me and see what was happening, just as I did with my mom way back when.Then last week, the entire back end with the speed dial just fell off. I can't even figure out how it stayed on in the first place, it's so rickety. So out it goes. I enjoyed it while it lasted but, really, it's a pretty sad excuse for a mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"Third time I used it, was making a soft pumpkin drop cookie, 2/3 the way through mixing the batter it quit. I thought it may have overheated. 2 hours later it was still dead. Researched to find out the problem is they use plastic gears ... very disappointed in Sunbeam! This mixer replaced a 1970's model that I used avidly from roll out sugar cookie dough to mashing potatoes. If you are a serious baker, or even half serious, this is not the mixer for you!

I find this collection more adventurous than Chronicles, I am actually kind of excited about listening to it (even though I have heard all but 3 of these songs before) I am really happy they included \\"mission,\\" that is definitely a favorite, and the normal version of \\"mystic rythms,\\" and more obscure Rush songs that are good, but where is \\"afterimage\\" and \\"between the wheels\\" and \\"yyz\\" and \\"manhattan project\\" and \\"the camera eye\\" and \\"witch hunt\\" and \\"vital signs\\" and anything from Power Windows?see, you have to assemble a set that includes everything.

For a new listner, this album falls far short of Chronicles. For the old die-hards, it's very disappointing.

The XFO would climb to about 10 -15' of altitude and the motor would begin to pulse on and off. moving the transmitter stick seemed to have little to no effect. This made for difficult contol. Problem was solved by unwinding the antenna wire inside the XFO and bringing it out through the side and scotch tapeing it in place along the length of one of the fins. Still, there times when the motor cant be shut off from the transmitterduring a landing which flops over.

If you can picture the laid back sound of Blues Project's \\"Flute Thing\\" spread over an album, you are very warmMontgomery was not flashy. He had a distinct, chopping comp style, and extremely fluid leads. I described this as laid back, and that really fits. Montgomery's smokey jazz is about the art of ease and restraint.

Silly me, I thought I was purchasing a very recent publication. Although very readable, the book clearly displayed the knowledge about Darius available to the nineteenth century reader and nothing more recent.

This book anticipates writers such as Hubert Selby in the examination of evil; its characters are very well drawn, the crime itself is hideous but mostly kept off the page, the society that allows it is dissected with unflinching attention. Kersh does spin incredibly strong sentences, and often touches the bottom of his characters' souls. But no picnics or fairy tales here. Tough stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detroit with Mitch Ryder","review":"This is Detroit rock and Mitch Ryder at his best. With Jim McCarty on guitar and Johnny \\"B\\" Banazak on drums, this music has a drive that never quits. Not even after 35 years. Mitch took Lou Reed's \\"Rock n Roll\\" and made it his own song. After this, Mitch had to retire for years to save his vocal chords.That should tell how how much effort Mitch Ryder put into this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"This set moves to the top of my DVD collection favorites","review":"I am so thrilled to have all of the Nick & Nora movies in a boxed set at such a reasonable price. It's great to watch the movies in a sitting or 2 and see how the couple evolved over time. Myrna got more lines and Asta got more scenes as the \\"series\\" went on, but the same basic charming qualities of the original movie were consistent throughout including the big \\"whodunit\\" scene at the end where all the players are in a room at the same time and Nick methodically deduces who the killer must be.I loved the bonus DVD with features on William Powell and Myrna Loy. Fans of Bravo TV will be pleased to see that Andy Cohen produced the one on Myrna.I really do wish there had been a booklet with the set, as I found myself looking up the actors I recognized from other movies from the 40s online or grabbing the Murder over Cocktails book by Charles Tranberg to look things up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my kids love these films!","review":"I had only seen 2 or 3 of these before so I had to have this set.

It is unfortunate that it is not more widely remembered. I was introduced as a result of exploring the filmography of James Stewart.

It is top drawer from the first to the last film in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Entertaining!!!","review":"I have been a fan of Nick and Nora ever since I saw the first Thin Man movie many years ago, so when I saw this set for sale I immediately jumped at the opportunity to own a copy of all five for myself.I was not disappointed.All of the movies are lovely, and the extra documentary DVD about the lives/careers of Powell and Loy is equally delightful.I most gladly recommend this set to any Thin Man fan, or to any person craving a good dose witty banter, clever sleuthing, and superb acting.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Thin Man Collection","review":"Myrna Loy and William Powell were superb together. They seemed to have a sixth sense for each other. Contrived by todays standards, I suppose as far as the script is concerned, but watching each as a period piece produces entertaining viewing.

Nick and Nora Charles are even more fun when viewed without commercial interruptions.If you enjoy slapstick comedy, razor-sharp writing and talented stars who are perfect foils for one another, this is a near-perfect choice.Having been made in another era, these black-and-white movies make light of Nick's excessive drinking. With the exception of that one caveat, though, I wholeheartedly recommend you sit back and prepare to enjoy a wonderful ride through the mad world of the Charles family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Detective Series","review":"My wife and I enjoy watching mysteries. One of her favorites is the Thin Man series. I was not all that into it until I watched the first in the series and now I am hooked.

In fact, we like Nora Charles' quick-witted, stylish yet down-to-earth character so much that we named our daughter after her! We put off buying the individual releases in the hopes that a set would show up, and we are thrilled - our Nora just turned 3, but I hope she likes these movies half as much as we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will be all over this","review":"I just found out about the near future release of The Thin Man DVD box set and I am THRILLED!!!! I've been waiting for this one for quite some time, and it's LONG overdue! As far as I'm concerned, William Powell & Myrna Loy are THE silver screen duo to beat. They had a chemistry no other screen couple ever had. As great as they were individually (and they were GREAT), whenever I see them separately in other films, something is missing. If I watch a Myrna Loy picture, I'm like,\\"Where is William Powell?\\" and vice versa. Now I'm not putting them down by any means. Simply put, it's just not the same seeing one without the other. That's how great they were together. Theirs was a partnership that will never be matched.So, if you want a chemistry lesson, put down your science books, pop in these wonderful movies and get ready to be educated. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"If you like Nick & Nora, you've gotta have this collection.

No matter what I watch these movies over and over again. Any excuse, it's raining yes watch a TM movie, better still watch more than one. Charm, humor, chemistry right down to the dog who was funny.

It is nice to watch movies as they used to be - clever, but without gratuitous and tasteless sex or violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old-fashioned fun","review":"I had seen some of these in clipped form on TV when I was young. But the whole thing includes some pretty sophisticated humor, a few people you will recognize who got famous later, and a lot of good fun. Nick and Nora are a charming couple, really in love with one another and quite able to banter about how unusual that is for a married couple. Asta the dog is a full-fledged member of the sleuthing team, and one very talented pup. They have a baby in the third movie, but he doesn't slow them down at all, and in fact becomes a foil for some pretty broad comedy. In the last one, he's old enough to assist in sleuthing, and is very, very clever.All in all, a lot of fun. They are period pieces, of course, and must be accepted in that context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"This is a set of classic movies from long ago. They are all enjoyable - fun to watch. If you enjoy old movies (and who doesn't) you will love this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I'm in Love","review":"We bought this movie as a Christmas present for ourselves. We love classic movies, but had never seen any of the Thin Man movies. We decided to buy the whole set, and what a wonderful surprise. It took a lot of self control to NOT watch them all in one weekend. Like everyone else has been saying, William Powell and Myrna Loy have a great on screen chemistry. Not just the dialog, but the looks, the expressions, the exchanged glances.And yes, I think that I have fallen in love with Nora Charles."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"HOW CAN YOU NOT GET A GREAT PAIRING OF WILLIAM POWELL & MYRNA LOY(NOT TYRONE POWERS).AFTER SEEING RERUNS ON TURNER CLASSIC MOVIE CHANNEL, THEY NEVER GROW OLD.THANK YOU TED FOR GIVING US THE COLLECTION.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thin Man Collection","review":"I love The Thin Man movies, and any other movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy. They are very enjoyable. I really love the old movies, much more than most of the movies produced today. My husband and I get all the premium channels available, and there are really very few movies made in the past ten or fifteen years that we consider memorable.

My dad happened to catch it on PBS one afternoon, and about half-way through, it caught my attention. When it was all done, I knew I had to see it from the start. I have now watched it many, many times (since I first saw it over 12 years ago). In fact, this movie was what helped me convince my hubby ( a previously die-hard action flick man) to watch classic films. He is now as big a buff as I am. Remember, a dry martini is alway shaken to waltz time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still funny after all these years","review":"I love this collection.

We would watch on television on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. At first I did not want to watch such and old film but the more I got into it the more I loved these films. The chemistry between William Powell and Myrna Loy is excellent and feels so natural. You sometimes forget that you are watching two actors and that it is an actual couple up on the screen. Each film is a joy to watch and I am glad that all of these films have finally been released on DVD. And not only that but they have one of the best presentations I have seen. This set is loaded with loads of extras and the films look great. Purchasing this set was a no brainer and I think it will make a great addition to any DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore","review":"These have to be some of the most entertaining, imaginative, and just plain wonderful movies to ever come out of Hollywood. No one since then has come close to William Powell and Myrna Loy for charisma and charm as a couple (not forgetting Asta, of course). They make it all look so effortless---shaking martinis, wearing silly hats, chasing bad guys----and still looking like a million bucks! All the films are terrific, particularly the first four.And no, they really don't make 'em like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection!","review":"A great way to have all 6 Thin Man movies plus an extra bonus DVD with a biography of both William Powell and Myrna Loy.

Yes, certainly the theme is always the same and yes Nick always gets his man, but the array of characters and the interaction bewteen Nick & Nora is very entertaining.

You'll be surprised when you learn how they got started and some of their earlier roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thin Man Collection","review":"Came quickly and in good condition.

The collection contains Nick and Nora on murder cases and their whimsical way of solving these crimes. Their chemistry is highly entertaining as Nora continuously tries to help her husband Nick on each case. They remind me of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy and the movies they did together. You do not necessarily have had to watch them in a row for each movie is its own separate identity. The last dvd is a synopsis of both actors', William Powell and Myrna Loy, biographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I'm in love","review":"\\"The Thin Man\\" was my introduction to the impeccable teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy. I went from never having heard their names, to (thanks in part to this boxed-set), owning all but one of their released-to-DVD films. I can't see why these two aren't more well-remembered today - they are absolutely fantastic!Though the detective story-lines of these films are far from perfect (but really, who watches these for the mystery?), Powell and Loy, especially under the direction of Woody Van Dyke, provide highly enjoyable, entertaining films. No other couple could pull off these characters like William Powell and Myrna Loy, with their combined flair for comedy, charm, wit, and beautiful chemistry.The supplementary disc, \\"Alias Nick and Nora,\\" provides two wonderful documentaries, great for any Powell-Loy fan, and those wanting to know more about the actors who made Nick and Nora one of the best and most lovable on-screen couples in Hollywood history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love old movies!!!!","review":"Just what I wanted.

I first saw these movies on TV when I was a boy, so early in life that I cannot recall a time when I had yet to see them. I give them my highest recommendation: along with The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep, these are the best of the 30's/40's detective movies.

I bought this CD under the assumption that it would sound better than a 27 year old record. I was completely wrong. Whoever mastered this 2002 release used heavy limiting to the point where they have lopped off any and all dynamics in order to make the CD as loud as possible. On top of that, it's not even as clear and defined as the vinyl release. I am NOT an audiophile freak.I would NOT recommend buying this and instead, I recommend buying a used vinyl copy from eBay. There are numerous 12\\" and 7\\" vinyl copies available as I type this.It is not Amazon's fault, but this is the worst product I have ever gotten from them.

These essays were written by one Chinese author and three Japanese authors, over almost a thousand years, ending with Basho. I enjoyed all four essays, but Basho has so much wit to him that I have to say he is my favorite. I love the image he presents: nothing holy or wise, just sitting there admiring the view and squishing lice.

Maybe the translator, Patrick Kerline, is a good writer, but I doubt he invents the style of the book instead of the author. It's a very well writed book, with a fantastic story which proves the fertility of Will Self'imagination, and maybe the best english writer I read for years (Amis is just now the shadow of himself, Kureishi too, I found Mc Liam Wilson recently, particulary with his \\"Ripley Boggle\\", but he's Irish). This book is my W.Self's favorite, because of its complexity, the richness of its characters and again its amazing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-indulgent","review":"Will Self has quite a reputation. At the very least, he is a \\"name\\" in modern letters. I'm not sure why after reading the failed \\"My Idea of Fun.\\" The premise of dreaming a reality isn't even that interesting and the book merely seems to be a chance for the author to print clever sentences. The chapter, \\"The Land of Children's Dreams\\" is the work of an author not experienced in what he is writing about and then taking the advice, \\"ahh, but if the wording is clever that will more than make up for the fact I can't really communicate what I mean.\\" (I've been guilty of it too!) Not a pleasent introduction to a writer who is still able to display some talent in a poor book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastically amateurish and timid","review":"Will Self's debut here in the USA was heralded with an avalanche of the most annoying kind of hype: the evocation of \\"hipster\\" novelists giving him their endorsement. He contrived to be photographed with Martin Amis--or at least menitoned in the same breath. Then came the novel. This novel. Oh, my heavens. Obviously it was delightful to discover just how timid a performance it is, especially after all the crap telling us we were going to be DEEPLY SCANDALIZED by the \\"egdey\\" Mr. Self's shocking world view. Boredom seeps from every page and sentence of this cautious, colorless, humorless disaster.

And while some of it is indeed amusing, it mostly fails to fascinate the reader. It certainly doesn't shock, if that was the author's intention.And what happened to the story? I'm nearly half the way through and thinking things were off to a good start when suddenly the narrative gets lost in some rather dull cul-de-sacs and has to be airlifted to a hasty and unsatisfying finish!Still, not a bad piece of twentieth century fiction, but Martin Amis's praise led me to expect a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and disappointing","review":"I've little to say about this book that hasn't been said better by previous reviewers. I actually came to this link to see what Amazon had to say about I book I found downright awful (kind of to test them). I was happy to see that the full-length review they included panned it. Good for them. As far as the book goes, it's just boring and bad. There are certainly plenty of good books with horrible or despicable protagonist/narrators--Pale Fire, Lolita, even Confederacy of Dunces (on a lighter note; dog-loving there, too, as I recall). This book just ain't one of them.

There's nothing particularly Celtic about the piano part--in fact, it was mostly improvised during the recording sessions (according to the liner notes). But the CD really represents a dialogue across time--fiddle music of another time \\"conversing\\" with piano music of the late 20th century.The passion these two artists bring to this recording is incredible. The emotion of last track, \\"Through the Woods, Laddie,\\" ought to be enough to bring tears to anyone's eyes. Risk and Schwab are both excellent musicians, and this album should appeal to just about anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dialogue Indeed!","review":"These talented ladies interweave their music so well that I sometimes lose track of whether it is the piano or the fiddle that is playing at the time or if it is both.

Truman himself considered Acheson a genius.Mr. Acheson's own memiors, however, obscure the his many achievements, not to mention witticisms, with overly-detailed renditions of treaty negotiations.

The instructions are terribly written, but more importantly the construction is shoddy and dangerous. The bed frame is made of multiple tubes of rolled sheet metal with punched-out holes to insert screws and cross tubes. However, the punched-out holes are often 1) poorly placed, resulting in cross-tubes fitting poorly or not at all, AND 2) occasionally not punched out entirely, resulting in sharp edges that can easily cause a deep cut.This product is a serious safety hazard and should be banned."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to know LotusScript - this is not for you","review":"I expected much more on LotusScript than this book offered.

The pressure is focused at the very tops of the outer ears, rather than evenly distributed over the outer ears. I would describe it as a stinging feeling at the tops of the ears. This of course is highly individual. Maybe people with smaller heads would find these more comfortable.The sound quality in the upper range is tinny. They sound like a cheap transistor radio. This is most evident with orchestral music. Maybe people who like the sound of these headphones are listening to non-acoustic music.They look rather odd when you wear them, because they stick out on the left and right sides at the hinges, where the fixed headband meets the parts that slide out. You won't notice this in photos taken from the side. I do not care for the over-stated branding on the earcups.In the same price range, the Sennheiser PX100 headphones sound better, are more comfortable, and look better.

When doing this, the wires point upward(not 90 degrees, but close), so I have to put the wires up over my head and behind the neck to keep them out of the way.

At the top center of the band, there was a jagged piece of plastic. I am bald, and ouch! it hurt. The wires coming from EACH phone were very thin and obtrusive. Sound quality sucked. I compared them to the sound coming from my Sennheiser sport PMX70 phones. The Senns blew them out of the water, and they were only 20 bucks!I did as other reviewers said and plugged them in and let the Ipod play for a day. No difference.I just ordered the Koss SB49 for the computer.

Even at the low price the headphones weren't worth the money.The headphones press flat and very tightly against the ears, and I could only wear them for about 15 seconds - surprising since I have a small head. For over a half hour after removing them my ears were numb. The cord is way too short to use comfortably with my boombox while sitting in a chair to listen to Hemi-Sync and binaural beat CDs and tapes which produce alpha, theta, and delta states for meditation and exploration.I returned them for the Sennheiser HD 202 which costed only $20.17, and I love the Sennheisers in every respect, and they have about a 10' cord. I had some expensive Sennheisers many years ago for my stereo set and loved them, so I knew that the ear pads would not press against the ear but would go all around the ear instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"From the description on Amazon....Sleek design offers contemporary styling, amazing comfort (if you like tight head squeezing fit) and securityCompletely adjustable,( what adjustability, fits in the top of my ear not the center and their is no adjustment) these headphones fit snug on your head and have hinged arms that fold for safe transportation in stylish metal case.

There is no objective analysis on any political or social issue. Wherever is there, all distortion and manipulative. This books is just another example where conclusion comes before analysis. He picks up data or facts whatever fits his conclusion. There is no totality. He is unhappy about America and instead of constructive analysis, he goes out to find scapegoats - the liberals. Does that make him (or other scapegoat finders) happy? Does that make America better? I doubt. That's why he becomes more and more angry everyday.There is nothing new in this book. He writes the same thing normally he repeats loudly again and again in his show.Anything wrong in America - blame it to Clinton and other liberals.Right wing idea - always good and cannot be wrong (just blind).Rich people pay more tax (he forgets mention that he is not taking about proportion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I would just like to say how much I enjoyed this book.

Mr. Hannity proves this time and time again in his book. If only everyone can have the utmost respect and patriotism as he does, the world would be a better place.

I think I am like most Americans who when really looking at our political parties see that I am not represented well by either.This is by design folks. How could we possibly have any power as a people if we are always divided and arguing with each other.

But who defines the absolutes? Everything isn't black and white, as Hannity believes. He also invokes our \\"founding fathers\\" with a sort of spiritual reverence, without really discussing that their idea of \\"democracy\\" allowed voting only by land-owning males. This is but one example of how notions of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" have shifted over time, as no enlightened person would dare suggest today that minorities, non-land owners or women shouldn't have the right to vote.

He generally has his facts right. But he makes huge quantum leaps from facts to conclusions. His book is a big opportunity for him to whine about Clinton. Sure, Clinton was a joke, but don't waste two chapters complaining about him. The real reason that I am down on Hanity is because he doesn't respect people who have diferent viewpoints. As a result, he is absolutely no fun to hear or watch on TV. He is not sincere and it shows. He makes people feel uncomfortable and is rude. Yes, the liberal agenda bothers me too.

There's no actual need to read this book, as I can sum it up for you in four words: Republicans good, Democrats bad. (In my view, 50% correct). Hannity simply puts forth the Republican, pro-Bush party line on every issue. Everything he says is predictable. Don't waste your time on this book.

Ended up finishing it last night.Mr. Hannity has created a real page turner with this one, and the slightly left of center to the far-right will have a tough time putting this one down. He writes in a very honest tone and in a manner that is not condescending to the reader, unlike a few of his contemporaries who almost seem to ooze with the \\"dont you get it!\\" style of diction. It's refreshing, because I believe many of us do \\"get it\\" or at least appreciate not being lectured to like incompetent children.Why only 4 stars? Well, nothing really new here. Most of the ground he covers has been tread before by other conservative writers and this book is basically another variation on the typical conservative mindset. Nothing wrong with that, but he doesn't have the distinctly unique fire of an Ann Coulter or a Rush Limbaugh.Overall, a well written diatribe of \\"Liberty over Liberalism\\".

Sean GROW UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"page 158 says it all about this douche bag","review":"Mr. Hannity seems to have an obsession with the light in the loafers lifestyle since he devotes most of his bile infected rant to it. So obsessed in fact that the reader is left with the question, \\"what's really going on?\\" It is obvious that his hate is an external manifestation of his inner hate toward himself. Maybe he can't be the person he truly wants to be so he has to attack the object of his inner desires. Moreover, he seemed to know an awful lot about \\"fisting\\"(158) - a little too much if you know what I mean.

First of all Sean goes off on Clintons cheating without mentioning the number of Republicans that had extramarital affairs. He calls Clinton a scumbag for pergery while he hails Poindexter a hero who also pergered himself before congress. He mentions Linda Cahvez and Pete Wilson and their views on immigration without mentioning their own use of illegal immigrants for work. He says that liberals are wrong to say they're pro-choice, shouldnt conservatives be wrong to say they're pro life when they support the death penalty?

How convenient. :)The basic problem I have as a libertarian with conservatives like Hannity is that they are as much anti-liberty as so-called liberals are. They sponsor socialism when it comes to issues of morality and also economic exchanges they happen to disfavor. What they want isn't really liberty - they want a world where people are free to do what they want them to do. Because they've wrapped themselves in words like liberty, they've hollowed out the term to meet their ideology. Its rather sad that this has come to pass, but so be it. Anyway, Hannity isn't committed to \\"freedom\\" so much as he is committed to his rather simple answers that the world throws at him. Which of course makes hima good right-wing poster boy for the folks at Fox News, but it doesn't make him an advocate of freedom.Flame On! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Read, You will love it!","review":"Sean Hannity has written a great book that is full of great facts and insight.

However, I have never enjoyed the writings of such people like Hannity or Limbaugh. The reason is, they are not really conservatives. They want fame and influence. They want to put ideas in the heads of people that quite often don't have any there to begin with. They package it in the form of patriotism, but in reality, it is just egomaniacal. They are Joe McCarthy and Charles Coughlin. GOP Shills and Commerical Opportunists. They do not make well thought out observations. They attempt to smear and spit venom. They simplify ideas so as to gear their message towards the uninformed. As a result, they become the prophets for the ignorant masses.

In fact, when the Constitution was written, democracy was an extremely liberal idea. At the time, monarchy was the trend in most \\"civilized\\" countries, and with the Constitution, America became the first democracy since ancient Greece.

Sadly, these guys are probably the voice of those in the mid-west and the deep south and if you want to put your finger on the pulse of political thought outside of cities like New York, LA, and San Francisco then these are the sorts of guys you have to turn to as the values they argue for are very popular in these necks of the woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannity, America's closed-minded superstar","review":"Bought it, read it...This book is for old ladies who need to reaffirm that their racist, homophobic, closed-minded ways are still the way to think and live.

He is an advocate of more laws about morality and restrictions. Sean's biggest arguement is that the liberals have no good solution to the problem other than communism (come on, really?). I don't know if allowing the CIA to run the country would be much different than communism. He's just playing off people's fears from the past (mostly indoctrination about the evil enemy) to try and keep a stranglehold to the future.

Even for someone who is pulling for him to make his points, you come out feeling somewhat sleezy and sorry for the guy at the same time.

There's no way that such a movement could ever be successful over the long haul, based on the kind of shallow, poorly reasoned, self-serving nonsense laid out in this \\"book\\". Have no fear, folks. This is a fad, like the hula hoop. Eventually it will come to pass that none of this plays out as predicted, and it will lose its momentum. Hannity will be one of those \\"undead\\" like Liddy and North, who have influence within their own choir of braying admirers, but not much pull elsewhere.

After the Cold War, america was looking for an enemy and Sean Hannity has found that indeed, it is us. Or, at least some of us. Liberals. One of the Fox networks \\"unfair and unbalanced\\" conservatives who, more than Tom Brokaw's raised eyebrows, constantly raises his voice against Liberalism, he does it again in his book. As a reviewer says above, Hannity isn't very bright and his views in this book show it. What passes for \\"fair and balanced\\" in Let Freedom Ring, as on Fox is decidedly unfair and unbalanced. Hannity blames Liberalism for all of america's ills. A dangerous and uncharitable view. Re-cycled Rush Limbaugh he, too, preaches to the choir.

The two yanks get lost looking for birds in the Highlands and happen upon the quaint little village of Brigadoon, a town that appears not to have changed for hundreds of years. Gene Kelly stars as Tommy, the American who falls for the beautiful bonny lass, Fiona (Cyd Charisse). The film is full of wonderful dance numbers revolving around these two; after all they were two of America's finest dancers. Van Johnson also stars as Tommy's comical best friend, Jack. Johnson steals just about every scene he's end and that's without doing much dancing. The theme of the show is that love can conquer all, even in an enchanted place such as Brigadoon. Until another time and another place."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, if you love Gene Kelly and dancing...","review":"But not a good guidepost - at all - if you are interested in being in a local production of the musical.

Van Johnson did a decent job playing against type and reminded me of his hoofer roots. And Cyd Charrise was her perenially lovely and swift-footed self. But I am just sort of lukewarm on this one. The songs were o.k. The choreogaphy was good, but the plot lacked something like maybe spontaniety and cleverness. The sets looked flat and uninspired. I didn't get involved in this one at all.I often lament the death of the MGM musical, but here it seems like it really needed a expedidited funeral service.This is one rare example where a great stage musical just didn't translate well as a movie.

Sounds like a formula for a masterpiece, right? Think again. The Lerner and Lowe score has only two memorable songs - \\"Heather on the hill\\" and the misplaced \\"Almost like being in love\\" (misplaced because it seems to have been shoved into this film and doesn't fit the rest of the score either musically or thematically). Gene Kelly's choreography is uninspired here. Some of his dance routines in this film are stolen - move for move - from previous films. Worse, they aren't very good. Cyd Charisse has little to do here except look pretty. Vincent Minelli directs poorly. The film looks stagy. Moving track shots are badly done. We can actually see the film shudder a bit before the camera begins to move. The big crowd dance scenes are awful. This is a third rate MGM musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Gene Kelly movie","review":"Always loved Gene Kelly movies. Great dancer, singer and actor. Always has a good story to tell.

I was expecting a wealth of information and examples on the peculiarities of the CE platform so that I wouldn't have to learn things the hard way. While the book does provide a little bit of the CE material I was looking for, most of what it provides is basic pre-MFC (stone age) windows programming which is virtually useless to an experienced windows programmer. If the reader is a complete neophyte to windows programming, the book might be helpful, if the poor soul was constrained to platforms which are too impotent to support MFC programs.While the book is not a total loss, for me was mostly a waste of money. Try \\"The Windows CE Technology Tutorial\\" by Muench instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is (so far) THE book on programming WindowsCE","review":"Of all the books I looked at for Windows CE programming, this was by far the best. If you've read Petzold's Programming Windows, you'll feel right at home. Has the same style of writing & examples. Easy to pick up for even the novice C/C++ programmer.All code is written in C.

This style may turn off those who are a bit more experienced, but if you can handle the \\"hand holding\\", you will get some great information on programming for the Windows CE platform, including Pocket PC. If you have a cursory knowledge of C/C++, you'll follow this book perfectly.Doug does a great job of not only explaining what XYZ API call is used for, but what all the parameters mean and the options available. He takes great strides to de-mystify daunting API calls that have several paramters by walking through each of them in real examples.If you're looking to start programming for this platform, this book is definately worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely useless","review":"This book gives very, very little insite to anyone actually interested in using eMbedded Visual C++ to write in the Windows CE environment.

His B&B needs constant maintenance and many more guests. He does have a lovely maid named Elise, but unfortunately, a one of his few paying customers ends up murdered at the top of the lighthouse. As the experienced reader expects, the police can't get their act together so Alex and Elise launch their own investigation. Guess who solves the crime?

I give LIGHTHOUSE two stars because my familiarity with this genre is limited and my expectations for quality perhaps misplaced.Unfortunately, halfway through the text, the writer had still failed to create a concrete believable setting for the story. This should be a minimum expectation for any work of fiction. Even the allegedly developed characters are hopelessly flat.

We loved the song and the music video. We were both hoping for a great follow-up to them.Nope. This is nothing more than an Anita Hill, liberal feminist, man basher movie. They concentrated on the whole 'no means no' tag line of Hillary clinton and her ilk of the time. It could have been so much more like the music video. In fact, they could have kept Huey Lewis and stretched the video out another 125 minutes into the movie.Major disappointment. Yes, go ahead and bash me in comments - I don't care.

Unlike 99% of bands today, they're not political, they're not annoying, and they're not self-involved egomaniacs.

How a band like this could not have hit the big time after their first (and only) two albums is beyond me. This is quite possibly my favorite CD of all time. It's an incredible shame to see a band like this break up after an \\"unsuccessful\\" second album (especially when I look at some of today's \\"talent\\").

The band lighten up the beats and a more cheerful country rock sound is b/c of this. Songs such as \\"Tributary Otis\\", \\"Sin Nombre\\", \\"Good Year\\", and \\"Una Soda\\" are excellent songs. \\"Horses\\" is a slight disappointment in the case it really isn't a song, and I'm not too fond of \\"Dolly\\". Other than that, the whole album is strong.I wish this band was around still. They showed great musicianship in their songs and the lyrics are sentimental and tell a story each time. Almost as if they are bar stories or cowboy tales. Whatever way, the songs are good. The Bottle and Fresh Horses is a unique clash of southwest country, and cali rock, all w/ a mexican influence. If you have FFBB give this a shot, I'm sure you'd like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"After repeated listening, I cannot get into this CD the same way that I did their first CD.

While watching the movie I keep fast forwarding. Even without the dialogs I could see what is moving the plot along and what is just time filler.This movie is one of those that shuffles the time line around. First you see something happening now, then you see something that happened before that, then you see something happening now, etc.If they shrink this down to about 45 minutes, it might be worth 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense and surprise","review":"If you like \\"noir\\" and period thrillers, Across the Hall is a movie worth watching.

Already sadly missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISERABLE","review":"This pathetic excuse for a film COULD have MAYBE been interesting if it had been directed any better and if some of the cast had been changed. It was so slow and so boring and so over-acted I could not even force myself to watch the end of it. The plot was too stupid {even for a movie}, its too unbelievable that no one called the cops. All the characters were cardboard cut-out actors pretending to act, even Murphy sucked. If you think this is really a \\"noir\\" style film I feel sorry for you. See some real noir to get an education on it. The film was like a bunch of teenagers getting themselves in stupid situation. No one came off as an adult or a real personality, or dimensional or interesting. Nothing. Very annoying movie. Don't bother !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Across the Mall","review":"Across the Hall (2009) is about a dull man seeking revenge on a cheating Brittany Murphy in a deficient attempt at film noir. This film is inadequate, inferior, and unsatisfactory on all levels. It is an insensitive love triangle gone intolerable and that is all.It's a below average film with a flawed, predictable twist. Nothing is too eye-popping about it.It's a very drudging film, too feebleminded for my brilliant tastes. None of the actors give credible performances, but the hotel assistant provides the most believable execution in his trivial role.There are no adequate actors in the entire film, and the majority of the film was shot in an indistinct studio hotel, mainly on the inside.If you're bored, read a book. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad, bad, bad, bad film: bad plot, bad acting, bad pace","review":"Reading the product description at a DVDXPress kiosk, I immediately knew who \\"the other man\\" was. It was just so obvious. But intrigued by the nice still shot of Brittany Murphy, I decided to rent it anyway. After all, it was only a buck.What a big disappointment! I want my dollar (plus tax) back! The movie is just absolutely terrible in every way, except perhaps camerawork (no shaky shots like those shot on a handheld). The plot, despite the obvious, is just plain boring and empty. To fill the time, the pace of the film is very slow, and the dialogs are extremely corny and annoying. Murphy (I hate to say this, being a fan of hers) looks like she's about to die, and she and the two male leads simply cannot act. The set design is so like one taken out of my high school's senior play.This film tries hard at being stylish, but it's not. It's a bad, bad, bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really don't waste your money","review":"While there is sufficient eye candy for most teenagers, a pretty girl, a creepy motel with a equally creepy bellhop etc, the story line is sub-standard. The whole movie was in a word, predictable. It is a premise that in my opinion has been done to death IE: Guy steals his friends girl / friend wants revenge / sets up the guy for the fall... The actors however, are reasonable, notably the eerie / half-crazy bell boy (who steals the show IMO) & most of the acting is fine. In fact, top notch in a few places but the material is just BAD & their acting wasted on this plot-less drivel. The movie aims to be clever but falls pathetically short of the mark.If you liked \\"B\\" 1950 style drive-ins you'll love the plot line. If not stay away, rent something else & pray the actors can get other jobs (and smarter agents) after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"STYLE AND DISJOINTED","review":"The movie credits starts out as if you were watching a 1960's mystery. The 1920's style hotel and eerie bell hop/ desk clerk gives the movie a surreal Sin City feeling. I was all set up thinking I was going to watch a great movie. Then it happens...the flashbacks. This movie shows you what has happened then uses flashbacks to eventually bring you up to that point, but in a way you didn't expect. Sometimes this works well in a film, sometimes not, especially in this one when you don't know if a scene is a flashback or not until later.

However, from the very beginning, I found myself progressively more and more disappointed. The writing is sub-standard, full of errors and contradictions when some plot line facts weren't kept straight. The scene in which the heroine discovers her old friend's dead body is truly flat, and her demeanor after the fact is unbelievable. She truly seems to have been unaffected by what she's seen, rather than someone trying to put on a brave face. The character of the daughter seems very one-dimensional and without merit.I've always bought Carlene Thompson's books as soon as they were released, without even looking to see what they were about.

I don't know whether the other components work because I never had a need to use them.This raises two concerns. First is the question of reliability if components burn out after a few uses.

That they figure in a romantic triangle together is even better. However, this tale is mostly about the characters' inability to avoid a life either directly in crime or allied to it. As such, it is unrelievedly grim and may be offputting to viewers on that basis alone. I can't help comparing it to \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" that dealt with much more horrific material, every character's descent into drug hell. However, whereas this film was linear and almost plodding at times, \\"Requiem for a Dream, was so artistically done and with such imaginative cutting edge storytelling techniques, that its grim subject matter never sunk it. James Caan is in here playing the lead gangster for perhaps the one zillionith time since his Sonny Corleone \\"Godfather\\" days.

This book is for the most novice or wire working abilities. Unless you have never made a wrapped loop i wouldnt recomend this book. Most of the tutorials in this book are covered online as they are the most basic of abilities used in wire work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing primer","review":"I've heard so much hype recently about wire jewelry, I just had to research it. So, I checked out all the books from my local libraries on wire jewelry making and this book was the best one, so I bought it from Amazon.com. The instructions are easy to understand and the pictures are great. Just a fun book to browse through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Though written several years ago, All Wired Up gave me more helpful advice than any other source I've used since I began toying with jewelry making a couple of years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I really like this book, its very informative with step by step illustrations. However; I would have preferred that there would be more step by step pictures of someone actually making the item versus the illustrations; at least on the more difficult pieces.There is some referencing to previous pages. At first glance it seems like steps are missing but really you just have to go to these other pages to get that particular step. I can see this as a way to save page space in the book but its still kind of annoying.The pictures at the end of the book to show off what you can do with the techniques learned are really inspiring but I would have preferred to see these in-between as more like \\"chapter\\" ends to illustrate that X and X technique was used for R piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner Basics - Yes!","review":"Having absolute no experience in wire working, I was eager to find a book that would teach me the basics in a simple straight-forward way. THIS IS THE BOOK!All Wired Up was written for someone who has the desire to learn, but doesn't know where to start. Large illustrations and easy to follow instructions guide the novice in learning the Basics from simple loops-stars (which for some reason I just cannot make) to Basic Projects, Findings, Ear Wires, Clasps (really easy) and Cages for beads/stones/marbles/or?)The Contemporary Wirework shown at the end of the book is inspiring and does require much more knowledge of wirework; however, it does inspire the beginner to learn more and try harder to create their own wirework masterpieces. At least, it inspired me to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Basics, but...","review":"I'd have to say this is an excellent book that teaches you the BASICS of wiring for jewelry. The first two chapters start you off great, telling you all the tools needed for wire wrapping as well as how to hold pliers and basic looping techniques. Then the next few chapters go on to teach you clear, step by step instructions (with drawn illustrations) on making wire findings, clasps, cool looking headpins, ear wires, how to wire wrap a cab, how to wire wrap marbles, how to wire wrap beads and so on. What this book is lacking is that, at the very end they have many pictures of very beautiful wire necklaces and bracelets with no instructions on how to make them. These pieces clearly require a LOT more work than the book teaches you. So if you are ONLY interested in learning the basics and incorporating wire into your jewelry this is the book to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book For Beginners","review":"If you are a beginner, this book is great. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow.I must say that personally, I was a bit disappointed in this book, simply because I am already familiar with many of the basic wire techniques, so I didn't get much from the book. I did, however, learn a wire technique for wrapping a cabochon, which I have never tried.I was a little disappointed that instructions for creating the jewelry piece on the cover, were not included in the book, since I thought it was a beautiful necklace.If you are familiar with making basic items such as ear wires, hook and eye clasps, spirals, etc. then you may not get much out of this book.If you are a beginner and want to learn about the proper tools to use, and looking for basic techniques, then I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the rest","review":"I'm really surprised to see how many positive reviews this book has gathered. Due to this I ordered my own copy as well as Bead on A Wire by Sharilyn Miller. The two can't even begin to be compared but I'll try. All Wired Up just lacks in good photos to show techniques, the drawings are small. There are only about 5 glossy pictures at the end of the book for inspiration pieces but none for projects. I'm very disappointed in this book. However Bead on A Wire is an exceptional teaching and inspiring book, with enlarged, color photos of every aspect of learning to work with wire. The projects are just beautiful and doable. I'm a beginner but sure Sharilyn Miller's book can accomodate all levels. So glad I purchased this and will return All Wired Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The things you need to know","review":"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but this book really impressed me that much. It is one of the only books with pictures and explanations that I could understand. What Lareau teaches you how to make in this book are basics that everyone needs to know - how to make a strong hook and eye clasp, how to make your own ear wires, and how to wrap cabochons for pendants. So many of the books I have seen guide you through gaudy, crafty-looking projects that I would never actually wear. This book is short and sweet, starting with how to create the perfect loop. Excellent graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book for beginners!","review":"I purchased this book not knowing a thing about jewelry making and yet was able to create a lovely necklace in just a couple of hours. The instructions are very clearly written and the accompanying diagrams are quite useful. If you are at all interested in creating your own wire jewelry then this book is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely photographs","review":"This book has lovely photographs of work by contemporary wire artists. Easy to follow directions in the front section of the book are for the true beginner with little or no experience working with wire, and cover only the basics. The photos of the work in the back of the book are truly inspiring, creative pieces- too advanced for the beginner to tackle, but a great resource for ideas for the experienced wire artist. It would have been great to have more advanced technical advice for those of us already working in wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"This book is great in it's drawings and detailed explanations for making findings. I got it along with \\"Bead & Wire Jewelry\\" by Tammy Powley for Christmas. I alternate between them when I need more clarification and both are great. I liked the pictures of the intricate pieces that had been made with wire in this book, but as a beginner, I would have liked a few more pictures of more practical jewelery;"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Wired Up","review":"I'm new at \\"Wire Wrapping\\" and this book was very helpful. All of the instructions were well written and very easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for basics and as a refresher","review":"I have been working with wire for a couple of years now and it was a slow process gaining the basic skills by myself! This book covers all the basics you need to know (wish I would have bought it earlier!) with clear and concise step by step directions and illustrations. A handy reference/refresher book even for the experienced wireworker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Yes","review":"This release is ideal for the Yes fan who is reluctant to double up their CD collection with the live Seventies songs from the Keys To Ascension releases but lack the studio tracks from KTA and KTA 2. These songs are some of the best music recorded by the band in a long time. The new songs are ambitious and exciting. They fit well into the classic Yes catalogue. In addition, the original orchestral introduction to Children of the Light by Rick Wakeman was restored for this compliation. Resulting in a better, more satifying song than what appeared on Keys To Ascension 2. This rocking release fully earns five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best Yes in a long time","review":"Well, the songs here from Keys to ascension 2 are some of the best things yes has done in a long time i.e mind drive, footprints, children of the light, bring me to the power. I first liked mind drive the best for a while but after having this for a while footprints is the clear favorite..a really excellent song with staying power..this cd is more in line with close to the edge than the 80's stuff. The songs from Keys to Acsension 1 are quite as good but the songs from keys part 2 easily make this a great buy without having to buy a lot of live material"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did their Muse get tired?","review":"I think these songs are not as good as their earlier compositions. Mostly the first song: it's monotonous and lacks melody. The rest are just ok. None took my breath away like \\"Pictures for an exhibition\\", or \\"Henry VIII\\", or \\"Close to the edge\\"... first time this happens to me with my favorite group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Sound Quality","review":"This recording is very poor done. Basically, its a beach recording of wind and waves. However, I doubt a wind screen was used (or the record levels were way too high) because strong wind and wave crashing consistantly and frequently, cause saturation and distortion. Very annoying. More like a Zen Supprise, not a Zen Sunrise. This was my second and last Serenity Series purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprise Zen Sunrise","review":"We listened to an excerpt before ordering. The CD was exactly what we wanted. A low rumbling, rolling chant quality with bells and chimes over a wind background. We play the cd as backgroud for work and relaxation. The feeling I get from it is of a temple filled with monks in deep meditation. There is no singing or lala sounds. I loved the realistic (maybe unrealistic) quality of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works ok but a bit scary","review":"The mains adapter makes a soft hissing sound on 240V.

It also doesn't include the group's third best song, \\"Blue For You\\", (which was not a hit).By the way:1) Singles were released from the third album, but there were no actual hits from the third album.2) \\"Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive\\", a minor hit, is arguably the group's WORST song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hits package, but missing a few","review":"This american Hits compilation is adequate and the sound of the disc is quite good. A few minor quibbles with song selection. This disc includes five selections from the Men's third, somewhat obscure third album. But the one american hit from that album, \\"Everything I Need\\", is missing, as is another called \\"Sail to You.\\" Also not included are the songs(not on any of the three albums) \\"The Longest Night\\" and \\"Shintaro.\\" These songs are included on their import best of called \\"The Works.\\" Having said that, this disc sounds much better.

(After all, Men at Work only had five hit songs: \\"Who Can it Be?\\", \\"Down Under\\", \\"I Can See it in Your Eyes\\", \\"Overkill\\", and \\"It's a Mistake\\".)It's telling, by the way that Men at Work has released just as many \\"greatest hits\\" or \\"best of\\" compilations as it has studio albums: three of each.

As I played the C.D., the songs were even better than I remembered! Besides bringing back memories, it brought back a unique sound and voice that is similar to absolutely no one. If you've never seen the videos that go with 'Be Good Johnny' or 'Land from Down Under', you'll have to try to get your hands on them. These guys were as good at performing for the screen as they were behind their instruments. 'Overkill' is my husband's theme song (he worries too much over little things). The lyrics have a wide variety of meanings with diverse beats. There's something for everyone on this 'best of' the best band ever!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"This collection shows the band's strengths","review":"\\"Who Can It Be Now?\\" and \\"Down Under\\" were two of the catchier songs of the 80's. The former being a nice paranoid's anthem, the second leading to a love of all things from the land of OZ. But there is more to recommend this band than a few hit singles. From the kid who just doesn't fit in (\\"Be Good Johnny\\") to a bit of concern about the world's inherent self-destructiveness (\\"It's a Mistake\\") Men At Work had range, a tight sound, and a depth that was not seen if you only knew the singles. Listen to Colin Hay on \\"Snakes and Ladders\\" and you know this guy can put across a song. Closing with the haunting \\"Down By The Sea,\\" this is one greatest hits package that serves a real purpose, a chance for people to hear a bit more than \\"men who chunder.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Tunes BAD Sound Quality","review":"This is a decent collection of tunes by the band (I might have picked some others though). The sound quality is very bad though. This CD was mastered in such a way that there is extensive digital clipping (i.e. distortion) that is very noticable (especially on some of the drum beats).If you care about sound quality then I would pass on buying this CD and look at the other releases by this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tunes from a good band....","review":"All music groups have there unique brand Men at Work has theres. i just wanted the greatest tunes because it had all the pop hits for the band.

Each song that she has made still continues to tell a sonnet of love to any audience, at any time.Her 1997 album, Next, reflects upon the rocky roads of love and marriage. That album remained true to Vanessa at the time, when she and her first husband, Ramon Harvey divorced. The songs still are as tough and as strong as they were released at the time. Songs like Happiness, Lost Without You and Oh How The Years Go By, range from Hip-Hop to comtemporary, and heavy to hard listening very smoothly.Although many people still think of her as a one hit wonder with Save The Best For Last, the songs on Next still prove that Vanessa Williams still has some staying power in the wings. All the way to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Next\\" is very UNDER rated!!!","review":"I got my first copy of the album in the mail today and I can't seem to get enough. While I must agree there should have been more dance tracks like \\"Happiness\\", Vanessa's forte is obviously the ballads. Her take on Van Morrison's \\"Someone like you\\" is smooth and emotional. Similar to her last sultry \\"Betcha Never\\" from the sweetest days album, \\"Who were you thinking bout\\" deals with the same cheating man. I love the beats on it. First thing on your mind and \\"And my heart goes\\" are lovely soulfoul songs. R. kelly impressed me with his written song for Vanessa \\"Start Again\\" which she mastered to perfection. The best song on the album is the last song-\\"Oh How The Years Go By\\". Vanessa has matured, and the fluffy dance hits are a thing of the past. Lets look forward to the NEXT album of sensible soulful music from Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not my favorite, but I like it a lot","review":"Overall, Next is a decent CD. My favorite ballad (which is what most of the songs are) is \\"The Easiest Thing,\\" because I like the slow, gospel feel it has. Out of all the songs I think the best is \\"Who Were You Thinkin' 'Bout?\\" It has a really smooth rhythm. Actually, it's one of my favorite songs (not just of her's). This CD isn't wonderful, but it isn't bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next","review":"Next is an amazing album by an amazing artist, Vanessa Williams has to be one of the most underrated artists. She has created some of the most memorable music, and she continues to with her latest album Next. This is a more adult contemporary, jazzy type album, and its so beautiful. Vanessa has a beautiful, smooth voice that just soars on songs like these. Key tracks include: And My Heart Goes, Crazy Bout You, Lose WIthout You, The Easiest Thing and And If I Ever. Give this a try its a cd filled with some really great music that you will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"I own practically all of Vanessa's albums and I find this to be my favorite, although \\"Sweetest Days\\" runs a close second. The songs range from upbeat to heart stopping. I love this type of music and bought my first Vanessa album about two years ago as a lark since I enjoy her movies so much such as \\"Erasure\\" and \\"Let's Dance\\". I was absolutely amazed at the singing talent she has. She can sing wonderful dancing songs, rousing gospel music, and love songs that ooze romance. She is no Whitney Houston, but who is? It's just nice to see someone with so much talent, in so many areas, be such a role model after having to overcome the adversity she faced after being crowned Miss America. She appears to be a great wife and very nice person. If you want an album where you just want to be entertained and relaxed, then I highly recommend this purchase. I just wish she would release more music and not let the producers try to change her style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next...NEXT! (The Comfort Zone was WAY better)","review":"This album isn't even average, great or spectacular, it's just an album. The only good song on the album is \\"Happiness\\" the rest are so boring that I just took the CD back and got a refund. I recommend her second album \\"The Comfort Zone\\" that is the most beautiful album she has ever made. This album is not. Also, I recommend Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope, now THAT'S A WORK OF ART."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"Vanessa's fourth album \\"Next\\" sounded uneven to me. A couple of songs are okay, but there's not a continuity like the other albums before it. I liked \\"Happiness\\" and how Jam & Lewis were able to interpolate Nu Shooz's 1985 song \\"I Can't Wait\\" into that song and place a funky beat under it. But the rest of the album has too many forgettable songs within it and the ballads lack punch to me. Such an uneven joint music wise when you listen to it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album made me want to stick a pen in my ear","review":"This album was certainly not a disappointment. Vanessa Williams is a terrible artist, and this is quite possibly the worst album ever released in the fine nation of the United States of America. My mother has this CD, and I was forced to listen to it in the car. I was ready to jump out of a moving vehicle when the first track, \\"Who Were You Thinkin' About\\", came on. But as the album progressed, notably during \\"The First Thing on Your Mind\\", I had the urge to strangle myself with my safety belt. Overall, this album is a disgrace to mankind. Because of music like this, I sometimes wish that music had never been invented.

These three records, which contain standards like 'Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll', 'The Red and the Black' and 'Career of Evil', form the core of the evidence for BOC's being the ultimate \\"thinking man's metal band\\".

My set workouts don't even take 10 minutes, and I can't find a way to extend the workout duration. That <10 minutes even includes extra time while the game forces you to watch your \\"trainer\\" display terribly cheesy facial expressions and encouraging gestures. After EVERY exercise. Rather than encouraging me to keep working out, it frequently encourages me to pick a different method of exercising.This was a huge disappointment.

It is definitely not aerobic. There is too much time between each exercise while the instructor is moving from one exercise to another and then the reps are pretty slow as well. It works some muscle groups well, but it is not at all what I expected & there are definitely too few different exercises.

There's no yoga. You don't even enter your weight to see any progress. I have been using the original version for years and was so excited that this new one was coming out.

I hated the graphics on the second one. It looked so fake. The trainers to me were very annoying. I didn't like that it used the balance board and the wii remote. I found that you really had to swing the remote high in the air if you were jogging, or it didn't count. The balance board also didn't recognize that I was doing the push ups. Very annoying.

All of the functionality that was in the previous version is no longer here (select length of workout, what exercise you want to do, change the level, change the music, etc.). You do not have much control at all over your workouts. I am a fit person so I need something that challenges me. The previous version still challenges me. The 2nd version barely gives you any workout. Even those who never exercise will get any benefit from this. My advice, do not spend your money on this!

Just try to cook them though. There is no way to print the menus and I really don't like the idea of having to drag the television and Wii setup to the kitchen.

It was a total disappointment. There is no place to add what equipment I own, no place to control the duration of the workouts or how challenging they are. The workouts are too short.

Total waste of my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Why can't someone make a great work out for the WII? My Fitness Coach, the original, is SO CLOSE to \\"just right\\" that I had to try this one. The daily workouts consist of 8 exercises....that's it. And if the controller doesn't communicate with the unit, well, eventually it becomes annoying. I was hoping for a good workout that could progressively get more challenging as I got better. I need the \\"company\\" during my workouts to help me keep focused and motivated. This is just not the tool I was looking for. Even with its minor flaws, the original is still the best one for the money.

This book is a little easier to start on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big mistake","review":"This book was a big mistake. It is a complete zero as far as providing the most basic fundamental explainations necessary to understanding Windows programming with Visual C++, and it is even more of a complete zero as far as providing detailed insight. It basically provides an 1100 page description of how code is generated using the AppWizard and the ClassWizard. With this book, those who want to learn and write their own code will eventually reach a critical level of frustration, and tear it to shreds as I have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reference book, bad teaching book...","review":"What can I use this book for?

I'm not sure who they had in mind when they wrote this. I have an excellent grasp on C++, and knew a little bit about MFC and windows programming. However this book shows pages and pages of code with very little (or in many cases no) explanation of it. It assumes you already know MFC! Of course if you already know MFC why the hell would you be reading this. No matter how good you are at C++ no programmer can look at a function call (with no defintion) and just guess what it does, and apparently thats what the author's of this book want you to do. Instead of reading this I've been reading Wrox's \\"Professional MFC Visual C++ 6\\". It's a much better book simply because it ACTUALLY EXPLAINS THINGS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big on scope, small on detail","review":"This book covers a lot of topics such as forms, DLLs, Database, Network programming, OLE, and more. However, the details are very minute. If you are looking to buy a book, read it, then be ready to program, this is definitely not for you. The general philosophy of this book is to briefly explain something, then give an example program. While the examples are ok, they are not useful for learning since they are not thoroughly explained.I don't know which VC++ books on the market are good, but I can tell you that this one is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a Good book","review":"It helped me with lots of stuff that i had problem with.Not for a Novice programmer though.

I just needed to brush up on my Windows programming because I haven't used VC++ for few years, so I bought this book because it SEEMED to cover many topics. As I was reading this book, I found myself totally lost because of very little explination in the book. It was not this difficult to learn VC++ when I first learned it, so I know that I am not the problem here.Even thought my company paid for the book, I regret getting this book. I'd return it if I still have the receipt.If you are not an VC++ expert, don't get this book.

My copy is for sale cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this CD for meditation","review":"I wish I had headed the warnings other's have posted for this CD below.

The birds and roosters are shrill and make meditation nearly impossible with this CD. I will not listen to this CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The combination of the barnyard animals and hourse clomping was not the worst of it... no, the worst is that after 50 minutes of this this single track (which ordinairly, I would not mind), we hear exactly ONE chant the entire time! Let me elaborate... one utterance, over and over. More like medication, not meditation. Waste of time and money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning about this CD","review":"I purchased this CD based on the sample I heard on this web site. The sample was really beautiful so I ordered the CD. Once I recieved the CD I sat down to meditate, really looking forward to hearing the whole CD. I WAS HORRIFIED, not more than a minute or so into the absolutely beautiful music and chanting there came animal sounds. This of itself isn't necessarily bad unless the sounds are of farm animals. I kid you not, suddenly you hear a rooster, a cow, a goat etc... It was as if I went from a tibetan buddhist monastery to Old McDonald's Farm. The sounds DO NOT FIT with the music and are discordant, jarring, annoying and out of place. I will never listen to this CD again and recommend you never purchase it either. The music and chanting are great, maybe the best of its genre, but it is destroyed by the poor judgement of the creators of the CD who didn't realize that farm animal sounds are not exactly conducive to meditation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible droning and animal sounds","review":"The rhythmic droning wouldn't have been so bad... or the synthesized, repetitive music. But once the chicken started clucking, the rooster crowed, and someone rode by on horseback, my mood was shattered. What a waste. Recordings of natural environments can be relaxing, but what I purchased was a CD entitled \\"Tibetan Rhythms\\" not \\"Tibetan Farms.\\" Not what I expected at all, and I doubt I'll listen to it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen and Draw Your Own Conclusions","review":"I bought this disk because I was fascinated by all of thecontroversy surrounding it. Talk about either loving it or hatingit. There is no middle ground on this disk. It's either a 1 star or a 5 star. I've never seen anything like it on Amazon. I can't say that I am a big fan of these types of recordings not have I ever been to Tibet or anyplace remotely close to it. I've tried to meditate on occassion without much success. The UPS man has an uncanny ability to ring the door bell at just the right moment. I'm not sure this is the sort of disk you can meditate to. Although if you do want to meditate I think this is a great training disk. It really will teach you to avoid and tune out all of those extraneous distractions. Overall, I thought it was a pretty cool disk...its worth buying. Actually, the more I listen to it the more I think that maybe I should go to Tibet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking account of the end of Imperial Russia","review":"Though the translation suffers a little, this novel of the last golden days of Imperial Russia and the frenzied destruction of the \\"old order\\" by the Bolsheviks remains one of my favorites. Although Solzhenitsyn wasn't born until 1918, it's as if he were strolling alongside Gorky and Tomchak and the other personalities that feature into his tale during that awful time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man's Folly","review":"Although difficult to follow at times, this work relates the tragedy of war, specifically war undertaken without the proper understanding and preparation necessary to sucessfully see it through. The sections written as a screen play are a mystery to this reader, even though the content of these sections are vital. Particularly touching and poignant is the sheer frustration experienced by the fictional Colonel sent to Second Army, and particularly sad and ironic is the account of Gen. Samsonov's turmoil, from the moment we are first introduced to him, to the bitter and unnecessary fate which is his."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book","review":"I was really hoping that I would like this book. I just don't see why people consider Solzhenitsyn to be such a brilliant writer. This seemed to me to read like an unfinished work. The writing is o.k. but the characters are somewhat flat, the story is confusing and lacking direction and, at the end, it's like he started writing a different story that had little or nothing to do with the first. Like someone else already said: a well-done narrative history would be more informative, more interesting, and more entertaining. I definatly won't be moving on to the next book in the series.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is a winner","review":"Usually when I buy a CD, there are at least one or two tracks that I don't particulary like.

And I love the song Your still the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never underestimate Twain","review":"She's done it again!!! Shania Twain and her husband have teamed up again and written a CD that will be forever remembered on the country music scene. Twain floats from note to note as if she is walking on clouds. The songs are well written and vocalized superbly. The only problem I can complain about is that Twain and Lange's rhyme time on the verses is nervracking. As talented as they are they could write appropriate words that correspond with each other and do not rhyme. A must by for any music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"If you're buying the record based on the catchy, \\"Still The One\\", you're going to be disappointed by the album. Formulaic and dull, the CD offers a LONG play time but you'll find yourself skipping through the songs quick enough to finish it in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Stupid, don't buy this cd.","review":"Listening to this cd makes me long for the days that it took more that just a rockin' body and a descent voice to be called a musician. Shania Twain along with the Spice Girls are responsible for the downfall of radio. Every time I attempt to enjoy a local station I am constantly bombarded with the horrible garbage by musicians like Twain. If Shania could only improve on her lyrics I might actually respect her as an artist. Mrs. Twain has talent but she seems afraid to use it. Shania, stop surrendering to the restrictions of popular music and write something that is real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed - Songs the equivalent of Wonder Bread","review":"I bought this CD after reading all the kick butt reviews by other owners of the CD, but I was VERY disappointed. I have to say, she was great on the VH-1 diva show but this CD is very over-produced and bland, without much guts or soul. I found the songs to be very formulaic and by the numbers, and even lyrically and musically quite shallow. I have to wonder if a lot of Shania's success is due to her great looks and sexy image. Let's face it, she has very slick packaging and looks great in tight clothing, but she's not the most talented singer/songwriter out there (albeit one of the prettiest ones). Although her voice does have some nice husky tones in it, her vocal range is extremely limited and it gets boring. I was expecting a little more soul and rock and roll from her - this CD has been stripped of all fiber - all that's left is Nashville white bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groan","review":"If I hear that icky Feel Like a Woman song on the radio one more time I'm going to rip the radio right out of the dash and toss it on the pavement. It makes my teeth itch. The same goes for \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" -- it's no better the 4308th time than the first. The rest of the songs here are about the same. The only exception is the slightly less painful \\"Still the One\\" -- only because there may be a little heart behind the glitz. The Twain must be stopped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Example of all that's wrong with Nashville lately","review":"Generally I find this CD to be a rather average popular music CD. I'm not sure why Shania Twain is classified as a country artist since this CD is hardly country. I would classify it as bubble-gum pop music suitable for the pre-adolescent set. Given that this CD is classified as country, I find it very disappointing. It is an insult to all the other country artists who care more about the music rather than becoming international stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shania Twain is my favorite 'country' star, but.....","review":"This disc is not good. Neither are her earlier offerings. I was depressed to find out that this version of the disc does not include the infectious pop remixes I hear on the radio, but rather the raw country versions which not only include the annoying, unnecessary twangs and plunks of banjos and harmonicas, but an overall poorer-quality, less satisfying production and slew of backing tracks. If you want the awesome, danceable pop mixes of her hits, get her Greatest Hits disc or better yet just go get Up!, her best album to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"She Don't Impress Me Much\\"","review":"I think this is a very over-rated artist getting by, for the most part, on her looks. Many of her songs are based on the same heavy beat, reminiscent of Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\", so they sound the same. Also, her lyrics are usually silly & superficial (\\"Man! I Feel Like a Woman\\", \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\", \\"Rock This Country\\"...). Her first CD (before she started writing her own material) was her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania IS THE BEST! STOP BASHING HER MUSIC!","review":"Wow, I can't believe how much crud people can make up about Shania! Stop bashing her! Shania is a sweet, caring, wonderful person (and yes I do know this by personal interaction). Her fans are forever and her music is amazing! It inspires us and makes us better people. For people checking out Shania's album for the first time (where have you been! j/k) don't listen to all the bad reviews because I personally feel that these people are JEALOUS! This CD is awesome and you will never get tired of it! I listen to it everyday and I never get tired of it. I have encouraged many people to buy this CD and they all love it! Country or Pop, it doesn't matter! Its awesome! Check out Shania tomorrow night on CBS...she's gonna rock this country!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"It is quite sad that junk like this which has NOTHING to do with country music, gets played to death on country radio and has millions of people convinced they are listening to the genuine article. I would highly suggest that anyone and everyone who owns this album and thinks it is country to check out the real deal. Go discover artists like Iris DeMent, Heather Myles, and Kelly Willis and leave commercial tripe like this behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and entertaining","review":"I got this cd a year and a half ago and I still listen to it. Shania mixes country with pop and this album is just really fun. There are no \\"bad\\" songs, every song is worthy and many are great. I never listened to country before and no one I know listens to it, but we love Shania!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed messages...","review":"Practically all of Shania's songs talk about treating women with respect and women's rights - wonderful things, of course. But then she disgraces herself and every other woman by wearing practically nothing, letting her cleavage pop out, and wearing skirts short enough that nothing is left to the imagination. You want powerful women? Look at Faith Hill, Martina McBride, or Trisha Yearwood. Not only are their CD's incredibly well-written, but their videos are honorable too. Shania should put some clothes on and practice what she preaches. Only then will I have respect for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"If all it took...","review":"If all it took was 3 fiddles and a belly button to be a country star, Buck Owens would still be on top today. No one wants to see Buck's belly button, but I would lay even money that most are tired of seeing Twain's as well. Let's face it, it's just impossible to be a true country artist when your principle residence is a castle in Switzerland. The thoughtless lyrics of songs like \\"honey i'm home\\" and \\"that don't impress me much\\" are more the product of a very talented and statistically savvy marketing department than a truly inspired song writer. you have to hand it to nashville though, they found a formula of pretty faces and weak voices that worked, and they stepped on the gas. if you're worried about keeping up with the big hair, shiny truck crowd, that's never really listened to a hank williams song all the way through, then sure, buy two copies of this disc. otherwise, spend your money on something more worthwile, like 60 big gumbballs.--Raul Duke"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did society allow this to be passed off as music?","review":"This CD is not music, rather it is an all out offense to good taste. It would be no great tradgedy to see such vulgarity, and off-key noise publically burned. I really don't know what would possess all the brainless automotons who flock in droves to purchase the CD to actually listen to it. I mean everyone must have some sort of standards.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall \\"Come On Over\\" is uninspired & bland: not her best.","review":"I thought the songs were not up to Shania's usual standards.

Actually, I would like my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler Music","review":"As with alot of albums it's hard to get all cuts to hit. This album is below average, sorry Shania, I feel ripped off. If you could put the same daring you put into \\"You're Still The One\\" you will be landing hit after hit, you just can't miss. Look at Maria Carey, she knows what we want, who writes for her? Also the criticism over Country / Rock doesn't apply when you are capturing all thier hearts... girl.

This is the most utterly disposable pop music I've ever heard ... I would compare it to Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. Unintelligent and soulless, I would advise all fans of real music to avoid this album. If you want to hear country music played the right way, listen to Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Junior Brown, or Dixie Chicks ... and leave this to the fickle pop masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BE STUPID, SHANIA!!!","review":"I don't even know where to start! I use to be a Shania Twain fan. I love her Woman in Me album! In fact it was her Woman in Me album that made me rush to buy this one. Well big mistake! She sings some of the most dummiest songs I've ever heard! \\"Man I Feel like a Woman\\", \\"I'm Holding on to Love to Save My Life\\", \\"When\\" and \\"If You Wanna Touch Her Ask\\" is a example of what I mean. She is far from being a talented song writter! She isn't as sexy as she thinks she is! She looks like someone that makes a her living off the streets! Well if you like songs that have very stupid lyrics, then this album is for you! I may have thought Shania was the best after The Woman in Me album, but I certainly don't think so now! I infact I now believe she gets WAY to much credit then what she deserves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT Deserve to Be Listened to.","review":"This is not music, and it should not be heard. Shania Twain claims to be a role model for young women, and i feel that is a disgrace to present herself in this way. She makes constant refences in this CD to women as being exclusively capable of \\"going totally crazy\\" and she says that wearing short skirts make her feel like a woman. she is proud to proclaim that she is not impressed by intelligence, rather she prefers a man who \\"has the touch,\\" or in other words can satisfy her physically. Her \\"music\\" certainly cannot be admired for its sound, it made my auditory neurons want to commit suicide. Even her slow songs, which i'm assuming were supposed to sound good, sounded like an underwater cow, I especially abhor the song \\"From This Moment On.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I only grieve there isn't a zero under ratings","review":"This is the worst CD I've ever heard in my life. If you like cheesy tunes such as \\"From This Moment\\" (gag me) or downright annoying and obnoxious junk such as \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" then you might like this trash. Shania Twain needs some voice lessons and person who, can you imagine?!, is able to write decent lyrics. Then maybe she'll have a shot at being just terrible instead of beyond unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shania Twain is bad","review":"Shania Twain's producer was the guy responsible for Def Leppard. That is like me turning around and selling a monkey to a lizard carpet salesman. What is this? Reminds me of Perry Como covering the Rolling Stones, only no payoff in the end. Sure I do my shopping humming You're Still The One, but I would erase that from my memory in a heartbeat if I could. No soul to this record at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE WANT TALENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think that if someone is going to try and make an album they should at least be able to sing...she's only in the music industry b/c she supposedly \\"looks good\\" and her husband is a movie producer. I'm sorry to say but that's no excuse...every time I hear her I want to gag. The only thing she's getting out of it is the publicity of her body...which frankly, i think is completely disgusting. Shania, quit your day job. Do us all a favor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Gum Country Music","review":"I just don't like it. All of the songs Shania has written are just too \\"bubble gum\\". They're o.k. for the 11-16 year olds and the men who don't care what she does as long as she continues to thrust her chest in the air while she sings. But for anyone who enjoys REAL music - this doesn't add up. If only she were half as talented as she is pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"JELEK","review":"Gue belom pernah denger ini album, dan mungkin album ini jelek, kali ya...tapi sih penyanyinya bagus. jadi kurang lebih...lumayan lah..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even A Good Pop CD!(Let Alone Country)","review":"Shania is a average songwriter at best and her vocal range is mediocre. I am surprised this album is so popular. I found myself skipping through most of the mindless songs. Finally, this is not a Country CD. This is pure pop music fluff ..... Patty Loveless, Faith Hill and Trisha Yearwood are all far superior female country music artist choices..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does good looks sell records? Yes I think so...","review":"Well, let's not deny the impact Shania Twain's looks have on record sales. Twain is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I've seen and she can also sing - that's good but not essential for success. \\"Come on over\\" is mainly country-pop of rather harmless character and songs like \\"Man I feel like a woman\\" and \\"Don't be stupid\\" is alright. The big hit \\"That don't impress me much\\", which by the way isn't sounding anything like country is a great song, but the rest of the material is very mediocre. I guess country music as a genre were in need of something to still be appealing, but I doubt this commercialization is the right way to go. To me it sounds a bit lifeless and without soul. I put my hope to the likes of Steve Earle and Jayhawks instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on over a great album","review":"Come on over is a great album. It has all of her best songs on from my point of view.Other people like this album as much as me because it has recently been best selling album by a female artist.I think it is one of the best albums ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent CD!","review":"I'm really not that excited about country music but this CD is absolutely terrific. I must say it has only about two or three songs that are not good. The way she sings makes you like country music. I'd recommend this CD to anybody!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Country gone bad.","review":"Come On Over by Shania Twain sold millions and millions of albums but I despise this cd with a passion. Shania is one of the worst singer-songwriters I have ever heard, especially in the genre of country/pop. Her voice is completely unoriginal, there's no fire, range, or accessiblility. I can't believe how truly awful her songwriting is! Terrible cliches, junior high filled lyrics and child-like melodies. Songs like That Don't Impress Me Much, Man I Feel Like a Woman!, Don't Be Stupid, and You're Still the One just gives me the willies. The only two tracks that have any emotion in them are From This Moment On and You've Got a Way. Come on Over is a horrible and silliest record of the '90s. Stay clear from this over-rated mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with International Version","review":"I was expecting it to have a lot of International type music to it but it virtually sounded the same as the original. I think I may have mistaken this cd title for another of Shania's. Her music is great but I don't see a difference with the international version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for fools","review":"Just got the CD from a local public library. This is a pop music at its worst. Songs like \\"Man! I feel like a woman\\" and \\"Don't be stupid\\" are great examples of music for fools... all just show-offs with no single idea behind it. If you are over 25 and actually like this stuff, let me tell you: you are stupid, no matter how high this stuff was in charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shania goes for the overkill!","review":"So the Shania juggernaut continues with the release of the international version of \`Come On Over'. I would recommend that if you want this CD buy the other so called \`country' version, at least the songs on it in their original versions are better, than the remixed disco and pop versions. It is a sad indictment on the music industry that this CD has 9 radio hits on country radio in the U.S.A. when much better singers like Suzy Bogguss, Lorrie Morgan and David Ball etc. are ignored. Not too long ago it was a mega hit album that produced 4 hit songs, but I guess Twain's record company is going for overkill...and lastly at least the Dixie Chicks have not sold out their country sound so they can become \`pop music divas'. When will artists like Twain, Martina McBride and Reba McEntire give up the pop cross-over ditties and sing music that suits their style of singing better. Enough is enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated album from the most overrated singer","review":"This \\"International\\" mix of the album is not only proof that it can't stand on it's own (few if any) merits, it also shows the music and production to be faceless, interchangable, generic and disposable. Tons of digital proccessing on her voice to mask any and all weaknesses. Your money is best spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay Full Price For Come On Over the Demo.","review":"Instead of 18 tracks, they cut a few, and are trying to sell a demo. Come On! Interplay tried this, we are all tired. While the songs may be good, I have the 'real' version. I guess all you fake fans who have the 'demo disk' version have been screwed. Shania, here's a word for you for even allowing the remix of this album: SELLOUT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE?","review":"Buy some Alicia Keys. Country stinks. Actually, this is not a country album. Shania is just a Spice Girl with a couple slide guitar solos thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shania can't sing at all, so why doesn't she stop!","review":"At first, Shania was an ok artist, and her music was ok. This album is nothing but useless stuff. Stop trying to be Britney Spears too! They way she dresses and poses for pictures is really sad. Kids may look up to her, but probably their parents don't want them to, since Shania is a horrible influence! She doesn't even have a range to her voice! In all her songs she sings in the same octive, and shouldn't be allowed to sing at all. I wonder why she doesn't win many awards...maybe because first of all you need to be able to sing. She started as a country artist, so why can't she be one? Stop crossing over to pop! I say trash her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"This is one of those rare gems that is truly excellent from start to finish, there isn't a single negative thing I can say about this album.Even after nearly a decade of being released this album never gets old, the songs sleep under your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many hits on one album!","review":"When I first heard \\"You've got a way,\\" I immediately fell in love with it. In fact, I still am! Shania has a beautiful voice!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why limit yourself?","review":"People are complaining that Shania is no longer coutry....Well she has country and she has pop. I just wonder why would people have to limit ourselves to one type of music. I look at the quality of the music not wheather it is pop, country, or whetever. We should all be grateful that she has opened up or lives to a unique type of music"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best 1 hour of music you'll ever hear!","review":"Yes, I'm 15-years-old and in high school and yes, I do like country music. Of course, I don't like all country music! Shania Twain is my favorite country star, next to LeAnn Rimes, of course! Shania Twain is great and anyone can like her music, no matter what age they are becuase her music (espically on this CD) is awesome! I personally think that Shania Twain should've won 'Album of the Year' instead of that pathedic Lauryn Hill and she also should've won 'Best Country Album' instead of those worthless Dixie Chicks! I mean, come on over! (Ha, ha!) I have this CD and I love every song on it. I can listen to the entire CD and not skip any of the songs. But sometimes I skip some of the songs anyway just so I can get to my favorite songs! This CD is totally awesome and everyone should own it! Shania Twain has an incredible voice and her music is awesome! Way to go, Shania! Keep up the amazing work!~Becky"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania Twain is totally awesome!","review":"I have listened to this CD at least 30 times, and it gets better everytime I hear it. Her music is flat-out fun. Everytime I hear this music I want to dance in the streets.This is perfect example of a CD with theme and a flow that connects all of the titles together. Her music has it all: silliness, thought, fun and hope.Great model for anyone desiring to start in the music business. You will never get tired of listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Alubm!","review":"I think that this is Shania Twain's best album. I like the songs Your Still The One and You've Got A Way. I wish that she would have a fan club someday. Can't wait until her next album when that comes out if there would be another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country kicks back","review":"Shania along with Faith grew up listening to country musicand idolizing country singers.And you can tell too.Because thisis so much better than everything else that is out there.I willkeep listening to country music until the new Elton John or thenew Beatles come out because right now rock and pop really [are bad]especially rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best country albums in history","review":"I don't know why some people put this album down because it's not \\"country\\". \\"Come On Over\\" is a great fusion of country/rock and it works well. Shania has a wonderful voice and carries her songs well. There's some great novelty lyrics and some deep, meaningful ones.For those who complain that this is not like old country--who wants to sound like Tammy WHINEtte anyhow?"},{"rating":"2","title":"entire album is Twain-like but well worth the $$","review":"Yes, the entire album sounds the same...the style, the rhythm, her vocal energy-but many albums seems to be like that, there are few artist who can branch out in the same album. It is a very energetic country (except for a couple of songs). The album seems longer than it really is, not a bad thing by any means. And the majority of the songs are definitely radio material, as well as dance scene material-to a point where I can no longer recognize the ones that were actually released vs those that were not (which goes hand in hand with the entire album sounding the same). My favorite track on the album, is by far, \\"Come On Over\\"-about putting your feet up and relaxing. Love the rhythm, love the message. It's a short, simple song but fun. Least favorite track on the album is \\"When\\"...ugh, no thank you. All in all, not a bad album and it is worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Highlyrecommened CD!","review":"Shania Twain has been one of my favorite artist for a long time. Her CD Come on over is probably one of my favorite CD's EVER!.. I find her music to be very insperational. Her music helped me in a very bad time of my life. She mad me happy, music has always been a big part of my life. Her music is one of the main reasons why I am a big fan of music. For anyone considering any of Shania Twain's CD's. Go for it. You will not be disapointed. her music is wonderful, the words outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"As a huge fan of \\"The woman in me\\", I was very disappointed by the simplistic lyrics on this CD. It seems to me that this was just thrown together in the hopes of capitalizing on her previous success. They would have done better by taking more time and writing some songs with substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHANIA IS AWESOME!!","review":"This CD from Shania Twain is simply awesome!! I hated country music back in May, and now I LOVE it!! I can't wait until she comes to Lexington in concert on October 22, at least that's what I have heard on the radio! I am so excited. Anyway, the two best songs are You're Still the One and Honey! I'm Home!! They are great. If you like country..this CD is a must buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True country with a splash of sass. Don't miss it.","review":"Twain portrays true country charm with a barnful of attitude to boot. It's no coincidence she's a superstar. Lyrically, it's both creative & entertaining. Musically, it's inventive, including unusual tags, arrangements and rhythms not typically country. Shania has definitely \\"gone and done it\\" this time. Walking the border between contemporary and country, she does and will continue to please the masses. Her verve, charisma, creativity and, of course, satin vocal chords are building her a tremendous current following and an imminent monument in the archives of musical history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best-selling album by a female artist!!! Record-breaking!","review":"This is simply a must-have album in your CD collection. It has everything!1) great music2) great singer3) good lyrics4) unforgettable songs5) record-breaking sales...BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"(POP)ROCK THIS COUNTRY!","review":"This album is intended for those who like Shania Twain's music, but don't like the countryish feel to them. While the song sequence is different, this album is perfect for those who hear Shania Twain's music on the radio or see on T.V., because her original versions do differ from those you hear elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money....","review":"The reason why I gave this CD such a harsh review was because I bought the Shania Twain Greatest Hits CD before purchasing this one. What I didn't realize at the time is that both CD's have the exact same 6 songs on both of them. I would strongly recommend buying the Greatest Hits CD for less money and with more songs on it. The Greatest Hits CD has 21 songs compared to \\"The Come On Over\\" CD having 16 songs. Unless you want to pay for the same 6 songs twice I would strongly recommend one over the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets old","review":"I have this CD and never play it any more. I find it hard to believe that there is anyone on the planet who hasn't heard these songs played continuously on the radio, so they are well aware of what they are buying. I believe part of her popularity is due to that fact her songs are so easy to sing people love to get up and do them on Kareoke night!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself some money","review":"I read the reviews on this board and decided the yays outweighed the nays so I went and bought it. After just one listening, I tried to give it away but nobody wanted it. So there it sits in its jewel case gathering dust. If you like Shania Twain because she's pretty, buy a poster. If you want good music, buy Martina McBride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be the only one.","review":"I must be the only one who thinks this album is below standard for Shania. I love her other two CDs and her video. This album sounds to me like a sort or reverse Karaoke with her voice but strange synthesizer tracts and percussion sounds that usually come out or bands that can't play well. We love you Shania. I can't wait until your next true effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"......","review":"After this CD came out i bought it, and i listend to it for a while,why i don't know? it had some cathy songs, yes, it has some fun songs, sure, but i really hate her voice. at first it's fine to listen to her voice and she's a good songwriter and seem to have a great personality, that i'll give her, but in the longrun, her voice is very harsh on the ears... i suggest you listen through one of her cd BEFORE you buy it... cause her voice might not be as appealing to everyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This don't impress me much","review":"After seeing the \\"Man I Feel Like A Woman\\" video, I lost total respect for Ms. Twain. She says she's country, but sorry Shania, YOU'RE NOT! These songs are clearly pop-NOT COUNTRY. Shania in her \\"Woman\\" video, clearly shows she can be 1st class hooker. Oh yeah Shania, your eye shawdow doesn't go all the way to your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Waiting For the Next CD","review":"I first saw Shania on County Music Television - Video \\"Any Man of Mine\\" and I wondered who she was and having not listened to county for a long time I was immediately interested. Yes she was sexy, but refreshing. Woman In Me Was awesome and it's the latest one that sold my daughters (in their late 20's and granddaughters 6 & 9)Come on Over is empowering for women and catchy, My husband is a solid blues and rock fan but he likes Shania. It's too bad there are so many people that don't understand success and beauty when they see it. Some of the above critics go on for 2 - 3 paragraphs. Why? Look what she has done, how many albums she has sold and even gone international to boot. Society has a hard time with anything new and refreshing. Critics get over it and leave us die hard fans to enjoy the best that music has seen (in general)for a long time. Shania is a long lasting success,an icon and W E L O V E H E R! Get over it! Shania we love you here in B.C. Canada."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS SHE SELLING, HER MUSIC, OR HER BODY?","review":"Except for \\"You're still the one\\" (which is an awesome song) this album blows! Maybe if she didn't prance around like a hooker on stage, or act like she's so great, I'd like her more. Does she actually think she's country? Sounds more pop-ish than anything else on the radio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen to being \\"COUNTRY\\"?","review":"When I heard (and bought) Shania's CD \\"The Women in Me\\", I though she was the next country deva. But after hearing her new one \\"That don't impress me much\\", she left me wondering, what happen to being a country singer? Not to mention the song itself makes her sound like she has an IQ of zero, no......I don't think I'll be buying anymore of her CD's. Like the song say's \\"that don't impress me much!\\". Thank you very much Ms. Twain and have a nice day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a total waste","review":"please, this is an example of what country music has become. give me trisha yearwood or faith hill instead of the schlock presented here. this is nothing but fluffly, middle of the road pop and should not be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shania is a traitor!","review":"Three or four years ago Shania was ranking high on country charts around the nation. She was a beautiful woman with a powerful voice. Shania used Country to get her start and then she went to the pop industry by singing songs that sound like so many others and by wearing as little clothing as possible. It is upsetting that looking as revealing as possible is what gets people to the top. I ranked her CD a 2, because her songs aren't all bad, but I do not personally respect her for the person she has become. She may still be topping country charts, but is she singing country? Compare her cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"This album is simply crap. I liked her previous effort, \\"The Woman In Me\\" and I picked this one up when it came out. I've regreted it ever since. This album is one of the reasons I no longer listen to country music. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i disliked this cd very much","review":"i think that shania is not at all country. she is a wanna be. her songs that dont impress me much, man i fell like a woman, and don't be stuipd were the most pointless songs. i liked from this moment and your still the one were ok, but i think that shania needs to also tone down her videos. the way she flaunts her self and dresses, dont impress me much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shania Just Doesnt Do It For Me","review":"I do not like this CD. I do not like pop music at all, and this is a mix of country and pop, that will leave you with a bitter after taste. She has talent, of course she does, she has sold alot of CD's, but she is just to market concious. I dont think an artist can maintain artistic integrity while just trying so despratley to please the masses. I liked Still The One, and that was all, and I only liked that one because she wasnt yelping or making hersefl look like an imbosile in her video clip. If you want quality country, get a Kasey Chambers CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbie Fulks is bettter","review":"She's a really pretty girl, but this just isn't country music.

I recomend you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED","review":"First off i'm a 12 year old female who listens to everything from george jones to motley crue! i like all music, but my passion is country music! When i first listened to \\"the woman in me\\" i was IMPRESSED! so when shania's third album came out i bought hoping that i would feel the same!(not) considering it took for EVER to come out with a new cd the songs were NOT well written! as a song writer myself MY songs are better than hers and i'm only 12! maybe she should consider taking writing lessons from matraca berg or someone who has talent! maybe she would have been better off not breaking country's rules! with a few more albums like this she WON\\"T be around much longer! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shania is NOT country music!","review":"OK....let's face it. Shania is not a country music singer and the fact that she tries to pawn herself off as one makes me want to vomit. Listen to the songs on this CD.....they all have the same, manufactured pop beat that you'll hear over on the top 40 station. So they throw a little fiddle in there and call it country...what a crock. The vast majority of songs on the record have the depth and intelligence of a rain puddle in the middle of the desert. Some of them may be catchy, but after you've heard them once or twice, they are just plain annoying. Shania doesn't have a very good voice and she can't write her own music. About the only thing she CAN do is look good, but now she's turned into some sort of two-bit whore wearing a leopard print bikini. Shania Twain is one of the worst things to happen to country music since LeAnn Rhimes showed up to become the country music version of Michael Bolton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Hearing these tunes on the radio is a truly frustrating experience! This will be some of the stuff people laugh at when they look back on bad 90's music."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's run out of gas on this one.","review":"Aside from You're Still The one, the songs on this album sound as if she wrote them in about 20 seconds. Honey, I'm Home is one of the most poorly written songs I've heard, along with That Don't Impress Me Much. I loved \\"The Woman In Me\\" album, but this one is terrible. Don't waste your money.

What's wrong with her!","review":"I bought her latest album a few days ago, because I've heard it has sold some copies, so I decided to test it out. I regret that! She's no good. All her songs sound the same. I saw a few of her videos, and thought what a bomber! She says she's country, but not anymore. She should just be trown into pop music, and be a disgusting person she is. Why should she even get credit for country music? Country to me is awesome artists like LeAnn Rimes, Faith Hill, Jo Dee Messina, Tim McGraw, and those kind of people.

Her voice is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania Rocks!!","review":"Shania Twain is the latest in a long line of successful cross-over artists, and this excellent CD is testimony to that fact. It is loaded with top ten hits from the first cut to the last. From the quirky \\"Don't Be Stupid\\" to the signature ballads \\"From This Moment\\" and \\"You're Still the One\\", Shania blends an awesome combination of fun and seriousness that leave the listener wanting more. Other songs such as \\"Man, I Feel Like a Woman\\" and \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" are top notch as well. Shania also outdid herself with some of the videos for these songs, too. I've seen Shania in concert performing these songs live, and they sound just as good on stage. Its no wonder she plays to packed houses wherever she goes. Songs such as the ones on this CD definitely leave the listener wanting more. Buy this first rate CD and experience the magic of Shania Twain. You'll want to listen to it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"~Shania Is Great!!!~","review":"Man this cd is really good. I'm not just saying that because it really is great! Shania has great songs. My favorite songs on her cd would probably be \\"Your Still the One\\" and \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" But I like all of her songs. She has a great voice as well. I don't know anyone who doesn't like her. I don't know what else to say its just that this cd is a great one. It deserves more than 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty repetitious stuff","review":"I will admit...I purchased this CD (albeit for $2.50 at the local used CD store), because I did like a couple of the singles on it. However, when putting this CD on and listening all the way through, one soon realizes that every song sounds just about the same (okay, okay...the fast ones sound like the other fast ones, the slow ones...well, you get it). As I quickly tired of hearing the one or two catchy songs on the radio (over and over and over), I have since traded this one back in to the store.If you like country, stick to Reba or Martina...they won't soon be yesterday's newspapers. And if you like pop...there are far better artists out there who are making lasting music (even Britney will be around long after Shania fades). And of course, if you just MUST buy this CD...at least wait until one of the many millions shows up used at a store near you for a couple bucks. That way, when you come to the same conclusion I did, you won't be out much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Gum Pop","review":"Please don't make my review one that doesn't help you..it's my opinion and if you like Shania I know you'll put me on the no list but I'm a die hard country fan so give me some credit. Shania is what is wrong with country music today..I agree her songs are good for dance or pop stations but I don't agree with her being known as a country artist. I'm from her home here in Canada. Come on over is a great song and the album does have some good beats to it but frankly \\"rock this country?\\" come on, please. If you really wanna hear some great country music before Shania \\"sold out\\" go listen to her self title debut album. What made you say that is a great tune. Thanks for your time all....be wise in your buying :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is pure poop","review":"It's so dumb...Don't buy it....Buy something better like Sarah MacLaughlan, Elaine Paige, or Sarah Brightman....They are so much more worthy of praise! Shania Twain is the worst, I mean worst, singer I have ever heard.... Her down-right cheeziness with skin tight leather dress (that is less than 2 feet long) and make-up from her eyes to behind her ears, is just sick.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fickle, unoriginal POP with a faint country influence","review":"It's a damn shame everyone likes Shania Twain. Modern country music is horrible nowadays - it's all pop songs and nothing compared to legends like Johnny Cash and Patsy Cline. Shania Twain is one of the most bland artists you'll find anywhere.What you have here is a mix of pop songs with sleep-inducing arrangements and overwrought corny Def Leppard style power ballads like \\"You're Still The One\\" and \\"From This Moment On\\" that is unappealing and nauseating. The only reason Shania is played on country radio is because she wears a ten-gallon hat. Seems like that's all you have to do nowadays to get your song played there, since Shania's music doesn't sound anything like country.All you people who have been listening to Shania Twain and Garth Brooks all your lives don't know what you're missing out on. Check out some albums by Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Hank Williams Sr., Buck Owens, etc., and you'll forget this stuff ever existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome cd","review":"My best friend and I went to her concert with her dad for our b-day present.

Her songs \\"You're Still The One\\", \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\", and \\"From This Moment\\" have all made the top ten.

I definately reccomend Shania's classy mix of pop and country,because there is a little something for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Fans: This is Not Country","review":"Though these songs are remarkable and passionat and filled with emotion, it's not what people now refer to as \\"country\\". if you want to listen to country get \\"The Woman In Me\\". this album is excellent for Pop fans. I own this not beacause I'm a Contry Fan but beacuase I'm a Shania Twain fan. And, please DO NOT CALL THIS CD COUNTRY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT HOOKS THROUGH AND THROUGH!!","review":"Shania and her husband producer Mutt Lange have created the perfect sound blending upbeat pop/rock with a country base that is effective to gain the attention of fans from all genres of music. The music is energetic, the vocal harmonies are right on, and the hooks are reminicent of the big 80's. I have liked pop metal and hard rock and frowned on country music all my life. No longer. Shania is rockin this country! I definately recommend this CD for anyone who likes good, upbeat, fun, music with talented vocal choruses and solid guitar arrangements (I should know, I'm a guitarist) By the way, Shania, if your's ever quits, give me a call, I'll join!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a ten year-old could write the lyrics that Shania does","review":"this album is a definate waste of money- I think that at times she has a great voice, but the constant talking in the middle of the songs is terrible. Her lyrics are lacking any real feeling, and anyone could write simple words like she uses!!!!! I have great admiration for musicians such as Martina McBride, and Patty Loveless, but Shania is what is wrong with country music. It is definately the video age- we like musicians because of what they look like... The song \\"that don't impress me\\", what is that all about- So you are Brad Pitt- that is the DUMBEST line in any song I have ever heard, and I listen to all kinds of music- So, your'e Shania, that don't impress me much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Country","review":"What a big disappointment! I liked her first two cds a lot, but this one is terrible. This is a pop album not country. She sold out, just like many so called \\"country\\" artist today. Listen to Terri Clark, at least she still sounds country."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Her Second Best.","review":"Shania Is One Of The Hottest Country Female Singers Along With: Reba McEntire, The Dixie Chicks, Patty Loveless, Faith Hill, Lee Ann Wolmack, Leanne Rimes, And Sara Evens. She Sings Good Songs Like Her Best Of The 90's \\"Love Gets Me Every Time\\", Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)\\" \\"You're Still The One\\", \\"From This Moment On\\" A Duet With Bryan White, \\"Honey, I'm Home\\", \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" The Title Track And \\"Rock This Country\\" Both \\"You're Still The One\\" And \\"From This Moment On\\". This Is A Must Have For Any Country Music Fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania's Influence....","review":"In my point of view, this album shows Shania's versatility - she can make success not only in U.S.A., but also internationally. This album - a touch of country and a touch of pop, shows Shania being guru in the music industry. She knows how to make catchy songs that could catch people's attention locally and internationally. I don't have any doubts if this album sold almost 40 million copies worldwide. This album must be added to everyone's CD collection, especially for those Shania's Fans like me :)...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly disappointed","review":"Many country fans have written negative reviews, saying that Shania has gone too \\"pop\\" for their tastes. I am a fan of both country and pop, and I was still not taken by Come On Over. \\"You've Got a Way\\" is beautiful because of its simplicity and delicacy. The title track is perfect when you're feeling run-down and you need a lite pick-me-up. Other than that, while Shania performed well throughout the album, I did not like the songs themselves. I find \\"Honey, I'm Home\\" to be particularly annoying. The lyrics make me cringe: \\"...Rub my feet. Give me something to eat. Fix me up my favorite treat....Give the dog a bone. Honey I'm home.\\" The fast songs have a good beat, but the content is often shallow and grows tired after repeated listens. It reaches the point of being irritating. Come On Over is more sizzle than steak. Try The Woman in Me; there's much more feeling behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Def Leppardish riffs with overprocessed country!","review":"This CD is only good after three listens. The lyrical content is very shallow and baseless. The Woman In Me was great, but was dearly disappointed with this. I compare it to leaving the bottle cap of the soda opened too long: it goes stale.When a CD gets this kind of hype and have no content, we all know it is a fad and in five years will be forgotten.\\"Honey, I'm Home\\" gets grating on the ears. The song doesn't even try to stay county, except with some synthesized fiddles. And the \\"remix\\" CD, if you can call it that is even worse. Shania has sold out to become a part of the pop world.I only like \\"You're Still The One\\" and \\"From This Moment On\\". Shania should go back to her country roots and give up this pop trip of hers.I can't wait to see real country back because this \\"New Country\\" is starting to sound more like mainstream pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLACK hip-hop loving girl drawn to COUNTRY because of SHANIA","review":"Sike. she's great. i knew one star would grab attention more than five stars because one star is so unexpected when dealing with such a talented woman. i love all types of music. however i was drawn to country music because of shania and dina (did is shave my legs for this) carter. since buying their music about 2 or 3 years ago, i've ventured out and brought other country abums over the years like garth, brooks and dunn, faith, and dixie chicks. i encourage all lovers of country music to be different and venture out like how i did and explore all types of music. shania is bad!! thanks to her i am no longer closed mind and have an appreciation of all types of music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a good country/pop album...","review":"This album, while not perfect, has enough quality in it to convince me that pop/country (aka Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill) can be really good. While not all of the songs on this album are excellent, \\"You're Still The One,\\" \\"From This Moment On,\\" and \\"You've Got A Way\\" are fantastic songs, all of them at least minor hits. \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman,\\" and \\"Come On Over\\" are good as well. While some of the songs suffer from inane lyrics and stupid titles, it is a good album, whether one likes country or not. If anything, that is the album's greatest success, providing good country music that appleas to diehard country fans as well as diehard pop music fans like myself, and that is good enough for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"way over-rated and very garth ville.","review":"i liked her first record alright not great.but this one is badd!!. with the exception of your'e still the one the rest is purely garth brooksville.no substance at all.way overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"country or not, it's trash","review":"Okay, so i admit I haven't actaully bought the cd. But who needs to? She's practically released the whole damn thing! There's been a lot of talk about wether this album is country or pop, either way you slice it's a bunch of dumb songs about PMS that ALL SOUND THE SAME! If you wanna hear vocal talent try Martina or Faith cause you won't find any on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"great cd......to be used as a bagel plate","review":"Ever notice how all country music girls are attractive? That's because the industry that writes all their songs for them need a pretty face so they can sell their records in higher quantities. If you think these artists write all their own songs then you must be naive enough to believe that Jessica Simpson is popular because of her music talent and not her looks. Why do you think country music lyrics are all the same? 'All my exes were at the family reunion', 'Her teeth were stained but her heart was pure', I mean come on, they're all written by the same industry. Real musicians aren't usually attractive, because they're too busy writing their own music to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I did not like this album at all. For starters, it was TOO LONG! Sixteen songs is a little ridiculous. My attention span usually goes after about 12 songs. And to top it all off, the songs aren't even anywhere near being country. The only good song on the whole album is From This Moment On, which she performs with Brian White. I wish I would have saved my money and purchased a different album. Give me Lee Ann Womack, Jo Dee Messina, or Terri Clark any day! I will never again purchase another album of Shania's. I can only hope that she will quite considering herself country, along with Faith Hill and Martina McBride. They are a disgrace to country music. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed, Shania has no talent at all.","review":"This album is not worth anything. All her songs sound the same, and it's sad. Her voice isn't even sweet enough to sing slow songs. Who said she was country? I say she should be trown into pop music, and stay there. To be a country singer, you need to be able to sing, and have talent. TRASH ALBUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soon turns sour, then awful!","review":"About half the tracks on this disc are slightly catchy at first. Some, such as Honey I'm Home, and Man I Feel like a woman are just awful souless money makers. Most of the country songs give the impression of being album fillers, and have little appeal.The whole album quickly becomes tedious. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Country Album","review":"Shania is so cool! Usually, I don't like country music, but this CD rocks. She mixes country with pop, and the outcome is totally awesome. I know have a new perspective on country music.

Shania's songs are so catchy and I find myself singing them in the shower. I usually don't like country, but this is different. It's got lot's of power and feeling to it. I can't stop listening to it and my sister, who usually hates the music I like, is always borrowing it. I think her single \\"Man, I Feel Like a Woman!\\" should be released as a single too. She is awesome and I hope she rocks on."},{"rating":"2","title":"This impressed me...","review":"Her newest album, Come on Over, is a big favorite of mine. Her songs are quite fun, with the exception of From This Moment being a inspiring hit. I highly recommend you to buy this because you will be happy whether you are a country fan or other music type fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate country--but here's Shania!","review":"I never liked Country, but Shania Twain is changing the face of it forever! I Love how she twists country into pop. It's great. this Cd is worth it to buy. Your Still The One, Come On Over, From This Moment On, Man! I Feel Like A Woman! and That Don't Impress Me Much are the highlights. I wish she would come out with a new CD though. Overall, it is still a little too country for me. but still an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually like this better than \\"The Woman in Me\\"","review":"I got this CD a month after its release(Christmas Day, to be exact)and though at first I didn't listen to the whole thing from beginning to end(due to the fact that there were SIXTEEN songs on the album) I began to enjoy it with more listens. Since there is no half-stars on the rating system, I actually give it 4 and a half stars because I don't care for that version of \\"You're Still the One\\", which is why I was excited when I found out that there was going to be an internaional version released with that version on there. Overall, a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I love Shania and I love this CD. EVERY song is my favorite. I have never been a fan of country...but, I love Shania Twain! AWESOME, simply AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"before shania came along,i hated country,in fact,i am a diehard vanhalen fan,that should tell you my taste in music,but,after hearing one song from her \\"woman in me\\"album i was hooked,nashville should give her a special award for making pop/rock fans country fans also.oh,by the way,she\`s very nice to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite as Good as The Woman In Me","review":"I like \\"Come on Over\\", but not as much as I like \\"The Woman in Me\\" which is one of my All-Time Favorite Albums. Don't get me wrong, \\"Come On Over\\" is a very good compilation of pop music, and you'll enjoy it if you buy it. It's just not as good as her previous effort in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great release by Shania!","review":"Well, I'm a die hard Shania fan, so I love all her work, but this album is the BEST! I love country music, but Shania really shines on her pop remixes. \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" and \\"You've Got A Way\\" remixes are reason enough to buy this album. All you critics of Shania going pop - give it a break and let her do her job! She's great at country and pop - is that a crime? This album is fantastic. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just plain awesome","review":"the cd rocks. there are no bad songs on it. if you are looking for quality music by a wonderful singer and performer then this is a must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy for listening no matter it is country or pop","review":"I like this CD very much. Shania had a beautiful voice. It related to a pop one rather than country. But it is not important no matter it is country or pop as when the music is generally accepted. It is enjoyable, commercial but good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is great!","review":"Shania Twain is better than any other country singer! Mostly because she's also pop. Shania Twain's \\"Woman In Me\\" album is good, but \\"Come On Over\\" is better! It contains great songs like the romantic French track \\"I Won't Leave You Lonely\\" and fun songs like \\"I'm Holding Onto Love\\", \\"You've Got A Way\\", \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\" \\"Rock This Country!\\", \\"You're Still The One\\", \\"From This Moment On\\" with Brian White, \\"Black Eyes, Blue Tears\\", and \\"Honey, I'm Home!\\" A great album for parties or if you're just in an eregetic mood. But not too energetic like Tina Turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on.....","review":"I bought this because I admire her catchy singles on radio -- particularly \\"Don't Be Stupid.\\" But, when you hear her own the radio, you only hear one song at a time. Back-to-back-to-back, the thinness of this material becomes painfully obvious. The songs all sound alike -- just take a look at how many of the titles contain exclamation points! And the over-the-top arrangements that mirror Shania's thin voice quickly wear thin. No doubt, she's gorgeous to look at....but, this CD seems to prove Shania Twain is someone who should be seen and not heard....."},{"rating":"1","title":"OKAY, LET'S TALK","review":"This CD further exacerbates me about the music industry and lack of brains that the mass buying public has. Shania Twain, and her last two releases, COME ON OVER and THE WOMAN IN ME, are total marketing ploys to get people to buy a product or package, which includes a hot babe who sings rock but is posing as a country singer. The country industry does this with not only her but just about every modern country singer right now. The quality control has definitely given way to the likes of Twain, Dixie Chicks, etc. There is no question why k.d. lang, the greatest country singer since Patsy Cline, did not get her due from the country masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could, I would vote it 0!!!!!","review":"I totally agree with shgeal02@willy.wsc.edu.....Shania Twain is a piece of trash! She plants her toes on stage in a skin-tight leather suit, and sings the most stupidest songs in the world! Just think abuot it! Man. I feel like a woman.. Feel the vibration? Can you spell D-U-M-B? I know I can! Dumb = Shania Twain and the Dixie CHicks! All country music for that matter!!!!! POOP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm caught in the middle..........","review":"I enjoyed her \\"The Woman in Me\\" much more than this one. The songs that are on here are ones that get me going when I am doing chores around the house. With this album, there just isn't the depth that there was with \\"The Woman in Me.\\" And what is it with her clothes in her videos??? As her career gets bigger, she wears less and less clothes. What message is she trying to get across?"},{"rating":"1","title":"some songs okay but most lyrics could be written by toddler","review":"i bought the cd - MY FIRST _ for 'still the one' and 'don't be stupid' but it's the lyrics that are stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, cheesy, but catchy.","review":"Summary says it all. From a woman who cannot be seen in public without almost totally exposing her body, that should be a clue. She has an awesome body but her talent is indirectly proportional to her looks. However, there are some catchy songs (You're Still The One, From this Moment On, That Don't Impress Me Much) on this disc which even the most cynical music fan would find themselves humming to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not country music ...","review":"It's a shame when so many artists jump south of the border and jump on the pop bandwagon - and I think Shania can safely be placed in this category. Her latest album feels less like a country album and more like a carefully orchestrated pop album - much in the same foray as artists like Alanis Morrisette. It is not the country music I would expect to hear from a Timmins girl, nor is it country music by any traditional definition. \\"New\\" country is a rehash of the same stuff the Eagles have been playing for the last 20 years - and it's wearing thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I bought into is not what I got","review":"I bought this album for one reason only, the song \\"From This Moment On\\". I saw the video and heard the radio airplay (sung by Shania only) but on the album it's a duet with Bryan White. It's just not the same song on the album. There's a reason why they redid this song solo, because it's just average as a duet. As for the rest of the album, it was utterly forgettable. In fact, it was kind of ridiculous how Shania feels the need to grunt out her own choice of WORD before almost every song (Coool)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy Cat","review":"Her husband Mutt Lange produced this album and it shows. He also produced Def Leppard albums. The similarities between her songs and various Def Leppard songs is ridiculous. They can mostly be heard on her song \\"Honey, I'm home\\". This song is a reproduction of Def Leppard's \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" Shania Twain has her looks going for her, but not her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania, keep rockin'!","review":"Shania is one of the few women in country that is not whiny. Her songs are all positive and full of energy. Listening to this cd always puts me in a good mood. This cd ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She is my all time favorite!","review":"I have loved Shania ever since I heard \\"Any Man Of Mine\\" but this CD is just as good as her second one. (I like her first one, too.) I love the fact that she and her husband write all the songs! My favorite thing about this disc is that ALL OF THE SONGS ARE POSITIVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Shania rocked at the Grammy's and made Madonna look like dog meat! She is beautiful and fans will not be disappointed with this cd. Just look at the hits from it! The ballads are beautiful and you can't sit still to the fast ones. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What ever happened to \\"Dance with the one that brought you\\"?","review":"Shania has always been a terrific singer, with an amazing voice, who is obviously very easy on the eyes. Unfortunately though she is moving further away from country. I still feel her best song is \\"Dance with the one that brought you\\" from her first album since it has the old style country sound. This is a terrific album, especially the song \\"From this moment.\\" - one of the best love songs ever written. One question though, what happened to Bryan White in the video? He just disappeared and it became an all female version. All in all, Shania is terrific, but she should not be classified country."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHANIA'S BIGGEST FAN.....","review":"\\"COME ON OVER\\" IS ANOTHER GREAT CD.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK..ALL OF YOUR MUSIC IS GREAT.FROM LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS ALL I GATHER IS SEVERAL JEALOUS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.YOU GOT IT RUN WITH IT..THEY WOULD IF THEY COULD THE PROBLEM IS THEY \\"CAN'T\\"...CAN'T WAIT UNTILL YOUR NEXT CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I REALLY really like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really like this song and I love the way Shania sings. I hope to get the CD soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough! How about 50 stars?","review":"Excellent! I just can't get enough of this album. One can't say enough good things about it, the music, lyrics, rythm, etc, etc.... Generally I don't listen to country but I LOVE Shania Twain. Not only is she a great artist but a good example for women whether their country fans or not. Even if you don't like country this one is a must have! The Woman in Me is an excellent album too. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a country fan, but I still love this cd!","review":"OK, so \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" does get a little old, and some of the songs have pointless lyrics, but there are also a couple really great songs on there. I love \\"From This Moment\\", \\"You're Still the One\\", and \\"You've Got A Way\\". \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman\\" is my fave song to play in the mornings to perk me up enuf to get ready for school. All in all, it's a great cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GUILTY PLEASURE","review":"Personally,I never could stand country. I'm amazed that I even like this. This CD contains some of '98 and '99's best songs such as \\"From This Moment\\",\\"You're Still the One,\\"and the beautiful \\"You've Got a Way.\\" It's one of the best-selling CDs by a female artist of all time so don't miss out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, given her past success","review":"Shania, no one's denying that you're talented. I enjoyed The Woman In Me, but this new radio-friendly junk is beneath someone of your capabilities. Get some intelligent lyrics, and knock off all that talking over the songs. You have a lovely voice, just use it! I'll add another star here based on the appeal of Still The One, and maybe even From This Moment (although I have to say the duet with Bryan White is far superior to the solo version) except for those two songs, you need to go back to the drawing board. Also, you're beautiful without having to expose yourself. Leave something to the imagination. And return to your country roots, before it's too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best ever","review":"Shania Twain is a very great artist I think that she has a lot of talent in the music buissness !!I think that if she keeps it up she can be as good as Marylin Monroe!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My fellow CANADIAN","review":"Shania Twain is the best! She has style, sex appeal and talent. What more can you ask for? Besides she was born in the same province as me, Ontario. And we're both beautiful!! WOW Us Canadians have it going on! This album is excellent, good songs !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional album","review":"I'm not a huge country music fan. But I absolutely LOVE Shania's new CD! It has a mix of pop and country which gives it a fresh new sound, appealing to many people. She obviously had fun making it, and I had a ton of fun just listening to it. It makes you want to get up and dance! And it has a TON of songs on the CD. Its well-worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"first i heard from this moment and i thought... i gotta buy this album! so when i bought it! i was listening to it 24/7! so i got sick of it! but i still like listening to it! and ill give you advice! never listen to a country album 24/7! it will make you sick of the album!ha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania, You've got a Way!","review":"Every single song on this album is soo good!

The CD version is different (i.e. steel guitars) than the version played on soft rock radio stations. I was very disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated&overplayed","review":"what is so special about Shania Twain? she is a country Jennifer Lopez.all hype and no talent.Lee ann Rimes is a better vocalist but when she tried to go pop all Hell broke out.Shania is pop.her songs and material have more in common with celine dion than Patsy Cline.that don't impress me much is as pop as addicted to Love.she is great at marketing but her music has no roots.Still the one was catchy as is the case with some of her other material but considering her overall impact she is way overrated&overplayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to knock a fellow Canadian but...","review":"Although this album is musically enjoyable the lyrics are juvenille to the extreme. It is amazing that an album with lyrics so childlike, that it seems that they were written by a fourteen year old girl, has sold so many millions of copies. I guess intelligent lyrics are no longer important as long as the melody is catchy. All the same I am happy with the success of all our Canadian artists. I must admit I was a bit put off by her deliberate lies about her heritage. Did she really believe that proclaiming herself an aboriginal Canadian would further her career?"},{"rating":"1","title":"another attempt to strech this album out","review":"Now at the begining when the original come on over was released it was a good album but come on enough is enough. Its time for a new album.

I Feel Like a Woman.\\" I gave her a 5 for looks and a negative 1 for music, weighted equally that comes out to 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come On And Get Over Here","review":"The country crossover queen of the late 90's, Shania unleashed this album and went on to make it the most successful album ever released by a woman. The songs are magic, exciting and upbeat. Her lyrics empower women without making men look less than what they are. At her most upbeat, she's fiesty, with anthemic hits like \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\" and \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\". At her most epic, she's devoted, with mellow smashes like \\"You're Still The One\\" and \\"From This Moment On\\". She opened the door for country pop divas like Faith Hill, Dixie Chicks, and Lee Ann Womack. A door that young country starlets continue to eye with want in their hearts. This album is a country pop gem. Shania's home grown classic, filled with punchy greats like \\"When\\", \\"Don't Be Stupid\\", and \\"Honey, I'm Home\\". An essential pop confection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania = The Best","review":"I would just like to say that this album, along with Unplugged by the Corrs, is probably the best album I ever heard, Right from You're Still The One through to Rock This Country, Shania shows off her incredible voice, on 16 excellent tracks.A flawless performance indeed, Ms Twain."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is country, I'm Grandpa Jones","review":"And I'm not.

And on a more frightening note, if you like this CD, well then ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it","review":"I have been trying to be a Shania fan ever since my two girls bought her CD 'Come on Over'. I took it to work and played it all day long through my computer. I tried, I really did. I can't seem to get past the silly, simple minded, amateurishly written lyrics. That silly, immature 'It Don't Impress Me Much' - Ugh. Sounds like she was grasping for words that rhyme. I liked 'Your Still The One' a lot but the radio stations have just about played that one to death. 'Man! I Feel Like A Woman' also sounds like a song she wrote without her husbands assistance. Just an observation on my part but her most successful songs seem to have the Lange influence while the amateur sounding ones have the Twain influence. I have a suspicion when credit is given to both it's mostly Lange with Twain interjecting a couple of words here and there. 'You've Got A Way' is a really nice song. It's the only one I can take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the Radio!","review":"This CD is not worth the money! The fun and upbeat songs that I heard on the radio and liked are not worth the money for the whole CD. If you haven't heard the rest of the songs then don't bother. Her irritating bark and yipping and pathetic lyrics get old after about two listens. I like pop and true country and this CD isn't near the top of either lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania Twain deserves all of her success!","review":"I became a fan of Shania two years ago. To be honest, two years ago, I would not have even considered country music. However, after hearing a few hits from Shania's \\"The woman in me\\", I was hitched (to Shania anyway). Now, at the age of 25, I have opened up to country more and more and actually enjoy alot of it. I have been a faithful fan ever since and cannot wait for her concert in March, here in Winnipeg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome just like Shania Twain, herself!","review":"This album starts with a bang. Out of 16 songs on the cd, only three were bad in my opinion. Track #11 blew me away, it's now my favorite song on the cd. I don't however like the fact that her solo version of From This Moment On is getting loads more airtime than the duet version with Bryan White. To tell you the truth, I would give it four and a half stars because it's that great. The day this cd came out, I got it. This is unusual for me because I usually exercise caution when buying cds. If there are 16 songs on a cd, I had better like at least half of them before I will buy the cd. This is one cd, I don't regret getting. It was worth the wait after The Woman in Me. This cd is even better than that one and that first was a four star cd at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety with perfect execution... loved it!","review":"Shania never ceases to impress me with her vocal talents and broad style. She is beautiful and talented... what a combination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Sound, Wrong Genre... But A Shania Triumph!","review":"There's a good reason why this album sold over 18 million copies in the U.S. This album blends country with rock/pop better than any album before it. And Twain once again shows off her song-writing capabilities on her this, her third Lp. This is her second effort produced by husband Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange and he certainly helps make it shine. Come On Over was certainly worth of all the Grammy nominations and wins it received. But no one should criticize Twain for \\"going pop\\", because all that does is draw more of a fan base to country music. It certainly did for me. There must be a reason why we have 3 copies of it in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous album","review":"I never thought I would enjoy an album so much as this gem from the hottest singer on the planet. Millions of others appear to agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable","review":"There is a reason why this cd has become the best selling album ever by a female recording artist (17 million and counting). I have owned this cd since that November day back in 1997 when it was released and haven't stopped listening to it yet. All the songs on \\"COO\\" are very good and entertaining. Granted they are not the best songs ever written, but, that was not Shania's goal. Her goal is to please her fans, and she has done that. So, if you have not yet bought this CD, do so at this very moment. I promise you that you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania Twain - Come On Over","review":"This is my first album recorded by Shania Twain, I think this is one of the best country albums. When I heard \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\" I immediately wanted to purchase one of the albums or the single. The best songs are \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\", \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" (the dance remix is a little better though), \\"Honey, I'm Home\\", \\"You're Still The One\\", \\"From This Moment On\\", \\"Rock This Country!\\", \\"If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!\\", \\"Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)\\", and many others. If you like Shania Twain, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does this mean I am a country music convert?","review":"I finally broke down and bought Shania's Come on Over today...after it is over two years old. I am a die-hard rock and blues/rock fan and I admit that the only \\"country\\" music I own is two Garth Brooks CDs. But there were so many singles from this CD playing on the radio that I just had to have this CD. It is awesome! Every track is well worth listening to and you can't say that about most CDs! I can't believe that other people wrote bad reviews. So what if the lyrics are a bit different and the melodies not \\"true\\" country? I find it just plain FUN and original and in this day and age...you don't find much of that anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"This CD is NOT country music.

I am usually not in to country, but some of the songs in Shania Twain's just make me want to get up and dance! Man, I Feel Like A Woman is just the song for all women to live by, along with That Don't Impress Me Much. The tracks are so honest to life and incredibly passionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania's at her Best here!","review":"Shania is a very talented and versatile Singer/Song Writer, and this album does nothing but enhance that image. Most of the album is duplicated from the American version of \\"Come On Over\\", but the additional Dance cut versions and International flavor make this a \\"must have\\" part of any Shania fan's collection. I enjoy the instrumental mix in \\"Love Gets Me Every Time\\", and \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\". They are so much different than the original versions...it's easily picked up on. I find myself replaying those cuts over and over again. The playing order is completely changed from the American version, and that adds excitement to the rocking cuts as well as the slower romantic ones. Shania, you and Mutt have a real winner here...keep it up, and we will all \\"Rock This Country\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it was better","review":"I have really gotten into Roy Wood again lately thanks to getting a CD version of MUSTARD. MAIN STREET turned out to be a great surprise that should have been released when it was originally ready. However, STARTING UP is a different kettle of fish.It is extremely dated with its 80's production, approach and sound. It was a pretty painful listening experience for me and being a big Roy Wood fan (and huge ELO/Move fan) it pains me to say that. There's not much I would want to listen to again. I have heard comparisons to McCartney's PRESS TO PLAY and the Stones' DIRTY WORK (haven't heard it), but it mostly makes me sad listening to this CD. Press to Play is not one of my favorite Macca albums, but it's great compared to this.I can only recommend this for the Roy Wood completist and even then don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"TORX Set","review":"I needed just one particular size to remove some bolts in my car.

I couldn't wait to get this home and try it out. However, there are some huge limitations of this device:1. Unless you live in a major city that happens to have a satellite repeater to rebroadcast the signal (New York), you cannot get any service. At my house 20 mins outside of Pittsburgh, PA, I can only get a signal if I stand directly in front of a window.2. It comes with a set of satellite headphones that are so uncomfortable, they should be used to torture captured terrorists with. Unwearable.3. I figured that at least I would be able to use this thing to store MP3s on. However, with their provided software, you cannot store MP3s on this thing - they want you to move up to the 100.So, unless you want to stand outside in your front yard in the middle of winter to hear satellite radio, there's no benefit of this device at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensibly Pointless","review":"I found this product to be profoundly useless. The headphones which are apparently mandatory to get *any* kind of signal are unbearably uncomfortable. You must also be *outside*, so I had to sit in my yard in the winter to listen to the radio and even then only managed occasional snippets of broken up audio.Stick with terrestrial radio - it works!One other alternative - use an mp3 player and get into podcasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fuss, No Muss Satelite Radio?!?!?! Um, No.","review":"I LOVE Sirius radio, and I paid well for this because I thought it was supposed to be a high-speed, low-drag way to get it. It is not. The antenna headphones are pretty good at getting signal, much better than the antennas that come with the Sportster, but they are bulky and uncomfortable. If you want to use it in the car, or as anything but a Walkman, you have to buy seperate kits (another $100 after the $195 I'd already paid). And the car kit is, well...See my review there. For here, lets just say don't plan to use it in the car. So, to sum up, Sirius satellite radio...Excellent content in terms of music, talk and news. Getting satellite radio signal? A pain in the behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Let-Down","review":"I'm not the type to generally review products, but the Sirius S10 was so remarkably bad, that I thought the least I could do was add my two cents here for other potential buyers. What the other reviewers say about the earphones and signal issues is absolutely correct---I cannot conceive what value a \\"portable\\" satellite receiver has that is virtually incapable of receiving any signal, and then when it does, loses it if you happen to move the wrong way. Unless you plan on installing an outside antenna and using the device for stationary listening, you're much better off with a standard MP3 player that includes an FM receiver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiletto buyers- please READ THIS","review":"Read all the reviews here before you buy a Stiletto because there is a 100% chance that; A.)The supplied antenae headphones cannot be worn for more than a few minutes without your ears beginning to blead.B.)You cannot move while wearing said earphones or they flip down and off your head due to their top heavy design (the antenae on the top).C.)Receiving a signal in any other location other than a wide open treeless prairie...while standing exactly still will be a rare occurance. If you do get a signal it will dissappear in a few seconds. Even glass is enough of a barrier to impede the signal.O T H E R W I S EIt works great in your car w/car kit or at home with your home kit and of course you can record Sirius programing which is nice but I really wanted the portability and this just doesnt do it. You certainly cant jog with the headphones on and you cant ski either because no signal can get through a hat or helmet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reception","review":"I live in a relatively flat rural area of Pennsylvania and purchased theSIRIUS Stiletto SL100 Portable Satellite Radio Receiveralmost two years ago to use when working outside. It has been a major disappointment primarily because of the poor reception. The headphone antenna is mandatory to obtain any signal, but even with the headset I am only able to get intermitent reception. It is lost as soon as you walk under a tree, behind a telephone pole or God forbid a butterfly flys overhead. It is primarily designed for the creative listener that likes to hear every 10th measure of a song or intermitent pieces of a game and mentally fill in the rest. It doesn't sound like the new Stiletto 2 is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"COSMA INFINITE NINA","review":"A great listen if you're in the mood for punk rock, high energetic music.

The recipes were good and had a lot of variety. But as I used it I noticed the lack of attention to detail. Trying to follow along with a recipe is an exercise in frustration because the book isn't spiral bound so it won't lie flat and stay open to a particular page; the appendix make some attempt at helping you find certain ingredients, but doesn't do a very good job. I've since acquired several more Tiki Drink books and would recommend the Beachbum Berry books as superior to this one.

They cover some songs on this album that are not on any studio albums. What is disappointing is that this could have been even better. The sound mix sounds like the guy mixing it got far too loaded as the concert went on, and the mix gets worse as it goes along. In addition, the band got completely [drunk], and as the concert goes on, their playing suffers. At one point, Van Zant can't remember the words to a song, and you can hear one of the backup singers say \\"Whiskey, Baby\\".

As Dr. Delaware tries to unravel these mysterious cases, a brutal murder occurs on the island of Aruk. Alex inquires of Dr. Moreland about the islands history, and Dr. Moreland is very vague in his response. As the climax of this novel approaches, Alex finds cryptic messages left for him by the then missing Dr. Moreland. Robin is very much a main character in this story. However, if you are a big fan of Milo (as I am ), you may be dissapointed because his character plays a minor part in this novel.

And for those Kellerman fans who love Milo, be prepared for disappointment since Milo doesn't appear. I love Kellerman, but the story here was ridiculous. The ending was so far fetched that it made me yank off my iPod (I listened to the audio version). Character development was poor, but that could be because there were too many characters. Only Elizabeth George can get away with that. The book did not keep my interest and this is unusual for a Kellerman book. It was entertaining in parts, but overall a poor effort.

Kellerman tries to presentt a complex villian, with conflicting motivations, but just ends up with a muddy character given to maudlin speeches.Then again...I *did* read all the way to the end and had to see how it all turned out. I should be so lucky to be able to write a 300+ page book that people would actually wade thru to the end! Everyone deserves a day off every now and then, and this was Mr. Kellerman's. Let's hope THE CLINIC, coming in January 1997 is a big rebound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good delaware","review":"All the elements that you would expect from Alex Delaware are present in this one.

However, the order of presentation can be a littleconfusing. Also, some of the topics were a little beyond what Ineeded it for, though that is not a bad thing.What I found annoying at times was that it did not always address aquestion I may have had about how to apply a particular class.Having \\"Learning Java: 2nd Edition\\" helped somewhat to alleviatethis as it had more in the way of explanations than this book.For the absolute beginner I would probably recommend another book.However, if the reader has background knowledge in Java, or otherprogramming languages then this book will probably prove to beuseful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Java Beans book","review":"is a goodbook for learning JavaBeans and all the other associated topics. It covers JavaBeans, the 1.1event model, properties, persistence, JAR files, BeanBox, introspection, and ActiveX.The writing is very concise and easy to understand.

I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"writing is good but examples are poor","review":"The writing is pretty good. Reading this book, a Java programmer can understand the Java Beans concepts.

This is the only O'Reilly book I've read that wasn't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing book about beans","review":"This is not a good tutorial about Java Beans. In order to explain the Java Bean concept you have to start with the Java Beans specifications of Sun. This would answer question about which things are relevant and why they are relevant in JavaBeans development. Now the the reader almost jumps into a long winded explanation about events and adapters, wondering why this is relevant and what the writer wants to explain. To make matters worse: the example contains errors! Basically, after the first three chapters I was utterly confused.This book also needs a clearer description about the use of Java Beans. In a next update we definitely need a chapter about how JavaBeans are used in Java Server Pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not only about Java Beans though.","review":"This book is titled \\"Developing Java Beans\\".

Almost 300 pages, half are I found worthless. I have programmed in Swing and JDBC, I wanted to start getting into some Java Bean development.

There are no compiled versions of the source code, no make files -- you even have to create your own manifest files. I can forgive all this. What I feel cheated about is the bugs in the examples and all the time I had to spend to modify the source code so that it would compile. (I finally gave up.) I have contacted O'REILLY about this and they appear to have acknowledged the problem. I'm hoping the author will produce an updated version of the source code at a later point. I suggest downloading the examples from their web site and seeing if they compile and work properly before buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice deep pockets","review":"I received these sheets about a month ago and have been overall pleased with the product.

'Alma Matters' is a classic Morrissey tune as is 'Ammunition' and 'Wide to Receive' - there are also a few tunes that are lower than classic Morrissey - 'Maladjusted' and 'Roy's Keen' - but are still good! This is a highly playable album - and I find it strangeley comforting when I'm in a bad mood - you should check it out - underrated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real artist","review":"The album Maladjusted yes is not a complete album with all his best work, but the songs i believe touch on all his different types of music. The song \\"Trouble loves me\\" has to be one of Morrissey's best songs. It takes a little while to get in to it but once you get it you are hooked. The words scream to you and the chorus really gets you going. I think the other people who wrote these reviews need to go home and listen to the album again because they are trying to hold on to the Smiths and taking it out on Morrissey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heaven knows I'M miserable now","review":"God, this one blew.

This is not the album that will win over new converts. His lyrics have always been his strength, but they are starting to become a bit tired. \\"Roy's Keen\\" is admittedly amusing, but the album overall is nothing special. Formulaic and predictable. Try Viva Hate or Your Arsenal first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Is He Dropping and Changing Tracks?","review":"I remember Papa Jack as being one of the more tuneful and melodic songs on Maladjusted, and should have read the track listing before I ordered this. Same with the re-issue of Bona Drag. He dropped a whole verse from Ouija Board thus mutilating it (remember the shattering of glass in the background after his name was spelt out?), gone!!I hope he doesn't pull this type of thing when and if Kill Uncle is remastered.Not happy Moz!!!Plus now I have to fork out for a inferior sounding original pressing of Maladjusted just to get Papa Jack back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sassy Morrissey","review":"This album points to a maturation in the album quality of Morrissey's music. Each song flows smoothly into the next, humor balancing maudlin musings throughout the album.The ultimately sexy lines in the opening track \\"you stalk the house in a low-cut blouse\\" lend to Moz's sensitivity and respect for the female form, but also the raw sexuality that draws his fans like moths to a flame.The strength of the first song, Maladjusted, draws the listner in to experience the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"most solid solo effort to date","review":"This album is wonderful. As a long time Smith's fan I was a bit reluctant to pick this title up. Most of Morrissey's solo albums have some great songs on them, but for the most part they are all inconsistant, except this album. I am so happy that I gave it a chance. It is now one of my most favorite albums of all time. Please give it a chance. You wont be Dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have you ever seen a keener window cleaner?","review":"I am a big fan so expect some bias.

Great CD recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best so Far","review":"I have Songs from..., White Stones, and Dawn of a New Century. I love all three, but I believe Once in a Red Moon is the best so far. I was concerned about there being three vocals, but the music is so good that they are written to that they don't distract from the others. I liked the first three releases so much that I was surprised that they could come out with one better, but I believe they did. They have such a beautiful rich sound, that I listen to them over and over and worry about getting tierd of it, but I don't. I can't say that about many artists. If you like the first three releases, don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really great!","review":"I discovered Secret Garden quite by accident. They were in Indy during a recent pledge drive at the PBS station here. So of course the station played their concert at Lillehammer. What a great accident! The music is sooo lovely. As with some New Age groups, you get the impression that if you hear one of their songs you've heard them all. Not Secret Garden. If you buy this CD you will not be disappointed. This duo will get even bigger. I thank God for their gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another enchanting album","review":"I recently got into Secret Garden with their '97 album \\"White Stones\\". I loved their fusion sound of celtic melodies with the gorgeous, lush sounds of new age music. When I found a copy of their new album \\"Once in a Red Moon\\" in the used cd bins at my favorite record store, I immediately had to buy it.What a surprise when I got when I heard vocals on a lot of the songs on this album. Lyrically, I found some of those songs to be over-the-top, cheesy that would fit perfectly right in in the Christian pop market. ... Asides from the cheesy lyrics, I loved all of the songs. Nothing has changed. Still is that gorgeous blend of celtic and new age music. I loved listening to the tracks with the vocalists but I just wish that the lyrics were better written.

About halfway through, the screen fogged up. I stopped and took the iPod out of the case, and the iPod was covered in sweat. The fabric that lines the inside of the wristband/case absorbs moisture, but the neoprene that covers the outside doesn't allow it to evaporate. Besides allowing a lot of sweat to build up around your iPod, it also makes your wrist awfully hot.For walking or for short runs in cooler weather, this would be fine; but if you find much sweat on your shirt during a run, you can probably figure you'd have a lot of sweat on your iPod too if you used this. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured getting returned","review":"I paid 15.99 for cheap foam rubber.

It fits the iPod nano perfectly, and is very comfortable on my wrist, which I prefer much more then having my ipod on my upper arm. I bought the Nike+ shoes, but they have not came in yet, so I thought I would try out the sensor pouch that this item comes with, and I had bad luck with it. I have ran twice with it, and I ran two miles my first and it said I only ran 1.56 miles. The second time I ran, I did just one mile, and it said that I only did 0.77 miles. I was disappointed with the pouch, but I did not buy this item for that, just the armband, so I still give this item 4/5 stars. If you're wanting to buy this item for just the sensor pouch, I would think heavily over it. If you want it for the armband, then go ahead and buy it, it's definetly worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but flimsy","review":"This product served me about a year before it started ripping at the seams.

I have had this case for almost a year and I still love it. I use it several times a week for running, as well as, during my training for a half marathon. I live in very hot climate and I don't even notice that I have it on my arm. The dual straps for wrist or upper arm placement make it even better. In the winter months, the wrist position works well wtih a long sleeve top. This case provides a tight fit for the iPod and the Nike+ receiver, while the clear window provides easy access for selections on the iPod. I will buy another as the neoprene is beginning to split where it has to fit over the receiver but it definitely was worth the price, considering how much I have used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk.","review":"I bought this because I wanted a window for the controls, which the nike armband doesn't have. It says it's a wristband/armband, so I assumed it was elastic and could stretch, it can't. It's made for people with small arms, and barely fits over my wrist. They include an extender, but it uses such a small piece of velcro that it comes loose and drops your ipod if you look at it funny. Also, the window fogs up the instant you start sweating.If you have tiny wrists and never sweat, it's perfect. For me it's completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great a product","review":"This doesn't really work that great. The armband sucks.

But I was training for an Ironman in the middle of a humid Miami summer, and this product failed miserably very early on. Now that it's winter, I thought the armband would work. Not so. After 1/2 hour of working out, the case gets very steamy and doesn't respond to you trying to press the buttons. Your iPod will stop working, it'll lock up even if you don't lock it.

I think if she had been working with the people at Varese Sarabande, for instance, the songs might have been more unusual and exciting.

Stick with her work on \\"The Slow Drag.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I loved Kim Criswell's first two solo albums -- \\"The Human Cry\\" and \\"The Lorelei\\" -- because they were original and imaginative. But this disc is tired and predictable -- I mean, does the world really need another version of \\"Memory\\" after Elaine Paige's? Songs like \\"On My Own,\\" \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\" have been recorded countless times, and Kim doesn't add anything new with her interpretations. Criswell's earlier albums were so brilliant (especially \\"The Lorelei\\"), but here, it sounds like she's just slumming. And the title song is one of the worst examples of oversinging I have ever heard since the last Michael Ball disc. I wish I could like this album, but I just can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very thoughtful","review":"Kim Criswell is a great talent, but I'm shocked at how little thought & imagination she puts into her songs. A big voice is not enough. What about things like creativity, good arrangements and a fresh approach to music? You won't find those qualities here, unfortunately. This album could have been recorded 15 years ago. That doesn't mean it's timeless. It means it is tired. I don't even recommend this with reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Before\\" rhymes with \\"Bore\\"","review":"Kim Criswell wasn't a familiar name to me, even though I am a MAJOR Broadway buff. No wonder, after hearing this CD. There is no sense of adventure here, just a performer singing some of the most common, overworked songs in theater history. Listening to this, there is no sense that this a performer willing to try anything new; instead she is sticking to the old guard and not doing anything new with it. Audra McDonald and Ruthie Henshall have nothing to worry about.

For me these selections, in particular, are retrospectives of these past appearances. She played Grizabella in \\"Cats\\" as part of the original L.A. cast; she played Mary Magdalene in \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" at the wonderful Papermill Playhouse (who produced the '98 production of \\"Follies\\"); and she sang \\"Unusual Way\\" as the understudy, and later, first replacement in \\"Nine\\" as the screen star, Claudia. Her performance, live, in this role was nothing short of perfection. She was coiffed and costumed in a style similar to how Anita Ekberg appeared in \\"La Dolce Vita\\" and was a vision on the stage. For me the disc serves as a souvenir of great memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB","review":"Everytime I listen to another Kim Criswell cd, I get goosebumps. Every cd she does, she tops herself! I just love it!

The choice of songs lacks inspiration, and Kim Criswell seems to lack an emotional connection to the material. This is a disc in which nothing seems to come together.

On BACK TO BEFORE, I think I can figure out why certain things don't work. Some of the difficulties are due to the orchestrations, which are deflating and lifeless. Some of the problems may be with the singer, who is piercing and shrill at certain moments; melodramatic and arch at others. The least of all the difficulties is the material, which is where I differ with other Amazon.com reviewers. This is a classic group of songs presented here. They are just not presented very well, unfortunately. So any plusses are for the smart choice of material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs and a not so great Singer","review":"I can't argue about the selection of songs here. They are classics for a reason. They are some of the best loved show tunes of all time! But the delivery by the singer here is not good. She is loud and unemotional and never moved me. I thought it would be hard not to be moved by the song Memory but Kim Criswell did it. If you love Broadway, there are much better albums than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm getting very sleepy....","review":"This CD expresses so little imagination or originality, it's a wonder it's still available. The songs are all overly familiar and have been recorded too many times. The arrangements are lifeless and boring, with no spark to them. And Kim Criswell just doesn't seem to connect with the material. It's like she's just going through the emotions. On TV, she has a bit of excitement to her, but here she just kind of limps through everything. This is one to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"What else can you say?","review":"There's not a lot to say about this CD, other than it's not very good.

However, Kino's DVD transfer is a disappointment and should be avoided. Buy the VHS version instead, particularly since the DVD looks as if the VHS was merely reproduced with a further loss in duplication. Kino almost always produces good to excellent DVD transfers, so this one is doubly troublesome; the contrast is poor, important details are lost, and the overall image is fuzzy and as soft as whip cream. This should be a five star but the poor quality of the transfer brings it way down.

These are probably three of his greatest works packaged together at a reasonable price. Blow by Blow led the charge in his day, back in the day when Beck (back then there was only one Beck) supported his vinyl efforts with ironclad live shows. After his short stint with some bleach blond, spikey haired gravelly voiced singer and Cozy Powell aside, a competent but bland band featuring Van Morrison's sideman Bobby Tench, there was Blow by Blow. Beck finally got the message that his audience didn't care about a Jeff Beck Group, it wanted just Jeff Beck. These three albums sum up everything that was new, exciting, and explosive about Jeff Beck.

I bought it nonetheless, even more eager to do so after seeing the video to their single \\"Name of the Game\\". ... Great stuff, without a doubt. Just like Vegas, every song on it is good. No semi-weak songs, or terrible songs, or filler, all the songs were carefully crafted, and \\"tweeked\\", before TCM actually released the cd, which is why there was a four year period in between albums.

But I could not give this album 5 stars, only because the occasional profanity on Tweekend is a significant distraction to adds nothing positive to the album.

Sure it is fine to use voice samples (like on Vegas they were used pretty well) but overdoing it ruins it. Then you've got that backstreet-boy-esque song w/lyrics... I am dissapointed that they are going more into mainstream styles. Vegas was so new, had such a distinct flavor.. this CD sounds like everyone else. Maybe they died and the record company hired some guys to sound like them.... hmmm..."},{"rating":"2","title":"big beat","review":"JUST FINISHED LISTENING TO THE NEW TCM CD AND IT ROCKS !

I don't have hate for the direction Crystal Method went in, I just don't like it. Songs hit the radio or the parties or my deck when they sound good. This cd isn't even worth listening to, it has no actual progression to keep you listening. I love a cd that keeps you wanting more like the euphoria collection or spirit zone. Tweekend sounds like an over produced jumble of music with no melody. Tweekend cannot be labeled as a certain type of music, but it's not at the breaking edge of anything. I guess the only way to enjoy it would be if there was no other music and that's all there was. This isn't what I anticipated, and if you can't tell every one either hates it or loves it(definitely not mainstream like Vegas)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegas, Part II","review":"Yes, there are some really good songs.

I really don't like it too much. It just isn't fun to listen to - gives me a headache. And I agree with the other reviewers that the bad language really isn't necessary.

BUT tweekend......it was a sad day for them when i listened to it. They should have ditched mr. Rage from the whole deal and stuck with thier old sounds and just expanded on it. Or maybe they should have waited to release vegas so it would sound and sell twenty times better when compared to tweekend. Still they are the crystal method so its not that bad but i was....dissapointed with this album hopefully they can figure out what went wrong and fix it on thier next one. And where the heck is the chick riffs???? or the space guy?? i'll listen to sound clips before i buy the next one with the hopes they will repent and do it on thier own again and kick the rage guy out of the studio when he tries to mess up thier music.

To be fair, some of the tracks here show signs of inprovement from 'Vegas' but overall they blend into one big nothing. The sounds and beats on this album are all so played out and there really isn't much to to set the tracks on this album apart from each other. Its a case of 'the hip-hoppy one','The one with the funky guitar lick','The one with the washed up rock vocalist'...In the end it just all seems so contrived and generic.

Since then, I waited around for news of any new material. After hearing about \\"Tweekend\\" (and listening to subsequent samplings of the album), I knew it was going to be worth the wait. While boasting some impressive guest talent (Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello co-produces several tracks, including the great \\"Name Of The Game\\" and Stone Temple Pilots' Scott Weiland contributes vocals to \\"Murder\\"), the music is quite impressive.

It proved a decent companion, and still does to this day.All in all, don't by this book and expect examples, just good reference material and moderately documented methods and return types.- Hope it was helpful"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book doesn't live up to its title","review":"The title of this book is misleading, 80 percent of its contents can be found in sun's online documents,the coverage on CORBA and RMI is a joke. \\"java network for dummies\\" may be a better title. all the examples given in this book refects the author(s)'s understanding of networks is sub-skin deep. if you are a serious java network developer, buy Doug Lea 's book and don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait... and look for a better book in the market","review":"Please dont get carried away by the wonderful reviews for this book by some readers. This is an expensive book but definitely not worth the money. The book should be named Java I/O programming rather than a network related title.Most of the book deals with Java streams and the network concepts are very few. At some point the book looks like an API reference than a full fledged text. This info is available in Java Docs for free . The font selected for printing the book is a real turn off. Another disaster from Manning .I will suggest reading Java Network programming title form O'Reilly which is due for release in July 2000 ( do not buy the 1997 edition )."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"I have not much to add to all the great reviews, but someone there wondered how come people have reviewed this title even before it has been published.

It's available as an e-book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Java networking book I've read.","review":"Awesome coverage of networking and streams. I love their *real* examples. Its different to the other network books i've read. Where else do you learn how to write a real Webserver with CGI support and stuff like that. CORBA coverage was fairly brief but I guess that's not their focus. Can't wait for their crypto book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WWE Unforgiven 2008 review","review":"The ECW Championship Scramble was pretty good for a opening bout. The Ted DiBiase,Jr./Cody Rhodes-Cryme Tyme-World Tag Team title match was above-average. The Shawn Michales-Chris Jericho-Unsanctioned match was a good reminder of a NWA Brawl back in the 1980's. The WWE Championship Scramble was a hard-hitting,entertaining match. The Michelle McCool-Maryse-Divas title match was short but sweet. The World's Championship Scramble was a hard-fought,hard-hitting brawl.

Updated the EZ-PC 500 software on my old Windows XP machine, and downloaded the unit's software, only to find it doesn't support vehicles newer than 07.

Going to run some wire to bypass the broken traces on the ribbon cable. Should work. Also noted some corrosion around the battery clips internal to the unit. Never seen anything like it. Not sure what the cause of that as most of the time corrosion is at the external battery clips. Suspect some acidic rosin during manufacture.

(Good luck finding one) Anyway, it has diagnosed EVERY car we have used it on for 10 years without a hitch. If it fails the next time, it won't matter, because it has paid for itself many times over. We have never used factory support, we have never had a problem. I need to buy a scan tool for myself now, but, am confused with all this bad hype out there. I realise, this is not a high end unit, but Snap-on, Genisys, and others are no better for much more money. I see many Snap-on scan tool owners crying about their $5000 units not working, or, not being upgradeable.

And of course, there's Q! Though Q doesn't make as much of an appearance in this one as he has in the past (this episode is truly spotlighting Picard more than anyone else), it does show an affectionate side of Q and his view of Picard.

First of all, it isn't heavy metal (or even hard rock). The Scorps' trademark mixture of rockers'n'ballads is gone. What we get is mostly commercialized pop of questionable quality. Some of the songs are just plain awful, not to mention ludicrous (\\"Priscilla\\" is a song about a cockroach - I mean, boys, get real!). The only thing that saves this record from being a total catastrophy is that some of the ballads (\\"Eye to Eye\\", \\"Yellow Butterfly\\") are actually pretty good. But the heavy metal glue that keeps it all together is lacking. For people who loved Scorpions' earlier masterpieces (\\"In Trance\\", \\"Taken by Force\\", \\"Lovedrive\\",\\"Blackout\\", \\"Love at First Sting\\") this album will be a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to what you do best...","review":"There are bands ever capable of reinventing themselves,like U2 and Metallica,unfortunately the Scorpions are not in this category-their recent attempt at doing just that testifies:the bad boys are not running wild anymore...because they've become the Backstreet Boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Scorpions","review":"The album cover looked suspicious. It was not a good sign.Then came music itself, but wait, something was wrong with it. By the track #4 I forgot I was listening to new Scorpions' CD; I thought it was some R&B band playing.Frankly, it is beyond me why the supergroup would release something like this even if they attempted to be 'modern'. Loosing fans is easier then gaining them and it looks like not many people dig their new material.On a brighter note, they did seem to realize how bad it was and did not include any of the songs from this album in their playlist when they toured last summer and still rocked.Hopefully, the experiment with the direction and sound on this album will not last."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Oh,this one is worst then BACKSTREET BOYS.I don't know what happend to the guys,but the music on this cd is just awfull.Do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No bad scorpions","review":"What were they thinking?

That is not a bad thing is essence but it was for me and probably the vast majority of their fans. Let's face it, it is natural for fans to want their fav bands to continue the same style of music. If a rapper decided to do country, he too would come up against the same criticism as are the scorpions now. I do think that the previous album, Pure Instinct, was the best album ever for them simply because it was a very solid album with very strong songs (all but one I loved) and who could not love Wild Child!I encourage you to check out Pure Instinct here on Amazon and read the reviews. I think the vast majority agree with me on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT ! Is this the Scorpions?","review":"Being an \\"old school\\" Scorps fan since the \\"Lovedrive\\" days, I can't believe this is the Scorpions.

Scorpions or Backstreet Boys?","review":"I am very dissapointed. I have been a Scorpions die-hard fan since 1982, and I could not have been more disillusioned after listening to the new CD. This is softy pop at best. Where did the powerful riffs of Rudolf Schenker go? What was of the agressive solos of Mathias Jabbs? What is this disco-like set of drums? Who are these people? Where are the real Scorpions? The body snatchers must have gotten them. I wish I wish I wish Scorpions would have stayed loyal to its roots. I wish I could say something different, but if this is the result of \\"evolution\\", Scorpions should have retired and left a good aftertaste.

I still can't believe they released this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What have you done, Scorps?","review":"This is for sure not the best Scorpions album (I don't want to say \\"the worst\\" because I am a big Scorpions fan . . . but let's say it: it is the worst). It is the same as Slang for Def Leppard: a transition album with bad results. For me, the period of glory for the Scorps was between 1979 and 1991; Crazy World closed 12 extraodinary years, which started with Lovedrive. Although Pure Instinct was not a bad album, the pop direction was obvious, but Eye to Eye was too much. I like very much the record with the Berlin Orchestra, but I believe that the Scorps are trying to survive thanks to their old hits. Acoustica is a good example, isn't it? Will we hear a new Blackout style album? I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I grew up on 80's rock. When I saw Scorpions had a new CD out(on Amazon)I couldn't wait to hear some samples. The music sampler saved me some bucks. EyeIIEye was a total dissapointment. If you're expecting classic Scorpions jam, forget it. Some bands such as Metallica have matured in their music. Unfortuneately it didn't work for the Scorpions.They should have stuck with what they do best....ROCK! Most of us 80's fans are alive and kicking.

What were these guys thinking when they made this Stupid Disc, Dumb Synth/Hip Hop Trendy Modern Sounds????. This is NOT something a regular, true Scorpions fan will enjoy, much less EVER want to play again.

Yet, instead of making hard rock here, they tried to make cheap pop music. Some of the tracks sounds like the drums are replaced by the demo presets of a cheap synthesizer.It is however one track that stands out here. A Moment In A Million Years is a masterpiece of a ballad. However, it isn't a band effort. It doesn't have either drums nor guitars. It is only Klaus with a backing of piano and violin.The scorpions have released exactly 20 records as we speak, and this one is uncontested as the worst one."},{"rating":"1","title":"yaaak","review":"VERY BAD ALBUM,FIRST WHEN I HEAR THIS I THOUGHT IT'S NOT SCORPIONS.DOESN'T WORSE BUYING.BETTER LISTEN TO OTHER GOOD AND HEAVY BANDS,TRY FEAR FACTORY,SOULFLY AND OTHERS.THESE BAND REALLY ROCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this stuff?","review":"Woah... From blistering hella good guitar rifts to this hardly rock, pop stuff--one can only ask: what where they thinking?

If you've grown tired of 'riffs' and are wanting good songs look no further. I'll admit the single (To Be No. One) is a bit kooky but it really is a good song. To be honest the last Scorpion CD I thought that had any merit was Savage Amusement, everything since then has had some good songs but they were not great cd's. Though this cd does have a clunker or 2 (Priscilla?), the songs that are good are absolutely GREAT.

I feel I have been mislead by the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tai Chi Reflections","review":"I just purchased... a companion CD in the Serenity Series titled \\"Tai Chi Reflections.\\" I listened to it last night and decided to write a review on it - strictly a public service because I would not want another hapless soul to waste [any money] on the same CD. Oddly, Amazon.com no longer lists it in its catalogue although I purchased it from them only two weeks ago. \\"Tai Chi Reflections\\" is every bit as bad as \\"Tai Chi Meditations\\" appears to be. It is supposed to be the sound of a waterfall accompanied by music. The waterfall sounded exactly like somebody had turned on the spigot in the bathtub and recorded it. I gave it three minutes before ripping it out of the CD player and tossing it in the trash.

I agree with the S. Berner review and would add the narrator had a definite negative impact on the book. While using a narrator may be a clever idea in some instances, here it detracts. We had no idea who this narrator was until about a third of the way in. The use of British idioms was annoying but finally made some sense when we find out the nationality of the narrator. This is essentially a story about a non-story, that is, there is nothing to it. It is really unfortunate for Mesce has written another one about Major Harry Voss, an interesting character, but Mesce fails to do anything with him. Simply not worth the effort to read all the way through to the ho-hum conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfullfilled","review":"This started out as a good story filled with mystery and intrigue. A little over halfway through when I expected it to really start getting good, it died. This story dove faster than the P-47 in the opening. The second half of the story waned and the ending had no closure. I hope future novels by these authors will learn by these shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get it","review":"This book had an authentic feel for the period. But I felt I just didn't get the story. The main character always seems to have a thought that the solution is hidden somewhere in the info he has gathered, but never seems to figure out the details of the crime. Several of the characters are developed, then drop out of the narrative. I found it to be a very unsatisfying book that I could have put down half way through and known just about as much as I did by finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"The story really went nowhere as other reviewers have noted.But what annoyed me most was the historical inaccuracies. For these novels to work you need to get the details right and here the authors conspicuously failed. A few instances:- There is no institution known as the \\"Royal Army\\" - constantly referred to- The Royal Air Force does not have captains, they have their own ranks, just as the navy does- Ireland was independent at the time of WW2 (well, most of it) and sufficiently so to send a message of condolence to the German Embassy upon Herr Hitler's deathI don't know enough about aircraft to know whether they of the details right but based on the above I have little confidence.

Berner is exactly right, and I am disappointed that I did not read that review before I read the book. If I had, I hope I would have sense enough to not read the book.

Lord Ranulf being much older has demons to deal with (just like all heroes) and in fighting those demons, he thinks that his new wife, the beautiful Lyonene is like his first wife from years and lifetimes ago, so in thinking that he accuses her of cheating (like his first wife cheated).Even after a huge fight between them, she followed him into the thick of battle to make amends with him, as well as a kidnapping that takes them both across the Irish Sea!Ms. Deveraux did VERY well on her second adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book!","review":"Never a fan of rape and domestic violence...pass on this book!

I'm going to edit this review until I finish it. But for now, I'm rating it 2 stars. The problem is Lyonene and Ranulf. i can't feel the love between them.

This is one of the best medieval romances I have ever read. Absolutely wonderful. It grabs you from the first page. I kept re-read a lot of sentences because it was that delicious. I finished the book much longer that usual because I just want to savor every moment.It's heart warming to see the heroine thought the black lion was beautiful while in fact others thought him repulsive. It's also so nice to see the hero change from a rough man who raped his wife to such a loving, faithful husband.I hate to see the book end. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"one stupid heroine","review":"It was alright until 3/4 of the book. The author makes the heroine out to be soooo stupid about the case with Amicia. She KNEW the woman can't be trusted but she persists in her stupidity by not asking outright of Ranulf if his supposed unfaithfulness is true or not when she has the chance. I mean, even Ranulf questions her why she was troubled! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Because of her stupidity, she allows herself to be caught in Amicia's deviousness.I can't handle stupid heroines just so the book can be longer. I call that bad story writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Black Lyon is a black spot","review":"After reading all her other wonderful novels, this one is surely a disappointment. It is glaringly obvious that this was one of her FIRST (which I took into account) The reasons for the hero's dislike/distrust of the heroine were weak and not at all believable. This guy didn't deserve the heroine's love and I would have liked to see him grovel a bit more for her forgiveness, and their emotions towards each other (\\"do I really love him/her?\\")were annoying. Of course, having said that, Jude Devereaux is one of my favorite authors. Thank god she, just like Johanna Lindsey, just keeps on improving!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story, couldn't put it down, again and again....","review":"This was one of the first romance novels I read a million years ago. The story line of the love between the characters was wonderful. I am working on my second copy of this book as I have worn away some of the pages I've read it so much.

Their characters are delightful!! You can feel the changes in them as they go through one ordeal after another. When you read about Ranulfs Black Guard, whew!, your heart will beat alot faster! Jude certainly gives new meaning to the phrase tall, dark and handsome.

He can barely bring himself to compliment his wife, even when she's pregnant. He disgusted me with his hateful jealousy and temper.Not that Lyonene was any better, putting up with a man that rapes her twice, hits her to the ground, and basically ruins her wedding day.Why Jude, WHY?????

If you like romance, with intrigue then you will enjoy this story. Although slightly predictable, there are enough twists to keep you turning pages quickly.

A great getaway, easy to read, hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I have not finished reading this book yet, but I just could not wait to voice my disappointment. I am a big fan of Jude Devereaux and seriously cannot believe that this is a fruit of her work. The dialogues are lame, the chapters don't hold together. And the hero (Black Lyon)...; don't even get me started there. That the heroine of the story not only puts up with him but also is madly in love with, is beyond my comprehension. She must be mentally unstable herself. Unfortunately, I have a bad habit of reading all the books through no matter what the content. It looks like I will suffer for the next 78 pages. Do yourself a favor and get a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was greatly disappointed with this book","review":"I am a guy who likes to read a romance novel every now and then. I just finished a Nora Roberts book and really enjoyed it. I had high hopes for this novel. I have heard alot about what a great writer Deveraux is and how her books sell millions, so I picked up this one. I could not believe how boring this book was and how bland the characters were throughout the story.This novel was written in 1980 and maybe her talent was not there yet (I never read Deveraux before) when she wrote this particular story. I didn't even finish this book, it moved to slow and had nothing to offer as far a plot is concerned.So why not just one star. The history part of the story was accurate and gave a sense of the 1300-1400's and I like history. I have not given up on Deveraux, but I hope the next book I pick in better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Compare","review":"I have read quite a few of Jude Deveraux's books and was sincerely disappointed in this one. I went off of everyone's majority of reviews on this site and was anticipating a good read. Unfortunately, I felt that the lady described in the book was a bit on the abused side, especially from the man that she loved. Although this is just my opinion, I like it better when the heroine is not hit by her lover and not told what she should be feeling. But if you like the simpering, defenseless types then you will sure enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!","review":"I was so excited to find this book, after reading references to a belt with a black lyon in Velvet Song, but I was very disappointed when I read this book. It was the first J.D. book that I have ever had trouble finishing. In fact, I gave up, after becoming so bored and disgusted with the characters. What kind of a hero knocks a woman around several times, only to have her vow to win his love. Talk about disfunctional!! I chalk this up to the fact that it was one of her first books! I do not recommend this book.

Living with it in my own life and trying to come to terms with it made reading this book a job....and it ended up being the best job I ever had. I have all of Devereux's first novels and this is definitely the best followed by her Velvet series. The green monster plays a big part in the story so if your not up to it don't read it but if you can get past it, not only will you give yourself a pat on the back but you'll truly enjoy a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum.","review":"This was my second attempt at reading this book. The first time, about 12 years ago, I thought it was very clumsy, long, and boring. I enjoyed it more the second time, I think mostly because my knowledge of the historical era it is set in has grown, but also because it has more story and less steamy parts. That is a way my reading tastes have changed in the last decade.Overall, however, this is your average romance story. Misunderstandings abound, heroine is feisty, hero is a rogue who must be tamed, heroine is kidnapped and must be rescued by the hero, heroine is poor, hero is rich, etc. The clothing, activities and settings of the medieval era are well researched and well depicted in the story, so that is encouraging. Both villains made me want to puke, which I suppose means they were accurately portrayed. I guess I was just left with an overall 'ho-hum' feeling after reading this book.

I'd completely forgotten about how I was going to feed my fish for 11 days while I was away and I made the decision almost solely on cost and how fast it could be shipped (Amazon Prime). I went out on a limb with this selection because I was looking for a pond feeder, but not willing to pay over $100 for a typical one. While this labeled as an aquarium feeder, I wasn't sure how it would work out. Once I got the feeder in, I rigged a setup for it to be suspended over the pond, and the rest is history. It worked out perfectly. I have 7 good size Koi to feed and the feeder allowed for great flexibility (how many times a day to feed, and adjustable levels of how much to feed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food gets moist","review":"The food in my previous fish feeder always got a little wet and would clump together. I chose this feeder when I bought a new one, because it specifically said it was designed to avoid this problem. That hasn't been my experience. As time goes on, it seems to get worse. I don't know if this is because the door you open to insert the food gets looser over time and lets moisture in there, or what. The food won't stay dry for more than a day anymore, and I've only had it for 6 months, or less. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"AquaChef Auto Feeder","review":"The feeder is easy to assemble and works great. Timer and readout are clear and quick to set up. The only negative thing about this product is the design of the clamp. It didn't fit on the aquarium edge (it has to be forced on, if you want the clamp to work, but mine did not) and the foam sticky pads were not secure and could not hold the weight on to the light panel top, so it fell in the water! Too bad, otherwise a good product. I bought another timer from a retail store and that timer uses a better screw on clamp (it fits snugly and easily mounts on the edge) but it's not a digital readout and the timer is not adjustable, but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good, but it is very hard to program","review":"Works good, but it is very hard to program but if you follow the instructions it does work. I bought two units. One for the fish and one to drop pellets for the lobster. The feeders also have a problem that the processor locks up. They give you instruction on how to reset it. It did it on one of the first times I programmed them up. I reset them and they work fine. I used them several times sense and they have not failed me. The units are larger than I pictured and have no way to clean them out except rinsing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for aquarium owners","review":"I had earlier used Penn-Plax fish feeder but that lasted only 1 month. It just stopped working for no reason. I like this product very much. Unlike many other reviewers, I did not find it difficult to follow the instructions to operate this automatic fish feeder. You may find it difficult, if you like to set it by yourself without reading the instructions stepwise. You can even keep 1-2 xerox copies of the instructions, if you have the habit of misplacing user manuals. This fish feeder allows to set 1-4 times food for fishes. There is 'single feeding' and 'double feeding' options which could be helpful if you have many (my guess, 20+) fishes in your aquarium. I'm now tension-free about feeding my two lovely goldfishes when going out on vacation or night outs! Recommended for all the fish tank or aquarium owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but requires thought to get it started","review":"This product works great. It definitely requires reading the instructions to program the timing mechanism. If you can manage to set up a digital watch or clock, you can manage this one. It has taken some experimentation to determine how much food the fish will really get from the feeder. Since the hopper trap door is on top, moisture from the aquarium doesn't seem to be a problem. In comparison to other products, this one offers a lot of options for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i wanted","review":"I have a 20 gallon fish tank with six fishes(kois and goldfish) and I wanted a fish feeder for when I go on vacation which is normally about ten days. I used this item and it worked perfectly. You just have to program it for the time of day you want the fish to be fed and it can feed up to two feedings at a time . What happens is the drum just makes two rotations and drops the food. Setting up the feeder is like programming your digital watch so just follow the instructions and all will be fine but dont lose the paper. I t also works with batteries so you dont have to worry about power outages......just what I wanted"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starving fish","review":"I purchased this feeder so my fish would not go hungry while I was on vacation. The time and the feedings are set using a 24h clock, so it's pretty hard to mess up. I did a trial run and everything seemed to be working fine. When I got back from vacation, my fish were not looking so hot. I fed them and they ate voraciously which got me wondering if the feeder was actually working.

This is more adult oriented, and sticks well with the two movies fel and premise. A good and somewhat beautifully animated filler for the two movies.My only gripe was that it was much too short, and that the animation seemed to change in some areas. Not the 3-D stuff, I mean the look of it entirely at times. Kinda jarring. But overall, a colorful and well done animation that looks like that Aeon Flux's Peter Chung and his studio really put some care and thought to this little filler.

I helpes bridge the gap between Pitch Black and the Chronicles of Riddick in a big way. I also shows what kind of potential this franchise has if it wasn't helmed by David Twohy. I mean don't get me wrong here, Twohy is a good screenwriter ( he did write Ridley Scott's G.I. Jane). But I hated the Arrival. And Pitch Black could've been a very, very good movie if it was directed by someone like Alex Proyas (The Crow, Dark City, I- Robot. Now he would've been perfect for this. And we can see the kind of potential this franchise has with the help of Peter Chung. All the same, I thought Dark Fury was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge Between Pitch Black & Riddick","review":"This animated feature is done by the Animtaor of AEON FLUX (Peter Cheung). It has an extremely dark style which fits in well with Pitch Black, and the recently released Chronicles of Riddick. Great music and good voice overs make this a fun filler between Pitch Black & Riddick. It's also nice to see how the charcters were split up for the begining of Riddick.Someone mentioned in a review previously that Harry Potter Killed Riddick in box office. Well of course it did. But that's not cause Riddick was a bad film. It's because it was Harry Potter for gods sakes!I suggest picking this dvd up for 9.95 it's a good buy, and also see Riddick in theaters or when its released on DVD & VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be filled with DARK FURY if you pay for this!","review":"I am a big fan of Peter Chung's animation. I loved Aeon Flux & really enjoyed his segment of The Animatrix but I am sad to say that Dark Fury is pure tripe. It's obvious that Peter had no creative control on this. Don't get me wrong, the actual animation of Dark Fury is supurb but OH MERCIFUL LORD, the story & voice acting are atrocious. I have not seen The Chronicles of Riddick feature film but if it's anywhere near as awful as this, I can understand why Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban clobbered it at the box office.

Riddick and the other survivors get picked up by bounty hunters but these bounty hunters have no interest in taking them to a prison and getting a reward. Instead the ship's captain has something far more sinister in mind. Riddick must survive her plans and keep his companions alive. We also meet the bounty hunter who shows up in the second feature.The animation is of an interesting style and the story does a very good job of plugging the gap between the two movies. Although animated, the main stars are present as voices. This help add continuity. Once again, the original Idea of Riddick as a government assassin is not brought up. In the end it is an interesting story for what it is. Anyone who has seen the two Riddick films should check this out. This adventure and the two movies are included in a Riddick Trilogy package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bridging, cool anime","review":"I was a big fan of the bizarro Aeon Flux back in the 90's and director Peter Chung brings that wonderful style to the universe of Riddick (much like he did in The Animatrix).Dark Fury is a small story set between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick (which I haven't seen) in which Riddick, Jack and Abu dock their scout vessel with an ominous and evil ship filled with frozen Mercs and run by a vicious female overlord with a perverted idea of imprisonment.The whole thing is basically an excuse for some quick violence but it's entertaining and expands upon the Riddick universe in interesting ways.

Vin Diesel as Riddick is very sleek, fluid, and attractive. The animated Riddick was not. The story only asks more questions, so no answers here, and while this short is supposed to be a bridge between the movies Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick, it isn't. In fact, it only serves to make The Chronicles of Riddick make less sense. Still, it is interesting and there are some great one liners, so I definately recommend all Riddick fans to at least rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cartoon..Like Popeye.","review":"It's a lame cartoon.....and not even a good cartoon....just like Popeye, a dumb, cheap cartoon..boo!!

He ignores political mistakes such as declaring war on the USA.

For example, the author describes Montgomery as \\"...an eccentric man concerned with his own glory...\\", but then fails to support his point. It's a rare occasion when I feel I've wasted my time reading a book--this was a rare book in that regard. I've read many a detailed account of the Second World War and I wasn't in the market for the broad survey that Mr Alexander's book offered. If you're looking for an analysis of courses of action Hitler might have taken to win the war--as I was--leave this book on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the serious student of WW II","review":"Bevin Alexander has written in the past the excellent book \\"How Great Generals Win\\", but this new one is so much disappointing that I couldn't believe it came from the same author. Nothing new is contained, and the title is misleading because Bevin Alexander does not point out the fatal errors of the Nazi Germany but only recounts the trivial history of World War II without offering any new perspective. If you want to read something interesting about World War II, avoid this book and try instead Richard Overy's \\"How the Allies Won\\" or John Ellis' \\"Brute Force\\", or the much discussed and controversial study of Martin van Creveld \\"Fighting Power\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"Quite possibly the most poorly written book ever published.

Mr. Alexander could benefit from the services of a good editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitler's costly errors.","review":"I think highly of this book. The author shows how the Germans almost won World War Two. Many people believe that the outcome was predetermined. However Hitler came close to winning the war. This book shows the many errors of Hitler and how it cost him the war. Just a few different choices could have resulted in a much different world than we live in today. If Hitler had sent two-three extra divisions to Africa when Rommel needed them, the Germans could have dominated the Middle East. If Hitler had let his army commanders decide on pull backs during times, he could have lost less troops and retained his strength. Hitler made many mistakes and it cost him his empire.This is a nice little book about strategy. Some of the chapters are a rehash of the same battles, but the analysis of the mistakes shows some serious study here. I learned something from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd time I have read this book","review":"If you are interested in World War II, This book is an excellent read.I found it very interesting.Scary how close Hitler came to winning.I have read it several times and plan on reading it again.I ALSO HAVE A VIDEO BY THE SAME NAME.This is a MUST READ.I definately recommend it to any one interested in the subject"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now everybody has said it!!","review":"Why would a publisher ever agree to publish a book 40 years after other authors have published the same material?

Each year new additions came on the market which always made it easy for my kids to make their birthday and Chistmas lists. This accessory was one of the more fun ones. I was still buying pieces for them until they were eight years old. Geo Trax are fun, versatile and of enduring quality. I can't see how anyone could break them. My teenage sons and I would get down on the floor with my young sons and help configure track layouts. They were fun for the entire family! They were only put aside when iPods and wii came on the scene introduced by my older sons. It's hard to compete with high-tech!You cannot go wrong with Geo Trax.

Willie Nelson has a sound that is at the heart of every American. Both somber and triumphant, Nelson writes and sings the songs of all those who have been overlooked, those who have built our great nation.

I ever saw the movie Lady Jane of which the book based but I knew about Jane as the Nine Day queen and thought this book would be a novel of that. Instead it appears to be a word for word retelling of the movie which no visual element at all. I mean, Jane and her husband became lovers in one spot, but the only clue I had to that happening was that the next morning they were talking about how they didn't hate each other. There wasn't even a break in the paragraph from talking at night to talking in the morning! Where was the sex?

I re-attached, but now the darn thing doesn't produce any more sound through the amp.2. One needs to constantly tune the strings. If you just love spending a lot of time trying to tune rather than play, get this guitar.I read someone else's review and mentioned the same locknut washer problem, yet they still gave this guitar a 4 star review. I beg to differ. Some people have lowered expectations I suppose.I'm opting for the Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar. It's $69 more, but I'd rather spend that difference now with quality pick-ups, headstock, and bridge.....rather than having to stare at a $99 mess now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Bought this for my son.

The good ones are the ones where she doesn't try to be more than she is - a disco diva. It's the numbers like \\"Female Intuition\\" that really hurt. By far though, the worst song on this disc is the HORRENDOUS cover/remake of Dead Or Alive's \\"You Spin Me Round (Like A Record), simply entitled \\"Spin Me\\". Not a true cover, but it does contain many elements of the song. The highlights? \\"Say...If You Feel Alright\\" is a great little foot stomper, as well as the duet with NBA star Dennis Rodman \\"Just A Freak\\"...By far her best album though (excluding \\"The Best Of\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Film Leads Pioneering Erotic Cinema","review":"An excellent example of Erotic Cinema in its earlier stages.

Too often, the characters stand around, ineffectually arguing about what they should do next, even sometimes watching their friends get killed.But once I had invested a certain amount of time, I wanted explanations and a conclusion. There was none to be had. Instead, we got some sociopolitical ranting and moralizing from a sociopathic teenager and no answers to what is going on.

Over time, Delta Force changed what was needed and didn't tinker with what worked. Recruiting and training obviously worked and have stayed fairly static. Technology has changed with time. The book is great history with great photos of real professionals-not the standard, glitzy public affairs shots.

But this one is a big disapointment. EVERY SINGLE picture that I have taken with this camera has needed to be edited before I could print them. Even in red-eye reduction and Potrait mode, every picture of a human being has RED EYE. Also, 1 in evey 4 pictures has a light spot somewhere in the photo. No matter how much I clean the lens or adjust the light in the room, I am still getting white spots on the pictures. Most of my shots are at parties or bars (low light situation) maybe thats the problem but I've tried everything and I can't get this camera to take great potraits that I can just shoot and print. I spend hours removing red eye and touching up white-spots with photoshop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem from the begining","review":"I bought this camera brand new and after I charged it and put in the memory card, the lense wouldn't open and kept getting a lens error message.

And there are LOTS with much flimsier construction and crappier sound for much more money.This component folds flat, is small and fits in my old CD case for traveling. The sound is more than adequate. For the whiners out there if you throw it around you will probably break it, so take reasonable care of it and you'll enjoy it for years.

Gerrit L. Herschuur takes the reader on a dramatic discovery of everything there is or ever was to know about magnetism, from it's being a mystical lodestone with superstition as a basis of understanding, to the degree of sophisticated knowledge we have today. He has a natural talent for keeping the reader as intrigued as if he/she were holding a best selling mystery novel! The best part is, this is a non-fictional true life natural mystery and you won't be able to put this book down until you've finished it. Herschuur reveals every mystery contained within and about magnetism, all the stuff you ever wanted to know about it, but didn't know who to ask!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but also repetitive and off topic","review":"This book covers in a bit more detail the history and people involved with the discovery of magnetism and subsequent magnetic phenomena. Unfortunately it is also somewhat repetitive with topics being brought up again and again for pages at a time. It also veers off topic into cosmology, metaphysics and science policy.

Like most telescopic designs, this rack is good enough for an extension ladder or two, but you definitely don't want to load it up with building materials or anything. I would estimate that the most i've had on these bars is about 100 lbs or so, with little to no sag. The finish is pretty impressive, kind of like a hammered greyish-black look.There is a little play between the inside and outside bars, and when you first install it, it seems flimsy, but once you fasten the bars together (you will need a drill and bit for this part of the install), it tightens up pretty good.I would buy this product again if need be, its not the best, but for the price range, I really can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graet Heavy Duty Ladder Bar Powder Coating Black and Silver","review":"Is ,just amazing how this product turn out ,build real well and the powder coating is exellent material ,looks good on my van..and the price and service of amazon as well was excellente,less than twenty four hrs servicein front of my door .Keep the good work ,Amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible taste and bad packaging","review":"For $28, I could have gotten a pile of lip gloss at the local drugstore, with brushes.

Not only did the story cause a lot of problems with Who continuity, but there was also the added irony that the show was on trial as well (the BBC came close to canceling it that season).In my opinion, one of the major problems with Who during this time was the pulpy, badly plotted stories of Pip and Jane Baker. How they managed to to write so many Who scripts is beyond me. If anything, their work novelizing their own scripts was even worse. They manage to incorporate every pulpy, said-bookism cliche possible. Luckily the Target novelizations are only 120 pages long, so Who fans can sail through this book without too much pain, all the time wishing that someone would break P&J Baker's exclamation mark key."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, please.","review":"What a delightful surprise!A fantastic comedic romance set in the new Russia with the totally charming Masha Shalaeva as the star (the woman who played Lise in the 2009 mini-series Brothers Karamazov or Bratya Karamazovy).

Tracks like \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Please Bleed\\", \\"Roses From My Friends\\", \\"Another Lonely Day\\", and \\"Beloved One\\" are all amazing.

The rest of CD is excellent, and i'd call it the comprehensive guide to Ben Harper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where to begin,,,,","review":"I guess I've become a geezer because this one leaves me completely cold. The electric set on Disc 1 is nothing remarkable and I'm sorry, but once Marvin Gaye did \\"Sexual Healing\\", it was done. The rest of Disc 1 is a sort of mish mash of reggae/worldmusic/pop/R&B that just doesn't hang together.Disc 2 is acoustic and is Cat Stevens with bad lyrics (\\"You put the happy,,,,in my ness\\"), and I actively disliked Cat Stevens way back when. Much angst in these whiney lyrics which overwhelms some pretty good playing by Mr. Harper and his band. The final track on the acoustic set is an outlandish \\"anger song\\" linking Martin Luther King with Rodney King (King-King...get it??) which is so insipid as to make this listener eject the CD.I'm told that much ganga is smoked at Ben Harper's concerts, which can be the only explanation for the rabid reception the fans at these recorded performances give to some pretty mediocre music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel like I'm on Mars","review":"This is a great double disc live set. It captures Ben and the ICs in concert. It captures all the energy of a live show. But the most amazing thing is how it goes from the rock out disc (disc 1) to the solo acoustic disc (disc 2) and nothing sounds out of place. This set basically shows how great this band is and how great Ben is. If you've never heard Ben I'd recommend picking this up.Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Amazing","review":"I've heard snippets of Ben Harper here and there, but this is my first full release album of him and I don't regret the purchase. Disc 1 shows Harper's rocking side and his he displays a certain soul over some of the heavy guitar playing. The remake of Marvin Gaye's \\"Sexual Healing\\" is funky as hell and just plain awesome. It's like Lenny Kravitz without the \\"Rock Star\\" type attitude Kravitz displays sometimes. Harper seems like the college buddy that you want to skip class and get high with. Disc 2 shows the acoustic side of Harper. At times he almost seems to recall the sounds of 60's folk artists. Again, a remake stands out on the disc with harper redoing the Verve's \\"The Drugs Don't Work.\\" The final song of \\"Like a King/I Rise\\" is ten minutes of pure songwriting talent at its best. If you're looking for an album that rocks, swoons, sways and makes you think at the same time, pick up \\"Live from Mars\\". Pop it in your cd player, sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"To all Ben Harper fans....you will love this!!!!!!","review":"I cracked this open at work and played it for everyone on the morning of release day and people who had heard very little of Ben were telling me how great it was!!!

The front support arms bent easily as needed and they clear the rear brakes with plenty of room.

After reading all the reviews and considering the product itself claims that it \\"fits ALL\\", I figured I'd have no trouble installing. Well, I was wrong. The instructions have two steps, each with one vague sentence describing what to do. I tried to install the product as vaguely described and the provided hardware is all the wrong size. I'm not even sure how to more specifically describe it, but I cannot mount this on my bike whatsoever. I'll be sending it back and getting one from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid piece of kit","review":"As the title states, a solid piece of kit that holds my Topeak bag perfectly (as I would expect as these 2 products work in conjunction with each other). Everything feels solid. Haven't tried holding anything other than my bag but I see no problems with rigging up some sort of basket if necessary. Gripes? Only that I forgot to make note that my bike didn't have the eyelet holes to screw in the adjustable bars to the back of my bike (I had the ones for the bottom). I quickly remedied that with some C-clips but that was my error, not that of the product itself. 5 stars overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to mount and sturdy","review":"This mounted to my 2003 Trek Navigator 200 in about 10 minutes, it was very easy.

I have two bags of different sizes, one for commuting to work, and one for recreational trips. This rack, in conjuction with the bags, is a very sturdy and convient way to carry what I need for the day. I'm not sure this is the best rack for the money if you don't buy into the whole system, but buying into the whole system is exactly what I would recommend. It is not cheap, but the convience and security has made me a fan of Topeak products. I just bought a second rack to mount on my latest bike. Other than normal wear from years of use, my old rack is going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit for my Bianchi Project-3","review":"This was the perfect bike rack for my new/used Bianchi commuter bike. If your bike has the threads for non-disk-mounting, this rack is super easy to install. You do need a 5mm Alan wrench of your own. This rack looks snazzy on my bike, is clearly high-quality, and is gonna do all the things I need it to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Was shipped very quickly and will be great once the snow melts and can start ridding the bike again in the spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to have Seat Stays!","review":"I will keep this simple, this rack wont work on a bike without threaded rear seat stays. Unfortunately the info forgot to mention that. I have an old Cannondale road bike and it doesn't have the threaded rear seat stays. I didn't even know what they are, but they are two little holes on the forks coming down to the rear wheel. Quite frustrating when Amazon doesn't have these types of details. Look at the picture of the rack, see those metal arms coming out of the front, you will need holes in your bike to attach those arms. Product itself seems to be decent quality, not sure why those two arms are not black metal like the rest of it though, not to pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive sturdy bike Rack","review":"I purchased this rack for my bike to put a basket on it.

No dice - definitely does NOT work over disc brakes, contrary to other reviewers comments. I ride a Kona Dew Drop with Avid disc brakes, and this rack couldn't begin to fit my bike. Just an experiment on my end, so I'm still giving it 4 stars based on build quality. The price difference is ridiculous between the two models, but if you have disc brakes, go with the other model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best with compatible bags!","review":"The true value of this rack is how well it works with the compatible bags from Topeak, such as the Topeak MTX Trunk Bag. It makes mounting and dismounting those bags a breeze. Installing the rack itself is pretty easy, but it will take a little while to figure out the angle you need on the two silver upper arms that attach the rack to the bike. The design of these arms is very good though, it will attach to most any bike regardless of the angle needed. It is very sturdy when installed properly, I feel very comfortable loading up my laptop, lunch, change of clothes, etc. all at once on it. And I also love that you can easily attach your rear bike light to it with the included mounts. I have a removable light so I can just slide it on the mount and then slide it out when not in use.Some reviewers have complained about not receiving enough hardware to install it, but I didn't encounter this problem. My package included everything I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great commuting rack","review":"I got this rack over the holidays and have not been disappointed. I have it mounted on my hybrid, which I use as a daily commuter. I paired the rack with the MTX-compatible Topeak DXP rack trunk w/ fold-out panniers, and don't have any regrets. It allows me to carry everything I need for work (change of clothes, lunch, etc.) w/o all the sweat and weight on my back from a backpack. I hope to do some overnight/weekend camping touring with this rack this summer as well.Suggestion: If you don't have braze-ons on your seat stays or the geometry of your bike doesn't allow the rack to attach properly to the seat stays (like mine), you can get a seat post collar/adapter to connect the rack with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bolts","review":"The rack came with 8 bolts that do not fit the nuts that came with them and do not screw into the bike. Naturally, in my efforts to force the bolts to screw in, I scratched up the \\"hard\\" paint. The store will not take it back in that condition. I suspect they got a bad batch of bolts and did not bother QA-ing them. I have email into their US distributor. I suspect I have a trip to Ace Hardware in my near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal if you own a drill and live near a hardware store...","review":"There were no screws for mounting the bottom connections. The two bikes I have need #4 metric screws. I had to drill out the holes on the bottom connections to accept these screws. Also you need somewhere to connect the adjustable top connections. If you are ok adapting, drilling, getting screws then go with this rack. Otherwise stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"very difficult to install","review":"It is very difficult to install, and there are the lack of nuts.When you open the packets, you will find there only two nuts. I don't know how to intall it with two nuts. Leave it.

It was pretty easy to install also. Only issue is there is no way to mount a standard rear light to this bike rack. You're forced to buy the topeak rear lightTopeak Red Lite 4-LED Ultra-Bright Rear Bicycle Lightto snap to the bag you purchase. So if you want everything to work the best and how they were all designed to work together you basically have to buy nothing but topeak products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Received product directly from Amazon very fast, within two days of ordering. The packaging was fine. The rack looks great. However, none of the screws fit the outlets on my bike, they were too small, too narrow. I went to Home Depot to buy larger screws, my bike required M6-1.0 machine screws. I got the 20MM, you may want 15MM or ones longer. I then had to drill larger holes in the rack brackets. Once I did this, it fit perfectly, looks great and is thus far very sturdy.It is fortunate I have the tools and knowledge to drill the holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topeak Explorer","review":"They ship me 8 screws and 3 washers that do not fit.

Unfortunately, this is not listed in the description of the product, it only states \\"fits all bike frames.\\"However, amazon does sell the disc brake version of this bike rack, and I did a simple return through amazon to get the disc brake version, which fit perfectly onto my Cannondale.Great product, amazon just needs to update the product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to install","review":"This is a great rack, and it was very easy to install.

If you are a bike engineer maybe you can figure this product out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rack but check your bike first","review":"I love this rack. Sturdy as all heck once installed properly. Unfortunately I didn't realize the rack was made for bikes with seat stays which my Trek didn't have. After a couple of trips to the local outdoor store, I finally stopped by a proper bike shop and picked up a Blackburn Monostay Rack Adapter. It took me nearly an hour to get everything properly installed but once installed the rack didn't move. I use this rack with a Topeak DX bag (with panniers). The bag has QuickTrack and is super-sturdy on this rack. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools that I used to install","review":"The other reviewers really cover the quality of this product. The installation was a snap. The hardest part was bending the support arms to exactly the right angle, but even that wasn't difficult at all. I'm glad that I had 5MM allen wrench, a 5/16 crescent wrench, and two pair of pliers (to bend the support arms). If your bike already has the threaded holes on the arms below the seat post and on the fork by the back tire you shouldn't have any problem at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality, cheap, and simple","review":"very lightweight and seemingly sturdy. fairly easy and simple to attach and i'm sure that it will last as long as i'll need it to. for the price i'd recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note the kit assumes your bike has threaded holes in frame!","review":"If not for the lack of advance information that the mounting design is not universal, the product could have 5 stars. Not like any sellers of the item are reading the reviews, but it would be nice if they stated this kit \\"requires\\" the bike have threaded mounts in the frame. I bought this for my son's 24\\" bike so he can ride to school, and will have to buy some clamps to go around the frame, and modify the aluminum braces. 24\\" Chinese made bike with threaded seat stay bosses? Not a chance. Apart from that, it's a nice, sturdy rack, fairly light weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes","review":"it works, it holds stuff, i like it. Does not come with rubber adapters to attach to frame, had to buy some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly one-size-fits-all","review":"The rack itself is high quality and works well with the MTX quick release trunk bag.

Now that this is on... it seems very sturdy. I like that it has a place to easily clip on a reflector or light. This rack seems easy to install if you have the 4 threaded holes (two by the hub and two on the body near the seat)needed. I did not. Even on my second bike I had to Magyver this thing to put it on. It would really by nice if they included some extra nuts for those that don't have the threaded holes on the frame.Moral of story... make sure this fits your bike and you will be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This works great and is obviously compatible with the Topeak attachments. My only complaint is that it took a while to attach and requires multiple wrenches to twist the metal pieces to the proper angle (although I admit this makes their product more versatile.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bike rack!","review":"Have one on every bike I own, have had one on every bike I'v owned, will have one on every bike I will own! Plus, all the attachment clip on bags make it cooler than any other rack options. Only drawback is that the rear tail light holder is flimsy since it has no support. Have had a few get caught up and bend which causes a fracture in the metal and eventually it falls off. But there are tons of other spots to attach a light, so its not been a big issue for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install, durable and light","review":"Not much to say,it's easy to install, extremely durable and light weight. Oh wait, the main reason I purchased it was to use the integrated Topek bike bag that slides into place and secures with a simple click. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this Rack","review":"I have a vintage Cannondale, a Trek and Giant. This rack (as with every rack I have used before) is very easy to install on all bikes.

I you don't plan to use the quick release bags from Topeak, then I would probably opt for a different rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice item with ONE exception","review":"This is an exceptionally well-made, well-finished rack with nicely packaged hardware, and it's easy to install on bikes that have existing mounting bosses. I'd give it 5 stars except for one thing: The rack is finished in nice black powdercoat, but the brackets that attach it to the bike are chrome, which is an aesthetic misstep. Nothing you can't solve with some spray paint but for a product whose manufacturers put such obvious care into, it's odd they didn't take the effort to have the bracketry match the rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"This rack is great with the MTX bags!

I sat for 7 of his course offerings over 3 years, and he continues to stand out in my mind as one of the most competent, engaging, and effective instructors with whom I have dealt in 22 years of schooling. Mayhew has the unique ability to satisfy the mildly curious as well as the most discriminating academician. In the years since graduation, I've paged through several of his volumes on the ancient Greeks, and I found them more interesting than any of the work I was doing in law school. You cannot go wrong with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Rained on my Parade","review":"The only reason this one got even two stars is because of the Prof and her Rottweiler. But even the poor dog didn't live up to his potentual. The story had an interesting plot, but it quickly became apparent to me that the narrative was two dimentional at best. To compare this book to any of Thomas Harris' is like comparing an Elvis on velvet painting to a DaVinci. Where Harris disgusts, horrifies and frightens one to death with his prose, Nykanen irritates. His monster is a bore. Plus it was unbelievable that his victims never fought back. If you want to be scared to the point of closing your book just to catch your breath, read \\"Red Dragon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree it was pretty redundant","review":"And you better like graphic descriptions of sex and perversity.

He joins Hannibal Lechter at the top of the list. In THE BONE PARADE, we meet a serial killer who is a world renowned sculptor who has his own horrifying way of creating art. He has created eight sculptures supposedly showing the agony of pain in various family members. We discover right away just how he captures that pain. Nyeken is effusive in his description of the murders and there is strong sexual content and graphic violence. Except for an overly long chase scene through the desert, the novel moves fairly well, although its ending comes out of left field and doesn't seem very plausible. If you like gruesome novels, though, THE BONE PARADE will fill your bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenage masturbatory fantasy","review":"I was able to slog through this book in a few hours and after I was done, I felt like I needed a shower...that I had just spent too much time in the back row of the XXX theater watching bad art films (i.e. porno)...the plot is thin, the character development was bereft of life and the pacing is just wrong...I suppose the author would state that it was part of his \\"art\\"...yeah well....in the eye of the beholder. All that's needed here to make this complete is a bad 70's soundtrack and a porn star mustache."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so plot, terrible characters, even worse writing","review":"I, too, heard the comparisons to Thomas Harris. Forget it. The plot is intriguing at first, but the chapters written from the killer's POV are ludicrous: over the top and utterly lacking in any realistic insight into the mind of a killer (or an artist, for that matter). The \\"heroes\\" aren't much better and come off as total cartoons. The plot becomes more and more ridiculous as it goes along (why, exactly, would a serial killer with an entire family caged in his basement agree to have an art-student intern move in?!?). Nothing happens unless it can be used later as a plot contrivance (gee, that lecture about keeping water away from the hot metal seemed extraneous at the time!). And the writing... so, so bad. I rolled my eyes so often they hurt. Overbaked prose, mixed metaphors, misused words... this puppy's got it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed Writing for the Budding Pedophile","review":"To call this book predictable is to give it more credit than it deserves. The mystery is mundane and the true horror of the killer's crimes is glanced over in favor of his lust for an underage girl. This is like a harlequin murder mystery for the yet to be incarcerated sex offender set. The character development is marginal and any insight into the human condition is below what you'd even expect in a novel in this genre. This could be a bad short story in a creative writing class much better than a drawn out piece of tedium.This is a bad, bad book and not in a good way. If this is the new Silence of the Lambs, we are all doomed to lousy reads for eternity. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS/WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY","review":"If you bought, or want to buy, this book based on the cudos of the author - forget it. If you want this book based on the narrative of its contents - it's a lie. This book is nothing more than a \\"snuff film\\" - written by a sick excuse for an author. He tries to glorify his story by keeping his thesaurus close by so he can write \\"big words\\" - thus making him appear cerebral - but the attempt, like the story, like his accolades, are a digusting farse.

I was hoping the sculptor would do in \\"Diamond Girl\\" but that was not to be. In the end I was rooting for a Daisy Cutter to drop on the mine and oblitterate all the characters in one glorious ending.

I don't recomend this one though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again.","review":"I am only giving this book one star for the simple reason that Amazon won't let me give it zero stars. This is far and away the single worst horror novel (actually, it's quite probably the worst novel, period) that I have ever read. The characters were one-dimensional clichés, the plot was boring and predictable, and as a whole, the book was altogether foul.

Most of the plot is predictable and it's certainly not fine literature but the writing is good overall. I have to disagree with the reviewer from Publishers Weekly when he says that Diamond Girl has a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome - it's much more complex than that. Diamond Girl really takes the book from mediocre to very, very good - the author leaves the reader constantly wondering about her psychology and motivations but doesn't clear it up until the end. I missed the book when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as HUSH","review":"When I saw this book in the store, it was a great and pleasant suprise... I have been waiting for years for Nykanen to write another book. However, this one sadly just does not live up to my expectations. If you are looking for a great thriller, one that you cannot put down , and that actually has characters in it that you care about, put down The Bone Parade AND head for HUSH!!

It is not flimsy, but it is a bit more on the delicate side than I would expect for the price.

I tried The Dog Whisperer slip lead training leash but that had no effect. She actually pulled so hard she was causing sore spots on my fingers! I broke down and bought the gentle leader. I was hesitant only because of the way it looks like a muzzle and so harsh on the dog (even though I know its not). I put the gentle lead on Maggie and the transformation was instant. We took our first of many walks and there was no pulling at all! Now when I walk her I actually find that the walk is a bit boring because there is really nothing for me to do - we just walk.

What a disappointment! Here the venerable Japanese lunchbox becomes the universal principle, the general compass, the ultimate paradigm for EVERYTHING-not just food and its presentation and esthetics but also commerce and technology, society, life style, you name it. Needless to say much of this is pretty contrived; the book reads as if it had been authored for distribution by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce. Most of the photography is either amateurish or archival. The lay-out looks stingy (single photographs as small as 4 x 4 \\" on 10 x 10\\" pages).

It has a lot of room for food, but I had a hard time fitting in the basics (change of clothes, diapers, and cleaning supplies). It does have a lot of pockets, but I would have valued more space INSIDE of the bag instead of tiny little compartments. I do not stuff a diaper bag with everything I can think of. While we were on our trip, we noticed that the straps and the pull strings were fraying from ordinary use! Very poorly made. Not worth the high price tag of $75.

This book attempts to justify the building as a \`text' that can be read if, like Eisenman, you can only see buildings and spaces as intellectual constructs rather than the material, physical phenomena which all structures and their environments do become. Sure, ideas are important as generators, but they are not the primary purpose of architecture nor its intended end result. They never were and never will be.In the introduction, Eisenman notes that he started this work over 40 years ago. He goes on to say that it is a work he mightn't have written today. Indeed looking at the simplistic way in which he has reduced a building merely to a series of diagrams, one can't help agreeing with him and feeling that this monumentally superficial book should never have been published at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giuseppe Terragni: Transformations, Decompositions, Critique","review":"Forty years after writing his master's thesis on this Italian rationalist's two 1930s masterworks in Como-the Casa del Fascio and the Casa Giuliani-Frigerio-Eisenman has turned it into a book.

Legendary as the first building is, fascinating though it may be to contrast it with the second, Eisenman tells us far more than any reasonable person would want to know about these two structures, and nothing at all about the architect and the factors that shaped his work.

I am a newcomer to the Atlantis series, and I 'm not quite finished with Season 3, but I love it already. So often we think that we want characters that are cool, tough, trendy, etc. Of course, Atlantis does have characters that are cool, trendy, smart, etc. But what also want unpredictability. I love Rodney McKay's character because he isn't the typical character, but underneath he's loves, he feels, and he is evolving. He is also unpredictable, and we cheer when he finally \\"sees\\" something. I just finished the \\"Tao of Rodney.\\" Absolutely loved it. Loved \\"McKay and Mrs. Miller.\\" I must say I also enjoy it when they show the other character's oddities, eccentricities, etc. It makes it fun. Couldn't be happier with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This episode (temporarily) ruined the show for me","review":"The basic premise of the episode was great, as was the explanation for the emergency situation, but the non-linear structure and constant repetition were annoying.

The other two are stuck on \\"Allocating Space: 100%\\" and I have 130GB of available space still on my 320GB drive(this happened on previous videos too). When they download, they are awesome, good quality, Unbox application is responsive and ever since I replaced my modem I get a steady 2400+Kbps download speeds so Amazon has got the throughput covered. They just need to work on consistency of delivery(never had this problem with Itunes in 18 videos I've ordeded from them).Anyways, i'm sure this SGA will be great just like Tao of Rodney but just wish Unbox would deliver the digital goods as well as Amazon delivers the physical. The low stars are for lack of satisfaction with the service not so much the show but the two are tied together for me and it's ruining my enjoyment of the content."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I would rate season 3 as one of the best of Stargate Atlantis. Of the twenty episodes, I would rate nearly half of them as among my favorite from the entire series. Rodney McKay is my favorite character and since season 3 is a very McKay-centric episode, one can understand why I rate it among my favorites. I thought the character development (especially of McKay's character) was extensive, but season 3 did not shy away from the dramatic, the action-packed or the tragic.Season 3 probably had the highest combination of episodes that ranged from the hilarious to the tragic, from the frightening to the bittersweet. Though I do rate season 1 and 2 as equal to season 3, I also believe that season 3 was the peak of Atlantis's performance. I didn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping","review":"In Season 3 SGA really stepped up character development.

I am not known for taking things \\"too seriously\\", and I can hardly believe I reacted as strongly to this as I did but the fact is I was appalled by the cavalier attitude toward Lucian Lavin's actions.*SPOILER ALERT*Lucian takes an herb to make himself impossible to resist - literally, impossible - and uses this to exploit everyone around him. Unethical in every sense, but in regard to the local woman, he - by thwarting their free will - effectively rapes them. Because of the herb they are unable to deny him, and it is clear throughout the episode that women are being effectively coerced into sexual activity they otherwise would never have consented to. Bad enough, but what I found utterly reprehensible was the fact that our \\"heros\\" treated his crimes like some kind of annoying yet amusing and harmless nuisance. A serial rapist!

He does an excellent job in noting the religious disputes between the Sunni versus the Shiite versus the Sufism order. He does a fine job in detailing the fall-out between the Sunni and Shiite sects in the 750s C.E. He provides nice \\"why\\" background to the various religious rituals.

EJ does not have the energy anymore but hopefully he still has the touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans can never be objective...","review":"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...\\"Recover Your Soul\\" is decent and adding the duet version of \\"Live Like Horses\\" would have been a slight improvement. The big single \\"Something in the Way\\" was only big because of the song it was paired with cuz it's nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stumble For E.J.","review":"I've been an E.J. fanatic for a long time. I've owned everything he's put out with the exception of Victim Of Love (I think I can be forgiven for that). I find this this album to be adult contemporary elevator music at it's worst. I wanted so much to love this album---and I tried---I really tried.Yes, the single, \\"Something About The Way...\\" is catchy and is the saving grace of this album. Another great song is the haunting, \\"Long Way From Happiness.\\" Other than that though, I find this work completly forgetable. It is nowhere NEAR the same league as some of his earlier releases like \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" or \\"Honky Chateau.\\"Luckily, from his next album releases, \\"Songs From The West Coast\\", \\"Peachtree Road\\", and now \\"Captain & The Kid\\", we now know Elton hadn't totally lost his edge. After first hearing this dud, I feared he had. If you have a hankering for some newer E.J. masterpieces, avoid this CD and go for one of the previously mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This album is depressing. After the astonishing comeback and return to form of 'Made in England' this album was a big let-down for me. All the songs sound like they were made with an Elton John songwriting program, there aren't any interesting melodies or modulations, the arrangements are uninteresting, underplayed, and by-the-book, and even his voice, which can lend viability to substandard fare, sounds detached and bored. Except in the hit, \\"Something about the way you Look tonight\\", where he sings with a bit of REAL soul. That's why the album actually deserves one star, it is a good song in his finest tradition. To be fair, he lost a number of friends in distressing circumstances in the period this album was made (putting it mildly), the album seems to have a mournful underlying mood, when there's any mood at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always full bodied and full of love and life.","review":"I always find Elton John to be new and exciting. Never sounds the same. Changes with the times. He has the ability to create a song that touches your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture This!","review":"Picture this! In the title track on this album,Elton John tells about a potential career in Hollywood(Do I have a shot at the big part?). Hits from this album are SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT(the first when this album was released in September 1997) and RECOVER YOUR SOUL. This album was finished before Elton's close friend Princess Diana of Wales was killed in a car crash nearly a month before this album was released. Also just before this release and immediately after Diana's death,Elton recorded and released CANDLE IN THE WIND '97 as a single with the same music as the original 1973 version from GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD but with different lyrics. It's also known as \\"Goodbye,England's Rose\\". Great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Gerstner - Just No-Name Plywood","review":"This is not a Gerstner. It is not even a Gerstner International. It has no name plate. It is just a no-name product (of modest size and strength).Non-descript wood (not really beech, but some similar Chinese wood - all plywood).All drawers and caseword must be assembled by you via dzus fasteners (you know, that cheap stuff that simulates a barrel-bolt without having the same strength). You have to wedge the drawer bottoms with their pre-pasted felt into the drawer sides during assembly, so have your longest, thinest palette type knife around to tuck the felt into the bottom groves.Some hardware missing - No-Name maker's customer service very helpful and super prompt.Good for the craft and hobby crowd.

It's got all the features and shows and junk. And for the price, can't go wrong right.The show itself is pure nostalgia. I used to watch this show when I got home from school as a kid. Looking back now, I do wonder what I was thinking, but none the less, I enjoyed it.The show really is Thundercats in space.

There's just something about 80s cartoons that you can't get with modern shows. They were more inventive and original. Even when they weren't original, they gave it their own little twists to make it entertaining...which Silverhawks does in spades. The dvd case was a surprise. I wasn't expecting, from the pictures online, that there would be a slipcover or that it would be shiny and bumply. Very cool. Just wish that the second, and last, volume wasn't so expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"When cartoons were cool...","review":"Goodness, whenever I turn on my TV nowadays I'm just disgusted. The networks really expect me to be entertained while watching people loose weight or watching people compete for the love of some publicity loving you-know-what. Hmm, lets watch some cartoons. Oh... cartoons stink now also. So I search for an answer... literally. My youth provided the answer in Silver Hawks.This show is slick. From the rockin' intro to the cheesy yet fun-loving dialogue, you can't go wrong. Yeah it's a bit old school... but I'll play hooky from the new stuff to watch this. As an adult, do I feel guilty for buying this, watching it all, and then letting the intro run for about 30 minutes while listening to it over and over? No, and neither should you. Do yourself a favor and pick this up, or do your kids a favor and show them how things used to be in the cartoon world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it Coming from Rankin Bass!","review":"I am so glad I can buy all the great cartoons of the 80's on dvd and this was one of my favorates. This was actually third in the series of cartoons from good old Rankin Bass Studio's, the same who made all those stop motion Xmas movies we watch every season. Thundercats was the first and are avalable on dvd. Now bridge the gap and please release TIGERSHARKS! This was the little know cartoon between Cats and Hawks that ran with the multi show THE COMIC STRIP, featuring Monster Camp, and the Karate Cat, and those rapping frogs. It was the same studio and the same animation. Am I the only one that remembers this show? It was my favorate from the three."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the hold up on vol 2, anyone?","review":"Seriously...great show, but why don't studios ever finish what they started?!!!

I bought it to replace a CASIO PQ-10 which I had misplaced. I subsequently found the PQ-10 and am using it because it works the same, I find the PQ-10's controls a bit easier to use, and it's about half the size. The PQ-13 does have the advantage of using an AAA cell instead of watch batteries, but for the added ease of carrying, I'd rather buy the more expensive batteries every few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casio clock was a discontinued item","review":"The Casio clock PQ-13 is a discontinued item per Casio.

The plum role is, as usual in this genre, the Matriarch -- maybe Tippi Hedren.In any case, a fine heroine and a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointed","review":"I expected the illustrations on the interior of the book to be (at least) at the level of the drawing on the cover, they are not.

She has a unique voice with quite a range. One hit that's missing from this collection is \\"Encore\\". How could that song have been omitted? I was also in search of several other Cheryl Lynn songs that received moderate airplay in the eighties. Unfortunately, those songs are missing here. To make matters worse, the albums don't seem to be in print any longer. Does anyone remember \\"Instant Love\\", an uptempo tune produced by Luther Vandross? What about \\"In The Night\\", a mellow Ray Parker Jr. production? Or how about \\"Fidelity\\", a song that sounds very similar to \\"Encore\\"? Since the albums aren't around any longer and they aren't on her \\"Best Of...\\" collection, I feel cheated. Thank goodness I least taped them from the radio!

So much so that when the Jerry Hay horn arrangements kick in on I've Got Just What You Need, it really kicks in.#2 The long version of Got To Be Real. Put it on here.

The sound is a little ropey in places, but the tapes had had twenty years to deteriorate before the CD was released.Some of the hits are there, but more importantly the album includes a number of tracks from the then new album Dandy. Best song is the amazingly punked-up Debora. The second CD is a concert from three years previously when Bolan was in his porky pixie phase.

This seems to be a common issue in other reviews. I thought it might have been others overstuffing the bag, but the zipper design is poor with a weak hold and easy to mis-align. Had to return the item which is too bad because I liked other design aspects of the backpack - all the compartments, hooks, and canvas material. Though, I did find it odd that the cooler/food compartment on the bottom of the bag had a hole (for ventilation or drainage, I suppose)."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Design, Terrible Quality","review":"The design of the bag seems adequate. There are plenty of pockets and compartments including the semi-insulated one on the bottom. I am appalled at the low quality of materials. The thread looks like cheap heavy duty polyester thread. Cheap thread makes it fall apart much faster. I would not expect more than 3-6 months use (yes, I am sure it is designed that way), based on my experience with other backpacks. I would be terribly afraid of washing it. What good is baby stuff you can't wash?!? The shoulder straps have terribly inferior padding. The waist strap is not padded.Overall, very disappointing for the price point.

This work is really an overview of the many areas of our thought, culture and tradition which require reassesment and change. It is with my most hardy recommendation that you read this book and benefit from Mr. Von Ward's seeming endless supply of wisdom and insight. Because of the liberal references provided it can also serve as a launch point for many areas of further study.

I am not especially into local color, and war stories generally bore me to death. But I loved this book. The Malta depicted here is a genuinely intriguing exotic locale, and its depiction of the courage of its inhabitants in a very dangerous situation rings very true. Rinaldi has a real gift for characterization and a real eye for eccentric behavior--the action sometimes seems surreal, and yet based in the most concrete observation. The novel is funny and moving without ever condescending to its characters or their situation in the manner of so much local color.

Sometimes I didn't know whether to laugh or cry! The love story between Rocco and Melita was \\"real\\" - based on war-time passion and uncertainty - a reaching out for love and hope in the midst of devastation and sorrow.

This book is so well researched that it actually includes newspaper cuttings of the time (some of the shops advertised at that time still stand today!). His description of the hardship endured by the Maltese during the Second World War is absolutely spot-on without being over-dramatic or too romantic. His characters are so real, the plot so clever I could not put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story!","review":"The beginning of this story was a little rocky, and I almost gave up reading the novel. I persevered, and was rewarded with an entertaining and informational story.At the start of the book there are many characters introduced and the story doesn't settle into its rhythm for a couple of chapters. Once the story progresses, the characters become interesting and the story of Malta during WWII is riveting. I am not into \\"war\\" stories, but the description of the pilots in Malta and the actions of the people stuck on the island was fascinating. There are some really wacky characters - the cousin who builds jukeboxes from salvaged parts to the prostitute with the wooden leg - that add a nice flavor to the novel.I was sorry the story ended and am looking forward to the author's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book since _Corelli's Mandolin_.","review":"Rinaldi's _Jukebox Queen of Malta_ combines the best of _Corelli's Mandolin_ and _Catch-22_. Against a backdrop of the World War II bombing of Malta, a half-desperate, half-comic romance takes place between a hapless American soldier and a Maltese woman who helps repairs jukeboxes. How Rinaldi manages to extract both love and humor from bombed-out buildings and a war-weary populace is a minor miracle, but he does. Highly recommended, especially for anyone despairing over arid modern novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"More or less useless","review":"The book is flowery and full of pretty pictures.

The only downside is that when I use it for cutting fresh bread, the angle the slices are pushed on the back-side of the machine can sometimes cause the bread to break.

Just the bread cutting capability has made it worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"We use a food slicer several times a day... ever since we were in food service and got used to one in the commercial kitchen. Our first home slicer was a Rival 1040. Excellent little slicer for the money. It would slice through 5 lb cheese block with ease (slicing cheese is a bigger test than meat). But it would not slice through a telephone book (don't ask) and so we had to replace it. By then the 1040 had been replaced with the 1060. BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT! 1. It does not slice through 5lb. block of cheese. Bigger moter but worse gears (they slip). 2. Instead of one button to push with the other hand, you have two... and they make no sense what-so-ever... because when you let go of them the blade keeps turning until you push the button again... no safety here. 3. It's messier and clean-up is more difficult.

I hate returning things, so I'm still trying to use it, but it's just a disaster waiting to happen. The first time that the sugar ends up all over the floor or the counter, this thing will get filed in the room of never used objects. In the meantime, I've found that if I can keep the pourer side closed, I can keep my thumb on the back end while I'm pouring the sugar. I wish it worked because I'd love to just grab it and open the pour spout to fill the sugar bowl, rather than getting the canister of sugar out and fumbling for something to spoon it into the sugar bowl while several tablespoons of sugar miss the bowl completely. Same goes with baking, making lemonade or sweet tea, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit, useful tidy item to keep you organized.","review":"Someone else mentioned it here: You can get the same thing at Walmart.Not any more.

It isn't an exact fit for the 5 lb bag of flour / sugar, which is important once the bag starts getting less than full.But we're happy with the product. It's a perfect fit. You can drop the bag right in and start using. Obviously, the more delicate spout is for sugar, and the larger one is for flour. The construction is sturdy, and well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap!","review":"This is cheaply made. I purchased 3 of these, because they had good reviews...what a mistake!

I like this one a lot better, and it's convenient how you can pour from it. I hate digging into a bag of flour or sugar. But, while the flour and sugar fit into the containers, the bags are too tall when you open them up. I could cut off their tops, but I just smoosh them in there for now. This doesn't really matter for the sugar, but the flour doesn't flow too well out of the little spout, and that's probably partially because of how I have the top of the bag stuffed in there. Maybe flour just doesn't flow well though, I don't know.

The Slide & Hide Tower is just perfect for Claire and her playmate Rafe to burn up lots of energy while having fun. Contrary to some other reviews, assembly was straightforward taking about 30 minutes. We simply mated like-numbered joints and followed the pictures on the box. The only tool that we used was a short 1 X 1 scrap of wood that we used the pry the joints into the latched position. It is important to do this, because while the joints slip together easily, they are not secure until pushed tightly into the latched position.

My husband was at work so I did it all myself, and in total it took me no more than 20 minutes. Our two year old loves it. The tunnel and different sized slides make for different challenges. Plus this climber has a variety of ways to assemble it, so you can change the arrangement of the slides and tunnel. I run a daycare center with children ages 2 - 5 and they all love it.

Both of our children love this climber/slide. With two slides (of different sizes), each child has their own slide. It is easy enough for our two year old to climb up using the platform, yet, challenging enough using the climber sides for our five year old.I don't know why so many of the parents are having trouble putting it together. My husband started about 10 minutes before dusk and had it together (using a rubber mallet and a cordless screwdriver) by the time it got dark. He had much more trouble with the mosquitos than with anything else!!I highly recommend this climber--works great with two children who are probably no more than 3 years apart in age (ie. still challenging enough for the older one, yet, easy enough for the younger one)"},{"rating":"2","title":"twist of fate will not die","review":"if you love wrestling or the hardys i recomend this movie its got tons of great matches my favorite is jeff hardy vs shelton benjamin but thats my choice also its got tons of stories like how the whole lita edge thing actually went down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardy Boys","review":"Boring, It has two disk for each of them and the beginning is exactly the same on each of them.

The people on the scene that day describe their confusion and fear even as they continued to do their jobs. That's what defines a hero - being afraid and doing it anyway. When these people speak, the dirt and smoke and fire and determination and grief flood the page.But when Smith's voice interrupts,the text becomes bland and strangely distant. Everyone is a long-time friend, everyone is a model fireman (or cop) beloved by all, everyone who died was perfect and practically saintly. Everything he sees is unlike anything he's ever seen before. Words fail him - not an asset for a writer.No matter, this is a book only Smith could have written because no one else has his access to the fire department.

I feared another sentimentalized, red-white-and-blue tearjerker that takes advantage of the horror of 9/11 to make a few quick bucks. But it took only a few pages before I realized that Dennis Smith's memoir was an entirely different kind of book. Emotional it certainly is; sentimental it isn't. To my mind, it has the horrific honesty and pathos one encounters in the memoirs of Nazi death camp survivors. One is overwhelmed by its scenes of destruction and anguish and fury. But, again like memoirs of death camp survivors, the book is a testament to the human spirit, to strength and courage and love and hope. All in all, exceptionally well done. Mr. Smith has done for the Trade Towers what John Hersey did for Hiroshima."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put......Beautiful Tribute!","review":"Using the words of firefighters and police who survived the WTC collapses, Dennis Smith shows what the situtation was like for those inside the buildings before and after they fell...the sounds and sights and then hearing their fellow brothers as they fell victim to their injuries. I can't even begin to imagine the horror these brave men and women had to face. When Mr. Smith continues with his own day-by-day words about Ground Zero, I felt the pain of those looking for sons, fathers, daughters etc. while pulling through the tons of rubble knowing what they would find but wanting to bring their own home. This book is so well written and emotionally draining. I wanted to put it down and reflect the words and feelings but had to keep reading. I was also able to match the families' losses to the photos the New York Times displayed on September for the firefighters' tribute. Thank you Mr. Smith for your book. The words will stay with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT WAY TO CELEBRATE DUANE ALLMAN","review":"HAVE OWNED THIS ALBUM SINCE 1975 (I WAS 13 OR 14)MADE ME A BLUES ROCK LOVERLET YOUR KIDS HEAR IT TO EXPERIENCE REAL HEARTFELT MUSICBY ARTISTS DEDICATED TO MUSIC NOT MONEY"},{"rating":"2","title":"ESSENTIAL COMPANION TO VOL. 1, BUT NOT EQUAL TO IT..","review":"This volume doesn't reach the heights that the first one does, but it includes some very strong selections. Actually, I'm surprised that both volumes didn't have more songs from the historic \\"Layla\\" sessions. Gregg Allman once said that it was Duane's favorite recording session. \\"Born to be Wild\\" doesn't feature any significant guitar (Wilson Pickett shines here) and could have been left off in favor of one of the blistering lead guitar duels between Duane and Eric Clapton. The two songs from Duane's own aborted solo album sound great, and are a lot of fun. This volume digs deeper into the session work and, of course, there is plenty of outstanding acoustic and electric slide guitar on this volume as well, served up the way only Duane could do it.Definitely Recommended as a companion to Volume 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"blistered back","review":"Unfortunately this heating pad does not turn off automatically. I accidentally fell asleep on it and woke up with blisters on my back. The last one I had shut off after a half hour. Yes I am not too bright for falling asleep but a lot of people do that so if you are one who falls asleep with the heating pad.... do not get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"TVARE","review":"This is the only place that we can get the heating pads that have a constant heat.

I won't tolerate that much presumptuousness in my heating pad.These are tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"only lasted 3 months","review":"It was great while it lasted, but it only lasted three months!

I gets pretty hot, and has an automatic 15 min switch on and off, which I like, because this thing gets pretty hot. And for muscle relaxation, its better to vacillate between hot and cool temperatures.- As a small woman, it covers at least half my back.- Lastly, the cord is long, which is helpful to find that elusive super-comfy position."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the trick","review":"I love my heating pad.

It also has a pad to prevent burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"My wife and I have been using this product for a variety of things and it has been great. When you turn it on, it doesn't take long to heat up which is great. At its highest temperature, the heat setting is just right, hot enough to bring relief without becoming too hot or uncomfortable. The only thing we wish was different is that once it has been on High for a while, it begins to cool down and does not become hot again until its cooled down first. This is a little frustrating if you wanted it to be hot for longer. We have tried turning it off and unplugging it at that stage, waiting a minute or two and then plugging it in again and having it on High but this doesn't seem to make it any faster. It still doesn't reach High again until its cooled down first. Other than that, its wonderful and has been a huge help for sore backs, necks, and other ailments. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"new one every year","review":"I've owned several of these, and they always need to be replaced after about a year. Generally I retire them when the heating element goes out of control and starts overheating to the point of burning. The slow decline takes several months. First one of the 3 heat levels will stop working, and I will only be able to operate it on the other two levels, and finally I'll only be able to operate it on the last (highest and hottest) level. Then I will notice it getting WAY too hot for comfort. The pad becomes a burned color. A minor but consistent irritant also is that the cover is very skimpy, needlessly so, and his held on by a very feeble snap. The cover immediately falls off every time I use it. I recommend this product for a flame-resistant immobile person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff and crappy","review":"This is too stiff and the cover doesn't stay on properly. It functions as a heating pad, but there are others that are much more comfortable. This one is so stiff that it doesn't lay on the body very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oct 2011 -- DOES Have Auto Shut-Off :-(","review":"I never tried the heating pad and thus can't speak to its various settings, speed of heating, consistency, etc. I have no idea. I had to return the item because it would not be useful to me with the automatic 2-hour shut off feature. This feature wasn't listed in the item description, and several reviewers had mentioned that they were glad to find a pad without it, but as of Oct 2011, at least the one I received does come with it. Bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I was not expecting much from a heating pad with such a low price, but this heating pad is worthless unless on high. The medium setting is barely warm to the touch.

I would buy with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Satisfied","review":"I use this to place under my bird's cage for the winter.
