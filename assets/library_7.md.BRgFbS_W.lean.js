The topic interested me, I found the book disappointing. The book has only a few not that great illustrations of some of the ill-fated ships and lacks basic illustrations such as a map of the Great Lakes. The book is divided into ship wreck stories about each of the Great Lakes and a final section on the Edmund Fitzgerald sinking. The stories aren't in any particular order, chronological or otherwise, and the author does not place them in any sort of context. It would be nice to know more about the geography and economies of the various Great Lakes, but there is not much on this. The author obviously had a great knowledge of Great Lakes shipping, but this book is written in a clunky style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorfully written and well organized.","review":"I bought this book for my 10 year old son who is very interested in shipwrecks. We visited the shipwreck museum at Whitefish Point just this past summer, along with the Soo Locks. We viewed artifacts from many sunken ships. The Edmund Fitzgerald artifacts were most interesting. He has a tee shirt with a Michigan map and numbered dots for all the shipwrecks in the different lakes (over 200!) on it. Needless to say, he has really enjoyed this book and is able to relate so much of what he saw and learned this past summer to material in the book. It put it all together. It is very colorfully written, and a bit too difficult for him to read alone. So we take time together and I read it outloud to him.

The first one and the fourth one the most so for me. In fact, her final album for Verve, entitled Who Really Cares, is amazing. Yet it wasn't bought in huge quantities at the time. It's a preface to how she would grow as both a singer and a writer. Her voice is less shrill, the songs are more sensual and show a jazz and soul influence, and the production - courtesy of Charlie Calello who produced two Laura Nyro albums - is fabulously rich and excited. The string and horn arrangements are like the equivolent of the limes or olives in a cocktail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Increased Appreciation for the future","review":"Being a long time fan of Janis' music I looked forward to receiving this CD; but I had forgotten just how different Janis' music was after her four year layoff between \\"Present Company\\" and \\"Stars.\\" There is no comparison. What intrigues me though, is that Verve positioned Janis to be a one hit wonder and provided (obviously) terrible studio/technical support, and now that she is validated as a singer-songwriter they are glad to cash in. The only good song on this album is \\"Society's Child,\\" and it plays better on her \\"Live at the Bottom Line\\" recording.

I thought I would save some money and not buy a more expensive Leupold like others I have. The BDC reticle on the Nikon Monarch is way too thick and takes up way too much of the field of view. When shooting at 100 yards, the reticle hides the bulls eye on the targets I use. Makes it difficult to get good groups or even sight the scope in. I have also found it difficult to focus the scope for different yardage. Lettering on the targets are blurry with the Nikon while crystal clear with a Leupold at 100 yards. To be fair, I have not tried the scope past 100 yards where it may do better but I don't have these issues with the Leupold's I own (even the cheaper ones). Again, to be fair the Leupold I am comparing to costs almost twice as much as I paid for the Nikon, but I wish I would have spent the extra money.

I do feel that Cynthia Voight made up good characters and my favorates are Sammy and Maybeth. Sammy's stubborness is fun and help's add to the story. Maybeth is a complex character. She only speaks to immediate family and is thought to be retarded. She finally proves everyone wrong at the end of the book. I like her for that.

Every parent tries to give their children the best childhood possible. The childhood lead by Dicey, Sammy, James, and Maybeth Tillerman is not the ideal childhood. What kind of mother would leave her four kids in a parked car in a strange town and then just walk away? &#65533;She just slung her purse over her shoulder, walked away, and disappeared into the crowd of Saturday shoppers&#65533; (3). The Tillerman&#65533;s mother goes crazy and leaves them, just as their father had. The four children set out on a wonderful adventure to find themselves and their family. I feel as if Cynthia Voigt did a good job describing the Tillerman&#65533;s journey to find their family and themselves.

That night when Momma didn't come back from the mall Dicey went out to use the pay phone and she was seen by a secerity gaurd, and he thought that she was a boy. They talked and Dicey ran, she outran the security gaurd and told the smaller children to go to sleep. The next day Dicey decided that the would walk to Aunt Cilla's.

The Tillerman's only chance of survival is to travel to their Aunt Cilla's dwelling. Will the Tillermans reach their destination?Overall, I thought \\"Homecoming\\" was a book full of ups and downs. It is very well written and full of great, descriptive words. The only aspect of the book that I did not like was the repetitiveness.

If you do like this agonizing style of writing, read this book as soon as possible. I would recommend the movie (however, it doesn't resemble the book all that much).

The ending of the book was kind of boring and a disappointment. I think they should have went on to more adventures and the author should have stopped repeating herself.

It starts out with the abandonment of a mother and the first 1,000 pages rattle on about the kids walking down the road, the next 50 million try to describe some bond between the kids and a college student, and when the book finally seems to end- it spends the last 6 trillion pages talking about Gracie's realtionship with her grandmother.There really isn't anything to be learned from this book other than the fact that whenever the action gets slow, have the protagonist take off her clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"toches the hart","review":"wow!this book is grate!its long,instersing and hartwarmingi love it it almoset made me cray it is my favrit book and i am a real bookwarmbuy this or ur crazy!thisd makes a good chirstmas preaseant foor book readers age 9-16i loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book on a mother who leaves her four children in a car.","review":"The book was not catchy in the beginning, but it soon began to pick up the pace on what it really was about.

Even as a 51 yr old mom I could relate to the kids in the story and wanted to go on and find out how things turned out for them in the end. Since then we have read Dicey's Song and I am now at work on A Solitary Blue. The books are geared toward a teen aged reader, but I think younger children would enjoy having it read to them. There's a wealth of topics that the book brings up that make for great discussions between parents and children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homecoming","review":"I thought Homecoming was a great book.

After a few weeks they decide to run away to their Grandma's house. When they arrive shes very rude and mean. She has no connection to anyone because she has no phone or no car.

The way the story was set up made me ( Personally) feel like the story could really happen and that since there would be more books in the cycle nothing too happy would come about. The ending was a little cheesy, but I still won't spoil it.One of the things I didn't like about the book was they got onto some things about life in general and then the trail would just end and the author would go back to the story.This book is not for people who like non-fiction( I think)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming home","review":"If you were a mother with no husband to provide for your children and could not pay rent anymore because you were fired from a job, what would you do? the Tillermans mother decided to abandon her children with nothing but a map and eleven dollars. this is the start of the novel Homeconing by Chyntia Voight. These kids have to find out how to get to their aunts house by foot. As they struggle to pass by miles and miles of road, walking in any condition rain or shine just to avoid being orphans and living with other abandon children. Do you think the Tillerman children would be able to survive mentaly and phicically? Theres only one way to find out. I think this book was great and very interesting because most of the book I have read in the begining are boring causing me to close the book but this book from the begining I was asking all of these questions. I would recomend this book to people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, relevant and well written.","review":"I bought this book for my children, four teenaged daughters, and read it myself before I gave it to them. I found myself reading all seven books in the series over the next two weeks. The Tillerman children -- Dicey, James, Samuel and MayBeth -- are among the most memorable characters I have met in 35 years of reading, whether in juvenile or adult fiction. Dicey ranks with Jane Eyre, Scarlett O'Hara and Kay Scarpetta. My kids are also hooked on these books. Good things don't always happen to the Tillermans, even when they do the right thing, but they stick to their values and have a strong sense of family."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite book. I couldn't put it down!","review":"This book caught my attention right away. I thought Dicey and all the characters were very well explained. Once I started reading with my class everyone said how much they loved the book. I would recommend this book to everyone of all ages. Also the movie based on this novel is excellent as well. I cannot wait to read the rest of the Tillerman books. Cynthia Voight is a fantastic writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dicey Has a Heart of Gold and a Will of Iron","review":"Teenage Dicey, left to care for her brothers and sisters, gives the terrible struggle her whole heart.

For instance, The town of Crisfield lay in the sunlight before them, bleached white as the oyster shells scattered on the ground. Also I liked the ending, and how it was a little suspenseful.This book is about four kids whose mom abandoned them. Dicey, the oldest of the children, have to get them to Bridgeport. It is a long ways to walk and they barely have any money. Their first stop was to their cousin Eunice's house. There, their cousin was very mean to them, so they didn't stay for long, she kept saying that Maybeth and Sammy were retarded. Next, with the money Dicey worked for, the kid's took a bus to Crisfield There they were going to meet their grandma. They had never met her, and also heard rumors saying that she was crazy.Will their grandma take them in? Or will they continue to travel? Will they ever find their mom?I think anyone that likes adventure stories will like this book. And suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I liked Homecoming","review":"I give this book 4 stars because some parts of the story is bad and some parts are good. Most of this book is good because Dicey and her little brothers and sisters had a whole lot of adventures when they were trying to get to Bridgeport and Crisfield. They went to a college, they went to different cities and towns, and they also had a lot of fun when they were doing most of the stuff they did. Some parts were bad when it talked about innapropriate stuff. Overall I liked the book it was exciting and fun to read that is why I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homecoming Reflection","review":"\\"Homecoming\\" by Cynthia Voigt is a heartwarming story describing a family's perilous journey to seek out relatives. Personally, I did not enjoy this book very much. The book is separated into two parts. Part One was pretty interesting, but by the time I reached Part Two I found it quite repetitive. All the same events were occurring and and it became very boring. So much so that our class could not even finish the book. I believe that the author could have added some surprises along the adventure.

This kid is supposed to be SMART???? \\"There's nothing for sure except death and the speed of light.\\" That idiot. And Dicey treats him like a king for crying out loud! Also, this book was WAY TOO DESCRIPTIVE. I mean I like a descriptive book, but do we have to know every single little thing they do?! I absolutely hated this book and I advise people to read it only if they have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...","review":"I had to read this book for assigned summer reading. Besides the fact that I despise summer reading when many other schools have it as optional or writing instead, the book asn't completely horrible. The first half really, it was awful. It descibed everything way too much. I had to drive on rt. 1 and it gave me a headache because i heard it too much and i couldn't look out the window because i'd imagine seeing the suspicious looking kids walking along the road. And don't you think sum1 might get the tiniest bit suspicious of 4 kids walking along a HIGHWAY?? Wouldnt sum1 stop and see if they're ok??- The second half was better because they werent walking ALL THE TIME. Most of the time they got rides - at least after page 245.I love books but this one was terrible - and the ending is sooo predictable, I mean its called \\"Homecoming\\" for a reason...

All the emotions in this book that people go through feel real. I love books that make you feel like your experiencing the same thing as the characters. It wasn't hard for me to finish this book; I just couldn't put it down. Many events in this book were filled with sadness and disappointment, which makes the book exciting to read. If you ever get a chance to read Homecoming go for it, because it will be worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandoned","review":"The book is about four kids who get abandoned by their mother. They get left at the shopping mall. All they had was $11 and a few sandwiches. The first night they spent $4 on burgers and fries. Then they decided to walk to their Aunt Cilla's house. Each day they could walk a little bit to Bridgeport. They could not buy expensive food because all they had was $7 left. The characters are Dicey (13), James (10), Maybeth (9), Sammy (6). At this college they met this guy and he knew how they felt. He bought them some dinner and a place to stay. This book is very exciting and very good. I like it because it is very adventurous and is very fun to read. I hope you like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading 480 pages","review":"This book is a waste of time.

We ended up not finishing the book. I do not recommend this book to youth readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homecoming","review":"I thought the book Homecoming by Cynthia Voigt had a great story line. In the story the family was abandoned by their mother in a mall parking lot. The four Tillerman children always had hope of getting to a family member. My reading class was reading this book. We had to stop reading this book halfway through. Most of my classmates and I felt that the book was repeating itself. In my opinion i did not really need to know what they had for dinner every night. This book would have been a lot better if it was shorter and got to the point faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Coming","review":"The book homecoming was a great adventure book. Their mother left four kids in a car one day while buying groceries. She never comes back. Their first journey was to get to Aunt Cilla's house. They had to get jobs so they could buy food. Finally they arrived to their Aunt's house. Instead of finding their Aunt, they found their Cousin Eunice. Soon that week, they started another journey to find their grandma in Crisfield. On the trip they had bad times but, they soon got to the grandma's house. The grandma wasn't sure of letting them stay but, then she let them call it home.

It does not offer any real world advice on how to get the most from the camera. You're still on your own. There are no recommendations, no examples of what features to use when, how to get the most from the camera in various shooting situations. It is just an slightly clearer extension of the camera manual. Only it costs about fifteen bucks and it took nearly a year to get printed after it was first listed on Amazon. The manual in the camera box is a.) included in the price of the camera and, b.) delivered on time.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Better Version of the D200 Manual","review":"This is a better version of the D200 Manual.

I would have preferred to have the pictures and illustrations in color. This book is very bland and the presentation boring compared to the digital field guide.

What a great help!When I find myself looking to buy a new product to use with the camera I look to the book to be sure the item is compatible with my D200. The Nikon site isn't always that helpful since this camera is now an 'archive' item.I work in the travel industry and I do recommend this book to folks in my daily life that I see are travelling with camera gear, or at least those with a Nikon.

As a compilation, however, I'm only giving it four stars. The liner notes and the number of songs is an improvement over the previous Parliament compilation (The Bomb/Greatest Hits). The order in which the songs are presented, however, isn't. The Bomb presented the songs in chronological order giving you a good feel for how Parliaments music progressed. This compilation, however, doesn't present the songs in a recognizable order. That takes away from the overall feel of the CD. It's still a great PFunk compilation but I recommend looking at The Bomb first.

The script, the acting and the directing is as its worse! The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it can be used as a teaching tool to learn what not to do in all aspects of movie making and acting. Although it is a 1986 movie, I think that a couple of teenagers could have done something better with a home movie camera... in the 60's! That's how bad it is. The dialogue is mediocre, the acting is as its worst, the \\"special effects\\" (if they can be called that) are of the worst kind.

To conclude that a man that does not even USE the word Jesus, in one SINGLE instance in ANY of his known documents, or writings, is a Christian, is disingenuous, and has a political, rather than religious overtone. Save your money, would be my advice, and skip this as the pure propaganda that it most certainly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Washington The Christian Man","review":"An outstanding book that shows clearly that the father of our country was a Christian and not the deist that revisionists would have us believe.

Just because someone is in a room where the Nicene Creed is recited doesn't mean the person believes every word of it. Washington was more than a deist for sure, but simply using the word \\"Providence\\" many times in life doesn't make one a Christian. Perhaps Washington was, in his heart, a Unitarian, which is much different than a Christian. \\"Providence\\" can have a diverse range of meanings depending on the individual. I just don't get the obsession with making Washington something that he's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential work","review":"Josiah Gregg's record of life on the Santa Fe trail is the quinessential work on the Trail.

Who cares how many other compilations The Who have put out? the fact is, all these songs are Timeless and this is an increadible collection. If you're a fan who has all these songs on other cd's, then don't buy this one!! But this cd is probably the best introduction to the power and wonder of The Who. I guess some people just don't like to see classic bands make new music for some reason? In my opniion, Rogers voice is sexier than ever, and Pete is still the master of songwriting AND guitar playing!! How can anyone complain about the two new AMAZING songs? Don't listen to negative reviews, this cd is increadible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Autobiographical material in new songs","review":"As usual, Pete Townshend has reached back into his life to bring out material for new songs. Like many authors and songwriters, his stories and songs sound suspiciously autobiographical. \\"Real Good Looking Boy\\" is no exception, an Elvis tribute where a boy with a notable profile falls in love with his own image (as a rock star?) in the mirror and then is shot down by his mother. \\"Old Red Wine\\" is a more recent memory, where Townshend reveals his feelings on the death of friend and fellow-musician John Entwistle. The songs are fresh and hold up well in concert. I recommend them to all buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't have to listen","review":"Why would I need to listen?

This pains me that there are so many releases of the same material because The Who is my favorite rock band.Is this release worth purchasing because of the two new songs?

Buy it now, do not wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Who compilation of old and 'new\\"","review":"This is a great compilation of some of the Who's best tracks from classic, to mondern. In addition, two newer tracks not found on any album of new songs are thrown in. Real Good Looking Boy is a great song that matches just about any Who classic. Also included is a song reflecting on Entwhistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who are always great. Even many compilations later.","review":"This album should only be reviewed on its own merits. Looking at other past compilations dilutes the idea that this set can have its own strong impact. If it hadn't been for an old 70's compilation -Hooligans(never in print on CD), I may never have been clued into what an amazing band The WHO are. That being said, this is a great compilation. The new songs are cool, and Real Good Looking Boy goes back to the formula of Pete writing something that is better communicated through Roger's voice. The song selection is good for a primer. Hopefully, some 14 year old buys this and is moved to go deeper as I did. If this package can do that, and I see no reason why it couldn't, then it is an outstanding CD. Oh, in addition, I really do like the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET SOME PURPLE INSTEAD!","review":"My two favorite bands have new releases out,Deep Purple and The Who.

Everyone who knows ANYTHING about The Who knows that Pete has no morals (Remember \\"Rude Boy\\"?), so the fact that he has put a controversial song (Which will remain nameless) out AFTER being flagged as a sex offender should suprise no one. It should not shock anyone either that they will try and milk fans to death (Remember, they did not cancel their tour after John died), the only way to stop this is very simple: Do not go out any buy this or any other \\"NEW\\" WHO CD. Instead,if you purchase other CDs (Like The Ultimate Collection) you get the songs you want (This CD not having Baba O' Riley, is a disgrace onto itself), without feeling cheated. Another CD to avoid like the plague, because it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"From legends to retreads?","review":"When I saw this in the store, I gritted my teeth and looked on the song list to find, ANOTHER cd with Behind Blue Eyes. The Who where rock pioneers. They were never as relevant after Moon died, but did put out good material. The last few years has simply been the seemingly non-stop issuance of greatest hits. Two new decent songs? Fine, but it just smells of making money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Shame","review":"If Roger wants to make a new album, and has to twist Pete's arm to do it by making him feel sorry because Roger doesn't get the song royalties and so isn't as rich, great! Whatever! I might even buy it. BUT, if you want to call that music The Who, sorry, it isn't, and I will be sitting this one out. It was bad enough without Keith (even Pete has said so many times), but now without John as well?

Everyone knows most of these songs. All I can say is that they are all the original versions and the sound quality was absolutely superb.

For anyone looking for a nice mainstream compilation that has all of the most popular songs, this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much nicer than you'd expect","review":"I bought this item in a store for my daughter and the quality is so much better than you'd expect. It's actually nicer than some of the more expensive one-piece dresses I have bought her in the past. The one we bought came with a tiara and a little purse and is so so cute on and actually fits her better than others she has.I was also able to machine wash it (the package says not to, but I had to) on cold/delicate and I hung it to dry and it came out looking perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"opinion presented as fact","review":"I started listening to the audio version of this book, but couldn't get past the introduction, where the author stated that \\"humans aren't in touch with their emotions.\\" I thought, is the whole book going to be filled with unsupported and untrue statements like this? I can't stand authors who present statements of opinion as though they were fact, nor can I stomach authors who ascribe to the whole world their own shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-scientific nonsense","review":"A great disappointment! The author proposes to prove that animals have a rich emotional range that humans can understand and interact with, but offers no rigorous evidence whatever! His argument is to repeat again and again assertions along the lines of \\"People who work with animals a LOT will certainly tell you that animals really do experience emotions\\". Well, there it is: the whole book in a nutshell. Anyone hoping for revealing research and authoritative insights will be left wanting. What drivel! Save your money and watch some pop-expose on E! instead -- it'll be more engaging and far more scientific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better.","review":"While this was a great idea for a book the book itself was poorly pieced together. It was like an incredibly long argumentative essay. I can't help but wonder why it would have been written this way considering almost all of the readers are in agreement before they picked up the book. If the author was hoping to convince some nonbelievers from a scientific perspective there should have been less guilt and anecdotes. The scraps of science that did make their way into this book were shaky to say the least. I read this book a few years ago but don't remember reading anything about statistical significance... could be my memory.It was more frustrating that uplifting. I did enjoy some of the cutsey stories but wouldn't put weight on them.I agree with another reviewer who said this book is more a \\"projection of human emotion onto animals.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Animal book","review":"This book makes me respect animals more than ever. I believe animals have the same rights to life as humans. It's so sad how we ignore the rights of animals. We should be their guardians.

Animals are much more than wild or savage they are beings, and have their own type of consciousness. Masson clearly shows that. In many ways, we are wilder then them"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL BOOK","review":"This book is one that will stay with you as you look at the animal kingdom with a totally different point of view. The complex emotional lives of the creatures that share our earth will sometimes make you cry or laugh, but always to think. I know that after reading this book, I cannot go into the monkey house or look at the elepahants at the zoo without being tremendously sad.This book should be read by all as it teaches that although we have opposable thumbs, other animals are just as sensitive as us and we should cherish and protect all of them.Truly a gem to be passed along to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I had to read this book for my reading class this year, when I came home my dad said,\\"this is a college level book they should not be giving this book to sixth graders\\" the reading teacher said that I didnt have to read it but I'm glad that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"Although by all means i do not disagree with the moral compassion of this book and found the research ... although highly bias...enlightning ...i was hoping to read about elephants. my bad for not reading a sample before pressing buy...but still a bit dissapointed that this book has very little to offer about elephants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscientific emotional guff!","review":"I wss hoping to find some insights into animal behaviour that would help fill out the picture being painted by sociobiology and evolutionary biology.

Face it-this band is just out there to make money and thats all they care about. How else could you explain this horrid cd: they try so hard to appeal to every genre of music. The outcome is one God-awful record. If you like it, go ahead and pick it up-its your money. It will bore you soon after a few listens. But by all means everyone needs to stop calling this crap metal. If the band calls themself a metal band, this is really a poor attempt at it.In my opinion-this band has some serious problems. They arent psychopaths or serial killers or hate filled satan worshippers, but they do have some rare case of ADD-that in which if they dont get any attention they'll probably run off into a corner and cry. This project is all for show. The only thing worth taking a look at is the percussion.

You have 3 guitars, make it useful, not 2 guys playing the same thing the whole song then mick or whatever doing some other thing. ...no solos, which is a bad thing, it shows that the guitarists are not good enough to do solos? Or does it show that they are too obsessed with doing intro verse chorus verse chorus verse last chorus ending?

Now if you do actually like slipknot music heres a few easy steps to save $10!1) attach fishing hooks to face (in any manner, just make sure they puncture the skin)2) put your head in an oven and set it to 400 degrees.3) get some trick or treaters to play some drums, and im sure you'll got the vocals covered ;)In a nutshell - this is a perfect way to give yourself instant headaches!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Angry","review":"Well, if I could give this zero stars I proboly would. There really is no good songs on this, except Duality. I used to be a big time hard rock Slipknot fan, but it just is too angry for me. Maybe its because I listen to punk rock now, but its a little too angry. I read the lyrics to songs and they're nothing impressive. The first album was good, the second was better but the third sucked. It just sucked, and thats a nice way of puting it. How can you listen to music and call it worth-while if you can't even listen to it. Its too hard, all that Corey does is scream. In punk bands it's cool, but Corey sucks at it. He should ditch Slipknot and go back to Stone Sour. He is much better in that. Maybe its because you can actually hear his voice. Anyway, the cd is not worth 10 bucks.

So I advice people to buy this. But don't expect Sic or anything from the past. This isn't 9 angry guys out to just scream. It's nine angry guys out to do something that means something. Not saying the previous two lack depth. But thank you, Rick Rubin. Another great album produced. And my advice. Listen to this album with an open mind. I guarantee. It can grow on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot has gone down hill","review":"I've heard the album, I hate to admit that after the first two Albums Slipknot has gone downhill. Where is the rugged hard sound that they used to have. Only a few songs on the album have that sound, that is why i gave it 2 stars.

After hearing Slipknot's hard core hits \\"Duality\\" and \\"Before I Forget\\" off this C.D., I expected that the rest of the album would probably be equally glorious. Instead my ears were insulted by track after track of senseless shouting and uninteresting rhythms, which basically seemed like they had been made up on the spot. Pretty much the only good non-hit melody is \\"The Nameless\\", which is a lot less loud but has a better sense of beat than most of the album has. It is a shame that Slipknot has so many random and slapdash songs, for this seems to hide the skill of the relatively talented guitarists in the band. I would quite definitely not recommend this C.D., but I would suggest that the singles be bought separately since they stand out quite prominently among the non-hit tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"i am dissapointed","review":"what has happened here, at first i was exited when hearing the first song, wow its not heavy i thought! giving teh whole album a listen i thought it was okay, but recently ive become aware that the cd is awful!!!! if you want to hear it borrow it form somebody. i am lending it out at teh moment and i dont care if i get it back or no, seriously it is THAT bad just just no! its stone sour in disgiuse, vocal harmonies, \\" i wont let this build up inside of me\\"? what the hell!!!! what happened to \\" f*ck it all f*ck this world f*ck everything that you stand for\\"my advise avoid at all costs, go buy a chimaira album or and old KsE one, by the way i agree new KsE sucks so much lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story of a Sellout","review":"What happened, Slipknot? I wil ltell you, you let Corey Taylor right your songs. This cd goes from great to awful, and makes me want ot hurl. It cannot compare to Iowa, or S/T. Slipknot is not the type of band that goes from Surfacing to Vermillion. It saddens me to see this happen. The great parts are The Blister Exists, Three Nil, Duality, and Opium of the People. Everything from this point...collapses. Vermillion? Now with a music video that is fully equipped with crap. Slipknot is dead, unless they can make a good cd after this, but since I really did like them at one point, I'll buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not good.","review":"I wrote a review about Slipknot's self-titled album and back then I thought they were one of the best up-and-coming bands around. They fell off a bit with the second album, in my opinion, but I thought they'd be able to get together and put up a solid third CD. I've officially lost all hope. If you liked the style of the first ablum, don't buy this. If you like a mix between Stone Sour and horrific, poorly contructed mainstream-y metal, than maybe _MAYBE_ you'd want to pick this up. I'd strongly suggest listening before you buy, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot = Metal? Please.","review":"I was a fan of slipknot untill this release.

I don't see how people say its not heavy? Theres still the heavy songs there but with melody, why have all 3 albums sound the same? What slipknot did this time was awesome. Songs with solos show the talent jim and mick have, the drums are still insane, corey sounds better then ever, they did a nice job with the acoustic songs too. Even though slipknot has changed u can still tell its them.

THIS CD IS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR AS HEAVY AS THE PREVIOUS TWO. BUT AS A DEDICATED MAGGOT I AM NOT GOING TO BLAST THIS CD. THERE WERE SOME GREAT HEAVIER SONGS ON THE ALBUM( \\"THE BLISTER EXISTS\\",\\"THREE NIL\\", \\"DUALITY\\",\\"OPIUM OF THE PEOPLE\\", AND \\"WELCOME\\"). BUT THEN THERE WERE SONGS THAT THE CD COULDVE DONE WITHOUT(\\"PRELUDE 3.0\\",\\"CIRCLE\\", \\"VERMILION PT. 2 AND ESPESCIALLY \\"DANGER-KEEP AWAY\\".....THE WORST SONG ON THE ALBUM). I FALL ASLEEP EVERYTIME I HEAR \\"CIRCLE\\". THIS IS STILL A GOOD CD, BUT MY LEAST FAVORITE SLIPKNOT CD(SELF-TITLED BEING MY FAVORITE). I JUST HOPE THEIR FOURTH CD IS MUCH HEAVIER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a fan of Slipknot, and I must say that this album SUCKS! The only good song on it is Duality. I'm not sure what to say about why I feel this way.. It just doesn't do it for me!I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers Mr. Rubin","review":"What I am finding is that there are people who liked slipknot with rough production, and those that like this, more polished focused production.Personally, i like the chorus to Duality, as it somehow reminds me of \\"sappy\\" by nirvana. The verse sounds like \\"boom\\" by that other band produced by Rubin. Good stuff. Of course these comparisons might freak out the avid metal elitist, who wants more gut busting and less melodies. To be perfectly honest, I was a little worried about slipknot's artistic integrity this time around. Of course that is always a concern when a band starts mellowing out. Still there is enough good stuff here, just less energy in Corey's voice.Mostly good, nothing ground breaking in the mellow parts, but intresting things abound."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good Slipknot","review":"I would like to say that i wasnt a big fan of their first 2 cds, but i love this album. They needed to change because i was getting tired of old slipknot. My favorite songs are Duality, Before I forget, Circle, Pulse of the Maggots. Some people are upset that they changed their sound a little bit, but it would get old if this cd sounded like the other 2, and bands need to change. So if you didnt like the other cds, check this one out, you might like it"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word......great.","review":"This album is awesome. As if Slipknot could disappoint.

One day I went to Sam Goody and picked up this CD. I was about to by it when my friend said it sucks and I should listen to it first. So I scanned it and started to listen. I am forewer grateful to that freind. They're just a bunch of Goths that are beginner guitar players. And the lyrics either sound like idiotic whispering or the screaming that is cusromary of Goth music. Why 2 stars instead of one?

Slipknot used to be heavy, now they sound like Stone Sour. Where's the anger in Coreys vocals? There's nothing like Heretic Anthem, or any of the good old songs on this album. There are only three good songs here. If I wanted to hear crap like this, I'd listen to Radiohead."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP!!!!!","review":"First of all I've liked Slipknot from day 1. Before their major label release. So all you nu-metal babies shut the F up. This album is for the most part crap and a MAJOR let down. If i wanted to listen to stone sour i would kept it when i got that. I liked Knot because of the power, aggresion, anger, pure heavy kick in the mouth metal. Now they just sound like good old radio friendly (most of the songs) nu metal crap.They do still get me pissed off and angry but not in the same way. When i heard Rick Rubin was producing this cd i thought nothing could go wrong. Low and behold another heavy band that made their $$$ and then went soft. If your going to Ozzfest skip Slipknot and check out the real metal bands like LAMB OF GOD, HATEBREED, EVERY TIME I DIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Slipknot","review":"This is so not Slipknot. If you've heard Stone Sour, you'll realize this cd belongs to them, not Slipknot. Corey's vocals on this cd are just horrible. He doesn't even really scream anymore, which used to be really cool. He uses his clean voice more and while that might seem good, it actually isn't. i thought the drumming was pretty cool on this cd, that's why i gave it 2 stars, but besides that, there's not really anything worth listening to on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT THE F@$#!!!","review":"Don't let the title of my review fool you. I just got home from work and I stopped by my local Coconuts to pick up this album. I've only heard the first couple of tracks so far and I think it's great. Compared to the first two albums, I think this one kicks a$$. The title of my review refers to all the negative reviews I've heard from so-called \\"hardcore maggots\\".This is not the Slipknot you're used to. Don't get me wrong, it's still there but on this new album, the band has evolved and it's definitely for the better. The same thing happened with Metallica when they did the Black Album. You can't expect them to just keep doing the same thing over and over again. They won't want to do it anymore.My advice... get this album immediately if you don't already have it. It's worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expected the worst and was dead wrong","review":"When I went to buy the album I first noticed no parental advisory sticker on the cd, which immediately lowered my expectations of the cd. Not because cussing is \\"cool\\" but the classic slipknot phrases I have come to love (i.e. \\"I want to slit your throat and F**k the wound) would not be present. I had done a decent amount of reading on the new album, when I read they were experimenting with new styles I figured that meant a Stone Sour sound with more double bass clicks (I f**king hate stone sour!) I put in the cd, which I expected to suck, and couldn't believe what I heard. Guitar solos, slipknot sounding Corey (not Stone Sour Corey) new guitar sounds, amazing Joey Jordison speed and style, and more fast paces mini-solos. I think this rivals the other two Slipknot releases and has reinstalled my faith in slipknot as a band. Awesome awesome cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was waitng for much more","review":"Subliminal is a good album. But where's tha hate of Slipknot?? If I wanted to listen to Stone Sour, I would bought a Stone Sour album! It seems that Corey and his bandmates let the industry took them down. Come back to the Hell, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Iowa Was better.","review":"Vol.3: The Subliminal Verses is not like the old Slipknot c.d.s. They dont say 1 swear word. They are less heavy, and they sound like Stone Sour - the cuss words. Its a good c.d. though. The only song that is really bad is circle because it is too light. The best songs are blister, pulse, duality, vermillion 1, and vermillion 2. Reccomended but if you want real good hardcore Slipknot gat Iowa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too great","review":"I have alot of respect for Corey, and other members of Slipknot. However, I think that this album should not have been made at all. I think that Corey should have called it quits with Slipknot and just stuck with the stone sour thing. I really like older Slipknot, but this isn't them, this is like stone sour and slipknot thrown in a blender with a pinch of John Mayer maybe. I don't understand why they would do this to the Slipknot name, they already get enough crap for being \\"numetal\\" (whatever). I think that Corey and the boys wrote some great melodies but they are too catchy for Slpipknot, and they didn't even try with the more heavy parts. It's almost like just a bland filler until the ultra-catchy chorus. I recommend the new killswitch engage if you want a good CD.....Goodbye forever slipknot"},{"rating":"2","title":"F*CKING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i'll tell you one thing: when i first heard of slipknot making a new album, i thought it will be the heavier thing i ever heard, but when the album came out, after reading the reviews, i was a little scared, because they said it was like stone sour, and i didn't like stone sour, but after hearing prelude 3.0, my mind simply blow away, i was listening to the best slipknot cd, i haven't heard any better cd since marilyn manson's antichrist superstar, or nine inch nails's downward spiral, it is truly dark and beautiful, i completely recomend this cd, ACCEPT THE CHANGE MAGGOTS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Evolved!","review":"As a musician I can say its great to see a band evolve as much as Slipknot has over the years. When they first arived I was one of the few who sided with Mudvayne over Slipknot. Today though, while I still love Mudvayne, I must tip my hat and give credit where it is due. Slipknot are there own machine (a monster of a machine at that) and this album is symbolic of everything the bands done. Its their trophy on the mantle. And for those of you whining that this album doesn't sound like Iowa: Go listen to Iowa! They already made that album. I don't won't to pay money for an album that sounds like one I already have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember LOAD?","review":"I haven't been this disappointed since Metallica's LOAD in '96. Most of he songs lack cohesion--they sound as if all 9 of them wrote 20-30 seconds of material per song and then drew the parts out of a hat and played them in that order. The ones that do have some sort of unity, like Duality (ironic, huh?) and Pulse of the Maggots, are not up to slipknot's previous level. Experimenting is fine, but remember that oftentimes the standard is standard for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell????","review":"Ok, I (used to) absolutely love Slipknot, but what is this radio-friendly piece of garbage??!!! I'm sorry, but this is not typical Slipknot, this is a typical move a band makes when they're trying to appeal to the radio and the masses and kill their true sound. This is not Slipknot, this is a mess of noise tied into an album. I know a lot of their fans may hate me for this review but you know what? If you understood TRUE Slipknot, you would probably think the same thing. \\"Slipknot\\" and \\"Iowa\\" were true Slipknot, this is media-sellout Slipknot. Then went extrememly melodic and soft on us all. If you are a TRUE Slipknot fan, you might get it to be loyal, but me, I'm not even bothering to."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEIR BEST ALBUM!!!!","review":"i like some songs from VOL 3, like duality...in fact, i think this the best album from Slipknot...it's way more polished than the first 2, but that's better for a band like slipknot because while the songs sound the same, you can hear some clean vocals from Corey Taylor. and the guitars actually bring one or two melodies....as on ALL slipknot stuff, it's really hard to argue with the whole album, because all the songs are way similar with NO variation....well, slipknot is really not so good...if you want NU METAL, try korn, coal chamber and deftones...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aggressive Metal","review":"Slipknot is one of the better Metal Bands I enjoy. They scream a lot, but it sounds different than your typical Metal Band. There is a certain tone to the lead singer's voice that is great to listen to. Slipknot also has some softer vocals that work very well.This CD is mostly a huge Metal CD. If you love this type of music, like me, then you will love this. You get your normal lyrics about hate, killing, and loneliness. While most tracks are fairly good, others are pretty meh. I feel like the addition of Slipknot's lighter non-screaming songs really made this one worthwhile. This CD can be good to listen to no matter what mood you're in at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big improvement","review":"Ok, here's the deal. This CD is a very good CD. I don't care if you're a Slipknot fan or not, but if you like good metal records then spend your bucks on this one. The band finally shows a improvement from their first album. It's good to hear some melodies at last. After going for the \\"sure thing\\" with the complete agression that was \\"Iowa\\" and the great debut CD, they're finally trying to bring something different. And that is \\"Vol.3\\". Ok, so some acoustic stuff don't quite fit in the whole spectrum of the album but you know what? At least they're are trying. Unlike some other death metal bands that sound just like everyone else! I'm over 30 and I heard them all! Slipknot bring us great riffs and a well recorded CD. What more do you want from metal? Well, listen for yourself (downloaded it first..is safer!) and take your own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAG! I'd rather eat a cactus...","review":"Wow. Why would you change your formula if the previous one was perfectly fine? I know, they're broadening their horizons, they're taking on a new tone. In short, they ssssssuuuuuucccccckkkkkkk. When I heard the opening of \\"Circle\\" i wanted to vomit on my own face twice. I love \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" and \\"The Blister Exists\\" but the metal moments are few and far between. They should've gone full-tilt Metallica and just brought in the orchestra. I figure next time they want to release an album like this one, they'll come to my house and stab me over and over instead. With that being said, I'd like to state that i LOVE slipknot and no bad release is going to turn me away from that. It's just that if I see a CD with the word \\"SLIPKNOT\\" on it, it better be so damned heavy, I shouldn't even be able to lift it without rupturing something.

I was not in the least bit dissapointed in Vol.3, it was just as expected. Slipknot is the next step on the evolutionary staircase. Anyway, i love them and i love there new cd, its not really like iowa(excessive double bass, which does essentially define metal but can be overdone)in the sense that it is next level and they are obviously exploring how far there genre can go, and that for the most part iowa was just regular old metal. anyway buy this cd, its must in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"turning the page....","review":"So everyone is making a big deal about how Slipknot has gone soft.

The heavy songs are the trademark Slipknot songs we all know and love, but then there's the slow songs! I know people are going to talk about selling out.. blah blah blah, buts thats crap. They're slow and melodic but they're not love songs! Like it or not Corey Taylor has one brilliant voice so I say why shouldn't he use it!

However that is not to say all its songs suck the nameless was pretty cool so was danger. You have to really be in to slipknot to actually buy this cd their best cd was their selftitled"},{"rating":"1","title":"ERRRGGG!!!","review":"WHY? WHY? I was never a HUGE slipknot fan. Who knows, i could've become one, but this album sure as hell didnt help. I own Iowa and think that is a truly remarkable piece of work. Awesome screaming, growling, and singing as well. This? I don't know what to say to this.I've been to numerous Slipknot concerts and have enjoyed jumpingdafukup with them and this cd has ruined that. Duality is an ok song, but alas, the radio has ruined it for me by playing it over and over and over and over again. Opium For The People Before I Forget and mabye Pulse of The Maggots are the only other songs on this Disk that are worth mentioning. Mabye Corey should've stayed with Stone Sour. We'd all be a lot better off. Overall i'm pretty much speechless on how big a piece of trash this album is, which is why i heavn't written much. And sorry to all the Diehard Slipknot fans out there who think this is their best album yet. I completely sympathize. But this is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbearable....","review":"i couldnt agree more with Fading to Black's review on this album. like he said, screaming lyrincs at the top of your lungs is not heavy. i used to listen to slipknots first cd when i was 11, thinking they were sooo scary. then i realized after seeing them play on conan o brien, they cant play for their lives. the band doesnt even care how good they play, all they care about is if their headbanging is synchronized or if theyre heavy enough by using double bass for every other second. every song consists of nothing but idiotic lyrics that make no sense, unessesary beeps and boops by electronics or turntables, and again, annoying double bass. please do us all a favor, dont waste your money on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot all grown up","review":"Ok for starters, I am the most dogmatic person when it comes to the music I listen to. I used to H.A.T.E Slipknot, I would actually make fun of kids that listened to it. I always thought they were just immature, down-tuned, screaming, worthless mask wearing garbage. Latley I have been angry and really grown a liking to them, and this is by far one of their best albums. Corey is an AMAZING singer and he really gets to show off his talent through this album. I really like heavy music, but its always nice to hear a band mellow out and make an awesome melodic ballad type song. Vermilion pt. 2 is a great song, very emotional and a great highlight of how slipknot is going out on a limb to help prove that they can play more than down-tuned powercords with nothing but screaming. AWESOME ALBUM, worth the $$"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really slipknot, but it doesn't lack greatness","review":"This is slipknot's least brutal album thus far. Although it is not as heavy as the nine man metal army's previous releases, it shows a much more creative side to the band. When i first got this album it was the only thing in mey cd player for about a week.The best tracks on this album are:THE BLISTER EXISTSTHREE NILWELCOMEBEFORE I FORGETHarcore fans of the first two slipknot albums may be disappointed with this one, but fans of stone sour may really enjoy it because it is much softer then the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growth for Slipknot","review":"Vol 3 shows a definite sign of growth and isn't the same as the old albums, but that is a good thing. Another Iowa would just be retarded. Some would be critical of slipknot softer songs on the album and say they themselves have gone soft but they show a lot more musical talent and creativity than tracks like \\"People=S---\\" off of Iowa. Vol 3 is by far Slipknot's best album because they have figured out banging heavy-heavy jams 24-7 gets old. A much better contrast of songs this time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot At Their Strongest","review":"I'm not a big fan of Slipknot, but this album is by far their best. It eliminates all of the profanity I didn't approve of from the previous two albums, although there are just a few minor \\"profane\\" words. The music is fantastic, and that's something really good for an album like this. Also, Corey Taylor works very hard on his vocals, and he puts a lot of effort into his yells in the songs. I really hope they can keep it up if their band gets back together after Paul Gray, the bassist, was killed by a heart attack. I really hope they make another album like this.Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Album","review":"up until last year, i couldnt stand slipknot and i thought they were the worst band in the world. then i heard a few songs off their newest album, and i actually liked what i heard. a friend recommended this cd to me, and i loved a lot of songs on it. the highlights include \\"Duality\\" \\"Circles\\" \\"Vermillion (Part 1 & 2)\\" and \\"Before I Forget\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest album from Slipknot","review":"Slipknot has always been in my top faves of bands. This particular album gives so much energy I could listen to it for hours. Three Nil, Vermilion Pt. 2, and such songs like that really prove to be a stronghold for the CD. This is one cd I recommend all people who like hardcore music to listen to. Great cd that I would give more than 5 stars to if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"This album is weak - sorry to dissapoint the fans...such as myself - who loved the powerful hard energy that the first two albums had....This album is soft. My best analogy if how Limp Bizkit was hella hard and awesome on their first album (3 Dollar Bill Yall) to the weakness of their latest album....Thats all I gotta say..I wanted this CD to pump me up like the older ones. But that didnt happen.This album is definetely not worth the 11 bucks I payed for it...If you want something hard more 'like' the old Slipknot then go buy KORN's 'Take a Look In the Mirror' CD! Thats a f...in awesome CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let this be your last album","review":"This album is very uninspired. Almost as if they put no time in making it. If they truly do not care about the band anymore then they should just call it quits. I would have liked this album better as Stone Sour, not Slipknot. Once again Rick Rubin takes another great band and tries to commercialize them. Slipknot should not ever put an acoustic song on their albums. Thats not what they are about. There are a few good tracks but they are not as intricate or creative as anything they did on the past two albums. I just hope this is their last album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little overdone!","review":"I'm sorry but I just don't like this album! The First two were great, but this one is less than good! One of the reasons is because they tried to add more statements to there music and SLIPKNOT is not about staements. SLIPKNOT is about anger and power taken to it's full extent, and sometimes even further! I think that any fan of SLIPKNOT says this is their best work, is on the wrong page"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This is possibly the worst Metal Cd in history.....Corey went Hollywood and took Slipknot down.....he simply soldout and wants more money.....Slipknot has their own shoes now...as if they need more money........Slipknot used to be good, but until Vol. 3 came out...then i lost ALL respect for them.....so many people that once said \\"OMG, i will NEVER listen to that satan worshipers music\\" now own Vol. 3.......f**king hypocrites.."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is crazy","review":"These guys need EXTENSIVE therapy.

LOL !! They have no talent! Kerry King could play at slipknots level when he was like 4 years old. For a band with 9 members you would think that they would be complex. Instead it sounds like crap.If you are a slipknot fan reconsidering your bad taste in metal I suggest you try the following bands. Slayer, Opeth, Dimmu Borgir, Arch Enemy, Old Mans Child and Burzum."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAY!!! SLIPKNOT SUCKS ***","review":"What were people smoking when they said this is Slipknot's best CD??? I mean.. jesus christ.. i want some..

This band does not have actual talent whatsoever (even a few of their songs that show \\"talent\\" in this album pale in comparison to a million other Metal bands). People really need to stop worshipping the dollar and skip this band and other bands who are like them.Don't bother.

With the track \\"circle\\", which is acoustic just proves they have sold out. THis is not the time to experiment, just do what you've been doing from the past. I went to the concert and they want us to mosh to PULSE OF THE MAGGOTS. SOrry people, if you like this cd, you must have never heard anything before this truely DISASTERPIECE cd.

I was dissapointed as soon as I started listening to the first track. I don't like Stone Sour so naturally I don't like the sound of this album. I don't like how Cory sings on this album, the guitar riffs aren't as heavy as in their previous recordings, and what happened to the double bass kicking???? Joey used to kick that double bass out so fast and it sounded so awesome but he doesn't use it that much on this album. I don't know. Too much singing and not enough intensity for me. Some of the songs on this cd actually remind me of Staind and I can't stand that band. Slipknot has definatly done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot and their fans are a joke","review":"Total garbage. This band and their music is a mockery of metal.

For real metal? get the latest album from shadowsfall,children of bodom,pantera,suffocation,cannibal corpse,cryptopsy,morbid angel,skinless, nile,dyingfetus and others.

They obviously put more work into this album than the other ones. There are no f-words on this one. all of you parentally sheltered kids can buy this one with no trouble. goddamn parents. anyway, this album kicks because they have matured but still have their thrashy antics. the first few songs are softer, but the rest of the cd is pure 100% hard core. you all should buy this cd if you are a metal fan. actually you should buy this cd if you are a metal fan or not. because it kicks ass. yeah. i dont feel like typin no more. just buy the album. oh, yeah, IF YOU DONT LIKE THE CD BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SWEARING: YOU ARE A JACKASS.

It's ok to paint your face like twisted sister and laugh like Beavis and Butthead at death and gore when you're 15, but at some point you need to join the rest of us here in the real world. What's funny is to think about these guys coming home and taking a crap, maybe paying the electric bill and making a T.V. dinner. They're just normal, boring idiots like anyone else.

Every distorted guitar riff sounds candy-coated, there's no consistency between songs, and what little \\"creepiness\\" they tried to capture is almost instantly ruined by silly electronic video game sounds, discrediting any validity they claim to have left.

The subliminal verses is really an attempt at just making money. There is no vision, no direction for the songs to go.

It not only is a balls out assault on the ears but it also has peaceful acoustic breaks that are very rare in metal bands. What I want to know is why did Slipknot decide not to curse on this album. To me, no cussing makes a CD so much better. There are so many good songs on this CD, that will make any fan happy. Check this CD out, it is really really good.

If you want a slipknot CD go buy Iowa instead of Vol 3. (the s**t verses).THIS CD SUCKS DONT BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"slipknot sucks","review":"If you are a fan of Iowa and the self titled album DO NOT BUY THE NEW ALBUM! This is slipknot turned into a top forty version of Stone sour. This album is slow and full of ballads. True fans of the old slipknot and heavy metal will hate this album. Slipknot sold out big and this album really sucks. I hope this album finishes the band and Corey can back to writing love songs for Spider-man movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album--Special Edition makes it better!","review":"Okay first things first. To all the people who say that this is Slipknot's worst album, and to the people who called other people liars because they said that this was a good album, just be quiet now and save yourself the rest of the embarrassment. Just because Corey doesn't scream the \\"F\\" word every 17 and a half seconds doesn't make this a bad album. Just because Corey doesn't cuss at all, with the exception of 'b!tch3d' in \\"Duality\\"--which is hardly even discernable--doesn't make this a bad album. Personally, it shows me a more mature Slipknot than we got on Iowa and the self-titled album. Cussing does not make an album good or bad. Let me repeat myself. CUSSING DOES NOT MAKE AN ALBUM GOOD OR BAD! Some people have a problem figuring out what that means. I, personally, like this album, as I do the other 2 'Knot albums. I cannot wait for the next Slipknot album. (There is one coming out in 2006, just to let people know.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but...","review":"For starters, I found that this album got boring with repeated listens. I quite liked it at first, but each time I played the cd, I enjoyed it less and less. No re-listen value. Another reason is a reason that apply's to the band it self: nine guys in jumpsuits and masks? I must say that is kind of lame. And although the music end of this is better than their previous 2, I would've thought that nine members in a band would come up with some great music, since bands such as Exodus and Testament really rip with five members. But, unforuneately things didn't work that way.On the other hand, I find \\"duality\\" and \\"pulse of the maggots\\"as decent tunes. I don't care 'bout the rest. I don't mean to offend anyone, but spend your hard earned money else-where"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This band are so rubbish it is untrue! All they do is make noise, they have no musical talent at all. They try to copy good death bands like Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir and In Flmaes but they arnt even close cos they just havent got a clue. They need to concentrate more on actually playing their instruments, instead of vomiting on the crowd and throwing sh*t around the stage! Hopefully they will split up soon and we wont have to listen to their wannabe nosie much longer.TO THE FANS: get your ears mendedTO GET SOMTHING BETTER :buy any CD in the world that hasnt got SLIPKNOT written on the front!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great Album, but not that great....","review":"Wow! What a great album. SlipKnot have really come together and amazed fans and Maggots, such as myself, with their new sound. They have gotten a bit soft, but it's new and it's going to take some time to get used to. The only complaint i have of them, is that they did too much of the acoustics on it, making them sound like Stone Sour, but the album is still worth buying, no matter what. I really enjoyed this album, but didn't really care for the acoustics, even though it sounds good. But thus far, Slipknot, keep up the fantastic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING","review":"I agree, this cd is very different to the others, yet it still sounds Slipknot, at least to me.

If you liked the self titled one and IOWA, this will be a HUGE disappointment. It's like they put no effort at all into this one. Also, you can hear corey's stone sour influence right from the beginning. Oh yeah, forgot to mention there are three acoustic songs in this cd...yep, you heard me right, acoustic songs on a slipknot album. Hard to believe, but true. I'm giving it 2 stars because it does have a few good songs(Duality, Welcome, Pulse Of The Maggots, Before I Forget) but 4 good songs out of 14 is a disaster. I am sure they will lose a bunch of fans as well as gain new ones...from my side, they just lost one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"OMG, i thought i just purchased stone sour for a minute there... i expected harder stuff than this.

Corey's vocals are pretty plain, and weak overall. the guitar work is subpar and not technical at all. the drumming is a joke as well, drumming and guitars are often the backbones of metal bands and slipknot lacks both. for having close to 10 ass-clowns prancing around stage they have a really thin sound. metal drumming, see: origin, decapitated, beneath the massacre, metal guitarists, see: necrophagist, slayer, pantera, and vocals there is no one better than Mikael Akerfeldt from opeth. slipknot blows, and if you are over age 13 and still think they're extremely talented, heavy and badass, please reconsider life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this music?","review":"Do not buy this album.Besides being extremely horrible in the aspect of musicianship, the lyrics are, well hardly understandable , and secondly, even worse then the musicality of this band.I am a musician and a big fan of metal, and Slipknot is noise.

How about Corey and his cohorts are just nine angry teenagers trapped in halloween masks. Every member of this band are just no talent hicks from Iowa. Joey Jordison's drumming is one of the most overrated things on this earth. As many reviewers have also mentioned, their lyrics are s**t. I don't care about satanic themes (I listen to deicide and every other Death or Grind band you can think of), I just care that these no talent poseurs are famous. But, crappy bands usually are famous. Ask about my experience with this music. My conformist, robot classmates love this generic nu-metal.

I'm not saying it's bad but it is their most commerical and blah album. Self titled (the 1st major label album) was their best by far in my opinion. Iowa was good but not great, this sounds like they just did it to do it. \\"Circle\\" (trk. 6) is an acoustic ballad thing, which stops the little momentum the album has and the lyrics of 90% of the album are just not of the \\"can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes\\" calibur, just not insane enough. The only highlights of this album are Prelude 3.0, the Blister Exists, and Virus of Life. Many skip over tracks on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd sucks!","review":"The only reason I gave this cd one star is because you can't go lower! It dosen't deserve any stars at all.

Corey Taylor and crew have thrown together a great album that I can throw in my car and scare pople with. When an album can do that they have acccomplished their goal as far as metal goes. I do not think the fact that slipknot has gone mainstream has affected how they feel about their music, only how it sounds. Though streying from their original roots and sounds a bit this cd should still call for veteran fans to rush out and buy as well as open the door for new listeners.I have been a Slipknot fan for a little over three years now, and I am now in love with this album. Their first single off of Volume 3: (The Subliminal Versus) DUALITY stays stuck in my head 24/7. Also this is a band with stage presense like not other. I would advise all loyal fans to buy this album if they havn't already as well as people who have been thinking about becomming fans. This would be a great cd to get started on Slipknot. I hope I have been some help to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forward without selling out","review":"The band tightened up all the way around for this CD, yet they still retain the appocolyptic rage of their roots.

I've been a fan ever since. The self titled and Iowa were two of my favorite cd's ever. I worshiped this band. I even have mate feed kill repeat. Then They took their hiatus and corey started stone sour again and they castrated him. He's lost his charm. I had my hopes up that subliminal verses would be up there with the other releases. after trying and trying to get into these songs, I was let down. This album was majorly pussified. I hate it. there's only three songs on the cd I can stand. blister exists, 3 nill, and pulse. other than those, the rest of the album is crap. alot of posers and wannabes are going to be happy with this album. but true maggots would agree that slipknot owes us true metal fans a much improved volume 4. play something with balls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot Still not that good.","review":"This isn't even a good album to begin with, writing is still pretty bad, boring toned down guitars, stupid clown makingand the same old, same old tired songs and plotthat even bone thugs and harmony would have doneVol 3: The Subliminal Versus is ridiculousand should be called the poorliminal versusThumbs Down for me on this albumthis is not a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroic Genius.

I heard this album in my friends car stereo because we were satisfying his little brother. This cd like the others is just pure garbage and noise. Theres no talent to it, its like lincoln park they just write the same song about 30 times and give it a bad title. If you want real metal go pick up Slayer Reign in Blood and Seasons of the Abyss. Sepultura Arise and Roorback. Pantera Vulgar display of Power and Far Beyond Driven. The list goes on, and the truth of the matter is in 10 years slipknot wont even exist anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot finally get to shine","review":"This album is their best release since Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. It is a great comeback from the godawful Iowa cd. That album was terrible. Slipknot finally drop the boring, 1 riff songs that Iowa had and return to the level of experimentation and technicality they had with MFKR. All 9 members shine on this album. Corey's vocals have improved quite a bit. The guitar solos on this album are incredible (they sound a lot like Death Metal solos). You can actually hear Paul's bass sometimes on this one. And the drumming, as always, is top notch. There is absolutely no rapping on this album, which is a big plus.My favorite songs on here are Three Nil and Welcome because they are the heaviest. Joey does hyperblasting on Three Nil, which makes up for the song not having a guitar solo. The acoustic songs are pretty good too. They still have the Slipknot atmosphere to them and kind of remind me of Opeth.This album surpasses Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"ladies and gentlemen listen","review":"wow, i have heard alot of slams saying, THIS IS NOT OLD SLIPKNOT! well duh, it isnt. its the new slipknot, you cant just sit there and hit a drum a thousand miles per hour cd after cd and expect to keep selling, people will get annoyed and be like, YAY for the first listen and then go, Ummm, lets listen to Blondie, afterwards, when i heard there self titled. i thought it was good, then i heard Corey Taylors voice, and i knew if he put into effect and used it more, they would be GREAT, it took them two awesome albums to make this amazing one, i couldnt believe what i was listing to, they rose above the norm (or abnorm) and showed they had true talent. Dont get me wrong they were talented before. but they hit there peak on this CD, some may not like the change, BUT EVERYTHING CHANGES! this one for the better.

It's amazing! They have really moved on musically. Iowa and Slipknot were both a bit... too destructive and inexplicable! This album has elements of the shouty and self-destructive Slipknot we used to know, but with new sounds added in as well. The fact that there are three songs that have accoustic guitars and at least nine that have understandable lyrics. It shows a massive improvement, and for the people who think Slipknot just shout and scream and swear, this is an album that will prove them wrong. I hope that this is sign of many brilliant things to come from Slipknot. They are trying to find their individual \\"sound\\" and to be honest, I think they've found it. Well done! Like the news mask as well! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album has got to be the best yet.","review":"Slipknot has really shown how awsome they are in this album.

There is alot of controversity over this album but if your a true Maggot youll accept what they are trying. Its differnt only 2 cuss words. one in duality-Bitch and one in Pulse of the maggots- Bastard, But is that what everone rates them on is how much they cuss. The Screaming is in a different style thats sounds pretty damn good. Id say its their best album yet. Yes their is some acustic guitar in 2 of their songs but the songs are exellent. They still have most of their heavyness, they just added more of a melody to their music.if you didnt like Slipknots first 2 albums try this one cuz it is differnet.

Slipknot, along with their producer, decided they wanted to do something new. That's not really a bad thing. If you want to listen to pure screaming without method or rhythm, go listen to Slipknot and Iowa. That's what almost everything on those CD's was. This proves that Slipknot actually has real talent. I picked thise up on a whim a while ago and it's fast becoming one of my favorite impulse purchases ever. Go and give it a listen at the store. Old fans seem not to like this CD, but Slipknot's winning a lot of new ones (me included) with it. It's cool, it's both heavy and light, and it's great growth for the band.

This cd has some of the worst songs yet with the exeption of a few, duality was the best one on there. So if you didnt like that song dont expect anything from this cd. The vocals sounded like hanson was in on some of them. I think that slipknot is heading more towards a nickelback sound.

What happened to the Slipknot we all met back in 1999?All I can say is that I'm glad I only spent $10 and not $20. This album isn't worth the time it took to make it. Wanna hear real metal?

The music hits hard, I mean, it is HEAVY STUFF!Don't shy away because people say it slow, it's not that bad. The slower songs are good and there are only a few. The heavy tracks are heavy and they hit hard. There is a slight hint of Stone Sour in this album which I didn't really apreciate but it does not prevent the enjoyment of any song. People also complain about it sounding different. IOWA was different from the first so Vol 3 is differetn from IOWA. All bands have a verying sound from album to album.

The guitar riffs are horrible and repeatative and over powers the drums on alot of songs. Cory doesnt do his aggressional scream anymore, and the lyrics are so over the top. They totally sold out to the MTV generation and it can only keep going downhill from this. I cant stand Slipknot now and have lost all respect for them. Whoever said Slipknot was death metal obviously doesnt know what theyre talking about! SLIPKNOT IS NU-METAL...NOT DEATH METAL!

Then I picked up a CD called Escape by a band called Ram-Zet. To my shock I heard something that was far more heavy then Slipknot, Adaem, Korn, etc. I started to find more and more metal bands that well big over on the other side of the Atlantic coudl not be found over here.Then I found out way. It was because if some radio DJ tried to play a real metal band like Ram-Zet they would be fried for it. All because teenagers were not buying it.Guys really a band dose not need nine people to make a band. Six to five people are just fine. Swearing does not make you a metal band.

Granted, there are one or two good songs on the album, but I still preffer the old Slipknot- it was more metal than this crap and was way more worthy of a headbang and a good screaming to.

Even the demure Aimee, abducted and sold as a slave, doggedly created a life for herself within a Turkish seraglio. Recent muddled books on these women often verge on either the pornographic or the bathetic; Blanch's account was light-hearted; her humor, sympathy, and realism tempered her admiration. This was a best-seller in 1954, and is still immensely readable -- even if Blanch spoke more languages than some annoyed reviewers, and was not suitably PC for 2003.

In case you're not familiar with his work, here's a resume: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Hercules. Excepting that last one, they are excellent musicals all. Home on the Range isn't as good as, say, Mermaid, Beast, or Aladdin, but it's as good as all of the others (and way better than Hercules).The songs are excellent, with \\"Little Patch of Heaven\\" being the best of the lot. k.d. lang's performance of that song is excellent, as is Randy Quaid's on the yodel song. Even better is the score, which has a very rich feel to it and is one of the best Menken has yet provided for Disney.

KD Lang sounds great on the playful song Little Patch Of Heaven. I really like the song Anytime You Need A Friend by the Bleu sisters. It is a great song about friendship that fits the theme of the movie well. Will The Sun ever Shine Again is a beautiful song by Bonnie Raitt. This is a somber and somewhat sad song that Bonnie Raitt sings so well.Tim Mcgraw lends his talents to this awesome soundtrack with the song Wherever the Trail May Lead. It is a song about having someone to lean on when times get tough. Randy Quaid yodels pretty good on one track which is fun to listen to. This soundtrack has some great music.

The narrator is left wondering what he should do: Forgive the soldier for what has been done to the Jews or decide not to forgive him.

And...the events are completly unbelievable. These rich kids just go around killing people for stupid reasons (like someone owes them $80) and they never get caught. On top of all that, whoever edited the movie put little stupid effects like a twinkle on this one rich guy's tooth when he smiled. Everything about this movie was dumb.

I was flipping around last night and caught it coming on Showtime. Out of curiosity, I decided to watch the first few minutes and, before I knew it, I was completely mesmerized by how utterly terrible this movie was in every possible respect. I mean, if the movie had been just bad--as opposed to an absolute train wreck--I certainly would've stopped watching it.

At its best his prose captures above all the heavy inevitability of real life. As in our lives, there are no miracles, no surprise rescues... only the unavoidable consequences of our actions. INCEST captures that reality and much more. In a way this is an especially philosophical work which very accurately portrays the power-dynamic between parent and child, and the relationship between man and local moral code. There is a spareness to Sade's writing here that will refresh those easily bored by the longwinded philosophical diatribes of works such as JUSTINE and JULIETTE. INCEST is a short quick-moving tale with all elements perfectly placed. A must-read for any fans of the Marquis."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeSade at his best!","review":"This is one of my favorite pieces DeSade ever produced. If you want to understand sexual deviancy and paraphilias, you must take a lesson from the master himself. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeSade is Overrated","review":"DeSade never actually describes any of the sex acts which I found disappointing. Maybe what were are exposed to today, regarding sex, it wasen't that shocking. I think a lot of people forget that DeSade was from the upper class and never worked a day in his life. So he felt he could look down on the lower class and woman and tell everyone what was wrong with them. Also, from reading his books that he has a deep hatred for woman and men, which I suppose stems from his mother leaving him with his perverted uncle who allegedly molested him when he was a young boy. I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who takes an oven camping?","review":"When I go camping I don't take my oven with me, but this writer does.

It was meandering, difficult to follow and gave more on the philosophy of good drawing and useless discourse on the intangible portions of drawing like 'rhythm and passion' than any usable information on the practice of drawing. A prefect example: he disregards the stomp as an embarrassing chapter in the history of draftsmanship, where the stomp is an indispensable tool to any professional artist today.I was looking for a book that gave a good technical manual on fine art drawing; how to render convincing pictures and measures of proportion. I fount none of these things. This book does have a safety though, it is so incoherent and difficult to follow I doubt most people could finish it.

I wish I hadn't ignored the fact that others commented about nearly everything except actual drawing instruction. I wish my mind had registered the key words analysis and theory in so many others glowing reviews. If you want to learn to draw, or learn to actually apply lines, mass, tone, balance, proportion, etc. to improve your drawing skills then look elsewhere. However, if you want to read one author's horribly long winded rambling lectures about how these things influence art, perception, and the psyche then this is the book for you. This is far more an analysis of drawing as it relates to art than it is a tutorial. Nearly three hundred pages and you could compress the portions related to applying these ideas to your own drawing down to two dozen pages at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best fruit picker design available","review":"I have tried both the WOLF Garten and the Lawn & Garden fruit pickers (with L-shaped picking tines), and found pickers with the L-shaped tines much more efficient - especially with fruit which has to be twisted to release it from its stem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for Mangos!!!","review":"I am about to buy my third fruit picker.

However, if you are a regular typists and are used to typing on other standard keyboards then steer clear of this one. The biggest flaw here is the design and placement of the enter/return key.

I found both books to be brutally disturbing and I came to believe her story. Maybe the descriptions of the people, their behavior and the abuse in both books were so horrible, I just wanted to believe in her. Or maybe I could not believe that someone who had just made the most successful porn film (and, allegedly, the most financially successful film of any kind) would walk away from all that money if they were really doing it of their own free will. I heard Linda Marciano speak at my college when I was a Senior and, while I did not agree with the views of the group she had become associated with, I found her to be believable. Ultimately, everyone will have to read these books and decide for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Partial sequel / partial rehash of LL's Ordeal","review":"Bought this after having read Linda Lovelace's first book, Ordeal. Out Of Bondage spends a lot of time retelling the same stories that were already told in Ordeal, and a little too much page space is devoted to Linda Lovelace babbling on about some lawsuit she had filed against her, where she owed some guy 40 grand... that part wasn't so interesting. Nothing here that wasn't covered better the first time around in Ordeal, and the things here that weren't covered in Ordeal (her going on a book tour for Ordeal) are kinda much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary of this Great Falklands Book","review":"Excellent.

I need all my beverages ice cold, whether it's iced tea or iced coffee. Whatever I drink, I love using a Boston shaker to get the job done.While the seal mechanic itself is great, it's a shame that the company only makes this model for 10 oz...Forgiving if it was $20, but for a $50 two-piece shaker, it's a deal breaker because you expect so much more. Not to mention, the accompanying strainer costs an additional $23...So far, I've yet to come across a quality shaker like this model that has a 16 oz scale for convenience and practicality.

I thought this was adventure-SF's last gasp before the cyber and alternate universe genre took over._On My Way_ is what the Star Wars prequels wish they could have been...I must find another copy at a used bookstore and read it again.

One look at the very female-like Rogers and it's pretty obvious she's an adult, especially at the dance near the end of the film.Sometimes the dated dialog and attitudes of the time period make it all the more fun. Rogers was a great comedienne, not just Fred Astaire's most famous dance partner. She is the big star of this film. Of note, too, is that Rogers' real-life mother plays her mom in this film.This is one of those classics I really enjoyed when I first watched it but dragged a bit when seen recently. Sometimes, the more you get used to modern movies, the more some of these classic films can seem slow. This is an example. Still, it's nice to see this movie finally came out on DVD in 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What Did Happen Between New York And Stevenson?\\"","review":"'The Major and the Minor' is a sweet, innocent, light-hearted comedy romance that could only come out of the '40's ('42 to be exact). The storyline will keep the audience amused from beginning to end, the cast is stellar and Ray Milland and Ginger Rogers have more than enough chemistry and good looks to please both sexual persuasions.However to make this plot work for the viewer one must be willing to suspend reality and accept the possibility that a group of intelligent, adults can be deceived into believing that a 31 year old woman (Ginger Rogers) is a twelve year-old girl.

The story is told against the backdrop of the world history of the time, the cold war, Vietnam, the Berlin airlift, the erecting of the wall, etc. Borman, Lovell and Anders were interviewed and contributed their perspectives on the flight as well as on the experiences that happened as they came up through the ranks of test pilots and astronauts in training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of focus","review":"Of all the history books about the space race I have read so far, and that includes a fair share, this is the most disappointing. Its recurrent emphasis on the religious aspects of the whole enterprise makes it appear more as a seminary reading rather than as a technological and human epic. The climax of the story is the reading of the Genesis verses (a whole chapter dedicated to develop this theme). We learn the number of times astronauts and family members go to church and to which ones in particular, all in great detail. On the other hand, we are shown the command module only in passing. The story line disappears in sympathy with the spacecraft every time it passes behind the Moon. Even the sense of adventure is bland. I could not finish the last two chapters because the focus was once again concentrated solely on the political and religious background of this groundbreaking scientific endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful story, poorly told.","review":"What an adventure was Apollo 8!In many ways, the first manned translunar voyage surpassed Apollo 11 and represented the greatest single leap forward in the US space programme.Sadly, Zimmerman falls far short of doing the mission justice. Only half the book seems solely devoted to it; the remainder is filled with a potted history of the Cold War and uninteresting insights into the religous lives of the three protagonists.The former has been done much, much better elsewhere; the latter served no purpose.In the author's defence, ommitting these two aspects of the book would have left it weighing in somewhere around 150 pages (and no, I haven't counted) which possibly explains their inclusion - it's not a long book. Add a peppering of typos and errors of fact and grammar and you have a book that only the most ardent Apollo fan would list as a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful telling of the Apollo 8 story","review":"This book was written for the student of history by a student of history.

Too bad the story is told in fits and starts as Zimmerman jumps all over the timeline. Just as the story gets REALLY interesting, the author cuts it short and moves on to some esoterica--I don't really care about what churches the astronaut attended. By the end of the book, Zimmerman is cramming \\"GOD and COUNTRY\\" down the reader's throat to the point of nausea.It also looks like the publisher didn't have my copy proofed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply flawed","review":"A great idea for a book, appallingly realised. Apollo 8 was a significant achievement and a pioneering adventure. However, this story is obscured by Zimmerman's overt propagandising of \\"the American way\\". His constant moralising and political hectoring obscures the essential brilliance of the Apollo 8 mission and the courage and skill of those involved. The last straw is his suggestion that the laws of the US and the \\"capitalistic and democratic principles\\" of that country should be a blueprint for future star travellers. Only read this book if you cant get hold of Andrew Chaikin's or Jim Lovell's books, both far superior and focussed on the real story, neither coloured by crass polemic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and comfortable","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my sister 2 years ago and it still looks new!

If you are going to spend money on this book, save it, and purchase one of the better Richter books out there (see my other reviews)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"After a ridiculously long drawn-out process with another vendor (Fawas Alharji) where i was basically screwed over, I found these guys who sold me an excellent Promaster 2500pk Super SLR Cam that came in exactly the day they said it would. If you're shopping for a top quality camera with STUPENDOUS service go to these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Succumbs to First Person Driveler","review":"Gardner wrote a fine first novel (Expendable - which I gave 5 stars) and a pretty good second novel (Commitment Hour). With Vigilant, he assumes that anything driveling forth from his first person narrator is intrinsically interesting. (This is an increasingly common affliction among writers.) Faye Smallwood assails us with her emotions and reactions so much that the reader is deprived of any reaction to the events in the novel. For example, the near extinction of the Ooloms seems little more than a side show for Faye. As a result, Gardner (or Faye) turned disaster into banalty. All I \\"heard\\" was Faye, Faye and more Faye. Yes, Faye has her story and we should hear it. But there's a whole universe out there. Gardner should have let us feel it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book in a fantastic series","review":"Vigilant is one of my favorite books in one of my favorite series. It isn't hard sci-fi, but James Alan Gardner has created an incredibly rich universe populated by aliens who run the gamut from unthinkably complex to truly alien to almost human. Unlike a lot of series that follow the same protagonist from novel to novel, James Alan Gardner continually introduces new central characters on new worlds within a shared universe. What's amazing is that each new set of characters is just as engaging and fun to read about the last. The League of Peoples books are a truly remarkable achievement that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in science fiction; and Vigilant is one of the best of the League of Peoples books. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable","review":"Gardner doesn't write the stereotypical future. Not everything is dark and metallic. This story is actually rather quaint, and is an easy read. It is enjoyable and moves well. The one caveat is that Gardner does not create a grand universe like Herbert does in Dune, so this series of books will be somewhat limited. But overall, this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her music is about life!!!","review":"I have to agree with Erik Werkman. Abbey Lincoln's voice and style just have a way of sending \\"shivers down the spine\\".I, also, first heard of Abbey Lincoln during a television interview a few years ago. It was during the Black Arts Festival in Atlanta Georgia. The interview was dynamite! But what really began my fascination with Abbey Lincoln, besides my being a Smooth Jazz listener, was when she sung \\"Throw it away\\". I have spent the last few years now trying to obtain any and all works of Abbey Lincoln, including the movie, \\"FOR THE LOVE OF IVY\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abbey - You go girl!!!","review":"This is Abbey Lincoln at her best. She wraps herself in and out and around this wonderful selection of numbers. Her songwriting is superb and timeless.

The LED lights in our Christmas tree were much much brighter. Our house sits about 150 feet from the street, and if you weren't looking directly at the windows, you would hardly notice there was a red light in each window. Rather pathetic. By contrast, the Christmas tree is easily seen. Each of the red LED lights on the tree are much brighter and easily seen. Not sure why the C7 replacement bulbs can't put out just as much light.. Was very disappointed, returned the LED bulbs and went back to the incandescent type. Maybe they'll be better next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant Grinder","review":"I spent a lot of time researching pepper grinders. My son, who loves to cook, wanted one for Christmas. I looked into all the supposedly 'top of the line' & 'highly recommended by the experts' grinders. Everytime I would walk into a store the Peugot was stated to be the best. But the people who really use the grinders weren't always giving the 'top of the line' ones good reviews. I finally settled on this one. Glad I did. First, it is an attractive & unique looking grinder...with the clear view of the pepper and the stainless exterior. My sons comments: \\"I really like it a lot. It is very easy to change to the different levels of grinding and a lot comes out. So, it is less work to get a lot of pepper out of it. Really like how it looks too. Not your typical pepper grinder!\\"Best part: MADE IN THE USA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Very nice grinder! the viewing window is really helpful to know when to fill it and the grinder has been very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"This worked beautifully when it was new. Not frequently used over about 1 1/2 years I have trouble moving the setting to coarse. It looks like the leaning tower of Pisa because at the plastic segment, the upper metal part now leans toward one side. I originally recommended that this item not be bought particularly in light of the price. However, I just learned that the manufacturer William Bounds offers a lifetime warranty on their mills. They promise to repair or replace at no charge other than shipping. This seems quite fair and I may change rating once I see how that works out. It's nice to know some companies still stand behind their products AND that they're made in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encyclopedia Brown - a good detective","review":"In \\"Encyclopedia Brown and the Case of the Two Spies\\" there are some brain twisting investigations.

It glosses over many important events and people who were instrumental to the development of the warrior & samurai class, without delving too much into anything. I think that the format of this entire series is more at fault than the author is; however, a more informative, detailed, and equally easy to read is Turnbull's \\"A Military History\\".The one thing which this book does cover very well is the armor, and Bryant probably does know what he is talking about, as he is an armor specialist. This mismatch between the very deep armor and the quite shallow history made me confused as to who the author's intended audience was supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first Bushi","review":"Osprey's Elite series run about 64 pages, which allow for a greater scope or more detail on a given subject. Although this title covers 1300 years (!), the subject is medieval Japan, so it is narrow enough. The evolution of Japanese body armor is worth the price alone. Surprisingly, there are no period illustrations. Photos and drawings of reconstructions are more than adequate, however. An extra long set of color plates by Angus McBride are, as always, wonderful. NO MAP???!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Herregud!, There goes Isak on his mule, let's watch!\\"","review":"This is an odd and depressing book. Far from Frank Norris or Jack London or Sinclair Lewis or authors intent to describe the homesteading life; there is no manifesto here. There is no bright definition between the good and evil, nor an epic struggle against the land and climate, nor a guerrilla war of one class against another. All the folks here get on rather well considering that two of the three women characters are murders and all of the men are but domesticated farm animals. More (or less) the book lacks even the basic description that would link the reader to the land; no colorful seasonal changes, no waves of migrating birds, no surf on the shore, no simple enjoyment of the earth as the day begins. No Steinbeck here. No Barry Lopez, no Ted Morgan. We have here the novel of the ruminants; grubbing, rutting, and wondering what it is all about. Put this book up in your medicine cabinet; try to read 20 pages whenever you cannot sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what life is about- simple pleasures and successes","review":"My friend received this book from someone when his father died- no note or card attached, just the book. A simple man who just wants to lead his own life- to exercise his right to be an independent person, not someone trapped by the demands of society. This is an enlightening book that is very centering. It reminds readers what life is really about."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the big ones...","review":"...yesirree. It starts as a simple tale and evolves into a modern narrative, weaving shifting points of view, moments of stream of consciousness, and a carry-you-forward narrative of simple rural economics evolving out of not so simple characters. I found this a great read, and for a long time afterwards, felt immersed in the landscape and the people. Isak is a true anti-hero, long before we knew the term. A provocative book in the best sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa!","review":"Remember Franz Stangl, Kommandant of the Treblinka Extermination Camp? This was his favorite book! Check it out.

A previous favourite had been the Schneiders' \\"Let's Look Under the City\\". These are older books with line drawing illustrations typical of the 1940's. You might think they would seem outdated but their basic explanations continue to be applicable today and well-suited to a young child's inquisitive mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"This production is a most have for any music lover.

The book was a real let-down in the sense I thought I'd be buying a tutorial and ended up with a paperweight. It gets two stars because it frankly IS a good desk reference if you have the program and several other tutorial books which do what this book had initially promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downright Deceptive","review":"Please think twice before buying this game. My daughter received this as a gift, and I have never been more disappointed in a game. The object of the game is to find another player whose cards show a term that matches a term on your cards. To do this, the players call out the terms on their cards, hoping to find another player with a match. The Bible terms are not defined; no player has to demonstrate a knowledge of the terms; there is no requirement that players determine the meaning of the terms; the players never learn the terms by playing the game. They could be calling out the names of automotive parts, for all intents and purposes! No learning occurs whatsoever. I think that the advertising for this game is just deceptive. Kids can shout out Bible terms until the cows come home, but unless they are learning something about them, what is the point?

After the study, the actual readings with the actual reading numbers as recorded by Cayce's secretary are listed. Those who have not studied Edgar Cacye's readings may find this book confusing, and may want to begin with \\"The Sleeping Profit\\" so they gain an understand of the readings, what the numbers represent, and how Cacye was but a vessel for mystical information to be revealed to mankind in this time and age. This book is not an easy read, and will take time to absorb the teachings.

You can argue with reason for or against many of Larouche's platforms on political economy. This book makes no attempt to do so. You can certainly take exception to Larouche's conspiracy theories, but his predictions of global financial chaos seem oddly prescient in 1998.

I recommend an introductory book in economics by LaRouche, \\"So, You Wish to Learn All About Economics?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of slanders and propaganda.","review":"Anyone serious who have read Larouche's articles before realize that Dennis King is lying out loud. The reader should look at Larouche's documentation which can be found at www.larouchepub.com and make his own conclusions.Also, I suggest to look more closely at the author (Dennis King) and who is behing him in this political attack. You will find out that Dennis King use to write for drug legalization magazine High Times and was financed by the Smith Richardson Foundation and the American Enterprise Institude to write his book on Mr. Larouche. These are organizations which promote a Clash of Civilizations policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Questionable Authority","review":"The book was interesting, in the sense that a novel or any other work of fiction is interesting, but it is not about LaRouche. Moreover, it is inaccurate in the (few) sections that seem to deal with his ideas in any way. Because it so grossly misstates LaRouche's ideas, it is of questionable authority in its coverage of the alleged inside workings of the LaRouche organization. People who are familiar with LaRouche's extensive writings should read this book, just to know what's out there -- but those who are not familiar with LaRouche should go directly to the source to encounter his ideas, and approach this book as a work of fictional entertainment. Your time will be better spent reading \\"A Program for Recovery\\", \\"So, You Wish to Learn All About Economics\\", and \\"Now, Are You Ready to Learn About Economics?\\".... LaRouche's theories are focused upon economics, culture and history. These are Topics that this book does not even begin to examine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanders, slanders and more slanders!","review":"I would give zero stars to this book if I could.

I read it at the library of the Swedish parliament, which has it as well as some books by LaRouche himself. dennis Kings book is insane. The swedish organisation of Lyndon LaRouche is filled with jews, africans and people from the middle east,and I understand that his international organisation is it as well! The swedish organisation of LaRouche is campaigning for the rights of Africa, Asia and the poor counties to free themselves from the european colonial tyranny. this proves that the author King is slandering the current presidential candidate LaRouche when he claims that he is a nazi and an anti-semite. Visit laRouches homepage instead and you will find that he is the opposite of what King claims him to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do you think the LaRouchies hate this book?","review":"This book is probably the best-researched book on the LaRouche cult to be published. The LaRouche cult has started many organizations over the years, basically to present different faces to the broad public. King's book tries to show how a charismatic leader could bring a communist cadre organization out of the student left, transform it into an opportunistic fundraising machine and cozy up to the fascist right in this country, all while purporting to be the cadre who would help save the world from the evil villains (as they identify them) of the moment. Clearly the book ends while the cult still survives behind various front organizations, so if you feel impressed with the LaRouchies, then do yourself a favor: before you commit your savings or make major career decisions on behalf of that group, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera with swords","review":"I thought maybe this would be a sexy story about hot female ninja's showing alot of T&A.

The rubber wristband works surprisingly well and is comfortable but I confess that it probably will be short if you are a big guy. I have not taken it much in the water but I do remember it being billed as water 'resistant' rather than 'proof' so keep that in mind.

Second, the collet could not hold onto the bit and on the fourth side of the groove, came completely out. Third, the plunge rods receivers have brass inserts; when i raised the router, the brass insert was just sitting at the base thumbing its nose at me.

I suspect that they will get it right one day, but wait until they advertise it with a sealed switch. If you make dust, this router is not for you. Dust gets into the slider tubes and prevents the collet from being fully raised (a great idea IMO that just needs a little refining). I use dust extraction but it isn't enough.

I can easily change bits from above the router table thanks to the ingenious design that extends the chuck above the table and simultaneously locks the spindle. The plunge spring was easily removed making for ease of use. I love the way the router can be quickly raised and lowered using the coarse & fine adjustment knobs without having to lift the router and plate out of the table.

A detailed account it definitely is. She sounds like an extraordinary person. My only hang up is this: she repeatedly emphasizes what a very private man her father is. Yet she is writing a book that tells of many events, conversations and disagreements that are of the utmost private nature. How does she justify doing such a thing? I am torn as to how I really feel about her memoir for this very reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read her father.","review":"I've had the book a while and am regretful and embarrassed to have actually purchased it. What made me decide to finally write a review was seeing Margaret Salinger on the Today Show this morning-- She's auctioning off personal letters her father has written to her in the past. Initially I bought the book because I was interested in knowing more about JD Salinger, like everyone else who bought the book. After reading the entire thing, I can't find a reason to sympathise or feel bad for Margaret yet. I personally have myself had a similarly distressed environment growing up, but instead of blaming anyone...I find it easier to be proud of myself for getting past it, without the need for people to know what I've gone through to do so. I'm sorry to say that I do not believe Margaret Salinger to have much pride, dignity, or respect for herself.

The story was all over the place and I'm still not too sure what kind of childhood Ms. Salinger had. There is a lot on the history of the Jewish people (which came across to me as \\"filler\\" to take up pages) if you're into history...I did come away feeling that she was a spoiled, over-educated rich kid who takes her precious highbrow education for granted.

I can't imagine betraying my own father like this. The writing is not that good, and at times I was embarrased to be reading it. You won't learn anything about Salinger that you would want to know.

I also developed an interest in the author, Ann Howard Creel and bought the book for my Kindle. As someone else has mentioned, the book is not quite as good as the film, but I think that's because the cast is so perfectly chosen for their parts in the show and we have Ms. Creel's comments about the cast of characters in the book. I did not find the subplot involving the two sisters to be unnecessary or lacking. But that may well be because I so liked them in the movie. Whatever, if you have not seen this movie, try your best to locate a copy. I highly recommend it to you.

Throughout the book the question arises: \\"Just who is our hero?\\" as even he himself does not know.

Apparently not to the manufacturer of this product: indeed note that they don't even claim that it resists breakage. So every little slip or bump in the sink and another storage container goes into the trash.

But they each wind up going in very different directions after the war as the country is thrown into a battle for independence while under the violent influence of both the United Kingdom and the Communists. While the 'Red Scare' theme is now outdated, its the 'soap opera' ending that kills this film most of all. As the credits roll, William Holden drives off in his white convertable to see the world after his girlfriend is hanged by the British for terrorist activities and it just doesn't work.

Having said that, the absolutely most appalling sentences in the book were when he described Jesse's very last moments on earth, and Rowe didn't know if he should hold hands with his child's mother, or put an arm around her. A stranger on the street would have been capable of acting more nobly and instinctively to comfort another suffering human being! This attitude pretty much sums up the entire book. Rowe's analysis of Jesse's drawings, movements and words are distorted by his apparently self centered attempt to win Jesse's love exclusively. If Jesse had more trouble than most children and teenagers with social interactions, it might be attributed to emotions often found in children of a bitter divorce living most of his life in two households.This book isn't much of the memorial to Jesse's life as his father would like the reader to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dado","review":"Tool cut a flat bottom and smooth sides.

Sandisk definitely knows that feeling for gamers of the Nintendo Wii. Their 2.0 GB Memory Cards are perfect for holding onto memory for Wii games like The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess, and Excite Truck. It is also good for storing data from games from the Nintendo gamecube library on the Wii, and classic games that you can download from the virtual console like Super Mario 64, and Bonk's Revenge from the classic Turbo Graphics 16 era. I definitely recommend this for anybody who has the need to Wii.Price: C+Convience: B+Overall: B-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Era of X-Men in Affordable Format","review":"I love this \\"phone book\\" format - I remember reading these and have since sold mucgh of my collection.

Once I started using this iron and told others about it they all bought them too and have been very happy with them. I now have 4 of this model of irons because I take them to quilting retreats for all the ladies to use. The retractable cords make them store well in a cubbard and easy to travel with.

I'm forever leaving water in it, even when it's off. Big mistake as it spits water, as well as the heating element doesn't work properly. Irons aren't made to take this abuse, and now I have to get another. However, I'll buy another just like this as I love the titanium finish on the soleplate.

My old iron lasted nearly 7 years and was still working after accidentally running it thru the washer with a load of laundry!!! I decided to buy this iron to replace my bruised and battered old iron which was STILL WORKING. I called Panasonic when it quit and they only warranty it for 1 year, and don't even sell replacement parts for it. I read online about 7 other people had the exact same issue with this iron. It's a piece of junk, DON'T BUY IT. I bought a $7 iron at Wal-Mart this morning because I decided it's not worth paying the extra money - Nothing lasts anymore. My $7 iron actually irons pretty good and at least I won't be thoroughly disgusted when it quits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective - never worked","review":"Wouldn't turn on at all.

This type where the plate vibrates smoothly a quarter inch or so and the Crazy Fit Massager type where the plate pivots from side to side at least a half inch or so. This one vibrates you gently. The other feels more like an aggressive shaking. Search on YouTube and you can see the difference. I am a Massage Therapist and own both and like them equally but they feel very different. Which is more effective depends on your body and what you are trying to achieve.The documentation on this unit is very good as apposed to the Crazy Fit which has a lot of interesting Chinese/English translations.

The book is loaded with the same slap-dash sense of humour and spontaneous action as found in the other SSR books, but this book's clever, well thought out plot puts it far above them.

Rick Baker's make-up effects and prosthetics are nothing less than amazing. It's dark, brooding and very atmospheric. I do not recommend the extended version, however, as it confuses the storyline slightly, and is really just overkill. The theatrical version is just right. Del Toro brings a pathos to the role that Chaney brought to the screen as a bit overwrought. Hopkins is very creepy, Emily Blunt is a suitable 'damsel in distress', and Hugo Weaving is perfect as Inspector Aberline. If you didn't like the original, or you're not a die-hard horror fan, you won't like it as much, but it will provide a good chill on a dark night. Also, the blu ray edition carries far more extras than the dvd, and the extra $ are worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"I have no idea what Anthony Hopkins was thinking when he agreed to this.

Hopkins and Del Toro were incredible. I was surprised at how much I liked this after reading all of the negative comments. Come on people!!

It starts off nicely enough, but started to unravel with a bad storyline and acting alike. The revelation about the mother, and the truth about the father just ruined the movie. For a classic and great werewolf movie, watch 'An American Werewolf in London'."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what I'd hoped it would be","review":"Pretty good blu-ray transfer.

It wasn't a terrible film, but one felt that there were just better things to do than sit there and watch this movie unfold. The CGI transformations from human into a werewolf were done really well though. Benedito Del Toro was barely passable in the leading role and caused the overall lack of interest in this viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-movie horror flick","review":"I can't say I was expecting much from this movie, but Wolfman disappointed. It comes across as a B-monster movie rather than something more. The focus is definitely on a monster killing people. The movie goes to pains to find odd and grotesque situations in which to disembowel a lot of people. However, this gets pretty boring. The scenes are uniformly dark and the acting dull. Simon Merrells is catatonic and Anthony Hopkins comes across as a joke. The only ray of light is Emily Blunt, who manages to look even sexier in 19th century wardrobe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled promise of a good show..","review":"Hopkins was good and so was del Toro. The scenes of violent animal mayhem were masterly done through special effect. But the story was too simplistic, the connection between scenes were hastily made and although Hollywood is all about \\"make believe,\\" this movie could not hide it, which is the matrk of a good movie anyway.There are several movies like that, and I guess any of them will do if you are interested about werewolves. I suggest you pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"my movie never loaded, never played and then they took it away from me, right in front of my eyes, do not rent from amazon, sherlock holmes didnt work either and they say that they dont do refunds for rentals? why not? i didnt get to see anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Awful It'll Leave You Howling","review":"There is almost nothing to recommend this outing. First, any hope that Benicio Del Toro might bring a touch of warmth or sympathy to the lead role of the tragic wolfman is dashed, almost from the instant he utters his first lines. Second, the contrived plot device used to explain the fact that everyone in the entire cast except Del Toro speaks with a British accent (sent away to America by his father at a young age) is so lame that it leaves one with the sneaking suspicion that it was a last-minute edit, inserted as soon as everyone figured out that Del Toro was simply never going to master a British accent with any consistency. Third, there is not the slightest chemistry between the tragic wolfman and Emily Blunt's character. Finally, the special effects were lifted straight from \\"An American Werewolf in London\\", only not as effectively. (Tidbit: Why the producers would miscast Benicio Del Toro so badly is explained as the credits roll: he was one of them.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly Hopkins' best showing ...","review":"Normally, I'd say that Anthony Hopkins could make melting ice interesting/suspenseful. This wasn't normal, so I'll choose to blame the script, the director, the phase of the moon, something. Yet another blue/grey CGI train chugging through a blue/grey CGI landscape. Have any of these people actually BEEN outside at dusk?I finished watching it last night, and I'm still waiting for a surprise.The acting was just OK. Hopkins was good, but it's been a long time since he was merely good.It'll be in the $5 bin at K-Mart soon enough. Watch it then."},{"rating":"1","title":"To put it gently...HORRIBLE! Waste of time and talent!","review":"Emily Blunt is the only good thing about this film. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that costume! I am not a Tweenie fan but in truth New Moon Special Effects blow this film away. That said, there is NOTHING special about this film! Benicio seems as if he is bored the entire film and would rather be doing something, anything else! Hopkins is just angry! Perhaps that he was stuck in this role? LOL! There is NO story, NO plot.**Spoilers**Benicio comes home after his Brother is murdered and becomes a werewolf and Emily Blunt kills him and you will laugh out loud at his death scene!! I just did for you what I wish someone had done for me. Saved you the agony of this pathetic remake.

I have watched it a few times now and will watch it from time to time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice character chemistry","review":"Some good plot twists and nice character chemistry among the actors in this movie. Maybe a bit overkill on some 'shock' features a time or two, but appropriate gore for wolf slashing. Worth the price and the time to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie","review":"This movie is so Great. I am a avid lover of horror movies and esp. the older ones. This movie is one of the best if not the best of the current age of horror movies, it is absolutely one that anyone that likes horror movies has to have for their collection. Superior action and effects. Not a dull moment. Perfect from the start to the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"epic fail","review":"How do you screw something like this up so bad? You have a classic story and the mist shrouded English moors make an inherently spooky locale, yet the movie is relatively scareless and the story has been turned into a furry Oedipal conflict. The main problem is that the script is awful and buckets of gore are substituted for chills throughout. Also, instead of being kept in the shadows, the monster is shown way too clearly towards the end and looks more like a pissed off pit bull than anything scary. The CGI is decent and the art direction and sets are really good, but good writing and well directed scares seemed to have been left off the agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BLU RAY TRANSFER!","review":"The film looks amazing on Blu Ray. I wish it was much longer. The directors cut does seem slightly better than theatrical version. My only cristism is the lack of Circus attack scene which is featured in the deleted the scenes. Also I wish there was a way to include the deleted, alternate scenes into the movie.A clever film with the right amount of suspense and fine performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent remake of a classic","review":"This movie isn't for everyone....if you grew up thinking the effects in Avatar were \\"to be expected\\" then you won't appreciate this movie. Rather than totally reinventing the old wolfman movie with Lon Chaney Jr. they tweaked it a bit, updated it a bit, fiddled with it and made an enjoyable homage. I think it is easy to see the Lon Chaney version, but with enough differences to keep it interesting. The greatest movie of the year??? IMHO no, but enjoyable none-the-less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Redo of a Classic!","review":"Even though we all know the story, you've never seen it like this! The actors are superb and believable, the special effects are incredible and we loved the Special Features section on the 2nd disc. Amazon's service can't be beaten--fast and economical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring!","review":"One of the most boring movies I've ever watched. I sat through the whole think and it was such a waste of my time. The effects are good, but the plot line and acting is seriously lacking. The previews oversold the movie and makes you think that there is going to be some exciting, action packed plot in store for you when in reality it's a dry, boring plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gorgeous Bite of Retro-Wolfsbane","review":"Admittedly there's something lacking here. Probably would have benefitted from more marauding through the alleyways and roofs of London. But once the initial growling disappointment wears off, reviewings should reward the attentive.What Wolfman lacks in narrative strength it more than makes up for in visual and audio riches.Surely one of the most beautifully shot horror movies of all time. And takes Sleepy Hollow's fogbound production design up a couple more notches. Likewise, the creepy, subtle sound design deserves close attention throughout. Credit and thanks to Johnson, Heinrichs, Murch, Elfman, et al. And, of course, a cast and director that try their best to bring it all off.Better luck next time?As usual, too many scriptwriters spoil the plot, so it doesn't howl at the moon fully enough. Curse them! Pity that. But just listen to the gypsy on this one, have a few drinks, and enjoy your visit to Talbot Hall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic surfaces and breathes new life into the myth.","review":"I thought this re-make was directed and produced rather well. Benicio Del-Toro portrays Laurence Talbot with a bit of symbolic reverence to the mythological aspect of man vs his inner demons, or a fierce bloodthirsty beast,-his past plays into the intricate cinematic elements that showcase his relationships with the world around him, namely his father and the ultimate confrontation between good and evil that develops as the movie goes on. But like all battles between good and evil, it never ends, atleast in the movies. If you like the classic movie monsters and have a genuine respect for movies in general, you'll like this. I give it 4 stars. Bloody good fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"werewolf with an Oedipus complex","review":"I hate to admit it, but I liked this better than the original Larry Talbot, which I had watched last week. This film has all the atmosphere, all the feverish guilt and anguish at fate, all the gory action. The great difference is that the actors are uniformly superlative, not second-raters like Lon Chaney, Jr. Of course, the effects are also superior. Finally, the plot of the story diverges significantly from the original, which makes it stand on its own as something new, with somewhat richer themes than the original. In particular, the psychologies of the various characters are complex and almost deep, which is great fun.TO say anything more would reveal too much. I recommend this with enthusiasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLAST FROM THE PAST","review":"I loved this movie, and wasn't sure I would based of the reviews. It really did harken back to the B&W Universal Horror Movies of the 40's (and the uncut version even sports the 1940's Universal Trade mark spinning glass glove at the start). Visually - it is stunning. The rooftop views of old London were breathtaking, and the FOG! That great FOG seen in so many of the old classic movies!! Fantastic. Loved the acting, and loved the fact that it was truly a good old fashioned horror movie. Even the red titles in the opening credits are the same font used in several 40's Universal Horror movies. Lots of fun - and yes, scary! Loved it! Now, if they could only re-make Dracula the same way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big letdown.","review":"The director's cinematography wonderfully embraced the classic style of horror films with haunting landscapes & sets, even the \\"transformation\\" is cool. And although Del Toro looks creepy, its hard to find any of the actors believable and it was ever explained why the father hated his own son. Not to mention the howling never ceased to be simply cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wolfman Blu-ray Digital Copy Expired","review":"Why Amazon.com is selling a blu-ray with expired digital copy authorization code and not advise customers about it?

The setting in Victorian england, a woman who keeps a diary and is the love interest of the main character and who dresses in one scene almost exactly as winona ryder did when she was writing in her movie, the protagonist gets attacked in bed, anthony hopkins, a very similar death scene at the end of both movies, a rounded podium lecture hall, an insane asylum.. there probably is a lot more. I will admit that since this is a horror movie there are bound to be similarities of course, but still.. Bram Stoker's Dracula was done much better than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was fortunate enough to be sort of a captive audience for this movie. I watched it on a Trans Pacific Flight. Glad I did in the sense that I didn't pay to view it and fortunately didn't buy it. I thought about buying the Blu Ray version sight unseen a couple of days before the trip but had second thoughts. Glad I didn't buy the DVD. The plot was to slow and tedious the special effects were good and of course HD enhances that.An American Werewolf in London and the follow on An American Werewolf in Paris were both much better, the original with Lon Chaney was also very good when compared to this film. Some people did like the film and that is what makes the world go around, others including myself didn't like the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooring","review":"In recent years there have been a lot of horror re-makes. I have liked some, but most should have been left alone in my opinion, the original being far superior. I waited for Wolfman with great anticipation to come out on DVD (I never go to the theater) and to sum up the film in two words; predictable and dull. Watching this movie is like watching paint dry on a wall. I was able to guess what the characters were about to say and what they were about to do. I only gave it two stars because of Anthony Hopkins which is about the only redeeming quality of the whole thing. I am very glad I only spent the $4.00 to rent this one and that I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it up!","review":"Way more graphic than it needed to be. Slow storyline.

I can't remember the name of a single character, probably because none of them had any. There was absolutely no chemistry between the Wolfman and his love interest; why the Scotland Yard inspector was there and what his role was is anybody's guess; the Wolfman's stay in the asylum was a joke, complete with the most cliche sadistic wardens and the dumbest psychiatrist (complete with German accent, of course) you can imagine.Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An honest Review","review":"Don't buy this.

An unfortunate soul who has been bitten by the Wolf-Man.The resemblance to Lon Chaney, by Benecio Deltoro, is wierd and makes this film pop for older horror film buffs.The story line is also magnetic, your senses are assailed on several levels at the same time, and they all merge to provide the viewer with a authentic trip to the movies.The music, the dark tone of the visual, the sympathetic emotion, that is drawn form the viewer, are magnified here by the special effects.I could go on but it will be better if you watch it for your self.ENJOY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda just boring.","review":"I was surprised by how boring this was. It wasn't tense or scary, the special effects weren't particularly good, and the acting was subpar for almost every character. The only touch of life is Hugo Weaving, and those few scenes are so short that you'll barely have time to register interest. If you're going to watch this, be sure to rent, and even then you should probably wait for a sale weekend when it's about a buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howling Good Fun","review":"OK, I know, the story's a little hairy but if you're a sucker for a good werewolf flick this IS the movie for you. We've all heard the bad reviews so I won't revisit those (some are valid). This film is visually sumptuous and the werewolf transformations are top notch (Del Toro is halfway there anyway). Lets just say the relationship between Lawrence and Gwen was doomed from the beginning because she didn't like the pack that he ran with. Gotta go, I'm gonna go wolf down a burger...rare."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't a werewolf! It's a \\"wolf man.\\" Disappointing!","review":"Yet to see a movie that shows believable werewolf transformation that will surpass An American Werewolf in London and the Howling. The werewolf in this movie is insulting to people suffering with hypertrichosis (werewolf syndrome) and thus enabling further mockery and fear to those suffering the afore mentioned syndrome. A modern movie made in a high tech world with such a poorly created werewolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"wolf man finally killed","review":"Tha Wolfman and Silver Bullit had alot more exciting bits than this movie.

Madeleine Stowe was very captivating. The movie in itself may have seemed boring to most, but if you look past there only being two people in the movie with one set, the movie was quite watchable. Alan Rickman although being the interigator was very screen worthy in this movie. The scene where he was more than 2 people was amazingly well done. The movie in itself although disturbing in one level is a very interesting movie. I recomend it to anyone. To most people this is a disturbing film. It was for me. But it is worth watching. I give it 4 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too disturbing for me!","review":"the acting was very good but i really don't see why they made this movie!All it does is make you uncomfortarble and have nightmares for the next whole week.The movie makes you feel Madeliene Stowe's pain (and for me that's not very good) th plot is very weak,there is basically no point for this movie to have been made.What's even more surprising is that Ron Howard and Brian Grazer were brave enough to be the executive producers for this movie.I can see why this movie got bad reviews!I will admit that this movie is good in some catergories but they just don't stand out in this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Closet Land - Let it stay in the closet","review":"I'm a die hard Alan Rickman fan, BUT this movie is extremely disturbing to watch. I won't deny that the acting is good, considering the storyline. But it is VERY hard to watch. The suggestion of torture and how the interrogator plays with his *victim* just made my skin crawl.

Because it lacks a topstrap (not necessary for this little light) it can be worn around the neck until needed, but it's so comfortable that I can wear mine while sleeping - you might forget you have it on if you're wearing it over a hat or balaclava. Produces a uniform, soft edged spot 2 to 3 feet wide, 1' to 1-1/2' high at 10 feet. Emits white light with a slight blue tint. No focusing + no angle adjusting = no fiddling. Switch is stiff, but shouldn't accidentally turn on while carrying in the pack. Great for emergencies; like when you're ending your \\"day hike\\" and the bats are flying over the trail. If you're overly cautious, carry it as a backup to your more powerful, heavier halogen. Not heavy duty enough for climbing or caving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junky switch + Great light = One Heck of a Problem","review":"It's true (as many before me have said) that the switch is pure hell.

HOW CAN A LABEL RELEASE SHORTENED VERSIONS OF GREAT SONGS ON A GREATEST HITS ALBUM--WHAT A SCAM! DON'T LET YOURSELF BE SCAMED TOO. DON'T BUY THIS CD.

They could've added a lot more songs to this greatest hits album, such as \\"Out of Control\\" from BOY, \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" from WAR, \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" from UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, \\"One Tree Hill\\" from JOSHUA TREE (probably my FAVORITE U2 song ever!), and \\"In God's Country\\" from JOSHUA TREE. Not a bad greatest hits album but could've been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the double album, throw away disc one","review":"This album also comes as a double album with disc two containing mostly B-sides. U2 fans will probably have most of disc one in their collection already. Disc two yields some nice surprises with catchy tunes which for reasons best known to themselves & their record company weren't included on their albums. I guess they just kept these for a rainy day- beats me, most of them are good enough to be on any U2 album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"From the cradle to the grave...\\"","review":"The Best of 1980-1990 by U2 is an ok greatest hits album but some songs are not included such as One. Bono has a great voice and the band has written some incredible music over the years. All I Want Is You, With or Without You, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, The Sweetest Thing, and Pride are the standout tracks here. This CD could have been stronger for fans, oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"not perfect","review":"When I bought this compilation I already owned Boy, Unforgettable Fire, War, October, Joshua Tree, and Rattle and Hum but all on cassette so I bought this so I could have the best songs on CD.

If you are a U2 fan or even if you just like the hit \\"Pride\\" you won't go wrong getting it. Several well known hits and a few not as well known good songs.

Although I recommend that sooner or later you buy every U2 album, this is a good one to start out with. I love every song on this album, (\\"Pride, In the Name of Love\\" is simply the best rock song ever recorded), but I wish they included two tracks from \\"Rattle and Hum\\" that really rock \\"Hawkmoon 269\\", and \\"God Part 2\\". When buying this album buy along with it the best album of the 90's \\"Achtung Baby\\", you will see how U2 has developed through the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for casual fans, 4 for diehards","review":"For the casual fan, this CD is quintessential U2. It has all the songs a casual fan could want (except for those songs after 1990--with the exception of 1998's awesome single \\"Sweetest Thing\\"--thrown in as a bonus). It also has a hidden track \\"October\\" to make up 15 solid tracks that are worth every penny. The sound quality is great; and for diehards, the Limited Edition CD is a better investment because it features a CD of hard-to-find B-Sides for only a few dollars more. Either one is a sound investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointing and predictable","review":"As if we needed further proof that U2's vision is lost and foundation is shaky, along comes \\"The Best of...\\", complete with an edited version of New Year's Day ( all those new fans won't know the difference now, will they?). The remake of \\"Sweetest Thing\\" left me wishing Bono would leave his vocal exercises in the shower. One has to wonder why almost no songs from \\"October\\" were included;not even \\"Gloria\\". Perhaps U2's new audience wouldn't appreciate the overt references to God on \\"October\\"; then again, perhaps U2 don't. Just about the only saving grace for this album is the surprise inclusion of \\"October \\" at the end of the disc, which is virtually the only reason this album gets one star in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE OVERVIEW","review":"How can we have a cohesive overview when a whole LP (October) is practically ignored?? (The title song reduced to a 'hidden' track). I'm thinking that \\"Gloria\\", the non LP \\"Celebration\\", and other worthy contenders were left off so we have to buy the inevitable box set. Shame on U, U2."},{"rating":"1","title":"From A Newbie","review":"Having never heard a U2 song before, I bought this album simply for its \\"historical significance\\" to the music industry. I was both surprised and dissapointed at its content.\\"Pride\\" sounds like something out of a nursery rhyme,but it grew on me after a while. \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" rank as two of my favorite songs ever. And I thought \\"I still haven't found what i'm looking for\\" and \\"Where the streets have no name\\" were dandy, but that was pretty much the end of the surprises.\\"Bad\\", \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", and \\"I will Follow\\" are three of the worst songs I've heard. The last four songs sound like used car advertisments.Verdict: Buy \\"The Joshua Tree\\", and possibly \\"War\\" because the rest of this CD, besides \\"Sweetest Thing\\", is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"commercial mess","review":"Still in shock I gave it 2 stars - this release should have been much bigger - Boy, War, UF are in of themselves a \\"Best of\\" and slightly under represented in my humble opinion - if you like Joshua and post release material this pup's for you otherwise if you're younger than 28 you probably have no idea what the heck I'm talkin about - don't waste your money - go out and buy the real deal - I'll wait for the boxset I guess..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you must buy a 'best of' then this is OK ......","review":"..... but a 'best of' will always be a very personal choice. I first saw U2 at The Limit Club in Sheffield, UK in 1980 along with about 14 others and since that time have thought of U2 as one of the best bands in the world. Nearly all of U2's albums are worth 5 stars, I would recommend anyone to buy 2 or 3 albums rather than this. My 'best of' tape is far better than this, at least I think so.But if you are only going to buy one U2 album then this is OK.Having read some of these reviews I must take issue with some of you. I have just played my New Years Day 7'' vinyl single (remember those) and it's exactly the same as the version on this CD. I would guess that the tacks on this CD are the singles versions, and this is forgivable."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL, ABSOLUTELY!

This Best of is not for me. But...for those of you just discovering U2 for the first time, you must begin with this disc. Then move on to each CD itself. The difference between U2 and the bands of today is that U2's best songs were never released as singles or played much on the radio. You'll find them all in the heart of each album and as B-sides to their singles. Consider this a starter kit, then discover later, Boy, October, War and Unforgettable Fire (their 4 best)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few good selections for casual fans...","review":"There are quite a few good selections on this album, and it makes for a nice collection for those who are casual fans of U2, or you're like me (a fan who's trying to find all of the really nice early songs) but those who live and breathe U2 won't find anything here, except possibly the lack of some favorite tracks.

U2 in my opinion is the best band in the world. The lyrics that Bono writes are like no other song writer out there. He writes about real life situations and U2 is always knows how to bring style to music. If there's one \\"Greatest Hits\\" album you want to buy, let it be U2 the best of 1980-1990. It features songs like \\"I Will Follow\\" which is why they are so well known....But Don't take my word for it listen for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It depends on which \\"U2 era\\" you consider yourself","review":"This CD gives a good overview to a new or casual listener. I detected a \\"break\\" within the CD which represents 2 different periods in their music. Tracks 1-8 are early U2, so if you are into that period, it should give you an idea about their early music. The same goes for Tracks 9-14, which is their later period and the tunes become a lot more pop than rock. I happen to like the early period, so I stop listening to the CD by Track 8. Almost all songs are in their different albums, and each is fairly representative of the kind of music for each album. If you like \\"early\\" U2 tunes, I recommend \\"October\\", \\"Boy\\" and \\"War\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Original Albums Instead","review":"How could they put out a best of U2 without \\"GLORIA\\"? I wish they would release the original recordings and not monkey around with them. Just like the best of the Police album, this collection is almost unlistenable to long time, passionate U2 fans. Buy the original albums instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original recordings are better","review":"I usually would not take the time to review something I was not all that enthusiastic about, but as an ardent U2 fan I felt obliged to inform the potential buyer of the flaws of this CD. My main problem is that the producers mess with the originals to the point of irritating the listener (i.e., me): a whole verse of \\"New Years Day\\" is chopped out, the beginning and end of \\"Where the Streets have no name\\" are shortened, a section of Bad is missing. These things irritate those of us who know and have loved this music for almost twenty years. I also don't think the inclusion of four songs from R and H was justified. One surprise - \\"October\\" appears unannounced at the end. Anyway, buy the originals. They're all worthy of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuando U2 sí eran Clásicos","review":"Un gran Best Of para una gran década ( la mejor de U2 en mi opinión ).

However, like most compilations, there is the odd track that has been missed out, and you wonder why. You have to buy the limited edition compilation with B sides to obtain the excellent remake of 'Everlasting love'. Back in 1990, that song received more airplay than the A side 'Desire' here in Australia. The album is still true history highlighting U2's early days with tracks such as 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' through to recent hit 'Sweetest Thing'. U2 haven't been able to match their impressive 1991 album 'Achtung Baby' in my opinion, but this compilation covers the best of the earlier albums up to 1990. Bono has a very distinctive voice, and seeing them live in concert Sydney 1993 proved what a great band live they are too.

This is U2 Lite. A lot of great songs on All That You Can't Leave Behind isn't on this disc. SOngs like 'Kite', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' were the staple songs of the Elevation tour. I can't believe 'Running To Stand Still' isn't included on this disc, but well, this greatest hits collection is what got me hooked onto U2. So obviously it's worth the purchase. Because if you don't like the stuff on this CD, chances are you won't like U2.One note though; October is included on this collection. Fast forward a little bit after All I Want Is You (The last track) and you'll hear it.

The books are the same, with some new material. Much of the new book is word-for-word identical to the old book, page after page. Nowhere does the publisher say this - not on the front cover, on the back cover, or in the introduction. Instead, the publisher seems to have tried to trick readers who bought the first book into buying the second book. An honest publisher would have called the new book \\"2nd edition\\" or \\"Revised edition\\". I encourage authors to revise and improve their old books, but not to trick readers into thinking they've written an entirely new book.--Review by Thomas David Kehoe, author of \\"Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful in uncovering deeper dynamics of relationships","review":"This book shed light on patterns that I have been acting out but couldn't see with an objective perspective, particularly the parent/child dynamic. I am sure that I will be noticing these patterns much sooner now. This book also provided significant insight into how I have been sabotaging relationships by my aversion to anger and how this has restricted the flow of energy in my life.

Similar to the Beatles Christmas messages these songs span and exemplify JB's evolving style over the decades. I've played the whole album every Christmas eve for the last 10 years while wrapping presents. \\"Santa's Got a Brand New Bag\\" was somehow lost during my divorce.

The author clearly recounts her dogged rise to screen stardom, her stormy marriages, and her often contradictory actions and statements. Many of the murkier incidents in the actress's life (namely the mysterious death of her second husband) are closely examined. Davis' acting, and the relative worth and importance of her many films get short shrift, but as a standard biography of a film star, Spada's book is quite solid. It's probably best read in tandem with Davis' autobiography, \\"The Lonely Life\\", and the memoir \\"Mother Goddam\\" to which she contributed notes and addendum. A more entertaining account of Davis, with better analysis of her films, is Lawrence Quirk's fan-oriented \\"Faster Your Seatbelts: The Tempestuous Life Of Bette Davis.\\" Now, that book is truly a joy to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut and Paste job disguised as a Biography","review":"This is one of the worst biographies I have ever read.

The book is full of factual errors such as saying that Davis won a Best Supporting Actress Emmy Award for \\"Strangers, the Story of a Mother and Daughter\\", when in actuality, Davis won the Emmy for Best Actress. The author makes every effort to portray Davis as a saint, B.D. as the enemy and then reverts to Davis as the enemy, B.D. as the saint and back and forth.

So much pathos and so much wisdom have not been seen in an American novel since MOBY DICK. The intelligence brought to bear in Wolfe's understated and brilliantly layered book lies somewhere between Dickens and Joyce, with a little Shakespearean flair thrown in for good measure. Wolfe's primary topic here is memory and its effects (causality?) on human existence, and the shaping of human existence by story. Layered and interlocking stories relate the life of the narrator, and significantly, the stories merge together, the boundary between stories becoming increasingly blurred as the book winds down. It is, in essence, The Book of the Dead (and here is the significance of the title), telling the tales of the dead, so that they ultimately rest in Peace. It is not an easy read, but one which patient readers will treasure and hold dear--and reread incessantly--forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I missed this one...","review":"Seems many people hail \\"Peace\\" as a classic, a hidden gem, and as much as I love Wolfe, I had to put this down 35 pages in.

Maybe it got better eventually, but I'll probably never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient Closed Captions","review":"Even though this film is advertised as embedded with closed captions, they are much too far and few between.

Coleman first became famous for his solo on \\"Body & Soul\\" (not on this album). The only tune you'll recognize is \\"Laura\\", but it doesn't make any difference. The music is superb.

In a nutshell: starfleet wants to disect Data for nefarious purposes. Picard convinces old flame to hold hearing to establish Data's personhood. Old flame assigns Riker to represent starfleet. (When Riker tries to refuse, she threatens to declare Data a toaster.) Hearing ensues... I was impressed when I saw this first-run and I'm STILL impressed. \\"Measure of a Man\\" asks the question: \\"What defines sentience?\\" But it also asks the more profound question: \\"What defines humanity?\\" The hearing is both touching and thought-provoking. I found myself wondering if *I'd* be declared sentient under the same circumstances. Spiner's performance gives Data a gentle dignity and compassion that just shines. Too many great lines to list. Stand-out scene when Riker removes Data's arm at the hearing and says: \\"I'm sorry.\\" A must-have for all TNG fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, if not the best Data episode of all time.","review":"Data is thrust into a trial to determine whether or not he is Starfleet property, or a living being with the same rights to life as all other Starfleet officers.

Director Mizushima's (of Fullmetal Alchemist fame) vision for this series was very ambitious, as the staff discuss in one of the extras, but it pays off in a big way.There are a large number of characters, but the designs and colors make it fairly easy to tell who's who, so this is a good place to start for someone who's never seen a Gundam season before.If you're a fan of mecha, drama, action, and good storytelling, you owe it to yourself to check this series out."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother","review":"Some nice writing and photos in some ways these books are not dated, but I would look for a newer book if I was serious about climbing there"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"\\"When I want a melodyLilting through the houseThen I want a melodyBy Strauss\\"Especially at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petzl E68 Duo LED Headlamp","review":"I'v been on 2 marathons so far since buying this headlamp, and it is the first to, not only stand up to, but excell at the harsh conditions anything that goes along on one of my night time uphill endurance WC marathons has to.

One thing to remember is that this is an entire album of B-sides to singles and outtakes from other projects. Even so, while some tunes are very abstract, and some are re-writes or remixes of others that have appeared on other albums, the project as a whole is well executed. Containing material from both Orzabal as a solo TFF, or with Curt Smith, this is a valuable addition to your collection. Also, there are 18 cuts and Orzabal gives liner notes on each cut, along with history, and flashbacks about how each came to be - that's invaluable information for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"Until I purchased this CD, I always said that I'd buy any Tears for Fears recording on faith.

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not necessarily strictly for only fans","review":"Usually a b-sides album is considered a must have for true fans of an artist or band. This time, it is not necessarily so. Sure there are quirky instrumental tunes that only devout TFF fans will enjoy but there are so many hidden treasures on this album. First, the amazing cover of David Bowie's \\"Ashes To Ashes\\" is fanatastic. Roland sings the first couple of lines so close to Bowie that it is hard, at first, to distinguish the original from the cover. Second, \\"Lord of Karma\\" was originally the b-side to \\"Laid So Low\\". At the time of its original release, I would constantly play this song on my college radio station. It should have been a single, rather than a b-side. Third, \\"The Way You Are\\" was never available in the US (it was a single in the UK)until now. It is repetitive but catchy as hell. This b-sides album is definitely a cut above the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grew on me","review":"At first I really had a hard time with this CD. Then, it truly grew on me.

The unique design of the handle prevents you fron seeing the blade as you try to follow a line. You have to depend on the flimsey plastic quide to follow a line. I have not broken the plastic guide yet because I have been very careful to protect it, but it could break very easily. Changing the blade is a real chore. The clearances between the guard and sole plate make it extremely difficult to install a 7 1/4\\" blade. I actually have to warp the blade to get it inserted.

(And yes, Catholics are Christians, contrary to some misinformed opinions.)As occasional entertainment, where the players play good characters, D&D has its merits. Playing in that way is not inconsistent with devotion to Jesus Christ; the greatest danger is that, in playing it, you not be spending your time in a way that best advances God's kingdom. Thus the need for moderation . . .

A few of the publishers higher-up employees ARE admitted occultists (they admit it).But D&D; really doesn't contain occult info or encourage the dabbling in any real occult practices.I certainly don't think the reviewer who said this was just a moneymaking scheme on the part ofthe author was warranted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, and this guy ever read a book other than the Bible","review":"It's not that Christians in general misunderstand the game.

Perfect.After watching the AOL Sessions videos, I'm convinced that these girls have staying power. While artists in the same vein, such as Avril Lavigne and Michelle Branch have great futures, Jess and Lisa have each other to lean on, especially strong because they are twins. You can tell just by watching them together how close they are, and can just imagine that one will always make sure the other doesn't falter.This debut album is pop rock at its best. There's nothing very original here, but what they play, they play great. And the backup band is also very good.For most of the year, Natalie Imbruglia and Coldplay were 1 & 2 on my top 3 album list of 2005. The Veronicas pushed them down to 2 & 3.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Sales Rank: #622 in Music","review":"I think this album shows Jess+Lisa can make the vocals of just about any song as good as they can be.Ultimately this album is only as good as the songs on it, which I think are on the whole good, but not outstanding.Relative to my personal preferences, I rate the tracks as: Excellent:(1,2,9,11), Good:(3,4,7,10), Ok:(5,14), Weak:(6,8,12,13).I had trouble appreciating the songs as much when listening to them one after another rather than separately.As far as I can tell The Veronicas do not have a particular \\"sound\\" I can identify, so it would be difficult for me to recommend the album based on that; it seems more like a sampler of what Lisa+Jess can do, which I think is a lot; I think they are great, and I hope to hear more from them; if I could give them a rating it would be an enthusiastic \\"*****\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it's good for babe pop!","review":"I liked Mouth Shut and Secret.

Reisner is simply the better writer. His book is more of a story than \\"Rivers of Empire,\\" and reads that way, as well as having the broader and more updated coverage.Indeed, with an older-style typeface (at least in hardcover), Worster's book looks much more dated.For somebody new to this subject, this is still a very solid four-star book.

I rolled my eyes several times at how bad everything was, everything I listed above and whatever else you can think of that I messed. Frankly, I don't want to spend another minute thinking about it.

The movie opens with a bar tender taking a girl to a house where she is killed and eaten raw. We then go to the credits and three people show up at the same house wanting to hunt for ghosts...which they find. The cannibals are ghouls, trapped inside the house.

Usually I can look at the cover and tell if the movie is any good or not, because most good movies put alot of effort into their artwork! So I took a chance and bought this DVD because I am trying to build my collection! What a waste of money! The movie was terrible as well as the acting! It was shot on a cheap camera, and it was a waste of time putting it on blue ray!!! if I were you I wouldn't waste my money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO SO BAD!","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. This film is so so low budget. Why was this even put on blu-ray. For what reason? It still looks like crap. The picture looks terrible. The special effects are the worst I ever seen, if you want to call them special effects. Everything looks so fake. There isn't any reason to buy this movie. Save your money and your time. I got this for $4.99 at F.Y.E. on sale, and now I can see why. After I watched it, I immediately gave the movie to a friend who just got a blu-ray player, and is trying to start up his collection. He thanked me for the movie, but that was before he viewed it. No matter how cheap you see this movie for, don't buy it. It definitely wasn't worth the $4.99 I paid for it. The most this movie is worth is maybe $1.00, and that is only if you need a replacement blu-ray case, if you have one cracked. If you do, use the case, and toss the disc and artwork away.

I think she may be a little biased towards the guerrillas - however, in most of the cases she presented, I think you'll find it reasonable to see why.Even if you are not in this field at all, but want to understand more of what goes on in the background of policy - namely, by the \\"little guy,\\" then I think anyone will enjoy the topics O'Leary presents for your ponder.

We are out another $100 and the bed STILL SUCKS!!!!We have tried to make this bed work for nearly a year and are finally giving up. As many have stated - we purchased this bed because we wanted a nice looking platform bed with drawers. Well, the drawers do not align to the bed, breakdown with very little weight put in them, it creaks and groans, feels like we are sleeping at an angle with dips in various places.....it is just the worst bed I have ever owned.Going to have to just throw it away - or maybe it will make great firewood for our fireplace - and buy another bed.BUYER BEWARE - do NOT buy this bed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I am used to purchasing Sauder-like products only to have them fall apart within a matter of days, and this one is a step above. The bed and headboard are higher quality products and were very easy to assemble. You can tell the boards are press-wood, but it extremely dense and doesn't give or crack easily like I've seen happen with lower quality items. One complaint is that, to save on space, I tried to open things one box at a time and build the main bed prior to digging out the drawers. Packaging would not allow it, as I discovered the screws and such were divided between two containers, but not divided so they matched the containers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bed but missing pieces and no answers from amazon!!","review":"The bed is great and from what I saw not very difficult to put together the main problem is that there were missing pieces for two of the droors and when I emailed Amazon I didn't get a response at all!!

You will want to watch this film a number of times so that you can understand all the social commentary, and it will entertain you each & every time. But don't let the noise distract from the core message - Mexico is a sexually maturing country that still has some learning before its masses can reach a place of honest, functional sex. The maturing teenage boys represent the country's sexual culture which has recently gone from overly closed & conservative to extremely open & disfunctional, the older European women represents the happy medium of functional, guilt-free open sex. I am sure that in a few decades, social historians will see this film as a watershed experience in Mexican sexual life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y tu mama tambien","review":"I turned this off shortly after the first sex scene.

Of course we are treated to some graphic scenes with our \\"heroes\\" (?) engaging in sex with their girlfriends as the film begins. The stupid cousin in law, for reasons that are downright blasphemous (as the ending makes clear) ignorantly goes on the road with the hormone-filled but brainless teens and has the nerve to get disgusted midway with the predictable results.Pure trash with a capital T. Not a sympathetic character anywhere in sight.

Once again, the sex here is sanitized. Some bad feelings to be sure, and yet, a fantasy land of no venereal disease, no AIDS, no pregnancy, and no abortion. The story, with all its explicitness, is empty and ultimately very separated from reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing has destroyed this great film","review":"I bought the R rated version of this movie from Amazon after borrowing the film from my local Blockbuster in Australia. I loved the library copy enough to want to own a copy of my own - only to find that the American R certificate version had been so badly edited that the sense of the film had been lost. Yes, the original film is erotic and confronting; the American R certificate version leaves much of the nudity but deletes some crucial footage. For example, in the climactic scene at the beach once the long journey is over, the kiss between Julio and Tenoch ends up on the cutting room floor! Without this, the tension of the following scenes is inexplicable. Try to buy the original and enjoy the whole film. It's refreshingly different, sad and clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!! Gael and Diego are cute!","review":"Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna are both great actors in my opinion. They are also both handsome, but in different ways. I liked Gael in Amores Perros and Motorcycle Diaries. And I liked Diego in The Terminal and Dirty Dancing 2. I really love this movie even though the ending is kinda sad. My favorite line in the movie is when Louisa tells the boys \\"You have to make the clitoris your best friend\\". I saw that in a magazine once as one of the sexiest movie lines of all time. The music is also very good. I'm thinking about buying the soundtrack. If you can't decide whether or not to get it, you should. It's a good, fun road trip movie. It's real. It's sexy. It's just a good movie.

I found both to be extremely bad. My feeling is that this is a softcore film for girls, where you get tons of shots of the two male characters, and the narrator's commentary tries to make you feel as if it were an art film. Definitely not worthy. Coming of age? See The Graduate. Want to see upper class Mexico? Watch Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole new world opening up","review":"Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN is yet another example (like AMORES PERROS) of how the films from Mexico have a unique style that is maturing rapidly. The pace of this tour de force of the effects of testosterone on young lads is breathless, so much so that the viewer yearns for the moments of stillness that do come and are all the more poignant for there role as relief. Much praise has been heaped on this film and I think for the most part it is well deserved. There is not the sophistication of the films from Spain, but there IS a sense of experimentation, go-for-broke effect that just feels right. This film is graced by the beauty of Maribel Verdu (perhaps the fact that she is from Spain adds to her level of sophisication) but the gleam comes from Gael Garcia Bernal who once again, as in AMORES PERROS, reveals a young actor with explosive screen presence and who gives every indication that he is a star in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexual, unique","review":"If you're looking for something controversal and fearless, \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\" is the movie to watch. I have great respect for movie producers who are not afraid to push the censorship limits. This producer should do this more often. That way we can have more quality movies like this. Its screenplay keeps your eyes wide open the whole time. You'll always want to know what happens next. I'll warn you, everytime you'll think you've seen the most extreme scene part, the next one will go further. It continues to become more unique as well.If you find graphic sexuality and sexual conversation disturbing, you may want to watch another movie. If this controversy attracts you(like me), this is the movie for you. You will not be disappointed, I'll guarantee it. If you're not into subtitles, then just the visual scenes will keep you watching, or you'll look beyond it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie of the Year","review":"I finally got to see this one and it was absolutely ... AWFUL!!! As a Mexican American I can honestly tell you that this one is an embarrasment to Mexican Cinema and its efforts to bring great work to the U.S. It is as though somebody brought to life Beavis and Butthead in Spanish. Y Tu Mama Tambien suffers from no real plot other than two spoiled brats waiting to get laid and stoned. If the film isn't insulting enough then try the degrading Spanish only pathetic attempt at a Director Commentary section. Don't expect the director to give you any insight into this stink bomb just be forewarned that the actors continue to talk trash about the female protagonist's body. I am extremely disappointed in this one and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE!!!! GO WATCH \\"Real Women Have Curves\\" now, that's INTELLIGENT and Funny!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another teen-angst movie","review":"It was OK I guess. The sex was pretty mild and disappointing, after reading all the hoopla. Maybe shocking in the prudish US, but on an absolute scale, there's little sex or nudity really in there, even in this unrated version. That Americans think this is a sexy movie says more about themselves than it does about the movie.This is basically just another teenagers-grow-up movie. Probably will be of interest to those under 30; over 30, forget it. (You can tell which side of that I'm on, ha ha!)The puerile machismo and chauvinism of the two young men was irritating, but perhaps not unusual for the age and culture. It would have been satisfying to see them begin to grow out of it by the end of the movie, but that doesn't happen.What happened to Luisa at the end was a cheap shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply disappointed....juvenile trash","review":"I was sucked into all the hype about this movie which is perhaps one reason I was so disappointed.

I ended up donating my copy to the local public library because I knew I'd never watch it again. Big on farting jokes....jerk-off jokes....boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was OK","review":"Totally not worth the hype. A better choice would be \\"Sex and Lucia\\" or \\"Like Water, For Chocolate\\". I spoke with some of my spanish speaking friends whom really loved this film and they said alot is lost in the spanish to english translation.

In between sexual scenes is dry humorous dialogue and exposition that make one think about life, about the loss of childhood/teenage innocence, about growing up, about sexuality (and the difference between lust and intimacy), and truth (although, to quote the film, truth is nice but unattainable). The character development and interaction as well as nitty gritty type filming make this a great watch and, for me, read (since I can only understand rudimentary Spanish). If you liked this movie, you may also want to watch Motorcycle Diaries which happens to also star one of the actors in this film. I also recommend viewing the special features. There is a short film and making of featurette that are funny in a dry sort of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GEM","review":"It is clear from the first few frames that Alfonso Cuaron loves making movies. The original way he presents the story (with the clever use of sound and voice overs, amongst other techniques) draws one into the experience very quickly. It is movie for mature audiences but it is rewarding and works on many levels. As it deals with life, death, love and desires, it will have you thinking and talking long afterwards. Worth seeing more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending","review":"This is a Mexcian film with a surprising degree of depth. Definitely get the unrated version; the ending feels totally different with certain scenes uncut, unlike the R-rated version. These scenes add a good deal to the film's message, one that's delivered with mastery and sincerety. It's a coming-of-age story that you won't forget. I don't find the actress attractive, but she puts up some terrific performance once the trip part of the movie starts. The two actors are excellent as teenage boys from different family backgrounds. One of them sure reminds me of a college dormmate I had and hated... :)A worthy movie for the mature audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"I have nothing good to say about this crappy movie. I watched it for free on Amazon, so the only thing wasted was my precious time. I'm surprised it received so many 5-stars.

The story doesn't have a very strong plot line and all the sex in this film is just unnecessary. I watched the rated edition and even that was just over the top. Although, I did love the fact that the film was in another language because the spoken language in this film is absolutely beautiful. To give the actors credit, they did do a good job with the characters they played. I do recommend seeing this film to those who are interested, but it just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mexico can do better","review":"I can struggle through reading subtitles is the film itself offers something worth while. I admit that this tale begins with a couple of young girls with the kind of shape that pleases a male audience. That they were less than scantily clad certainly got my attention. After that, the movie dwindled into a road movie where the two girls are off to Europe and their less interesting boyfriends engage in a road trip to the beach. Now, I didn't think Mexico was that wide, but this beach trip takes forever and these main characters don't get any deeper in their conversation. It amazes me that some foreign films get so much attention when there are some truly good ones out there. El Mariachi is practically a classic.

Was looking forward to the DVD. Unfortunately a key scene near the end of the film was cut short. I won't relate the content, however this was the payoff demonstrating the relationship between the two boys. The denouement, if you will. The payoff is gone.. the film just winds up. I purchased the R rated version, thinking the scene would not be cut short. Wrong. Viewers of either DVD version will not see this key scene. Fortunately the film was shown in its entirety on cable.

It's called America! You mention that you have it in \\"widescreen\\" because of the director's vision. What about cutting parts of the movie because of your own hysterical censorship?On the back of the box, you highlight a prominent blurb from the new york times that states \\"Fast, funny, unafraid of sexuality.\\" If only that could be applied to MGM!This movie is a wonderful story about coming of age in Mexico, and I for one believe it's awful that you edited to suit your own diluted tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indictment of Mexican Decline","review":"So much for macho - the boys are the antithesis of the South American male ideal - to the point they choose each other over the woman.

On that level, this movie succeeds brilliantly. Every road trip book or movie should be about transformation, whether it be over subject matters as diverse as those found in \\"On the Road,\\" \\"Apocalypse Now\\" or my personal favorite, \\"Midnight Run.\\" YTMT is faithful to the genre and had interesting, mostly believable characters to deal with.A couple of small points of dissent, however. I found the extremely long takes to be disturbing (think Hitchcock's \\"Rope\\"), and by the middle of the long takes I was struggling to see any minor flubs. The long takes actually took away from my suspension of disbelief, rather than enhanced it. Second, the omniscient voice-over was unnecessary and manipulative. It seemed primarily to exist to provide snide political commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not life-altering","review":"This film was wonderful and very erotic -- an excellent choice for a quiet night at home with your sweetheart and take-out chinese food.

I, for one, do not know a single teenager who did anything close to the \\"17 year olds\\" in this filth. But I guess me and my friends were too busy expanding our knowledge instead of burying our faces in carnal desires.Question- how do you sell a movie in the year 2003? SEX! Regardless of the consequences. And that's all this film is. There is no plot, and no characters, as far as I'm concerned.This movie has no meaning. The sex is meaningless.

Trash is all this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant","review":"While there are admirable elements in \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\" such as three attractive-looking, capable lead actors and nice cinematography, overall I found this movie to be unpleasant and distasteful. Its plot focuses on the promiscous, immoral behavior of two young men and an older woman who are brought together on a road trip. Their sexual exploits are rather graphically depicted. This movie could have made its point without as many gratuitous, explicit sex scenes. \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\" resembles porn more than it does classy filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"wayne's world is better","review":"I don't get the hype around this one.

All of us, I believe, can relate in some way to one of the characters. Whether that be in a friendship similar to Tenoch and 'Charo's,' or to the torn apart Luisa.Overall, a very provacative film that should not be missed. I will be looking forward to more of Cuaron's films!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"People who rate this piece of junk highly are full of it. It's an amateurish \\"coming of age\\" movie with obnoxious and/or unbelievable characters. It goes nowhere and raises absolutely no emotions. The end is a total copout - so the woman screws the 2 boys not because she is mad at her husband - or even enjoys sex - but because she is dying of cancer. Give me a break. The 2 main boys have no redeeming features that would make us give a damn about them...just typical teenie slackers with nothing interesting to say. The whole thing has an air of concocted \\"spontaneity\\" that I didn;t buy for a moment. Save your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated!","review":"This film is mediocre at best. It's no where near other recent potent Mexico City flicks such as \\"Amores Perros\\" or \\"Todo El Poder\\". It is rather graphic in its sexual content, so it is not recommended for a young viewing audience. It does have it's funny moments, which save the film from being a complete waste of time. The film is about 2 young men taking a roadtrip with an attractive older woman hoping to get laid, eventually each one gets his wish fulfilled. The film gets it's name from a scene in the film when all 3 are having dinner and the 2 guys start joking about women they've \\"had\\" including each others' girlfriend then one of them says \\"and your mom too\\" implying he slept with his friends' mother. Overall, i recommend it to adult and mature audiences and would only really be suitable for one of those evenings in which there is nothing to do and just wish to kill time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie was hyped by the US press as a blockbuster among foreign films. Boy was I disappointed! The two main characters, Julio and Tenoch, are spoiled brats of the Mexican upper class. They meet Luisa, a beautiful lady with an aloof husband, and con her into taking a road trip with them. They then bicker, bully and tease each other incessantly, until both Luisa and you, the viewer want to pummel them. When they do kiss and make up for a threesome, the boys are more into each other than they are Luisa. But I was genuinely sad at the film's end. Luisa's fate is a cruel blow.

I was surprised to read that there was a more complete and unrated version and so I ordered it. I was immensely moved by the film when I first saw it and the unedited version adds to the understanding of the final product. If there is any disappointment it is that I do not have enough Spanish under my belt to understand the tracks where the actors discuss the film.

Don't waste your time, stick to the unrated version. Not because you're sex-obsessed but because you want the story, characters, and themes that were intended, not that one that met the censors' standards.

Wrong. The two guys can't get it together -- they're too busy being annoying. Finally, she takes control, but in two very brief secenes, each of them proves sexually inept. And that's the nice way to put it. This is not sexy. This is not steamy. These boys are so annoying, it's hard to stay interested. They annoy her [and us] so much, she gives up and ends up telling them to be quiet and stop annoying her.

I heard great things not just from critics, but from regular people. I just kept waiting for a point when I could feel something for the characters, but it never came. I didn't just dislike them, they flat-out irritated me. Not only were the characters exploitive and undeveloped, there wasn't much interesting about this film at all. Near the beginning, the two best friends masturbate together while talking about the wife of one of their cousins. I almost stopped it right then, but made the mistake of wasting more of my time. It basically was softcore porn, but worst because it was supposed to be a serious movie. This whole story was about sex and cheating, and not giving much forethought to either of these things. It tried to make it seem like it had a lot more going for it, but failed miserably.If you like mindless, sexually exploitive movies that parade as meaningful films, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"hahahahahaha","review":"Wow. You think people would learn after the horrendous Great Expectations (Gweneth Paltrow emotes like an anoerexic Valley Girl), Hollywood would have learned to not let this director near another project. But no such luck---and once again, he decided that a good story wasn;t worth it, so he manipulates it to a degree unheard of before this.Working with only the brainlessness Hollywood joke can, he decides to insult us by claiming uniqueness and making the story set in Mexico. Then he adds two boys for one girl so we can watch a feminist version of a good time--sleeping around.There is the only thing that garners praise in hollywood---sex.

Lots of cigarettes smoked, beers consumed, and more marijuana than any movie this side of Cheech and Chong. The trip through the Mexican countryside is visually fascinating, but the story is hackneyed. I can't call this a coming of age story because it is hard to see how the boys would be matured by this escapist fantasy. And do people really find this erotic?

I wish they would have said whatever happened to him, or how he's doing or something. What became of him after he came out of the bubble. I think the ending isn't fair since it left me questioning.

In each case, I sold my house for MORE than the advertised price.This book will work if you stick to it. If it didn't work for you, it's likely because 1) you were unwilling to sell your house for the fair market value and/or 2) you didn't do everything exactly as stated in the book.

Three more dropped out by the time we got to $120k. Then one more dropped out at $140k. So according to Bill Effros, my house is worth $140k and I should sell it to the highest bidder.

Once I dropped this method and went back to tried and true real estate selling, i.e place well written ads for weekend running only and put up signs, lots of them, I was able to sell my home in just two weeks.

Here are the updates I would suggest:1. use a website service - George Cappony's 5-daysale.com does a great job. The website service should include a way to track the number of hits.2. If you use a website, expect fewer calls (most people I talked to said they got 5-10). The website does the work for you, and you don't have to be at home to answer calls.3. Use a minimum undisclosed reserve price to protect yourself. This should be what you think is market price minus the 6% commission you would normally pay. Then make the listing price REALLY low. If people don't say your price is ridiculous, then drop it even more.4. Place your newspaper ad for 8 days instead of 5 days. Most people only read the Sunday paper, so if you start the previous Sunday, you will get maximum marketing exposure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great for me!

Things like keeping eye contact and engaging another person by asking them questions does indeed work, but you can find these ideas in an average article in Men's Health or Cosmo. A full-length book was not required for the ideas in this book. I would admit that this book could be helpful for someone just beginning to explore interpersonal communications, but if you have any experience whatsoever, you will not find much depth here.

The novel wasn't fun and the characters were not true to the series. There was no mention of Leo. Piper and Phoebe seemed lost and lacking in confidence next to Prue. Phoebe has been a free spirit throughout the series, but in this novel, she doesn't shine. The voodoo practices seemed authentic, but it didn't blend well with the Power of Three.

Hoffman and Redford are brilliant (not to mention dead sexy) as the two earnest, tenacious reporters. The supporting cast is wonderful, too. Some people have said there is little or no suspense in this movie, but I think they must be off their rockers. I was so tense watching this movie, wondering what would happen next, if their lead would pan out, or if they would have to start all over. There is a minimum of background music, which just adds to the over-all atmosphere.

Mr. Redford is the movie's idealistic center and calming influence to Mr. Hoffman's hyperkinetic character. Jack Warden & Martin Balsam are solid as Post editors, Jane Alexander gives a fine performance as a paranoid White House employee and Hal Holbrook is dark and mysterious as the still unknown \\"Deep Throat\\".

The transformation was very poorly, amateurishly, done: it resulted in very noticeable noises which ruin the listening experience. The noises can resemble distortion, but include other sounds. I disliked hearing the normal, natural sounds being preceded by faint pre-echos of them.The result here is a cd with so many loud, odd noises in the tracks that one does not want to listen to the cd a second time.I do not like fake stereo at all, and always prefer to hear a track in its original mono; but there is good fake stereo, and bad fake stereo, and this is very bad fake stereo. This fake stereo is intolerable.This cd does contain a few rare Anne Shelton tracks. But of course they are rare because they are not quite as good as the more common tracks.

Even the least of these had something to offer. Maybe more so on this album than the others, Elton's vocals bring such a rich texture of emotion and sometimes attitude to every track. Listen to his angst on Amy and his emotional plea on Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters. He is clearly the master here and knows exactly how to portray every character. Phenomenal accomplishment.

During that time, my hair was somewhat thicker, but it was also constantly filled with static, and just seemed really dry (which is weird, because I normally have oily hair). The fact of the matter is that SLS was pretty much created to work well with hard water--and it does. I pretty much have no choice but to continue to use my regular shampoo.

Part two, Exclamations, is a radical form of the contemporary haiku that associates within itself atextured flow, and part three, Exit, contains a number of poems that make up a greater whole in a stream like state of consciousness.

This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Fiennes acts like he is constantly constipated, and none of the main characters other than Juliette Binoche are actually likable.

That it didn't deserve any oscar, let alone 9 or whatever goes without saying. The buildup to some great romance was more than disappointing - just another adulterous affair - with of course, the obligatory female nudity - to show us poor saps of course, just How Passionate they are about each other. It certainly didn't show, beyond the groping of course. One reviewer had it right - why would anyone in his right mind have him piloting the plane!!! Of course, with the 90's morality of today, (where men and women have no idea whatsoever, what REAL LOVE is all about - only the most explicit idea of sexuality and instant gratification) our little heroine not only had an affair with someone she just met, she also manages to euthanize the so-called \\"hero\\".

I did like the beginning, but then the rest of the movie happened and like so many other popular movies like Top Gun, Backdraft, Dante's Peak and Deep Impact, the story became completely and utterly predictable, just with a slower pace and more literary refernces tossed in to make it seem intelligent. It isn't anywhere as good as Lawrence of Arabia, Casablanca or Howard's End, and it certainly didn't deserve the Best Picture Award.

The English Patient, in my humble opinion, is a boring story. The drama is overdone, the film drags on and on, and by the time I watched the first hour, I had put the pieces together and knew exactly how the film would end. The only redeeming aspect of the film, I felt, was the curious and cute relationship that developed between the nurse and \\"Kip.\\"Honestly, I can't believe that this film garnered so much critical praise - I've read reviews that said the Pianist seemed to drag a bit. If the Pianist dragged, then the English Patient skids and thuds at a slower pace, tearing bits of the ground off as it nearly refuses to progress.Eye candy it might be, but a waste of time the English Patient certainly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little slow","review":"This movie has beautiful cinematography, nice acting, and an unusual setting. The plot did not grip me and I found the love story to be ho-hum because of the way its told in flash back. I know a lot of people really loved it, and if you're someone who likes sophistocated stories you might love it to. But if you're a boring American like me, the pacing isn't fast enough and the movie is very long.The one TRULY exceptional part of this film, however, is its score.

I really enjoyed Ondaatje's novel. Why then, is this movie so dull? Perhaps it suffers from trying to stick too closely to the half of the novel it tries to depict. Perhaps there is just a lack of chemistry between the actors (Defoe in particular lacks a necessary dangerousness). I don't know. I just know that I do not care for this movie. I suggest that you read the novel instead.

Basically for all the things critics and fans describe. But, even without its unique plot device, the movie is essentially a collection of powerful, moving scenes that do not quite add up in power as it should. Rather than being epic, it feels episodic, albeit many of these episodes are great. Rather than being sprawling, it feels long and at times self-conscious, though it's nevertheless grand. Thus, to enjoy the impact of the film, I prefer rewatching certain scenes rather the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brains in revolt","review":"Quite inadvertently, this film depicts the roots of the struggle between those bipeds who think with their spinal cords and those who think with their gastrointestinal nervous systems. Kip is a belly-thinking product of Eastern philosophy while the Hungarian count is dominated by the European impulse to think linearly up and down the spinal column. Had this movie been made forty-nine years ago by Douglas Sirk, with Robert Stack as the English patient, Greer Garson as the adulterous hussy in the desert, Leslie Caron as the French Canadian nurse, Sabu as Kip, and Dan Duryea as Caravaggio, it would molder forgotten on the video store shelves, but the desire for those who still think with their spines yet assume they have achieved belly-wisdom to have an opportunity to display their taste and sensitivity to their dates have made this pretentious farrago a modern classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Terrible Copy. Don't Bother","review":"I have always liked this movie. I bought it on Bluray in part because it is beautifully photographed. The print however is terrible. You would think that they could have run down a reasonable copy and perhaps even cleaned off the link off before digitizing it, but apparently not. Lots of white spots and random black crap on the print. The disc does not support 24 fps playback and doesn't even have a top menu.

All of these elements created a perfect movie. This movie kept me interested to the very end. Ralph Fiennes did a wonderful job with his performance, as did everyone else in this beautiful film. I did not notice that the film dragged at all. I was taken in by every moment. I feel that this picture deserved every Oscar that it won. A film like this is very rare. People need to appreciate it for what it is. The many people who have bashed this film obviously missed the whole point. They need to give it a second viewing, and watch it with an open mind.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRULY EXCELLENT FILM","review":"The English Patient is one of the few films where you can find excellence in every aspect.The film is superbly made:acting,cinematography,art direction,musical score,costume,editing,direction;all of these pieces were crafted by the best in their fields.I believe attention was given to every detail by the director A. Minghella.The acting by the three principals:Fiennes,Scott-Thomas and Binoche is so good that you forget that they are actors and you only see their characters. I have to disagree with some reviewers, in that in my opinion the best acting in the film belongs to Kristin Scott-Thomas.Her portrayal of Katherine is complex,true to the personality of her character. I remenber Janet Maslin's review in the New York Times in which she said that the film set up sparks with the grand entrance of Scott-Thomas(Katherine).This a film that deserves viewing;deserved all the nine Oscars it won and the few ones it did not win."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very touching movie","review":"As a devoted Ralph Fiennes fan, i just had to watch this film. Don't let the length scare you,the story is well transferred into the movie and it may seem boring in the beginning but give it a chance, it gets better.Tragic love, tragic ending, but still, i would definitely recommend it - it's not typical WW2 love story, the main character, Almasy, is somewhat mysterious and makes you wonder about his true nature througout the entire film.Wonderful acting by Ralph and the 2 main women characters in the film, Kristin Scott Thomas and of course, Juliette Binoche.Get the DVD, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More expressive art than a fictional story","review":"As I saw it, the English Patient was a weak story. The main focus of the book was the poetry in which it was written, to capture the setting and emotions, rather than an actual plot. I would have liked the book to have had more storyline and less embellishment of language. Although, the language greatly added to the mood of the story, which was definitely important for a purpose. It took a lot of tolerance to be patient enough to read this book, which makes it less practical...but I appreciated the expressiveness which shined through the language. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"This is bad on so many levels it's hard to know where to start. I think the most fundamental problem is that you don't feel any empathy to the main characters so you don't really care about what they're doing. This makes the movie seem like it's dragging on forever, whereas it's only 2 3/4 hours. (Ok, so it does drag on forever). I'm a lover of drama and am sick of the current movie trend of eye candy at the expense of plot, characterization, etc., but there are so many better movies out there that I wouldn't even rent this one unless you just need a way to waste 3 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Films Ever Made","review":"Rickly deserved all of the Academy Awards (it really swept that year).I love this movie, it's definitely one of the best films of the 1990's, and possibly of all time. It is such a rich film, the images so original and dense, the story so compelling and intense, the finale so devastating and extreme. What makes this film different from so many other love stories gone bad is its beauty; at the end you're left exhausted and sad, but not empty. This is one movie that caresses the viewer like its stunning opening shot of the plane gliding over the golden dunes of the desert. The characters are well-rounded, and the entire production is wrapped in a veil of nuance. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and everyone should experience it to feel that much more human."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Am I K in your book. I guees I must be.\\"","review":"A great film about love and infidelity. Jeffery Clifton was a good man and Katherine repaid him by sleeping with Count Almasy. People are so unkind and that's what life is like. One of the reasons I like the film. Yes, it is slow and takes time unfolding its story, but that is so rare in movies where people have to have everything moving at lightning speed. And God forbid, some people had to THINK as to what parts connected where. I would give an example, but I don't want to ruin the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I honsetly don't understand the critical acclaim","review":"The score is amazing, the best part of the movie, which is overlong and cliched. The last twenty minutes, which are wonderful, are the only reward given for sitting through three hours of mostly happily-ever-after trite. The physical love between the main characters, shown through flashbacks, is overdone and becomes tiring and gratuitous. It was rather shallow, and I certainly don't understand the academy awards bestowed upon it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE IT !!!!!!!!!","review":"If your an insomniac in need of sleep, this movie is for you.

Well they were and so is every imbicile that tells you this movie was \\"riviting\\" or that it was a beautifully trajic love story. Here's a piece of advice, if you want the viewer to be captured in the couple's forbidden love, first you have to make us care about the characters themselves. A Pauly Shore movie has more dimension. If you want to see a love story worth its salt go rent True Romance or Like Water for Chocolate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The English Patient is a vastly over-rated movie, filled with unmemorable characters and a slow, plodding story that builds nowhere. The problem is, the academy showered this film with oscars, as they often do with technically excellent, but substantively lacking films. Don't be fooled...The English Patient is simply not a very interesting movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a Doctor in the house? No, make it a lawyer!","review":"This movie should be sued for malpractice. This is a story about liars and cheaters and it is hailed as a great love story. Excuse me, but what does love have to do with this story? NOT A THING! NOTHING!!! NADA!! ZIP!! ZERO!!! I seriously think this is a story people LIKE TO think they HAVE to LOVE. What a very sad commentary on our contemporary socieity when Elaine (a fictional character) has more sense than \\"real\\" (pretentious!) people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience Is Needed","review":"Let's begin with a little math: Artsy direction plus pointless story equals Oscars! Not too bad, but really I don't see all the fuss about \\"The English Patient.\\" I've studied the book, watched the movie several times, and still don't see what's so great about it. Yes, it's pretty...even the burned German spy (now called English) doesn't look like a burned victim in ICU like he should look. Yes, there's a love story. There's WWII for all those WWII junkies. With all of this the movie is still boring, too long, and completely convoluted. It may be artsy, but art is subjective. I'd leave this one in the store and see other Oscar nominated movies from the same year such as \\"Shine.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"?????????","review":"If anyone has ever seen that episode of 'Seinfeld' where Elaine went to see the English Patient, that is how I felt about this worthlessly dull film. The entire time I was watching it, it was like, \\"Shut up about the plane and die already!\\" I mean, if a movie is going to be this long, it should at least be interesting, but it's like watching some long, melo-dramatic soap opera where it will NEVER end. I can't believe THIS won 'Best Picture.' 1996 must have been a bad year for movies, cause my college film slides that we gotta take notes over are more interesting than this. My advice: Waste your three hrs. doing something else. If your totally set on drama, watch 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'The Crying Game.' Now those are good movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the most beautiful, boring movie ever made !","review":"I loved Out of Africa, So I really enjoyed Kristen Scott-Thomas's clothes.

The end of the movie features euthanasia; and defends the mercy killing with the rationale of the entire previous juxtaposed amoral plot. ...Ralph Fiennes charactor is the anti-hero, binal, and unredeemed - he struggles not for any good but his own pleasure in the present. One wonders if the author of the novel was tring to take the double strandard of Occidental morality and throw it in the West's cultural face? I got this movie by accident at the Video store. I was all set to get \\"The Bridge on the River Kui\\". Instead, I got The English Patient, as liking Ralph Fiennes in \\"A Dangerous Man\\". I should have stayed with the David Lean film.

It is a remarkable story with many underlying threads, all of which come together in the end. I guess that is the definition of a masterpiece. Visually ,it is lyrical; beautiful photographic touches like when they show the lower part of her neck as an abstract piece of art... Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Very Good\\"","review":"I had the impression before seeing this movie that it would be long/boring, and possibly a silly chick-flick. I was wrong.

See it, it's not overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Movie","review":"Loved this movie years ago in the theater & saw it multiple times on the big screen. I had the movie on VHS which was OK until I bought my Blu-ray player. This is the perfect type of movie for Blu-ray. The cinematography is incredible & every detail comes thru. The music is beautiful, intriguing & adds so much to capture the feel of the time & place of this movie. I would give the DVD 5 stars except for the fact that it doesn't have English subtitles. I enjoy having subtitles even though I'm not hard of hearing because I don't want to miss anything in the dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH EVERY NOMINATION","review":"The English Patient is one of the best crafted movies of the last years.All aspects of the film are outstanding: acting, cinematography, score,script,art direction.

Incredible sets and cinematography immerse the eye. It touches every sense..from ink on textured paper to the tinkling of tiny bottles on a camels back. Letting us soar in the air then dip into a \\"Swimmers Cave\\" aa we feel the passion in unspoken resonance and grief in a place called \\"Palace of the Winds\\". A love story within a love story, so entwined that they become one tale of many loves. Timeless.Katherine Rosengren"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Product","review":"Like other reviewers, I was disappointed that this DVD movie had no subtitles and that it was produced using an inferior video format (1034i). As one with hearing a deficit, I would not have bought it had I known this; maybe it is my own fault for not researching the product more closely; I will be much more cautious in the future, as I am with BBC-produced items which often lack English subtitles. Even my 1997 \\"English Patient\\" laserdisc has subtitles. The less-than-ideal DVD sound quality makes Kristin Scott-Thomas's telling of the story of Gyges almost unintelligible unless one has heard it before. I'd think that an ethical seller 13 years later would have made a point of noting the primitive audio status of this product in the interest of service to handicapped persons. Only the Direction of Anthony Minghella and superb acting mitigate this defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor has no clothes","review":"A boring, slow, meandering, uninteresting, shallow story about selfish people told with a lot of money, exotic locations, period costumes, and blaring orchesteral music that fooled the critics into believing it was \\"supposed\\" to be a good movie.I have seen many reviews saying it was good, but I have never met anybody who enjoyed watching it or liked the story it was trying to tell.I think you can get a great deal of insight into what type of movie this is and who the target audience is (and decide ahead of time if this movie is for you) by reading the reviews of the people who liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely overrated","review":"I found this film one of the most pretentious and arty films. I didn't like the character Ralph Fiennes played. I didn't care whether he would die or not and didn't care about his love affair. I could barely see through this film although I am pretty much patient with art films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, and it feels it","review":"I ususally love films in this genre but I was very dissapointed in this film. It just didn't do anything for me emotionally. I felt nothing. Even at the end I felt nothing. I'm not sure why, but I thought most of the film was rather bland and dragged terribly. This should have been the perfect film for me, but it was the complete opposite. Long movies do not bother me in the least, but I was getting restless half way through. Its a pity because the actors in this are some of my most favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"The English Patient","review":"The beautiful cinematography in this film is in sharp contrast to the violation of a basic principle of good story telling. The characters are simply unlikable. Asking an audience to feel empathy for the two lead characters or their situation stretches the bounds of verisimilitude to the breaking point. By the end of the first fifteen minutes, you'll be praying for the two to be buried in a sandstorm. They are insufferable. The condolence hoped for the \\"heroine\\" left dying in some forgotten cave (she might still be out there!) is best reserved for anyone who successfully suffers through this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Pure rubbish and a complete load of old tripe. Do not bother with this film as it's mind-numbingly dull, complacent, self-satisfied, smug and self-indulgent. It beggers belief that it received Academy Awards but if you like David Lean without the skill of direction or political acuity than you just may like it. Otherwise, leave it alone and let it die in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groan...","review":"If you find adultry as hopelessly romantic, then this is the movie for you. The beautiful images and sweeping landscapes conjure up a tale of old, when women were often prisonners in an arranged marriage to an evil husband, and their lovers rescued them from fair castles. However, the heroine is merely a girl who married before she knew what she wanted, and the hero merely a man who is stealing his best friend's wife. These characters solve problems by running away from them, not by staying true to themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have listened","review":"to quote Hank Hill\\"You dont have to be english to watch this film but you sure have to be patient\\" Wish Id listened before I wasted 3 hours of my life on this boring movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew Their Second Chance","review":"Another lost sale. I simply don't understand why this film is being re-released without a Director's Commentary. Anthony Minghella had the time and inclination to annotate Truly Madly Deeply. So much for the notion that Miramax is more interested in quality than more mainstream studios."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy glorification of adultery","review":"This movie is the most overrated movie of the last few years. It's too long and it's poorly directed. I realize that everyone who turns to this review will be a fan of the movie in advance, which is why you're here, but I have to disagree with you all, and with The Academy, and go in writing saying this is not much of a movie. I was happy that the adulterous lady ended up the way she did. Actually I think I'd leave the whole movie in a cave somewhere. Dippy pseudo-romance that goes on and on, and there's no one to root for or care about. I hate these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Would I care about The Characters?","review":"The movie is well done and nicely acted. But as for me, it lacks the main ingredient of a story: I did not care about the characters at all. Why would I, anyway? Why should I sympathize with two adulterers? And if the viewer does not care about the characters, this movie becomes excruciatingly long and boring. I found myself fast forwarding many a scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring, overrated, and lame","review":"I'm a huge movie buff and enjoy everything from action to lengthy epics. Perhaps I expected too much of this movie with all of the hype. I knew it wouldn't be an action film that would keep me on the edge of my seat but I at least expected to like some of the characters and the story. To me, there was nothing remotely interesting about this movie or the characters portrayed in this movie. Complete and utter waste of two and a half hours for me.

The title of this review says it all: the story of the patient is predictable, and there is not one original scene or situation in this movie that you cannot find in other romantic films.The reason this movie deserves 2 stars is the superb acting, which is the only reason I can understand why this movie was made up to be such a great film.

If we only knew the truth about everyone . . .The scene towards the end where Hana (Juliette Binoche) is thanked by the patient (Ralph Fiennes) for giving him the final morphine shot and she breaks up, is the finest moment in the history of cinema.

The frames were damaged and the filters would not straighten out. I would not buy filters in this shape from a brick and mortar store.

It is just great movie music that evokes so many feelings, and you never get tired of listening to it. It would be hard to pick a favorite track, but I love \\"Someone Like You\\" (a gorgeous, romantic, well-orchestrated ballad); \\"Les Yeux Ouverts\\" (nice, relaxed French groove); \\"I Want You\\" (I could fall in love to this one too); \\"La Mer\\" (surprisingly, Kevin Klein can carry a tune, and the arrangement and the song suit his voice very well, making the thing a nice little package); and \\"I Love Paris\\" (kicky and fun).

If the fans keep getting treated with these lame dvd releases that are simply not the \\"best\\" of GLOW than we're going to finally lose interest.A last plea for full season box set releases!

Her stories have no flow to them and you end up wondering what the first 1 or 2 paragraphs have to do with the rest of the story. The writing was also terrible in my opinion.

It does not actually give any of the answers that the title implies. Rather, it seems like a kind of satire of nonbelieving parents, churches and Sundayschools. I read it and felt more like it was poking fun at the whole question rather than offering helpful advice. Additionally, the presence of 2 or 3 uses of d--n, 1 use of a--, a reference to Junior's parents being \\"in the sack\\", as well as other less-than-reverant elements all make me wonder if this book is really meant as a mockery, rather than a helpful guide. It certainly wasn't written from the perspective of a Christian parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Romance","review":"The book reads like an X rated movie with non-stop sex. The \\"hero\\" sleeps with EVERY female character throughout the book, and the \\"heroine\\" is taken advantage of by EVERY male character. I don't know much about movie business, but I don't think that in a historical drama such as the one they are filming in this book all the sex scenes are real actions. The part where the heroine is being gang-raped by the secondary actor and ALL the extras on the set, while the hero turns his back and pretends it's nothing, really sickens me. I can believe that Steve and Ginny love each other in the historical \\"Sweet Savage Love\\", but I couldn't find in any part of this book the element of love, only lust. When Webb turns out to be some sort of secret agent at the end it's only laughable to me. BTW, if you like steamy contemporary ROMANCE please read \\"Love Play\\". I think Rosemary Rogers is one of the most talented romance author. It's a pity that sometimes she writes porn, not romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static and intermittent from day one","review":"The DLO TransCast FM device seems like a great idea. It is small and packaged nicely. I thought I was getting a great deal at $20, but the device was intermittent and staticy from day one. After I gave up on it, I tore the device open and discovered a cracked solder joint on the socket where the power jack plugs in. Even though the root cause could have been a cold solder joint (manufacturing problem), I suspect failure was because the tiny socket wasn't mechanically secured. The force of plugging in the jack was borne completely by the PC board pad and solder."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem is impedance...","review":"The problem with is with impedance. Yes, it works with my Zen MP3 player. No, it doesn't work with my ATT Tilt Cellphone. The problem is the impedance is different. The DLO wants low impedance..like for a typical headset. My cellphone puts out a high impedance to its headset.So, the issue can be resolved for $2.99. Go to Radio Shack and buy the 8 ohm-to-1000 ohm audio transformer.

Next I plugged it into the headphone socket of an MP3 player. Using the headphones, I confirmed that something was playing. I even held the DLO Transmitter right next to the receiving radio's antenna and tuned the radio to surrounding frequencies in case the display was inaccurate.To check that it wasn't the radio or the DLO battery, I tried it in the car, using the car charger. Still no go, so I removed the battery and relied on the charger alone. Same result.What a disappointment!

It is very difficult to find a station that is \\"empty\\" and does not cause static. If you are driving more then 25 miles, it takes constant adjustment to keep relatively static free music. In retrospect, I find it would be better to listen to my Sony Walkman with one earbud in, then have to hastle with locating a clear station all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much static","review":"This FM transmitter gave off too much static which ruined the sound quality whenever car engine was running.

I end up pressing the iron to the fabric and steaming - not actually ironing. I always have to unplug it. When you shut it off it has an indicator light that continues to blink.

For instance a typical Viking eating hall, will have captions that points out who the people are, what food is cooked and how.The narrative line of the Time Traveler is burdensome. A character goes back in time!! Whoo-hoo. But you can ignore it easy enough. In the Pharoh book I lost track of who was related to who and what they did in that family. I just skip a lot of these more nuanced particulars as I am reading the book to a 4 year old. That said I and my son have enjoyed them and learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Presentation!","review":"Like all of the Usborne books of this type, the learning possiblities are great and encourage further investigation of the topics in the book.This book is set in the time of the New Kingdom, which was the height of prosperity and power in ancient Egypt.The book, through its simple text and drawings, explains daily life at that time, as well as agriculture, religion, and war.Long-fascinated by the Egyptian belief in the spirit world and their burial rites, I found these topics well-explained. I myself learned a lot from this book.It also explains hieroglyphics and the construction of the famous pyramids.

The introduction of the book is great, leading the children towards apprehension of time, and the map of the Nile is a winner, wish I had it as a poster! Through the book the pictures could though often do with a more work on them, it's like some of the pages aren't fully made. And some photos show informations you wish the text told the children about. But the book does a better job helping them to coprihend the everyday life than any other I've seen, and it's just when it comes to religion and the pharaoh than it becomes a bit disappointing. When working with the 6 to 10 years old on Egypt it was the religious sermonises that got to them.

An insider to the African struggle and cultures, I was very disappointed by the book. Although I read several, successfully written, English interpretations of Fanon, I was seriously struck by the majority of the authors in this reader (except a few who unfortunately should have published elsewhere). The majority tried too hard to interpret theory with theory, without offering any depth at all - used too many quotations to support their argument, and a few were in direct opposition of what they were trying to put forward in the first place! I do not doubt the authors best intentions, but we all know too well that good intentions alone do not make for a good argument.In sum, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying","review":"I must say these ice cream sandwiches are quite filling.

I can't say enough good things about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice film but slow moving","review":"The characters are likable, there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film, but only about half of the scenes are necessary. It seems as if they just wanted to give Gene Wilder a few more chances to be quirky. Gene is a funny guy, there is no doubt about that, but enough is enough!The film is family friendly, except for a few instances of harsh language and violence, but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days.It is worth a look, but only if you're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One if the funniest.....","review":"This film is a comic classic!

The congregation waiting for him in San Francisco, and of course Sarah Mindle, are great as well. Populated with keen character actors at the top of their game, and steady if unsplashy direction from Robert Aldrich, I would put this near the top of films of this kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naive Rabbi & Weak '- tuff - cowboy ' head west ...","review":"Gene Wilder & Harrison Ford wander around ' out there ' trying to get the designated Rabbi to San Francisco thru miscellaneous bouts of goofy adventures & misadventures along the way.I saw this terrific flick many years ago, when it first screened, and it has stayed with me ever since !!Such an odd story line, with these guys suiting their roles perfectly, makes for a great humourous journey for the viewer ....Not 5 stars to me since I don't say it's the best I've ever seen regarding this genre, but it IS ... indeed a pleasing flick, for all in my opinion.On VHS (mine) but good quality none the less.

Gene Wilder is simply wonderful as a lovable Polish rabbi on the wild frontier, with a young Harrison Ford as his traveling buddy. It has always been one of my favorite films. As a professor, I love showing the clip of the odd pair as captives of an Indian tribe. The chief is classic, particularly in the moment when he speaks his first line, to Rabbi Avram: \\"You don't speak English very well.\\"The little theological conversation between our \\"Wilder West\\" Rabbi and the chief regarding God's role in making rain is a hoot. \\"It's not his department!

Her other films tended to be pretty goodie-two-shoesy, but this late WWII flick has a pretty salty script, apparently influenced by the hard-bitten film noir genre of the time. Here, Henie is a hardworking professional figure skater who falls for a hard-drinking, roughneck hockey player whose bad temper and alcoholism gets him banned from the sport (played by Michael O'Shea). He in turn is pursued by the trampy, sexually aggressive wife of one of his best friends, who plies him with booze and (apparently) leads him astray. The dialogue is full of both implied and surprisingly direct rawness -- hardly the family-friendly fare of Henie's earlier films. All in all, pretty entertaining!

Like it was just out of reach and if only we could gather the courage to leave the house more often, we could see it and experience it. And the only way we end up truly experiencing it and finding ourselves is if we are forced into it.

The production of the album is also stellar. Other reviewers have already made many good points, so I won't be redundant to those, but try to offer my own thoughts. While musically and lyrically this album is magnificent, overall this album belongs to Nigel Olssen - Elton's drummer. Nigel provides the punctuation to every phrase both musically and lyrically throught the album. Nowhere is this more evident than the hit song \\"Someone saved...\\" where Nigel kicks in about mid-song and changes the entire emotional feeling of the song. This is true through the whole album. It is only fitting that it is Nigel's drums you are left hearing as the album draws to a close with \\"Curtains\\".I also agree with a previous reviewer - buy the original album, not the one with 'extra' tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like stepping back in time","review":"My sister was a huge Elton John fan when we were growing up in the '70s, and we used to sit in her room and listen to this album, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" which she brought back from a trip to Europe, along with cigarettes. I like certain Elton John songs a lot, and others, from various periods of his, I really don't like (\\"Crocodile Rock\\" for example). I think he's even admitted himself that he didn't like certain songs he released because they were just crap he was spewing out to make a buck, but that's beside the point. This is the good Elton phase in my opinion. \\"Captain Fantastic,\\" \\"Tower of Babel\\" are really good songs. When I listen to this album (CD, haha), which is creative and unique, I feel like I'm back in that yellow room, and the whole world is out there, just waiting for me and my sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Elton has some masterful songs here. \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\\" and \\"Tower of Babel\\" are two of the best on this CD.The only reason this gets a four star rating is there are 3-4 poorly produced songs on this collection that could have been made a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Elton's Greatest Album of the 70s!!!","review":"Incomparable, exceptional artistry from start to finish. Sticking the three bonus tracks on the end was a stupid idea, but the final original track, Curtains, has such a long instrumental finale that you have plenty of time to catch the CD and restart it before the bonus tracks begin. ;-)I have many fond memories of this album, as it was the first Elton album I ever owned. His music has been a major part of my life, from the early days on, but if you own no other early Elton, BUY CAPTAIN FANTASTIC!Actually, whatever you own, if you don't yet own Captain Fantastic, buy it!

His other albums while great in their own special way have become somewhat dull and boring to me now and I just don't enjoy them as much as I once did. Maybe I need to buy some more of his albums but right now I tend to get the most enjoyment from this classic 1975 album that I honestly believe everyone should own."},{"rating":"1","title":"lullabyes to paralize","review":"If it werent for the 3 add on songs it would be 1 star, nice to sleep to though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-So-Fantastic","review":"Come on people, this was always overrated. It was the continuation of EJ's big downslide that began with Caribou. Outside of the title cut, Someone Saved My Life Tonight, and (maybe) Curtains, there's nothing memorable about this album. I was disappointed when I bought it 26 years ago and I still find it a letdown from his earlier work. If you want great Elton, listen to the amazing string of 5 albums that began with Tumbleweed Connection and ended with Goodbye Yellowbrick Road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Fantastic, Captain","review":"I should first state that I am a huge EJ fan. His music has been extremely important to me over the years. He is, without a doubt, a genius ... I would go so far as to call him the Mozart of our times.But, Elton can also write bloated, self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in that bucket. I give it 2 stars just because of SSMLT, one of his all-time greats. I never cease to be blown away by that song. But the rest of this album? Booooooring!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God my gag reflex is still alive","review":"If there's anything that drives me up the goddam wall, it's self-referential musicians who write first-person song-lyrics about musicians. And that's what The Unendurable Bernie did in SOMEONE SHAVED MY WIFE TONIGHT. With that hideous self-congratulatory line: \\"Thank God my music's still alive\\". This tune is also notable for Elton's hilarious high-camp enunciation of the word \\"dammit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing to add","review":"After reading all the customer reviews of this CD I have nothing to add. It is a great album from a great artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton's First Great Album","review":"\\"Elton John\\" is the first of the classic albums which Gus Dudgeon produced during the amazing period from 1970 to 1976 when Elton John was the world's most popular rock and roll musician. It was also the first to feature the great orchestral arrangements of Paul Buckmaster. It's also notable for featuring the talents of guitarist Caleb Quaye and drummer Roger Pope, who would be part of the Elton John band in 1975 and 1976, playing on \\"Rock Of The Westies\\" and \\"Blue Moves\\". Aside from the obvious \\"Your Song\\", my favorite tunes include \\"Sixty Years On\\", \\"Border Song\\", \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\", and \\"The King Must Die\\". Bernie Taupin wrote some of his finest introspective lyrics for this album. Without question, this is an essential Elton John recording. Once more Gus Dudgeon and his team have done a splendid job remastering the original analogue tapes using the latest digital technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"The serious artist days","review":"Elton John (Self-titled) / (with Bonus Tracks): Although Three Dog Night had already released their own version of \\"Your Song\\", it was this original version that caught the radio listeners.

I have dozens of such events on DVD. However, this was absolutely unwatchable for me. The reason being that the rules of this promotion (or perhaps the state) did not allow any strikes to the head except with an open fist (no kicks, fists, forearms, elbows etc.). Couple that with the fact that the vast majority of the fighters had very limited technical skills (I believe most of them were legitimate amateurs). I tried to hang in there and at least finish one full event, but that proved quite arduous (I scanned through all five events just to see if it was all open-fist strikes only - it was). It's pretty deflating to see somebody get a full mount, but not be able to do anything with it because they couldn't apply any ground and pound and had no submission skills. Basically what you have here is a DVD set with many, many hours of slap-fighting and bad submission grappling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disbelief, shoddy product","review":"The fighters get poor introductions as the fights just happen, you can't see their faces that well, and the fights mostly are on the ground (wrestling).

Jeunet, unfortunately, isn't, and this movie comes off as a lethargic \`Amelie Goes to War'.Gorgeous cinematography... but the Italian hooker angel-of-death was a much more interesting character than the one Ms. Tatou, unfortunately, portrayed.

But don't take me wrong: in this album Jose Maria Cano proves again what a great composer he is, specially with songs like \\"Eugenio Salvador Dali\\", or \\"Mujer contra Mujer\\".Now, if something has really improved since their previous album, is Ana Torroja: her voice is better than ever. A true angelic voice.Buy this album, no matter if you're a Mecano fan or not, and no matter if you understand spanish or not. Mecano will always be one of the greatest spanish pop bands, and this is probably their second (or maybe third) best album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixes Galore","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this c.d. because I bought it hoping to find the original version of Catch Me I'm Falling.

I listened to it right away and found not one single track i liked! They are all over-done cheesy \\"techno popish\\" remixes, covers, or whatever you want to call it. I prefer to call it \\"headache music\\", very loud, very repetitive! Not even an extended or 12\\" version is on this disk!If you like freestyle music and/or the title track then stick to the original release with the original track on it because this cd right here is NOT for you!If you like loud pounding bass with a bunch of weird sound effects, cover songs, and DJs no-one has ever herd of, then this cd IS for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"three imaginary girls from seattle.....","review":"What the hell kind of review is that? Stop wasting everybody's time, moron. Glad you got turned on to drugs in college (who cares?); it's a shame they didn't assist you in searching for any good bands. You don't know anything about Pavement, and it is blatantly obvious (since Helmet, of all bands, is your yardstick for music?!?!) that you're not much of a music fan, or shall I say, \\"good\\" music. Pavement is in such a different league than those complete dorks. And maybe you should know that Scott Kannberg (of PSOI) was not the main songwriter in Pavement.

The duvet cover is soft and comfortable, and fits my comforter perfectly. The shams were slightly disappointing as they are very plain and look just like pillow cases. I would have preferred to just receive pillow cases since when I read the word \\"Sham\\" I tend to expect something a little fancier than a simple stitched pillow case that is called a \\"sham\\".

It starts off kind of boring and some of the chapters are not really meant to be there. Also, articles seem to be a bit dispersed because almost all of them are written by different authors. This results in a lack of continuity that might have been present if the book had been written by the same author. But overall, the book is very useful and can be kept as a reference on US business history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Details....Details... And more details...","review":"I really enjoyed Panic Snap by Laura Reese, but I was very disappointed in Topping From Below. I think she spent way too much time describing things that were not important. She spent literally pages describing bushes, weather, clothing, scenery, etc. In my opinion, it was a waste of the whole Sunday it took me to read it. But hey, to each his own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"S&M Classic","review":"Despite a bit of clunkiness in the plotting, and too many pages to get where it's going, Topping From Below is an S&M classic. It's strong stuff, not ordinary fare. \\"M\\", the sadistic master, may well have killed the heroine's too-submissive little sister. To find out the truth, the heroine will have to play his game. It's a game she is reluctant to be drawn into...at first...but she becomes caught in the master's web. There are powerful and graphic scenes here, turn-ons as well as turn-offs, as the game is played to its deadly conclusion. Unforgettable. If you think you should read one S&M novel in your lifetime, this should be the one you pick. But, be warned, it will stay with you. Not surprising it has achieved such a large, intense cult following."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"I read this book and was totally enthralled page after page ..I found it very erotic , and yet at the same time disturbing, It paints a dark picture of the lifestyle, one that left me shaken and somewhat ill. yet at the same time I could not put it down, though I was tempted to hide it after i read it so graphic were the details of M's sadistic tastes.. the climax was terrific .. and the characters captivating .. even M in His quiet Firm and self assured attitude, the kind of Man who from a distance would seem every submissive girls dream .. until you get to know His dark desires, then you can only hope you never are under the Dominance of one such as Him (unless His desires happen to be yours) I totally enjoyed it and recommend it to any who have an interest in the lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Enjoyed By Armchair BDSM Players","review":"Those that will appreciate this book most are the ones who enjoy BDSM from the safety of their armchairs. Those who actually live the BDSM lifestyle will most likely find this book to be offensive and downright degrading. The basic tenet of BDSM is that all play must be \\"safe, sane and consensual\\" and you'd be hard pressed to find even the heaviest \\"edge\\" players willing to partake in some of the scenes described in Reese's book. Aside from the ridiculous portrayals of BDSM (M. is not a true dominant, he is simply deranged), the protagonist is completely insipid and the storyline is predictable down to its final twist and turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This book works at every level, as a murder mystery, as atale of sexual obsession, and as a novel about complex andvividly drawn characters who are impossible not to careabout. It works in the large, with the plot unfolding atexactly the right pace to keep you hooked, and in the small,where nearly every paragraph is a minor work of art. Thisbook sat unread on my shelf for ten years because I assumedit would be shallow and exploitative. It is nothing of thekind. This is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dejavu anyone?","review":"Did anyone get the sense that this was Panic Snap?

It has a great plot, lots of twists and suspense, and the characters were well developed. I really felt Franny's pain. As an erotic novel, I would give it 1 star. Now, i'm no prude, I like a good spanking scene as much as the next girl, but parts of this book made me want to vomit. If bestiality (sp?) is your thing, read it, if not you may want to stay clear.

I asked myself what kind of sick, twisted person writes this kind of story. Here's what you can expect:urinating on people to show possession and dominance, intimate acts with animals, sex with animals, electroshock, cutting, severing limbs, etc. Disgusting and sick!!

She's possibly the blandest \\"heroine\\" a novel has ever had. Insipid, ugly, boring, even the author clearly disdains this poor non-entity of a character.

What does she do? If you guessed \\"something sensible\\" you are dead wrong. She decides to seduce him to find out more. Mind you, she KNOWS he is a sex maniac, and possibly a regular maniac. She STRONGLY SUSPECTS he has murdered her own sister in some horrific way. She takes no precautions, has zero plan or mode of escape or self defense.

I have been saying I was going to find this book to place back into my library. So here I am ordering it and will with pleasure re-read it in its entirety. I also just told a friend about this book who will also be ordering it from Amazon.Topping From Below is an Erotic thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I felt a bit guilty at first due to the graphic actions of (M).

I have not been able to complete this book it is so boring. If I wanted to read a murder mystery I would buy a good one. I would not recommend this read. I've read slave books that were interesting. This one is not but I find it offensive to women. After all who is so stupid as to become lovers with the man she suspects of murdering her sister?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother-","review":"I really didn't find this book all that enjoyable. It's not really all that erotic and it's rather long-winded. Definitely not the five stars I've been seeing.

I will say that some of the scenes were captivating, and I did enjoy reading most of the novel. But by the time I got to the end I was thoroughly disgusted (and it wasn't the S&M). It was the way the book played off stereotypes and the predictable nature of the plot. Basically, it makes a good stroke book if you're into that sort of thing, but it isn't a great mystery novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I am certainly not a prudish miss, (if I were, I would not have ordered this book) but I found this story disturbing and the references to adding farm animals to sex play totally nauseating.

It totally grossed me out.How could anyone with an ounce of self esteem allow \\"M\\" to do those things to her.

The book did keep you guessing however as to who committed the crime, but this book is too \\"hardcore\\" for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Normally I am a person who loves and cherishes books, but this one will not even get shelf space in my house. And, quite frankly, I would be embarrassed to even give it away! I could not find ONE redeeming feature in this book.

It held up moderately for a couple of months. Now the top part won't stay in place. Despite it falling apart on us, I just haven't found it very easy to use. all the small parts wind up in the middle where it is harder to get to them. Of course, we use glass bottles so there is more weight on the parts than if we used plastic, but the top part is where we put the bottle tops, nipples, etc. That shouldn't break it.

It's very cheap flimsy plastic. The polls on the bottom layer started to bend over with the glass bottles, and what is worst, after 1 day of usage the top rack collapsed to the bottom because I was using glass bottles (and not all the prongs were even used).

Keeping all the nursing gear well organized and reasonably well contained was important to us. This drying rack really helped a lot with that. It is sturdy and compact, and it can hold all the bottles, nipples, and other gear that we need on a daily basis.

The grid/holes on the top rack are perfect for inserting the Dr. Browns bottle internal vent system pieces. I have been able to fit 8 bottles on here with breast pump parts. Perfect item to have when you aren't wanting to put all your bottles/pump pieces into the dishwasher.**Update- it's been a year and this thing has held up perfectly. The best part now that we are nearly over the bottle stage is it snaps apart for some long term storage :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good drying rack","review":"First off I will let you know that we dry Tommee Tippee bottles and Medela pump parts on this rack.

I am now going out to buy another drying rack, I hope I get one that really works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My biggest complaint with this drying rack is that the top rack is fairly unstable and comes crashing down as soon as you load it with say 5 bottle tops. You have to place very lightweight stuff on the top for the rack to stay, which if you are dealing with bottles, there aren't that many. My advise is to simply buy a normal dish drying rack - works just as well and costs half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well thought out product","review":"This little rack is big on smart ideas.1. It stores flat. When not in use, just take the drying spikes off the discs, take the top disc off the center pole, remove the center pole and store on underside of base, put spikes in the drain catch basin, and voilà!2. Can put drying spikes wherever you want them.3. The top and bottom drying discs spin independantly about the center pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy and falls down too quickly","review":"We have had this bottle rack for about a year now and initially we thought it was a good investment. That was until the top rack kept falling down and this is WITHOUT glass bottles. When the top rack falls you pick it up to reposition it and the small plastic things at the top fall everywhere, so you have to remove those before repositioning the rack. It has just become more annoying than useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Space Saver; shoddy design","review":"I love the vertical and two-tier design because it helps to save counter space. What I don't like is the quality of the design - the pegs keep falling off. The drain is not very effective unless your counter-top is also sloped. The rack also needs to have more center weight to accommodate heavy glass bottles - it sometimes topples over when I don't evenly distribute bottles on the rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ample space for drying bottles and accessories","review":"Easy to put together.

Our baby is barely a month old, so we are doing so many frequent feedings that we just use it to store our bottles after they dry as well-works great. No real complaints. We use 8oz and 4oz Advent bottles and it holds them up just fine. We also store tops, pumping parts and tools from my breast pump as well as pacifiers.I can see it not being sturdy enough for glass bottles as another reviewer mentioned, but I honestly took a look at a few other drying racks in the stores and didn't see many that would. My only small complaint would be it's little tall store in our lower cupboard when we need to, but it works pretty well for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent rack","review":"This is a great design.

Sticks fly out easily, racks don't turn unless you hold the center rod, water collecting tray doesn't stay put. The whole thing just feels very cheaply made. For $2 extra, get the Munchkin one instead. Much more sturdy & better quality. The sticks actually are foldable on the Munchkin model, so they'll not come out.

I thought the plastic, rods and other material which they used to build this item are high quality standard,, At least it will match with the price..But its huge disappointment... As soon as you open the box you will feel cheaper plastic smell... I donot know whether we can keep sensitive things like baby bottles into this cheaply made plastic.The tray which they showed on picture to collect the water... is not attached to main stand.. It lies as a different piece.. So you need to be careful whenever you are using to pull the bottles from stand,, other wise high chances are that water in the collecting tray may spill over into the table/floorMore over.. I am not getting why they are charging around 10$ for this... If you ask me two dollars is the right price.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and Cheap Product","review":"I'm so annoyed with this product. It's been only less than 2 mos but the top of the rack can never be positioned stable. I am so annoyed that the height is never stabled. The top is always dropping down. I use a hairband to keep up the top part. It still doesn't work. I'm on Amazon now looking for a replacement. I don't understand why there is such high marks for this cheap, flimsy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this product based on the many good reviews. It does hold a lot of bottles (we have 6 wide neck Born Free plastic bottles), pumping implements and accessories, but takes up a lot of space. The most disappointing thing about it is that it is VERY flimsy. The plastic pegs come off too easily, the spinning parts are not level and the entire unit does not seem too robust. Also, the drip tray does not attach to the module and just sits underneath. This is a nice idea in concept, but it is not well-made. I have just bought a Munchkin deluxe drying rack which has a better feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and a space saver","review":"I used this rack when I had my first baby 2 years ago. I liked having a separate rack because it was easy to get to all the bottle parts. It also did not take up a lot of space. It also drains into a little dish so it didn't need to sit right next to the sink. I used it to dry 6-9 oz bottles, nipples, and parts to the Lansinoh breast pump. Once he was done with the bottles, I continued to use it to dry sippy cups. Now I have a second child on the way and will continue to use this rack.Didn't give it a five star because I find that some of the pegs don't fit in tightly. So, sometime they fall off as I am placing something on or off. However, I have not had it fallen off once an item is already on there. Another thing is that you can't spin the bottom section with one hand or you'll move the whole thing. You do have to keep one hand on the base. Not a big deal to me. The top moves fine.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottles never dry","review":"I put the bottle in the rack for 3 days, it never dry..my friend uses the same one also have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for glass but cant work that well even with plastic","review":"I cannot believe this has been rated so well. Are people getting paid to rate it well? I can't understand how else they would approve. It's so flimsy and junky. The stand often collapses on itself and the sticks pull right out of place.

With this rack, I can easily transfer it from the sink, to the table area, and it takes up very little room. The parts spin making it so much easier to put your parts on easier to dry, and to take them off when putting together your pump parts.The only thing i don't like is the drip tray. you have to carry it seperately, it does not attach to where it drips from, you just put it under."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy, impractical","review":"pretty flimsy. the design on the product picture looks appealing, but in reality it is actually very non-functional so to speak. not easy to put in and get out sterilized feeding bootles, nipples at all. pretty impractical IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy rack","review":"This rack is flimsy not really meant for glass bottles.

I wish someone had given it to me after my daughter was born so I would have a chance to test it out and return it. The thing can't hold a full rack of bottles. It may not have helped that I had glass baby bottles as well as plastic. I did keep the heavy bottles on the bottom rack but that didn't help. The top rack every so often collapses onto the bottom rack. It's truly annoying. The only reason I gave it two stars was because I could remove the top rack and simple use the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good","review":"Its good just wish it was a little stronger and actually spin able as claimed on box other then that works fine.

It's easy to use, easy to clean and store away very easily. The only draw back is that the sticks that hold your bottles up can get bent over time if you leave your bottles on me for a long period of time. We only found this to be true no the large 8 ounce bottles and not the 4 ounce bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding design","review":"I purchased this drying rack after reading lots of reviews. I don't use the dishwasher to clean bottles, so I really appreciate how practical this rack is. I use an electric pump and Dr. Brown's bottles, which have lots of little parts. This rack accommodates even the smallest pieces very easily. The rack itself doesn't collect standing water, so it's also easy to keep clean. Highly recommend this product--great value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked really well.. at first","review":"I've been using this bottle drying rack for about 7 months. It had been working really well. Occassionally one of the plastic pegs would fall out.. which was no biggie.. you just pop it back in. However, in the past 2 weeks, it's started colllapsing. Basically, the top falls to the bottom and you can't really pull it back up very easily. This is really irritating when you you have it filled with bottles and bottle parts. Btw, I don't use glass bottles.. so I'm not sure why my plastic bottles are now to heavy for it. I'm so frustrated with this that I'm about to buy the Skip Hop Drying Rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twins!","review":"I have 2 month old twins boys. I bought this before I had the babies thinking it would help with all the bottles that would be sitting around. I still use it everyday, but it isn't has durable as I thought although it is very convenient! It doesn't hold a lot of bottles and the top rack has a tendency to fall if you overload it. I gave it 5 stars because it is very useful when you need to have bottles, nipples, etc... close at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for plastic bottles","review":"Works well for plastic bottles, we have been using it for 6 months and are pretty happy with it.

However, it definitely holds all of the Dr. Brown's bottles while drying (we have about 12) and does the trick, so that makes it a good product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very well designed product","review":"This is a surprisingly well-designed product. It basically does what it says, but what I really like about it is way it folds down. The top-level platform can collapse all the way down so you have a single-level drying rack. The pins that hold up the bottles all come off and fit in the drip tray which doubles as a pin storage bin that clips to the bottom of the rack. Even the center column clips underneath (though that's a little loose).My only quibble is that I wish the drip trap clipped into the unit when it's in drip-tray mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Holds plenty of bottles.

If you do, it'll fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money, but not perfect","review":"We started with the Munchkin drying rack, but quickly outgrew it once we got more bottles into rotation (along with pacifiers, pump equipment, etc.). It only gets 4 stars because it does feel a bit flimsy and the trays don't spin as nicely as I'd hoped. That said, it does hold quite a lot of items and I would buy it again (heck, we might end up buying another, as we still have more items than will fit on this rack!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not for glass","review":"I needed a bottle rack that had tons of space for my pump parts, as well as other bits and pieces -- sippy cups, their lids, bottle nipples, etc. This is drying rack was a great choice for us. It has more than enough space, and the rotating feature is handy.However, I can't give this five stars, because I think it's just too lightweight to use glass bottles on. Any plastic bottles should be just fine on here, but I think glass ones would be too heavy. Thicker \\"stems\\" for the bottles to rest on would solve that problem.Overall, though, this is fairly sturdy and has held up to a year and a half of use in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baby Shower Gift","review":"Love this- got it as a baby shower gift and use it everyday.

It holds bottles, bottle parts, nipples, and breast pumping parts quite well. The items dry much quicker on this rack than a traditional dish rack.

I did this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you're a pumping mama!","review":"I love putting my pumping parts in this rack (along with bottles and nipples). Also nice after using the steaming bag and putting them on the rack to dry. The turning is a nice feature to access space. I usually shake of stuff before putting it in so I don't really ever see water in the drip tray, I think it dries before even getting that far. Mine, though, is little crocked no matter how I put the center rod, no biggie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather flimsy","review":"I was surprised by how flimsy and fragile this thing is.

I expected it to be slightly smaller though. I bought the white one but now I wish I had purchased the black. I use the rack to dry my pump parts and the white valves which are pretty small and white tend to disappear on the rack....just a note for anyone buying it in the future.

I'd recommend the \\"Prince Lionheart Complete Drying Station\\" instead. I haven't tried any other products, but the Price Lionheart product still has a small footprint and I can fit more bottles on it and access everything I need. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price... and I use glass bottles","review":"Some of the one-star reviewers said this product doesn't work well with glass bottles, but I don't agree. I've been using mine for four months now and it works just fine. I do have to hang my glass bottles opposite of each other so the stand doesn't tip over from the weight, but that is easy to do! This product is well worth the price, and if you are like me and watching every dollar these days, don't spend more money than you need to. I definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Where do I start?The top rack collapses if you put any kind of significant weight on it such as one 8 oz glass bottle.The plastic sticks that hold the bottles are made of cheap plastic that bend down if the bottle is warm from the dishwasher or after being boiled.The drain pan doesn't latch on to the bottom tray, this would have been common sense design. Instead if you move the unit the drain pan has to be moved as well.A cloth rag does the job better than this rack.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use it, but not impressed.","review":"I use this item daily to dry my bottles, but that's about it. Bottle storage.It's super flimsy and even with the plastic bottles it knocks around easily. Also, the \\"spin\\" part of it, well, I just don't really call that spinning. It's easier just to pick it up and turn it IMPO.This is one of the few items I will probably toss out after my son is out of bottle and just get something better next child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick another one, anything but this!","review":"We originally registered for this and are still using it but have not liked it at all.

We've been using this for almost 4 months (so yes, we are in the big glass bottles) and it's still holding up great.

The solution of making violence a public health issue works (ONLY on paper) and the concept of \\"community policing\\" is nothing new. Prothrow-Stith fails to mention the Senior Lead Officer, which is an important piece of this concept. There is a strong anti-police overtone throughout the book. I am certain this comes from the criminals the author has bonded with in the ER room. Too bad she hasn't walked the thin blue line and seen first hand the damage these criminals cause to their victims and society as a whole. Rather than demand they take responsibility for their actions, this book places blame elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthy of praise for our Lord, Jesus","review":"Please buy this new christmas worship album.

On the second page of the book, the author states that a mockingbird singing in the middle of the night is unheard of.

No way. I am very experienced with weight training and I thought this program was just awful. There is not only zero emphasis on form, there are exercises on the Workout 101 Portion of the program that I have never seen before. \\"Get in position\\", she says, but never once does she describe the proper position or form for any of the moves. But you are welcome...no, encouraged... to buy some of Joyce's books or other videos if you want to know the proper form and alignment for the moves. And what's the hurry? The \\"15 seconds\\" beween pyramid sets rarely make it to 6. The sets are rushed and the moves seem to me very undisciplined. There are several places in the program where she calls for one move but does a different one, then catches herself and changes while continuing to count. Really, really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Form!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this video.

Every episode is basically \\"Engine gets special job. Engine botches job three times. Authority figure recaps each mistake. Engine fixes mistakes with time to spare.\\" And whoever's the focus of the story seems to abandon all common sense at the outset. It's not even like the old ones where a character's specific flaw might be their downfall.There's some new engines and machines too, but they don't seem to add much. The animation's not bad (actually one of the best parts), but it doesn't have all the industrial activity and background detail you might have seen in the show 20 years ago. Instead of pulling coal, lumber, or boxcars, the engines seem to pull car loads of ice cream, merry-go-rounds, and cakes.I'd recommend a disc of the older episodes instead. There's more visible craftsmanship, more originality, and the characters really grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Action adds nothing to the mix","review":"In our house we love all the Thomas shows, CGI and old-fashioned.

When my friend listened to my play through the telephone, she said she wanted to buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner book.","review":"I find this book to be fairly easy to use. From knowing nothing re: piano I have several chords learned and am using two hands to play. I recommend it to any adult willing to put in the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"I'm loving this book. Its great for beginners and has easy instructions that a novice can understand.Great songs to practice too even if they are a little \\"child-like\\".

I have no complaints about the book and would consider buying the other two in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need to start","review":"I'm not giving a 5 because I think that the CD must come with the book and I don't have to buy it from some place else.The book is very well organized and complete. A great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the absolute beginner","review":"I picked this up upon a recommendation and based on the many positive reviews here. I was a total piano beginner at age 31 and have been using this for over 2 weeks now. It's almost as if it was tailor made for the way I learn. I'm progressing nicely through it without much trouble so far. I plan on completing this and moving to book 2 by this Fall perhaps. If not sooner.If you follow the process as it is presented, you will learn ways of reading the music that is beyond the normal note recognition and memorization techniques. That makes for faster learning and easier note recognition. For example, it trains you to recognize intervals between notes to move fluidly instead of trying to identify each note before playing it. It's working very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro book","review":"This book is good for students learning how to play piano and read music. If you are already familiar with reading music, you may want to look elsewhere. It starts out very basic and slowly becomes more challenging, which is good for the beginner!!!I wish the songs in it were more well known or interesting to play as I often find that I'm not very interested in learning how to play the short pieces in this book. Other than that, it has good instruction at an intro level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book at good price","review":"This was book our son's piano teacher wanted him to get. He likes it so far after the first month of lessons. It was only available in one local music store and was $6 more expensive than Amazon. Ordered on Tues, had by Thursday (Amazon Prime member)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Easy to Understand","review":"I am beginning piano lessons and my teacher has me using this book. It is easy to follow and understand. I like how it builds on information to quickly progress your playing knowledge. I have a coworker who has played piano for decades. She brought this book for her adult nephew who was interested in lessons because she saw how great the lessons were. It's a good choice in my opinion for adult learners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Chapters are clearly organized. Book eases you into new topics in a logical and effective way, increasing in difficulty in a constructive way. Songs are a little cheesy, but it's an intro book, so hopefully the more advanced books will have more interesting songs. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music notes for beginners","review":"I have purchased this for fun.

A good learning tool. Takes time and practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The instructions are very clear and takes you step by step through the music theory and practice.I was totally new to music and this book made it so easy to learn how to play simple songs.The song selection is very good. Most of the songs are very beautiful and easy to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Good thorough theory book, has songs to go with the lessons. Just wish it included scales and chords a little more. But definately worth using!! I personally don't like theory and I'm teaching my daughter, so we're learning together!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter book","review":"I'm about 1/3 of the way through this book and am using it in conjunction with a teacher. He gave me the book as part of the fee and finds it to be the best book he's found to teach adults, and he's been teaching over 20 years. Some of the work is too basic (writing the note or chord letters for example) but on the whole it's very effective.Even though I'm still fairly early in the book I've already started practicing sharps and using the sustain pedal. I expected that stuff to come later so was pleasantly surprised. The only other complaint I have is that the CD was not what I expected. I thought it would align with the lessons so I could hear what the lesson sounded like when played correctly but it's actually accompaniments to the songs in the book. Oh well. Other than that a very good tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible over-view for the starter!","review":"Looks like your one stop place for the beginner here.The early punk-influencing tracks,and the cream of the mid-period are all here!\\"Dancing In The Ruins\\" and \\"Perfect Water\\" are great to get here too,'cuz ya wouldn't wanna buy \\"Club Ninja\\" just for those two good tracks and miss the alternate early tracks on disc one here. So,just grab this and use it to guide you thru the BOC catalog. Just skip Club Ninja...really.A great set covering all the early bases. Looks tasty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing.","review":"An overwrought collection which should be avoided by newcomers and die-hards alike, WORKSHOP OF THE TELESCOPES, offers too much and too little at the same time. There is little of any value here for the dedicated BOC fan - a mere handful of unreleased tracks that would have largely been better left in the vaults and a questionable selection of \\"hits\\" from BOC's catalogue. Any curious fan may be turned off by the large number of tracks from the group's latter period. A much better introduction would be either the concise best-of recently released by Columbia or the group's first three albums, which can often be found packaged together at a bargain price. These along with AGENTS OF FORTUNE effectively capture BOC at their best. To the dedicated fan - leave this expensive set on the shelf and wait for a better set of rarities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Albums","review":"This collection contains too much filler and doesn't sound so good. My advice: Buy the original albums. Secret Treaties and Agents of Fortune are my personal favorites, but several others contain good material. The biggest problem with Blue Oyster Cult is that, after 1976, their material was uneven. Godzilla is a great tune, but Spectres is not a great album. And so on. Although this collection contains a lot of fine stuff, it's difficult to recommend. A better starting point for the novice would be the albums listed above. Verified fans will probably want a more inclusive, better sounding collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping","review":"I got this product in just a matter of days.

Verdi's operas are very, well 'user-friendly', if you are new to opera. I am slowly learning to appreciate operas after a decade of love for classical music without vocals.This is a very good CD for those looking to break in to operatic scores. It has large, haunting compositions for chorus, solos, duets, trios and a good mix of orchestrations with no vocals, perfectly showcasing Verdi's gift as a composer.Performers on the album include Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and other well known and talented artists as well as some of the most famous, gifted and revered orchestras in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be a lot better","review":"I have six Rockaby Baby! cd's. This is my least favorite. I love Nine Inch Nails, but they missed the mark with this one. I was really disappointed when I first listened. Maybe it will grow on me, but it's going to take a while before I listen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Elton!","review":"If you like Elton's music, you need to hear how it all began! Valhalla is superb and Skyline Pigeon is great, too. Probably not Elton's best work ... but this album is sooooo good! It brings back lots and lots of great memories! Hope you enjoy it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"Once you advance beyond the notion of thinking that if none of these songs were hits it can't be good, then you can realize how good this album is. I'd say this album ranks somewhere in the middle of Elton's discography. The musical styles of 69 to 76 are a personal favorite and Empty Sky doesn't dissappoint. The title track sounds like it was recorded as a demo for Jefferson Airplane. Other songs show influences of Dylan, Donovan and Traffic. But this album did some influencing as well. Elton and Bernie got to Valhalla a year before Zeppelin. And Hymn 2000 both musically and lyrically can be heard in Jethro Tull's Aqualung and Passion Play albums. Sure the bonus tracks bring some much needed energy that would have helped sales in 1969. And the cover doesn't do Elton any favors. I'd say if you liked the Elton John album of 1970 you would probably like this one as well. Minimum 3 and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Fan's Only","review":"This is Elton's first album, of course, and he was to go on to bigger and better things. Unless you're a big fan, you definitely don't need this. Much of it is embarrassing and pretentious, as both Elton and Bernie would admit. But if you're a fan, there'll be a couple of tracks that you'll want to hear that show glimpses of what's to come - the original version of \\"Skyline Pigeon\\" (not the best one, though) and two fairly decent rockers \\"Sails\\" and the Stones-influenced title track. The bonus tracks are from singles from the period and are generally better than what was on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing treat!","review":"For someone familiar with \\"Greatest Hits\\" era Elton John, this debut album came as a refreshing and pleasant surprise. The album kicks off auspiciously with the titular \\"Empty Sky\\", which is one of Elton's most propelling rockers. The bare bones \\"rock and roll\\" feel of the song, though, belies the delightful inclusion of psychedelic flourishes like backward taped guitar solos, a fake fade-out, and \\"Mr Fantasy\\"-esque harmonica wailing. Indeed, there seem to be subtle shades of British acid-pop sprinkled throughout the album (leading one to appreciate how much cross-pollination must have occurred among musicians in England around 1969!) Elton's jazzy instrumental \\"It's Hay Chewed\\" covers similar territory as Traffic's \\"Giving to You\\", cheery harpsichord melodies like \\"Skyline Pigeon\\" invoke \\"Benefit of Mr Kite\\"-style Beatles, and the bonus track \\"Just Like Strange Rain\\", both beautiful and surreal, is worth the price of the album alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass This One By!","review":"First off, I am an EJ fan. I own everything he's recorded. Nevertheless, I also try and be objective and this review is more for the casual/beginning fan who may not be familiar with Elton's entire catalog. That said, Empty Sky is very much an album for Elton enthusiasts. It's a sort of curio piece (or artifact) that only rabid EJ fans will find listenable. In truth, Empty Sky's only value is the glimpse it shows listeners of Elton's origins. Skyline Pigeon, is the one worthy track on this thing. From failed psycadelia (Empty Sky) to dull, cheerless, false antiquity (Valhalla, the Scaffold), this is an effort that reflects the times (late 60's) and Elton's attempt to compete with all of the other once popular (and now utterly forgotten) \\"time capsule\\", mock-atmospheric oddities such as Procol Harum or the Moody Blues. Elton was very much trying to find himself, musically, and he hadn't yet realized his true gift: the ability to pen unbelievably catchy pop songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans can never be objective...","review":"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...this is Elton's first album and it's rough around the edges. A good producer could have improved this project and there are a couple of decent tracks including the title song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Architecture and Construction","review":"Architecture and Construction is the tenth issue of Scholastic's voyages of discovery.

From Paris pyramids to icy igloos, from Parthenon pillars to building bridges, this book is definetly one you have to buy!This book covers architecture works from six of the seven world continents. It also shows the different kinds of houses in the world and many tall skyscrapers.

The book left me feeling less like I'd taken a journey, and had just read a badly written travel brochure.

I was interested in a book on spiritual enlightenment, but the author seems more concerned with advertising his large vocabulary, than he does providing any true insight to anyone.Considering that this book is only 80 some pages long, it took a week and 6 sessions with a dictionary to complete, and I found myself toward the end, forcing myself to read it, just on principal.

The abuse and over use of adjectives and adverbs would leave a college linguistics professor, dizzied from the experience and the only thing to be gained from this piece of 'literature' is a migraine. What little discernable information is present, is 'borrowed' from popular literature, and is simply an overworded version of something you might find on a religious pamphlet.Whoever this publisher is, Ark Enterprises, they did a terrible disservice to the author by not hiring a qualified editor or literary consultant to screen the text prior to press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful...","review":"I can't even bring myself to write a decent critique... the book was just plain awful and that is really all there is to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Word salad... all roughage, no sustenance","review":"Big words, unintelligably concatenated. At first, it seemed the author was showing off to himself and hoping others would be impressed.

The reader's failure to understand the author's point is not the reader's failure, but because there's nothing there to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but absolutely HORRIBLE","review":"The book is unreadable without causing a severe headache. If you have suffered through this ridiculous ranting of the authors', you will realize that the last two postings with 5 stars were written by the author himself.He published it himself.

My wife found it at a garage sale for a dollar and at first I was intrigued... how can you go wrong for a dollar. Now I believe she was overcharged.The book is poorly written by an author who appears to be more interested in promoting the number of \\"big words\\" in his vocabulary than providing any insight into giving oneself a mental overhaul. I'll give him this much, he seems interested in the subject matter, but he isn't sufficiently well read to offer his own rendering.My advice to this author is to first learn about the material before writing about it and second, find a publisher who provides professional editing services prior to release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oil Sponge","review":"This is a great product for anyone with oily skin.

I experienced less fall-out and my hair was smooth, silky, and wonderfully moisturized without feeling greasy. I didn't experience the stickiness and dullness that results from using the PCA and Paul Mitchell. Plus the scent is lovely without being overpowering. But I must caution you to use only a small amount, and part your hair in sections.

Not only that, the film takes great liberties with the book and changes some very important situations, the fates of certain characters, and even their ages. Last of all, the sound production is not very good and the actors spend a good deal of time either talking at 1,000 words a minute or mumbling. It's rather amazing that such an interesting subject could be dealt with so badly. The viewer has so few points of reference. It's like we are thrust into a place where mysterious strangers appear and disappear, where time stands still and where you will be checking the minute hand on your watch about 2/3rds the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie drags on","review":"I thought I would like this movie since I like historical fiction, the English & the Irish and Maggie Smith. But the story was extremely slow, some of the characters were not believable and the writing wanting.

The acting wasn't too bad either, though not stunning. But the editing and script truly left something to be desired. Flashback scenes interspersed at random threw the average viewer into a state of confusion. Characters of indeterminite relationship flew in and out in dizzying succession. The character development unfolded abruptly in harsh jerks, with very little subtlety. Most of the characters were quite one-dimensional, especially the young girl's two \\"lovers\\". One was a dumb, shallow cocky Englishman, and the other was a dumb, coarse, brutal Irishman. They were supposedly the two extremes that clashed over the anglo-Irish, but as symbols of the two cultures they fail dismally.

Furthermore it is hard to find out what a chorus and a verse are in many songs because they sound exactly the same often times. There are only three songs on this album I can listen to wholly before skipping it. There are other better bands out there that whip Dizmas easily. I gave them a try and I honestly tried to hear what everyone thought was so great about them. I can't find it no matter how hard I try. Mediocre lyrics.

This book was, um, bad(should i go that far?) because there was not enough to make me want to read more. The book is, as we say, boring. No action, no drama, no nothing. There is an interesting topic about a Happiness Machine, but that was all that was able to catch my attention. Having a child read this book is like giving the death penalty to a man that jay-walks; it's not right. I am 15 yrs. old, and have the attention span of a monkey at a zoo. And this book requires patience, something most every teen does not have, along with grammatical skills. I was forced to read this in summer school. Maybe this book would be better if I didn't have to read it in class. In conclusion, if you're elderly, read this book, it'll bring back good memories.

Bradbury has a very poetic writing style which makes the book a nice read. Read this book to go on a wonderful summer journey, Bradbury's use of descriptive words will help you to feel like your actually seeing all the excitement going on in little Green Town.

This is an atypical piece of work for Ray Bradbury, as there are no supernatural or futuristic happenings. It is about Douglas Spaulding realizing that he is alive. It is very heavy on figurative writing is challenging fo younger people to read. Fans of mystery and action will also be disappointed. Despite this, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forced to read, ended up liking it","review":"The book reads quickly and it is written very well. It must be difficult for a grown man to write from the perspective of a 12-year-old boy. Overall i thought that it was a good story and I would recommend this book to others. Also this book shows how you can grow up very fast in a short period of time. The main character in this story grew up rapidly in only one summer. Also it triggers memories from your own child hood which got me thinkin about my childhood and how much fun I had, and how much I miss it.

The only problem with the book is that the author tends to wander. He almost seems to be trying to fill page at times. The descriptions that he provides are very profound, but he takes them too far, often going to deep. This method is not a very popular one with younger readers, such as myself. Bradbury would sometimes take as much as a page just to explain how a cow pie smells to the main character, (an eight year old boy in the 1920's) who is far too young to have the ability to think as insightfully as Bradbury depicts him.

But this type of book is not really my cup of tea, and I found it vey slow going."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Boring","review":"I found this book to be interesting at times, but then it would go on for a chapter about absolutely nothing. I think that with a few minor changes I'd like it a lot more. I liked the theme of life but sometimes the theme would make you think a little too much and start to get confusing. Some things that the auther would say, I'm sure made good sence to him, but when i read it, it would make me insane. This book is for someone who likes fiction, someone who likes books that make you think. But me I like non-fiction books better, to me they are more interesting. So if you are like me and dont like fiction i highley don't reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dandelion Wine","review":"Dandelion Wine is a book. It's not a bad book, it's not a good book. It's just a book. I personally think that the book lacked excitement and a plot that was less than sufficient. This book did not appeal to me in any way shape or form. Someone may find interest in this book though. If you care about feeling alive and how it affects you and summer rituals, I highly suggest this book to you. If those do not apply, I would try to avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless Reading in Summer School","review":"Well, this is a story that I have read in summer school this year. It is definitely not one of my favorite books. Although, the writing is very good and there is a lot of description, I still don't like the plot of the story. I cannot read a sentence with out five lines of description before the sentence is over. So it is very tedious for me to understand. Also, I am an aficionado of murder mysteries, so this is certainly not the book for me. It lies on the line between boring and annoying. As a 17 yr. old I don't find a point to reading and besides that when I am forced to read a book in school, I 99% of the time dislike the book. I feel that this may be a good book for someone who prefers descriptive, obtuse writing or if they like the summer. But 2 stars are better than 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd book","review":"I read this book for school, and i really didnt think it was that great. Im not a big reader in the first place, but this book didnt catch my eye. I thought it was to detailed and had to many similies and metaphors. It seemed like he never got to the point of the story. Im not writing this to tell you not to read it but to me it wasnt a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard going due to personal taste","review":"I'm a new fan of Bradbury. I love the incomparable Something Wicked This Way Comes and a whole heap of his short stories, The Illustrated Man and Golden Apples of the Sun to name my favourites so far.I came to Dandelion Wine expecting to be mesmerised, but sadly, I just found the book was too easy to put down and rather hard to pick up again. There are some great ideas and interesting imagery, but the whole lacks a narrative thread to entice more thrill-seeking readers, and in the end, after four of five chapters, I just found the whole thing a little...well, dated.In no way should this put people off Ray Bradbury. Those seeking a semi-romance about the state of childhood could do worse than to read Dandelion Wine. For me though, I much prefer his fantastical and dark works, and in the end, Dandelion Wine became too sweet and cloying for my tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book about the young Douglas, describes the ideal summer of 1928. From a ghostly lonely one, to the idea of discoering one is alive, is incredible. I am a ninth grader from W-, Ma., and this is one of the best books I have ever read. Ray Bradbury is an excellent author, who can write about a 12-year-old very well. This book takes place in the summer of 1928. Douglas Spalding is a very interesting character, along with many of the other characters from the book. Each one has its own personality, luring a reader into this great book. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an easy-reading, fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best \\"summer book\\" ever written.","review":"Do you remember what summer was like when you were a child -how endless and magical it seemed and how different from your\\"real life\\" then or now? See those summers of wonder again through the eyes of two young brothers. Dandelion Wine will evoke those old feelings of timelessness, curiosity, hope, and the beginnings of self-knowledge. It also brings to life the sights, sounds, people and activities of a time and place from the American past that is worth your visit, especially in the summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How a Happy Childhood Without Computers Might Unfold","review":"This novel is a group of short stories set inside an idyllic early 20th century small town community. It follows the halcyon days of youth of three young boys, as they are touched by events around them (the short stories). The phraseology inside this novel is amazing in the good parts.The first half of the novel is brilliant, covering the magic of new summer sneakers, a happiness machine, what makes a time machine, and every time you say 'good night' it's a happy ending. The second half is boring, covering 'what might have beens' involving incidental characters, ghost stories, and not capturing the same nostalgia. The children are downgraded from making the book magical into introducing and following up the main stories.Overall I enjoyed Dandelion Wine, but don't feel too bad if you skip past stories in the latter half. You weren't alone in hoping for more of childhoods lost, and less of adults wishing they had more time/different lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"outdoorspirit","review":"What a lovely book. My first introduction to this author and I was not disappointed. This writer remembers how to lap up life as we did when we were children. I have read the author's other books which are a little childish and dated, but this one will last forever. Something very special. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This was way too poetic for my tastes. Never thought I would yearn for the clipped writing of Hemingway, but this is so ponderous and overwritten I had to put it down. I get the drift, he is coming of age and seeing the world with new eyes but Good Lord, could he tighten it up a bit?My daughter has to read it for freshman Honors English this summer. What a bad start to high school. This is a book only an English Lit major could love. Trying to find the Cliff's Notes, but alas, there are none."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Book","review":"I felt that this book had its ups and downs, mostly downs. At times I'd have to admit that it was catchy and interesting but then it had its times when a chapter would just go on about absolutely nothing. For example, in chapter ten it is all about the mom worrying and trying to find her son, boring. I think that if they changed the book and took out the boring parts by adding interesting or adventurous themes, people would enjoy it a lot better. Maybe I see this book differently than others, but that's just my own opinion. I would rather recommend this book to adults because it skips around, making it hard to follow when at the same time being boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb book, even for a teenager","review":"I am 15 years old and i loved this book, it has captured theimportance of life and how you must live everyday to your fullest. Ittaught me that everything will die soon or later and you must not die without finding the true essence of life. Ray bradbury might have confusing ways in portraying certain scenes, but the plot is very understandable and a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bittersweet to the last...","review":"It's rather sad that our newest generation, weened on video games and bad movies, cannot relate to the bittersweet memories that Bradbury is able to so eloquently describe through the course of this novel. This work is a time capsule, a fragment of an innocent age lost when one grows up - and an age that today's youths cannot grasp or understand.The book itself is written with a dazzling sense of rythmn and pacing, flowing more like poetry than prose. The stories themselves are like memories of events you've never shared in, yet can relate to instinctively. It's a masterwork through and through, and is probably the best of Bradbury's vast library. I heartily recomend this to anybody with a soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bais Chana Reveiw","review":"Hi, I'm a student at Bais Chana, a Jewish all girl school, and we read \\"Dandeline Wine\\" it was a book abot a boy with an active imagination.

It is an exceptionally enchanting story of a Red-tailed Hawk, and chronicles its adventurous life from breaking out of its shell into adulthood. The book is extremely well-written, and it had a profound effect on my life by introducing me to the wonderful world of books. I loved it so much that I checked it out continuously in order to read it repeatedly. When I finally did return it, I was required to pay so much in late fees (from my paper route) that I could have easily purchased it instead.This very special children's book is so deserving of being re-published!

Unfortunately, the neck length makes transportation difficult because it fairly long and must be stored straight or awkwardly bent. Depending on your USB port arrangement, it can be difficult to position without interfering with more critical equipment (like a mouse).It also turns out the light itself isn't even value-added because most laptop monitors provide enough light - even in a pitch black room. From yet another functional angle, I've found that the only reason I use a laptop in a dark room is because I need the room to be dark (for watching movies, or not disturbing someone's sleep). Unfortunately, this LED light is bright enough to disturb the people next to you.Overall, I find this USB LED Light awkward to carry and use.

Keating has a very \\"no nonsense\\" style of writing -- he tells the truth like it is and does not worry about what one may think. For this book's purposes, his voice works well to defend Catholic customs and beliefs that have been under attack by various groups.While I personally like Keating, I wouldn't necessarily recommend him immediately to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Catholicism or to those who aren't open-minded towards it. There are other authors who can introduce you to the truths of Catholicism in a gentler yet, honest tone. Rather, I would recommend this to Catholics seeking to understand traditions in their faith better as well as those who take issue with Catholic beliefs and seek a very basic understanding of why we believe what we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, quick-hit Catholic Apologia","review":"I thought this book was well done. It isn't written as an in-depth study of every issue someone might have with Catholicism, but it covers some of the biggest myths and shibboleths and gives solid, if brief, answers to the questions raised.I wouldn't recommend it to someone doing a scholarly study, but for someone new to the church, or considering taking the leap and joining RCIA, I think it's perfect to demonstrate that there are indeed answers to the attacks that are so common nowadays from (sadly) some protestants that should know better and especially the secular media.I'm taking one star because I think it could have been written in a more friendly style to the less sophisticated reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Target Audience is Catholics...","review":"I bought this book as someone who is not Catholic (or any denomination of Christianity for that matter), however, I am familiar with several Christian denominations.

I didn't learn anything I didn't already know, which I didn't feel was a whole lot to begin with.I found Keating to be defensive. His book was, for lack of a better term, \\"Catholic Propaganda\\". I felt like he was saying \\"Catholics are the best\\" without explaining himself.This book would not help a non-Catholic understand the Catholic Religion at all. I was hoping my husband who is not Catholic could read this and answer some of his questions, I didn't bother giving it to him to read. He'd just have more questions that I couldn't answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundbite Heavy/SubstanceLite","review":"This book is very easy to read and does outline the basic misconceptions about the Catholic church.

Without the necessary makeover/remaster, \\"Strange Magic\\" resonates mostly tape hiss and two-dimensional phonics; therefore, this is not the CD master any casual or any dedicated fan should be seeking.If you enjoy much of ELO's popular singles and wish to try a more aesthetic studio outing, then begin with the beautiful and wistful \\"Eldorado\\" (1974).

Christian Slater and Cuba Gooding Jr. would have done adequate jobs if they were directed properly.

I completely agree with the reviewer that shames the two actors for allowing themselves to be on film, NOT ACTING! High school one act plays have more guts than this, with better acting, better dialogue and better scripts! Billed as comedy/thriller? I think not! No comic relief from any of the performers...they deliver their lines like they were reading for an audition and not a good one at that! I had to take the movie out when I heard \\"I'm just a writer!\\" for the umpteenth time!! If this is the best you can do, Cuba and Christian, you either need new agents or new careers. The rest of the cast?? You don't even belong on the extra list! The baddie with having a bad hair day?? Worse than bad! Wish there were a 1/2 star! Even that is too much!

It's cool if you live in one of the cities to see some of the locations they filmed in.

I would describe the music as haunting, gripping, subtle and chilling. Basically, what one would expect from a score of this genre. Although there are no real surprises, the music gets the job done of creating the perfect atmosphere for the film. Many songs start off softly and slowly build up.

It is beautifully illustrated, and a pleasure to read aloud, even for someone who doesn't particularly enjoy reading aloud, like myself.

Unfortunetly this album \\"The struggle continues\\" allows too much pop influence to dictate its contents, maybe it is because of the non reggae label \\"Columbia records\\" That has influenced it. I would recommend other older albums such as \\"Sweets for my Sweets and \\"Si Boops-deh\\" to give the listner the altimate of Super cat. Some songs on this album are extremely good. Those are: \\"Too Greedy\\" \\"A class rub a dub\\" and \\"Warning\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as his earlier records","review":"I am changing my favorite solo artists in music from my web page for amazon. It is now Supercat. This album isn't as good as Don Dada, but it has a little bit different of a sound. There's hip-hop influenced tracks thanks to the work of Eric Sermon and DJ Muggs.

By eschewing the ridiculous clichés so often expressed, the authors lull the reader into trust. However, the seemingly open-minded approach of addressing \\"advantages of suicide,\\" for example, is only a cover for a step-by-step process of convenient omission and incomplete logic. While many \\"passing\\" suicidal thoughts may be overcome by this book's methodology, its condescending attitude toward \\"rational suicide\\" is revolting. This book is only for those who really already know they do not want to commit suicide; others will find it lacking in substance, but with a seductive appeal that leaves you feeling good at first, but saying \\"But, waitaminute!\\" after a few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth five stars just for its insights","review":"It's obvious that the authors of this book are extremely compassionate professionals. Although one may not subscribe to the theory of cognitive therapy being an effective solution for depressive or suicidal invididuals, the first few chapters alone are worth the price of the book: they are insightful, non-judgmental and empathetic. I am reading this book from the angle of someone with an extremely depressed family member, and I can't wait to give it to him, because I think he will find hope in its message. Highly recommended for those contemplating harming themselves; just as highly recommended for their friends and family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but beware of the mismatch between title and product info","review":"As of the date of this review, the product title indicates \\"dark chocolate with orange flavor,\\" but the picture and description are for their regular 72% dark chocolate bars.Vivani is perhaps my favorite chocolate, so I took a chance on this ambigious product hoping to get the 72% cocoa version.Bzzzzt. They sent me the orange flavored stuff. But I called and asked Amazon to try again. Bingo! Got the good stuff. But both versions had the same ASIN numbers on the boxes....Anyway, IMHO Vivani makes some of the best tasting off-the-shelf dark chocolate you can buy. I like their 85% cocoa even better, but Amazon doesn't stock it, and the 72% is very good (and less expensive than my local store).Compared to the other dark chocolate Amazon offers (Cote D'or), the Vivani is much smoother, tastier, less flat, and better texture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tad bitter with a smooth mouth feel","review":"This is my first experience with Vivani chocolate. It is a bit more bitter (or maybe just less sweet?) than I am used to with 72% dark chocolate (in comparison to Endangered Species 72% for example).

This gem of an album easily ranks up there with the best of Seattle's \\"Big Four\\" and is light years ahead of anything Creed or Nickelback could ever hope of concocting. It's straightforward, mature and melodic, sans the cheesy theatrics of what passes for rock music these days, and every song is a keeper.

Everything about it is first class with smooth operation and plenty of power too. The trigger control is precise and reverse switch and speed switch are well placed. A couple of years ago I was given a Black an Decker product as a present and I had a problem so I called their service dept. They were so helpful and willing to do what ever was needed to fix the problem with no hassle and I didnt even have a receipt as it was a gift.

Set in the French Quarter and starring a down and out horn player, Voodoo That You Do, casts a spell on the reader that's nothing, but white magic.From the sights, the tastes and the smells, Helms builds several thousand words into a picture of New Orleans that's pure pleasure to read and authentic to those who've done more than just the tourist stop.

There has to be a better program out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie But It Is Not In Color","review":"There are several Roy Rogers movies listed as being in color on VHS when they are not.

There is also a video for a great song (great video too) that does not appear on the album named 'McGreggor'.Couple of important things however - the dvd is region 0 and PAL... meaning that it is not really made for US dvd players. Make sure your player can read/play/convert PAL and is not region encoded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Band with a solid album","review":"If you're into rock, from the technologically induced trance-like rock of the latest Radiohead, to the diverse sound of Pearl Jam, to the softer and more straightforward rock of earlier Radiohead, then this band is for you. They aren't too cerebral like a Radiohead, but they're sensitive and sincere. They also still work in some straight-up rock like Pearl Jam still does. Elbow is a band that adheres to the roots of rock yet still comes out sounding new.Also, if you're tired of lead singers who write terrible lyrics, ones who write vague poetry with weak imagery, or ones who seem to work only in cliches, then you're in for a nice surprise. Take this review for instance, it's full of all the stereotypical review sentences, it's boring, and it's vague. If this review were more like Elbow it would be full of awesome metaphors and provocative imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable album","review":"If you like Coldplay, Keane, One Republic, Embrace or The Script, you will enjoy the music from Elbow. It is less commercial than many of the bands listed - but it is similarly enjoyable. This particular album is one of their best. Apologies - it isn't a long review and doesn't go into track detail - but I can only say that you are unlikely to be disappointed by this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's mind-blowing.","review":"This is a 2CD set. The first CD is half studio work and half live recording. Jorge Ben appears on the first song, which rocks. \\"Nos Quintais do Mundo (Mucuna)\\" is particularly fresh. The live stuff was recorded in Recife and it rocks. The second CD contains some mind-blowing remixes of CSNZ by David Byrne (Rios Pontes e Overdrives), DJ Soul Slinger, Apollo 9, Mario Caldato, DZCutz, Fila Brazilia, Mad Professor, BiD, Death of a Rockstar and Arto Lindsay. Anyone who liked what these people did on the RED HOT & RIO compilation will find their mind equally blown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real ASL","review":"This movie is lying a bit with the title...Yes they are signing songs...but the signs she uses are not true ASL signs.

I highly recommend this dvd, and also think that siblings who may know more signs or who can even speak enjoy watching. The dvd is also not overly \\"flashy\\" so it does not over stimulate children, yet still keeps their attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too lightweight for the comprehensive beginner's book.","review":"While this book covers a lot of territory in only 160 pages, too often the author simply says for the beginner to do something with inadequate, or no, instructions. After buying this book I'm now looking for another, more textbookish book on the subject. Before passing up this book, consider that it has been around since 1969, and survived 29 printings.

Although Mr. Allen was very focused on Native American motifs, the help he gives transcends that and seems applicable to any segmented work. There are some helpful jig ideas, too. The gallery is stunning and the step-by-step help is thorough. If I have one disappointment it would be that there are few design ideas outside of the Native American motifs. But that does not diminish the book in any way. I'm glad I bought this book, though I would not consider it a stand-alone volume. It needs some help to more fully equip the novice turner (like me!). The perfect companion for that would be \\"The Art of Segmented Wood Turning\\" by Malcolm Tibbetts.

Now all the data I stored on it is irretrievable unless I want to pay a huge amount of money (over $1,500.00). Thanks to the short warranty period, I am basically screwed. I wouldn't recommend this hard drive to anyone, and I would have given it zero stars were it possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Turn Off Sleep Mode; On/Off Switch Misfunctions","review":"I purchased this HD with the intent of using it as my primary drive for document work. However, the Seagate drive automatically goes into sleep mode after 5 minutes or so, and the sleep mode feature cannot be disabled. It is very annoying to work on a document, hit the save, only to discover that the drive has gone into sleep mode in the meantime. While it probably only takes 10 to 20 seconds for the drive to awake, that 10 to 20 second wait becomes tiresome fast - those 10 to 20 seconds seem like much longer when you want to continue work or open another document.Also, after the warranty expired, the on/off switch began acting up, requiring several tries before it would turn the drive on. A month or so after that problem began, the switch on its own jumped out of the \\"on\\" position while I was reading my email, and now I cannot get it to stay in the \\"on\\" position, making the drive unusable until the switch is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive Failure after a year and 1/2","review":"I bought this Seagate 3.5-Inch Pushbutton Backup drive in November 2006 to use to backup for my computer. I chose Seagate because of their great reputation as one of the most tried and true drive manufacturers. I felt like my data would be safe with them. However, this drive failed after less than about 500 hours of use (most drives are supposed to last 100,000 hours, or at minimum 5 - 11 years). A 1.5 year life on a piece of equipment that is supposed to safeguard your data is unacceptable. Obviously Seagate has let their standards slide, and their 1-year warranty makes me think they do not really stand behind their product. I've never seen a modern hard drive fail before, and I've used plenty of them. Buy from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All","review":"I just bought this hard drive a few days ago, and its solid. So far no problems (its brand new, id hope not). Don't listen to anyone that says its slow, its as fast as any other drive. Jus make sure if ur running Windows 2000? or XP to reformat it to NTFS not FAT32, it works faster that way. Other than that it sits there and makes el nada noise. Sometimes i have to feel n see if its even on. But no need to fret its on and working properly. At first i thot it was ugly, but now that its out the box, is actually kind of nice. I wouldnt ask it out on a date...but i dont mind it sitting on my desk.

Microsoft really outdid themselves when they released Windows XP, and it was developed with the most novice of users in mind.

And every day I still play some part of the CD.Strangly enough my favorit number at this time is the last number on the CD (no 10). It's not really a song but spoken text surrounded by music.

He's not too big, and not too small-Comes with a bonus--Rinoa's dog, Angelo (although his coloring is different)-Stays faithful to his in-game design (minus the polygon look)-Relatively durable. I've had him for awhile.Cons:-He really isn't that articulate. His heads can be moved a few degrees, his jaws can open, and you can move his legs and feet. However, attempting to pose him differently will just look awkward, as his knee joints don't bend.-His tail can be difficult to snap on and remove. Once you manage to snap it on...just leave it.-The sockets of his back legs can be a little loose, and his back legs will sometimes slide back to the point he appears to be rising from the ground (with bad arthritis in his hips)Overall, I'd recommend buying him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised...","review":"Be careful which version of this figure is being shipped to you.

I could watch a couple of excerpts on Youtube and get the same thing.Buy it if you'd like to watch combat and don't care that you have no idea what's going on. For me, it's good to watch for the drill (and see if I can spot people I know). But, in the end, I would have liked something a little more educational.Also, from a technical standpoint, the text that precedes each battle is difficult to read. I have an HDTV, maybe it's not meant for HD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!!","review":"The bad reviews on a independent docudrama company shows how picky people are. This film doesn't have a several hundred thousand dollar budget like the History Channel shows have. That said as a Civil War Reenactor I love and appreciate this film. The problem of being staged like some complain about is due to reenactments have 10x less men than the actual battle. If not staged everyone would die and it would be over in a few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very amateurish","review":"Was excited to get a video on Yorktown! However, I was very much disappointed when I watched the video and it is poorly done. There was information on the engagement and siege but the video is very disjointed - using reenactors - and not edited to show a very cohesive story. Some of the video shows engagements with units that did not happen. Also - with the use of reenactors - the whole thing is like another reenactor filmed it and did no editing. The footage drags on alot and for no reason. At least 25 minutes of footage could have been cut to make a better video. Maps of the siege would have helped alot as well as more information on the geography and commmanders would have been beneficial. This looks like a video that was done with very little editing. Very amateurish and very disappointing - much like the battle of Cooch's bridge one. Great if you are a reenactor or was one that participated in these reenactments, but otherwise, not worth much at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yorktown: The Final Battle","review":"This is a very bad DVD and a waste of money. It contains primarily marching, and the battle scenes are OBVIOUSLY staged. The photos posted on Amazon are very misleading, as they have been very carefully selected. I bought this DVD because I wanted one that showed and described the final battle between the American Patriots and the British in the Revolutionary War, but I did not get that. As I said earlier, it contains primarily marching scenes on surrender field. Even the British surrender is not well presented.

The photographs alone make this book a must have for hollywood history buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is just a teaser...","review":"First, I'll say I love the book. It is entertaining, fascinating, and never boring. You can learn a lot about the human condition from reading about Dunne's rise and fall (he calls it \\"the deluge\\") in the biz. Second, what is most frustrating about the book is that you know he has a lot more to say that he chooses not to. A couple of times in the book he admits to not discussing a couple of choice humiliating incidents. But so much more lies beneath the surface.But Dunne's talent as a writer lies in his ability to make readers question themselves. You can lie to others, but you can't, ultimately, lie to yourself. Dunne puts (most of) it all out there and the text, coupled with the terrific photographs, makes for a memorable reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"not vintage dunne","review":"would have wanted more detail . . . instead, there are far too many names \\"dropped\\" and not nearly enough told about them . . . just glad that i got this from the library and did not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book... Great pictures... Insightful self-analysis","review":"I've loved Dominick Dunne's articles and books since I was in college. This is perhaps his most insightful and introspective work simply because he turns on himself the same scrutiny he uses on \\"society\\"--he pulls no punches and is as critical with what he did with his life as he is of what those around him were doing. This is almost like a personal diary; a glimpse into someone's mind. Despite the fact that I did not recognize many of the \\"famous\\" names--I was a child when most of the events in book took place--I was still amazed at how Dunne and his wife were social magnets in Hollywood. It is often disappointing when an author writes about himself. The author is often \\"light\\" on the embarassing issues. Dunne will have none of this. His honesty makes this book worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very insightful.","review":"Dominick Dunne's book should be publicized as more of a photo essay rather than a text based insightful memoir of the era it covers in Hollywood. The book was not very insightful and exposes Mr. Dunne to his short comings as a person who circled the wagons of the major stars in Hollywood without actually being invited to the club.The pace of the reading is very monotonous and Mr. Dunne discribes many instances as the best time in his life. He does this so much that it becomes less powerful and surprising.It is clear that Mr. Dunne and his wife used his wife's family money to throw lavish parties as a carrot to gain access to Hollywood stars. However, it becomes apparent early that these stars never actually embraced the Dunne's as members of their circle and once the Dunne's stopped given parties these so called friendships ended.Unfortunately, this is reflected by a book that lacks depth and insight.I would not recommend this book to Amazon's readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, the joys of getting your scrapbooks published.","review":"If only *I* could get paid to publish MY photo albums! Admittedly, his are full of famous people while mine are full of people nobody knows, but still--the pictures are only occasionally actually revealing (Liz Montgomery and her former husband playing mind games); the rest are your standard \\"Smile at the camera\\" variety. The style of the book doesn't really lend itself well to any in-depth self-analysis, but please, you need one or the other (good pictures, good writing). Mr. Dunne, I love you, but you're in need of a good editor and shouldn't be allowed to run loose with every passing whim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to fiction, Mr. Dunne","review":"The problem with this book is that, if Dunne had tried to storm the Hollywood of the Fifties or the Forties, the pictures would at least be very entertaining. But the late Sixties was not the most stellar time in Hollywood's history. There's also something very pathetic about a memoirist who keeps telling you how awful it was that he was such a snob and an arriviste while all the time he keeps trying to impress you with his (unilluminating) anecdotes and (ordinary) photos of the (somewhat) famous people he knew. While Dunne's romans a clef about high society are often great trash wallows, this book (and his recent terrible semi-autobiographical ANOTHER CITY, NOT MY OWN) forces you to confront the dislikeable and selfish person behind them. Please go back to writing fiction, Mr. Dunne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"What a dissappointment after being a dieahard fan of Mr. Dunne's page turners I fell asleep with this one.

Mr. Dunne's fixation with being\\"acquainted\\" with stars reaches new heights. I guess he cleaned out his closet and found all the pictures he had taken while in L.A. and decided to write captions for them. This collection of photos and captions is called a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"who is an ardent Dominick Dunne fan","review":"To anyone who can remember the Los Angeles of the 50s, 60s and 70s, this book is a treasure and a real piece of social history. It is wonderful to see how beautiful and stylish the women of that era were, and how the behind-the-scenes entertaining of celebrities was accomplished. The photo of Priness Margaret with a cigarette in her mouth is priceless, as is the shot of Natalie Wood fixing her makeup in the reflection of a dinner knife. Dominick's black and white ball, which preceeded the Truman Capote extravaganza held in New York, apparently was the prototype. It's a wonderful read that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about behind-the-scenes Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprising Tour-de-Force","review":"It wasn't Dominick Dunne's vintage photos that caught me -- although some of them are stunning -- but the delicious text of this book. There are some quotable lines, like this musing on Lana Turner: \\"I have always been intrigued by the kind of people who call their lawyers before they call the police after a murder. It's a rich-people thing.\\" What's best, of course, is that Dunne manages to capture the guilty innocence in post-war Hollywood manners and morals. And then that exquisitely sad coda! This book will be a minor classic. Dominick Dunne, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insights into Dunne's books","review":"A great book if you're a fan of Dunne's. To appreciate it, you have to read the text, not just look at the pictures. He gives interesting insights into the people on whom he based his book characters. For example, the Mendelsons in 'An Inconvenient Woman' were based on the Bloomingdales. The coke snorting movie director was based on Robert Evans (also much maligned as the character who Dustin Hoffman played in Wag the Dog)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick reference for Opals","review":"The book gives a good overall insight into how opals are formed, types of opals, where they are mined, how they are mined and many stories surrounding opals and opal miners.

Yet, when trying to make this point the movie is so narrow in scope that it fails to tackle the foremost relevant issues. Nor does it handle the select few that it does encounter with sophistication.

I strongly feel that everyone should have it in their personal DVD library! This movie exposes the massive deception that is regularly carried out on a daily basis by our mis-Leaders. When a tiny group of elites own the media (like in the US), it's becomes relatively easy to manipulate an entire population. Besides the action and great plot, this is one of the many things that I enjoyed about this movie.

Yet, I wonder why disowned his name from the credits of the movie. Perhaps it's because the original graphic novel from which the movie was based upon was not only about the message that the masked hero delivered but it was also a little bit more about exploring what V (the character himself) was really all about. Because by reading the graphic novel and then seeing the movie there were obivous chages made to the original story, but you can tell that the movie didn't spend as much time on the V character like the graphic novel did but it was more about the message that V delivered. It would be very interesting to hear Alan Moore talk about his reason for not being involved in the movie. Because I thought the movie still had alot that maybe he could still have been pround about."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984 recast","review":"V for Vendetta is a movie which invokes the stifling dominant government of Big Brother in 1984. That the dictator is a figure from one of the best adaptations of 1984 is a nice touch.The story revolves around a rebellious figure who strips the thin veneer of populace satisfaction by his actions. The unspoken distrust and dissatisfaction of the government rises almost immediately. The control mechanism (BTN Network) into which the dictators place a lot of stock is shown to be disbelieved by the people watching.The central tenets, control by the induction of fear, intimidation by official organizations (the fingermen), obfuscation of facts by a government, are well recognized.The performances are really quite good. I got a little tired of Natalie Portman's accent. (Does everyone in London have a Cockney accent?), but that is small potatoes as complaints go. A bit dark, and predictably a little unhappy.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"At last a movie for people who mindlessly rebel","review":"***** Spoiler Alert *****See if you can follow this:1.

The movie has a gross revenue of over 132 million according to Box Office Mojo.My major objection to this film is that in my opinion there is never any excuse to torture a woman.Apparently there are many young people around the world for whom torturing women is pleasant culturally accepted diversion.If you are not one of these people, do not support this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Anarchy?","review":"In V for Vendetta, a masked hero attacks the institutions and leaders of state that rules with fear, torture, incarceration, and propaganda and inspires the masses to rise up and overthrow this morally bankrupt government.But--then what?Was V fighting for a better government?Or NO government?While the movie seems to leave V's politics at \\"Freedom!

Also, too many coy and sophmoric jabs at the current situation in America, were in bad taste and ridiculous.I would actually give this 2 stars, but it seems so many fools around here try to hyper-inflate reviews by bombing them with 5 stars.No one in their right mind could honestly give this incredibly flawed film 5 stars.

At the end of a long, trying story on the stroke of midnight on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day), a series of spectacular explosions fells the entire building along with Big Ben, while the coda of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture plays and a beautiful fireworks display lights up the night sky.And to think I saw this movie totally by accident during the overnight after July 4th, not knowing at all what would happen.

The story line tries too hard to create a web of intrigue, instead it weaves a web of forced tie-ins and the relationships between past characters and the present story line falls together far too easily.

My first impression is that it was a cheap movie from all the movie trailers.My expectations were wrong.Although it may not be as deep as the graphic novel, they were able to jam enough details in a span of two hours without making your head spin. It managed to create a good balance of action, storytelling, and character development. Natalie Portman was an excellent actress in this movie and played the role perfectly.The only downside is that the Wachowski brothers still do not know how to create a romantic scene!

The movie however is an exception.Reading the origional comic of V for Vendetta is like any great book, timeless. If it is read in 50 years, the reader would be able to relate and understand the injustices of the depicted society.Instead of preserving a possibly poignant message and making a great movie, the writers and directors have created something entirely \\"NOW\\".

The Wachowski brothers should fear the fans.Considering how well the Brothers W dealt with the interweaving of complex ideas in the first Matrix movie, I was willing to be optimistic about their ability to adapt one of the most brilliant works of fiction I'd ever read. I am however, thoroughly disappointed. They might as well have put Keanu Reeves in the role of V.The graphic novel is a thought-provoking discourse on freedom, anarchy, and the price we pay for security. It is many-layered, complex, and intelligent - little of this translates to the screen. Entire characters and plotlines are rewritten or ignored in the film version, and important themes are lost entirely.As a standalone piece of work, it might suck less.

Of course, so lets make it PC, show anything not far left as fanatical with untrue labels, and make it right wing bad! That way we please all the liberals who are running Hollywood! And then they can have Brokeback Mountain AND V for Vendetta for under 30 dollars! So sad that so many of the sheeple just wander around eating it up hook, line and sinker.Natalie Portman is great but I just felt so sorry for so many of them in this film because the story was bastardized for political purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product it arrived a few days early. which of course is a good thing. great product at a great price.","review":"great product it arrived a few days early. which of course is a good thing. great product at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"paranoid violent movie","review":"I was stuck somewhere when this movie came on and ended up watching parts of it. If your idea of a hero is someone filled with hatred, bitterness, fantasies of violence and revenge, plus able to torture a poor innocent girl for her own good; then this movie is for you. The very philosophy behind this movie is sick and twisted. Of course, Hugo Weaving is a great actor even when he is forced to act from behind a Guy Fawkes mask (I think that's what it was), and Natalie Portman is good, but it's not her best role. I don't care for movies with agendas and this one clearly has an axe to grind. I want to be entertained--this was NOT entertaining. It was depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie...","review":"The most important thing about the movie is that all you need to know is in it. You just have to be able to sort it out to understand it.Do we praise the character 'V' for his actions? Would we cheer for the actions of a real person who takes such measures? And would our answers be different if our government controlled the media and launched terror against our own citizens? Would we be willing to stand against our government if it did? I tend to think these questions are the ones that the movie makers want us to ponder upon. They've succeeded quite well, from my point of view. Mind you, its not a direct adaptation from the graphic novel.The extras are very good on the disks.All-in-all, well worth owning. My highest rating for a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The farcical WOT","review":"This is not a movie for the faint-of-heart. It reaches down into the very root of the modern political warmaking machine and totally debunks the War on Terror (TM) (copyright) with all its sloganeering and xenophobia. I'm not sure the latter was intended by the movie's producers... it looks more like an attempt to analyze the mindset of hyperambitious politician-types. Nevertheless, the larger message becomes hard to avoid as the movie unfolds because it mirrors our government's actions post-911.If you're into feelgood fairytales, this is clearly not the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not DVD quality","review":"Clearly, this is not up to DVD quality standards. Movie is 640x480 (not 720x480 widescreen), and only 2 channel, vs 5.1 DD audio. Even more pathetic? The price is identical to the actual DVD. Save the money, and the slow download. Buy the DVD, and archive as needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"P is for pabulum","review":"Skip the movie, read the comic books.It is no surprise that series creator Alan Moore removed his name from the film.

(I accidentally started watching in normal Dolby Digital 5.1 and sensed something wrong) After switching the audio I was wowed.The image is top rate as well.The story line is enjoyably complex and makes you think hard about political and moral implications of decisions of government and how the general populous might be manipulated. It's a movie I can watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"I saw this a few years ago, and it is really thought provoking, which is rare in movies nowdays. It makes you wonder how easy it could be to create a dictatorship in which the few own the powerful, especially since nowdays the media will participate because they care more about ratings than reporting. my only complaint was the length, although that is due to my short attention span"},{"rating":"2","title":"Governments should be afraid their people...","review":"This is one of the greatest films I've ever had the opportunity to watch. It's classified as \\"fiction\\" but should be reclassified as \\"prophecy\\". The movie had more than great acting, cinematography, and storyline but it also has (and will continue to have)great relevance. The parallels between the film and reality are truly freighting at times. As a fan of the graphic novel I was disappointed V's political ideologies were purged and the government made far less tyrannical in it's actions.The performances given by Weaving and Portman are tremendous.For a man whose true face is hidden beneath a mask you feel greater emotion coming from V than you would most unmasked men.The greatest success of the film is warning it sends to its viewers: unlike most thins in life if you ignore your freedom it will go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"This is a movie that has great symbolism. Besides that it is a smart action-packed movie that displays great use of slow motion, and the whole \\"matrix\\" special effects that everyone that they needed to use after it came out. This movie is one of my favorites and I think everyone should watch it at least two times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy at first, but serous and important message","review":"When I first began to watch this movie, I saw the V character and was immediately put off by the campy nature of the character, and stopped watching. But after hearing rave praise from friends, I decided to go back and finish it. I am SO glad I did! This movie has a superhero vibe about it, but the message of human dignity and the triumph of human spirit in the face of heinous authoritarianism is wonderful, honest, and an important message. This movie seems prophetic in light of the Arab Spring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and thought provoking","review":"I really enjoyed this movie... really makes you think about the government controls thats for sure!

I also gave the graphic novel 5 stars so it should give some clue as to how good I think this movie is. It pulled at my heart strings, it made my heart beat quicker with action, it had a certain romance about it, and in these strange times of government power grabs it made me stop and think about the world that is being created by our politicians today. Do we really want to trust them with all the newly created powers? Do we really want to surrender our rights and freedoms to them in order to be \\"safe\\"? These things are worth thinking about while you enjoy this wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch how a Terrorist Works","review":"V is a scarred man who has a vendetta against a fictional totalitarian government because they did some wicked experiments on him and other captives. You see how crafty and deadly he has become in his attacks on government property, and you see how he slowly warps Natalie Portman's mind over the course of the film by convincing her that his cause his just and his approach is justified.The movie is well done, and the acting is phenomenal, especially the guy who plays V. This is a film that gets under your skin, a movie that sticks with you days after your first viewing. Recommended for mature adults.Rev. Marc Axelrod"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars","review":"Awesome. Aside from sin city, this is the best comic-to-movie translation (having not read anything prior to the film.) Also, it had a good story and a clear message that wasn't ruined by some fantastic hollywood one liners."},{"rating":"2","title":"improvement on the comic series","review":"Although I have great regard for many of the comics and graphic novels alan moore has done, in the case of V for Vendetta, the series was at times, muddled and the storytelling, not always clear. In fact, the comic series was what kept me away from the movie from so long! I just did finally watch the movie the other day though and was very pleased. It presented the story in a much clearer and cohesive fashion. Usually, hollywood does nothing but screw things up but once in a while, although it's VERY rare, they improve on a comic. This is one of those times. No, moore's unhappy with it. Moore's unhappy with so many things, I have to say \\"get over yourself, Alan\\". they did a better job telling the story than you did. While I really can't recommend the comic--although the art was nice, I can recommend the movie. and I'd honestly give it 4 1/2 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Despite needing some editing, Alan Moore's vision of a 1984-style England manages to come through as both chilling and timely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I MUST HAVE MISSED SOMETHING WHEN I WAS SLEEPING","review":"I keep seeing these great reviews of this movie. Yet, I think I musthave missed something when I dozed off due to boring everything. I fell asleep shortly afer Portman met the \\"V\\" charater(sorry didn't find out his name) only to wake up to seeing her being abused by the same. Did wake up for the final stupid part at the end.

The parallels are truly eerie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"In response to: the person(s) who think this movie is just about action","review":"This is one of the most subtle and enlightening movies that i have ever seen. It had everything, most notably it wasn't a movie that was made for everyone in general. The Wachowskis have done something that is far better than the Matrix trilogy, not for its' action, but for its' plot. And I thank them for making a movie that actually makes a person use their brains. The musical score was absolutely stunning for lack of a better word.My final sentences are BUY THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IT, I mean actually sit down and watch it, and think about how much this is on par with Orwell's vision in 1984. You will be very pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable flick on several levels","review":"Putting aside the political slant on this movie, and the whole Beauty and the Beast aspect, I'd like to just describe the entertainment value I got from it. Many scenes were engrossing in a video game / graphic novel kind of way, especially the whole back story on how the \\"V\\" avenger character came to be. Also, I generally appreciated the treatment of the \\"rebellion vs. totalitarian government\\" theme, although it's often been done before, several times in better ways. A major plot twist about 2/3 thru caught me totally unprepared (most unusual), and really made me think about V's motivations. The acting by Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant, especially considering it was all done behind a mask. A few minor parts of the plot were unconvincing, but overall I recommend it. I saw \\"V\\" for the Matrix creative team connections, and mostly found it a worthwhile experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality Check, folks!!!!","review":"Whew, where to begin? well after reading most of those prior reviews I guess we'll start with the film itself. I don't know what the people before me watched, but this film is at BEST decent, trust me.

The main theme of this film is to murder or inflict violence upon everything you disagree with or that is corrupt, evil, or has harmed you.Its a very base and bestial film that hides its true nature wrapped in eloquent British speech and supposedly high ideals. At least films like Hostel have no pretense, it spoonfeeds its audience violence and sadism for enjoyment. But offers no excuses, justifications, or distortions.This film does the same thing but offers self-righteousness to try and persuade the viewer that the course of action taken in the film is the correct one.Hatred and violence is shown in such a casual way in this film that it offers an easy seduction.The worst type of film IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie adaptation of amazing comic.","review":"This movie is based on an amazing comic and has been adapted into a great movie. The special effects are amazing and the acting is superb. The dialog is top notch from the comic and works well on the big screen. Hugo Weaving does one of the best voice overs in movie history.

I haven't read the original story/graphic novel, but I really enjoyed the visuals and idealistic beliefs portrayed in the film.We do live in a world where the majority of the people are silent, because they lack the conviction to say something. We do live in a world where governments silently threaten the majority. We are in a world where governments do not act on behalf of the people [who voted them in], but instead act on their own agendas. We do live in a world, where sometimes a vendetta by those agrieved by political hurts is the only way of expression. Hopefully this film wakes the silent majority up!A thoroughly spellbinding and enjoyable experience, a must see.Dave"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie.","review":"I like movies that you cant get out of your mind the next couple days after youve seen it.

The government will tell us what to think. But a rag-tag group of renegades will risk everything...to save mankind.\\")That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! Very polished. Great soundtrack. But for people to say its thought provoking, suggesting it had not occurred to them that right wing politicians are ruining the quality of our lives, well, duh.To be honest I thought there were some sincere aspirations until the end. But once the point was made, and the masses were on the march there really was no need to blow anything else up. But come on, this is pure entertainment disguised as something very serious.

The only knowledge I had of this move was from the trailers while the movie was in theaters. I had no clue it was based on a graphic novel. All of that being said...I loved it so much! The story line was excellent, touching, moving, inspiring, etc etc etc. So when I finally got around to getting a blu ray player I knew I would need to get this one (already had it as a regular DVD, but ya know how it is!)In blu ray this movie is amazing. AMAZING. The details you could see were fantastic, right down to the texture on V's coat. I can't say enough about it. Everything is crisp and sharp. The domino scene!!!!!

He does this by setting an example of just what one individual can do by active resistance to this power group which was in control.What is frightening and relevant is that we seem to be getting close to the type of dictatorial government portrayed in this movie. I do wonder if there is anyone out there who can or would do as V did in being able to rouse the populace, or whether there is any populace which would do anything even if someone did very similar things in a similar circumstance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Excellent","review":"Warped and twisted but watch it.

Some awfully subtle jabs at the political right, reminiscent in style of the the far right's own hysterical fears.There is some unoriginal idea of rising up against an oppressor, which falls flat as it is of a type which has no connection with the experience most viewers. It might, however, resonate with the sort of person that imagines that their unpleasant experience at the hands of mundane authority, such as having to pay a speeding ticket, is tantamount to being taken away by the Gestapo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving, boringly predictable....","review":"This is a very slow moving film with a predictable plot and unending dialogue.

They never are. But this is so beyond my worst fears. A great frightening, satirical, political, and also fun and emotional adventure story has been completely ruined. Every single scene that is from the original story has been diluted in some way, not just in the sense of softening the political edge, but just plain making them less emotional, interesting, tense and original. And the new poison storyline makes no sense; it's boring, and poorly executed. And usually good actors like Natalie Portmans (accent is awful), and John Hurt (a clown, instead of the deranged but still dangerous leader of the comic) do worse than ever. This movie might impress someone who never read the original, but only because usually Hollywood action movies are even worse.

It's ig iea stuff examining the extremes of government and policies. It has no 2D characters but instead flushes out and makes you understand even if you don't like) all of them. It's timeless and never needs to be \\"updated\\" because it's about ideas that are still there today and were there long before the book was written.This film claims to be an update on said story. But aparently update means they must skew a balanced look at polotics as a concept into an onslaught on the bush campaign.

It's a little over the top. I'm all for freedom of expression, but this movie takes basic Christian beliefs and twists them to seem opressive.Besides that, it also looks low-budget and cheaply made.

Worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Winning","review":"I would go so far to say that this movie is in the top 10 best movies of all time, hands down. Hundreds of quotable lines, a pure and original story, a mystifying and intriguing protagonist and pure action.

Politicians, watch out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"V for Vendetta (2005)","review":"V for Vendetta, a film version of Alan Moore's graphic novel, is set in a futuristic totalitarian Britain and peruses the chords of politics through the vengeful eyes of a mysterious, masked rebel-fighter known as \\"V\\". Produced by The Matrix's Wachowski brothers, and directed stylishly by then-newcomer James McTeigue, this roaring, action-packed flick manages a rare brand of intelligence and lucratively enthuses the idea that citizens run by governments are nave to the confines of such leadership and are too quick to conform. V for Vendetta perpetrated Hollywood's long-since-owed delivery of a film equally rich in smarts and entertainment value--somewhat of a rarity in the sci-fi and action genres, lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Even after multiple viewings I cannot deny that V for Vendetta has serious flaws--the scenes with Natalie Portman and V don't really click--but the film has scenes of such power and skill that it lingers in the memory far more than more accomplished but less ambitious movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly disappointing","review":"All the right elements here - Matrix filmmaker involvement, Stephen Fry, Natalie Portman, DC comic - this should have been an excellent film.Instead we get one of the lamest screenwriting jobs I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. I kept watching telling myself, \\"The dialogue will get better, the plot will become less predictable, it will get better, just give it another 20 minutes..... ok, another 20 minutes...... ok, just 10 more minutes....\\"Sadly, I didn't listen to myself and instead continued watching - hoping and praying the movie would get better. The acting was fine - they just didn't have anything to work with. The story is the biggest ripoff ever of the much, much better Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.As far as style, I can't dog this movie at all - it's very stylish and clearly a lot of money was spent. Just a shame they failed to include even a half-decent screenwriter in that budget!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder Alan Moore has withdrawn his name...","review":"Pitiful. Moore's comments on the film are justified. His story of facism, Orwell-ion society and supression of the masses has been turned into a liberal social agenda designed to try and attack the world today when in reality the material has nothing to do with our current society. And thats where it failed. I wanted to see an adaptation of one of Moore's master-works, not someone elses take on the subject and characters, twisting a classic of the genre into thier own creation. Don't waste your time. Read the book. You'll be smarter for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd mish-mash!","review":"A bizarre blending of Zorro, The Phantom of the Opera and 1984 - only this time John Hurt is playing Big Brother - all in the style of the TV cult series of the sixties, The Avengers. Sadly, Natalie Portman is no Mrs Peel! It's mildly diverting but anyone looking for something really deep and meaningful will be wasting his or her time. Not an original idea on show."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Film at Odds with Itself","review":"Generally we don't question the abilities of superheroes. We could ask how it is that Superman can fly, but why spoil the fun? This film, however, preaches the merits of healthy skepticism; and we can be excused if we apply the lesson. In this spirit, then, we face the fact that in an Orwellian state of crushing powers a subversive, V, apparently working alone, accomplishes remarkable things and has enough spare time not only to maintain his considerable martial arts skills but also to dress up his successes with fireworks displays. How is this possible? We're given no clue. V FOR VENDETTA presents itself as a film of ideas and then asks us not to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Recommended!","review":"Some time ago, I watched \\"V for Vendetta\\" soon after it came out on DVD. At first viewing, I felt that this film is quite remarkable. This remarkable film was created by Wachowski brothers, whom also created the \\"Matrix\\" trilogy, which is one of my treasures. These films are gifts to humanity for they provided wonderful yet strong analogy of our reality. If you look closely to these films, you will see the underlying messages as relating to our current situations. While both \\"Matrix\\" and \\"V for Vendetta\\" presented the theme of control, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is the best presented as a government's control of the people. This film brought about the idea of how media is being controlled to keep the people 'asleep' or unaware of government or of dictator's doings. The common people portrayed in this film did not see how controlled they are until the up-lifting appearance of a character named \\"V.\\"In my humble opinion, I highly recommended this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great DVD","review":"The DVD is packed with special features, basically anything you wanted to know about the making of the film and the history behind it. The movie is a flawless transfer, with special effects that will stand the test of time.If you haven't seen this film in the theatre, you have my pity, but the film is just as gripping on dvd. It screams loudly \\"People shouldn't be afraid of their government. The government should be afraid of its people\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"V is nothing but a plug for terrorist apologists","review":"If you are a conservative Sean Hannity watching American troop supporting lover of a free and moral and decent society, you will be climbing the walls of your home theater in the same anxiety as men trying to flee the theater from Madonna's portrayal of Evita while the women forced their husbands to stay because of Antonio Banderas (from personal experience). Yes this movie has a vendetta, it is to place all the blame of terroristic acts on a decent and civil society. I cannot imagine a movie that is more of a crime against humanity and a plea for insanity and lawlessness than this one. I'm not going to say avoid this movie, I would say go see it if you are inclined to for what it really is which is Hollywood's secular humanistic pull for placing the blame of the 9/11 attacks on a western capitalist society. This movie was absolutely nauseating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"I equate this movie to a modern-day fable. It tries to teach lesssons using contemporary situations. It's not anti-Western civilization...it emphasizes freedom of thought.It's worth watching.

This movies is nothing but an anti-U.S., pro-terrorist, pro-anarchy, pro-gay mound of junk. I wouldn't have been surprised in the slightest if Bill Clinton was credited as an executive producer and Michael Moore as director at the end. Kudos to the aurthor of the graphic novel for dismissing this movie and publicly saying it in no way repersented his book. If you hate the U.S., love terrorism, see a consipiracy around every corner, and are a general left-wing nut...then this is your movie hands down. However if you're even 1/100th of a decent human being, save your money and buy a movie that is worth watching. If you're looking for a good movie based on a graphic novel without all the preachy politcal propaganda check out Sin City."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie","review":"I'm not going to sit here and write a review on the movie... so many others have done that before me.

Call it a jog down memory lane with music, tv, movies and much more from the 80's. I got this for a friend and she liked it so much that I picked one up for myself. A great mind and a great retrospective to a great time for me and probably a lot of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but some fact-checking needed.","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. It captures the 80s so well. But there are a number of mistakes, which I find surprising. For example, one part says Lauper's \\"True Colors\\" video was the one where she shaved her head and her boyfriend got upset. I was pretty sure that was wrong so I looked it upand it's the \\"Time After Time\\" video in which that happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Back So Many Memories!","review":"I grew up as a teenager (from 13-22) in the 1980's, and I have a special love for the decade, especially the music and television shows.This book brings you back to the '80's for a nice, pleasant visit.

I believe in GOD and JESUS. I don't believe in the way at times in this presentation his head fills up the screen as he drones on stating his personal opinion as fact. Many great Jewish scholars and mathematicians deserve the credit for this actual breakthrough. This DVD sure takes advantage of their work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This was the first Tony Hillerman story I ever read and years later, the beautiful imagery remains fresh in my mind.If you appreciate understated prose that lets a few choice words build an entire vista in your imagination, then Hillerman's booksabout the Navajo country and America's spellbinding southwest are for you. The themes of The Fallen Man don't stray too much fromwhat we are used to from Hillerman -- Joe Leaphorn, now retired, patiently collecting clues; Jim Chee, moving towards the same eventual directionas Leaphorn, but frustrated along the way by supporting characters, his unrequited ardor for Janet, and his own inner self; and the non-Indian characterswho fulfill the role they often do in a Tony Hillerman novel. For anyone who has come to like Leaphorn, Chee and the Four Corners, you'll enjoy The Fallen Man as much as the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASTOUNDINGLY BAD","review":"I have seen better home made bootlegs than this.It seems at points the picture was filmed a mile away from the stage and the sound is to say the least grim.the best way to summarize this is to say amateurish.If you want a really good spanish DVD get Lius Miguel Vivo it is outstanding.Skip this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Did Not Deserve 1 Star","review":"Yes, there were some distant shots, and yes it will not win any awards, but it is a live concert, and it does have some great songs. MP helped start the Salsa/Merengue Revolution, so I am giving them extra stars out of respect. Although I can understand why the other reviewer was disappointed. He had higher expectations which I can certainly understand. I agree with his suggestion regarding the other DVD, and I would also like to be so bold as to recommend the Feliciano DVD/CD, or the Ragga Nacion DVD/CD. The Feliciano DVD/CD has Celia Cruz's last video on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"One of the reviews said that the game has not been released yet, which is hasn't but the demo has been put out on the web for download... so...The demo is extremely fun even though all it contains is the Training and 1 mission. If you are not sure about this game I suggest your download the demo, as with all games.If there is no demo (DOOM 3 & Battlefield: Vietnam) then wait for your friends to buy it so you can try it out without wasting your money!! haha"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game isn't what you think","review":"This game is not what you think it is. I thought this game would be like Socom but sadly...its not. Its more of a strategy click and drag, you sit back and watch all the action type of game. So many control issues and it has a slight learning curve you need to adapt to but by then your dead. Graphics are ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too short and redundant","review":"Initially the game is impressive, but I found myself waiting for things to get hectic and they never did. This is the kind of game that needs 30 levels of increasingly complex tactical puzzles. Instead we get 11 missions that remain very similar intersected by cut-scenes whenever things get too interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six levels?","review":"This game was brief so I'll be brief. It took me one week to beat even with the extra 2 missions for the PC. You don't get much for your money. Full Spectrum is virtually non-replayable. I don't understand how a developer could have had a preexisting game engine and then give you only six levels. The hard work was already done, come on guys. As for the on-line play I haven't been able to get anyone to play with me, so that is null in void. The game play should be approached more like a \`Close Combat'. This is not a shooter rather is a real time strategy game. I will never buy another product from this developer unless they release some more missions for download. PS gamers, start recognizing developers. If they have disappointed you in the past then don't buy from them in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game SUCKS","review":"DO NOT waste your money on this horrible game. I didn't even finish the training because it was just annoying. This is meant to be a war game but to me it seems more like psychological warfare, the people a THQ want to see how long will you last trying to play this stupid game. This is more like chess, pick and pint where you want your pawns to move. The targetting is a joke, you have to select an area where you want the troops to fire but the person you want to kill is like 15-20 feet away the targetting area is 75feet squared (like shooting darts with your eyes closed.) Is this how \\"AWSOME\\" the american army is?? This game is all pro-american, they make it seem like the US army is the best. If this is how they are trained to shoot then I'm not gonna pay my taxes because like this game its a waste of good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd return it, if I wanted to waste more time because of it.","review":"A 350-page book of which the last 238 pages are appendices, a glossary, and an index. 125 pages of the appendices are nothing but a listing of NASDAQ stocks, symbols, and sectors.

Don't buy this book, if you are seeking knowledge about how to trade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoodwinked?","review":"I thought this would be a referance book on electronic daytrading software and how to apply the information gleaned from it. The main point of the first 100 pages was to tell the different places I might find the information I expected to have been in the book. Then there are over 200 pages of appendices listing the different stock exchanges, a list of compainies on the Nasdaq, etc. This would not have been worth the price if it had been a five dollar paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off!!","review":"I couldn't believe that I bought this crap. I didn't learn anything from this book. It has so little content. Most of the book is an appendix listing the stocks on the Nasdaq.

There are better ones out there that provides better details on day trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it","review":"There were very few helpful hints in this book. There are over one hundred pages of the book devoted to listing NASDAQ stocks! How is that helpful? It seems that someone wanted to pad the thickness of the book. In addition, I was disappointed with the misleading subtitle on the cover that says \\"day trade like a pro, starting today!\\" Then she contradicts that (rightly) in the first chapter by saying that she would never recommend beginning to trade after reading only one book. On the the plus side, I think this may be helpful for someone who is a very green beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance, a waste of paper","review":"The book starts with 112 pages of very basic information, information for the totally clueless newbie. If you have more than 3 months of investment experience or if you've read 2 beginner daytrading books or if you've surfed investment sites the last 3 months, you won't learn anything new here. The next 200 pages are references, website addresses, and stuff that belongs in a phone directory. Page 189 to page 313 is a listing of NASDAQ stocks!?!?!? All it shows is the ticker symbol, company name and which sector the company belongs to. NOTHING ELSE!!! I would have rated it zero stars if Amazon.com had such a rating.

I got 1/3 of the way into reading the book when I realized that the rest of the book is all appendices. Approximately 127 pages of the book are names and the corresponding symbols of Nasdaq listed companies. This might have been helpful before the Internet, but now it is a waste of space. It does give some basic information for the begginer who has no idea about day trading, however if you base the price on relevant information, in my opinion, the price should be under 10 dollars. If you have a little knowledge about day trading, you will not get much more info from reading this book. If you have no knowledge about daytrading, you might want to look around first, in my opinion,you can do allot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough","review":"Had just about the information a needed.

For the record, my book has the correct story. It's still awful, though.- No maps. Zero. None.- Descriptions (locations, what to do) are vague.- A lot of secret things (Bottles' puzzles, etc.) are missing.- Brentilda's tips vary in each game so the list in the book is useless.

Especially good for Catholics, since it portrays the Gospel accounts of her life properly (for instance, the angel Gabriel calls her \\"full of grace\\").Two minor quibbles: Mary seems to have labor pains (though it's somewhat understated) and the movie rushes through Jesus' ministry a bit quicker than I would have liked (though this is more a movie about Mary than Jesus, so that's understandable).I watched this movie along with the 1979 Jesus film by the Genesis project; they complement each other very well, each making up for the other's weaknesses. Amazon.com doesn't seem to carry that film, however :-(. But this one is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend you to see, \\"Mary, The Mother Of Jesus\\" instead","review":"...These actors who played the roles of Jesus & Mary were both serious most of the time and they did not show enough love to another. I think the actors were just cold in their characters. I don't think the real Jesus and Mary would have been like that in real life. So the movie of, \\" Mary, The Mother of Jesus\\" & the movie of \\"Jesus \\"from 2000, showed a lot of what their loving characters might have been like. If you want to watch a movie about Mary or Jesus, then I HIGHLY recommend you to watch these two other movies I recommended you - I'd give them both 5 stars. This movie here, I'm not giving it a good score except 2 stars. The two stars is based on the actors performance, other than that; the movie would have been good. So, if you rather see them serious, then this movie is for you. * By the way, the movie I'm discussing is the 1995 movie film done by the same actress.*"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing remake","review":"What a disappointing new release by this author. The book seems to be a random assortment of ideas and past-published material that fails to hold together with a cohesive focus. As a fellow spiritual director, I had expected a presentation of contemplative spiritual direction that would plumb the depths of our ministry.

The second time I went to use it, I noticed it did not seem to work as well, and I thought perhaps the branches of my shrubs might be a bit thicker than the ones I initially pruned. The third time I took it out to cut away dead plants and get my garden ready for wintering over, I found I could cut and cut and cut and nothing happened.

Also, some of the bonus footage is decent: e.g., the 2002 Olympics segment (although again, not enough actual hockey footage); behind-the-scenes footage of the Pond of Dreams shoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I'm extremely disappointed in this so called \\"Ultimate Gretzky\\" dvd. This dvd is for new fans only. There is nothing new in terms of highlites, and very little new in terms of anecdotes. What kind of carer retrospective doesn't even mention his time with the Blues? A dvd with 3 hours of footage should have at least a few rarely seen highlites thrown in for the long time fans. I think that I'm even more disappointed by the fact the Wayne himself was one of the producers. I have the Above and Beyond video from 13 years ago and it's above amd beyond this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"ultimate gretzky 4 disc special edition","review":"Ultimate Gretzky 4-disc Special Editionhi! i think any fan would enjoy this set. it comes with 2 disks of highlights along with 2 disks of complete games! great set for those who grew up watching wayne or those wanting to see wayne in action for the first time. i only wish there was a set like this for the GREATEST....BOBBY ORR!! make some popcorn and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB!!!!!!

Plus the choice of games on this DVD are more the \\"significant\\" nature rather than actual \\"great\\" games. The Oilers DVD is unlike that at all. All the games on there are great and the choices are very solid.The NHL needs to take a page out of NFL Films and learn how to do documentaries on players and teams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Gretz","review":"Great collection - still working my way thought all the games but the initial disk if fantastic - a definite must have for any 80/90's Oiler fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought John Paul Pet Tearless Shampoo because of the reviews!","review":"I have two light colored Malshi's and they get baths every week or two. I've tried various shampoos that are tearless, smell good and lather up nicely. I was hoping John Paul Pet Tearless Shampoo would be the shampoo I would buy again and again but it's not. It's tearless and has an okay smell but it doesn't lather up at all. I had to use way to much when I washed them just to be sure I was getting them clean since without the lather it felt like I hadn't used any at all. I'm now filling the tub with about 5\\" of water and using this shampoo as a bubble bath in between normal shampoos to use it up, since it's more of a rinse off for them instead of a regular bath. If you want a shampoo for your dogs that lathers and gets them clean without having to use copious amounts don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the old Leppard","review":"one song from the the first two albums , thats it really? what about Rock Brigade , Let It Go , Saturday Night ? this stinks . the early stuff is the best . remember that next time you release a greatest hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Get Rocked!","review":"This CD is an awesome compilation of the all the hits from Def Leppard. Many greatest hits tend to leave 1 or 2 good songs off the album but this one captures them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What has 9 arms and 10 legs?","review":"Being in high school in the late 80's, I thought Def Leppard was matched only by Motley Crue and Van Hagar. Truly great pop-metal. Overall a good collection. I realize that Def Lep wanted to present the \\"hits\\" only, but I think it's too bad they didn't show the whole picture. Though I like them all, SIX tracks from Hysteria? That's half that album. And nothing from the first record? I would haved loved to seen \\"Hello America\\" or something from that. You'd think it's inclusion would benefit everybody. Just 1 from High n'Dry too. At least Pyromania is represented by 3 songs. Plenty of ballads, though I'm sure somebody wishes there were more. But on the positive side, what IS here is mostly classic Leppard that will make you def. Now where did I put my British flag muscle shirt?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is a winner!","review":"A great chance to remember a great group. Each song is excellent in its own right. Great upbeat cd. Would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for every Def Leppard fan","review":"Def Leppard was one of the most popular bands of the 80's. They were one of the few metal/rock bands to sell tens of millions of records and were on top of the arena rock scene. This album is a collection of their most popluar music and includes the extremely popluar version of \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" that is not available on the Hysteria album as well as a new song \\"When Love and Hate Collide\\". Vault is a must have for all of their fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"good if you only want the biggest hits!","review":"Vault is good for someone who only wants the groups biggest hits.The dates are misleading it doesn't cover anything except 1 song before '83's Pyromania album.There are many more good songs off of the first two albums that got no exposure on this album at all.I would recommend Pyromania and Hysteria to even casuall fans,there is enough high quality material on those to albums to please any Def Leppard fans.The songs that made it on this album are good,but I'd buy the individual albums,unless you don't have a lot of money to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive guide to Lep Hits","review":"Def Leppard have had a great deal of hits, and Vault has all of them. As a result of VH-1 giving heavy airtime to the band, Vault has been selling shedloads recently. It's quite right too; other '80s metal bands might have been cheesy acts cashing in on the trend, but Def Leppard with producer Mutt Lange invented the concept of metal with huge pop hooks, great melody and huge harmonies, and created songs with substance. The classics are all here, and that's the problem. Because Def Leppard's hits are all on Vault, people are ignoring their other classic releases and their new ones. That's a real shame, because there are so many other great Def Leppard songs. For those wanting an overview of the best known stuff, however, Vault has it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the greatest","review":"This really is a collection of Def Leppard's greatest hits, the most memorable and most popular. \\"When Love and Hate Collide\\" fits perfectly in the middle of the classics as a beacon of sorts of how the new stuff fits the classic mold and where the rest of their new music is going. Nice additions of Pour Some Sugar On Me and Rocket's video versions, the more popular versions of the two. Excellently compiled and produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONLY ONE \\"MUST\\" FROM DEF LEPPARD","review":"IN THIS CD ARE ALL WORTH THE HITS FROM DEF LEPPARD, SINCE THE RELEASE OF THIS COMPILATION THEY HAVEN'T GOT A GREAT HIT, AND HERE'S THEIR BEST AND MOST SUCCESFUL TRACK \\"HYSTERIA\\". THIS IS ALL YOU NEED FROM THEM. FOR YOUR \\"80's ROCK\\" COLLECTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Greatest Hits album ever","review":"If you want all of Def's best known songs with a few new ones, buy this terrific album. You can't go wrong with classics like Photograph, Animal, Pour Some Sugar On Me, and Let's Get Rocked. The new songs are not quite as good as the older stuff but they are still good.This album works good during a workout as it is all energy and keeps you motivated with great guitar and drum beats. This album kicks a** and I highly recommend it as a workout album or to listen to anytime you need a boost of energy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two big thumbs up for \\"Vault\\"","review":"\\"Vault\\" is a wonderful compilation of Def Leppard's hits! Even though I'm partial to their earlier works (\\"High N' Dry\\" and \\"Pyromania\\"), the mix of old and new on \\"Vault\\" is great. There are a few songs that I wish had been included, such as \\"Women\\" and \\"Me and my wine\\". Def Leppard proves once again that a band can get better with age. I would definately recomend this CD to old and new Def Leppard listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Collection","review":"This Def Leppard collection brings back a lot of memories of the 80's and contains some really great songs. In my opinion, the songs that really rocked out were their best, as opposed to the softer, slower songs. I don't think Def Leppard was suited to those slower songs, but really rocked hard on songs like \\"Rock Of Ages\\", \\"Photograph\\", and so on. I just really enjoy their songs where they let themselves go totally, THAT is real rock! Overall, this is a good collection, but could have been better if only the hard-rocking songs were more concentrated on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I wore out my cassettes of all of my Def Leppard albums long ago...

The others as well. The earlier stuff I am not that big on. Some was good at the time....but they have changed somewhat with the times. I for one will buy X and others as I collect this type of music. But yes Vault is not a must have by any means. Yes it is missing some essential Def. So ya if you do want all the really good songs. But if you cant afford all the albums...the Vault is at least a somewhat good solution to having some Def Leppard that you want. Otherwise do yourself a favor and just save for the albums separetly and buy them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the albums High N' Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria instead","review":"The idea of a Def Leppard Greatest Hits package sounds like an easy Field Goal, but their attempt sails wide. No Good!It's not in Chronological order, the sequence of going from Pyromania's \\"Photograph\\" to Hysteria's \\"Love Bites\\" is downright illogical. Whose idea was the song order? It fails to show the Leps change in musical style. Worst of all, it fails to properly represent their first 2 albums. Where, oh where is \\"Let it go\\"?A good song included from High N' Dry \\"Bringin on the heartbreak\\" was severely butchered.Def Leppard made three classic albums in a row, High n' Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria that are essential and well worth the investment. Pick those up instead, I'd avoid this compilation, it's not a thorough overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I absolutely love Def Leppard and have loved them since I was a teenager. This CD is a must have for all Def Leppard fans!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, but why not call it Hysteria Two.","review":"A great compilation of songs but many good songs are not involved. We are missing great songs like Stand up (kick love into motion), and Make Love Like a Man. Pyromania was misrepresented also. Songs like Rock Rock (till ya drop) or Stagefright would have been great additions to this album. Overall it's a classic Lep album anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On!!!!!!!!!","review":"It is quite amazing to me to see so many wonderful songs on one CD. There is not one song on the CD that I do not like. I love all of them. You can also see how Def Leppard has evolved over the course of a decade and a half. You have \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\", then you have songs like \\"Rock Of Ages\\" and \\"Photograph\\" in the mid-80's \\"Pyromania\\" days. In the late 80's, Hysteria came out, and songs like \\"Animal\\", \\"Armageddon It\\", and \\"Hysteria\\" showed how the band had refined it's sound and would continue to do so in the 90's with hits like \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\", and also \\"Miss You In A Heartbeat\\". Def Leppard is one of the best bands ever and this is a wonderful greatest hits package that anyone who loves rock n' roll will love. And I also love the intro to \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album to own","review":"Vault is a good collection of 15 songs from Def Leppard over a wide portion of their prime. There are, of course the powerrock hits \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\", and \\"Photograph\\". But the fun doesn't stop there. This album is loaded with many of their feel good songs and great ballads. Included is the stunning UK hit \\"Animal\\". Truly not \\"the\\" most essential and complete compilation of Def Leppard hit songs, but a great place to start or add to your on-going collection of one of the biggest, most influential bands of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band, Good Choices: Should've Been 2 Discs","review":"I really do not have a whole lot to say about this album that has not already been said by most who reviewed it except to agree.It is a good compilation, but not a complete one.I think a two disc set would have been better. Whitesnake did so as have the Scorpions and a few other bands. With a two disc set, you can have your more \\"pop\\" songs combined with your heavier songs and make a true complete \\"best of\\" set.But, if you are a new rock fan looking to discover who Def Leppard is. This is a good place to start. But, this is not, or should not be, the place you stop. There are a lot of great songs that didn't make the disc. So, explore and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So many hits, so little room","review":"A Def Leppard 'greatest' has to be a 2-CD set. This is an awesome compliation of tunes but too many classics left out to get a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of a great band!","review":"Def Leppard was my first favorite band. I have all of their albums, but I still felt compelled to buy this greatest hits compilation. I'm glad that I did. Not only does it bring back my childhood with such greats as \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me,\\" but I get the added bonus of the excellent \\"When Love and Hate Collide.\\" The only real complaint I have is the way that some of the songs are edited (Rocket, for example). They should have just left it alone. Still though, it's a great blast from the past, from a great band that I hope will keep on rocking for another 20 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Band out there","review":"Just never got into these guys, never will. I got this album a few years back to keep my wife quiet. Well it's been over 2 years now since I've been divorce, and I must say along with my divorce don't have either one of these, got rid of them both. The only highlights Bringing on The...., and Two Steps Behind, that's it my friends. Just too much airplay on radio and MTV. Can you say \\"COMMERCIALISM\\" I knew you could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Pyromania was the first LP I ever purchased back in 1983 (I think that was the year) after hearing the song Photograph on the radio. I then purchased High N Dry soon after that. Def Leppard became one of my favorite bands, and High N Dry is still one of my favorites. I think their last decent album was Hysteria, but they have produced nothing but trash since then. If your going to dish out $15 for a cd, spend it on High N Dry and Pyromania. Hysteria is good, but it was the start of the group selling out. On Through The Night is also good, but isnt as polished as High and Pyro. The bulk of the songs on this Greatest Hits disc are garbage in my opinion.Steve Clarke was the brains behind the group, and one of the most underrated rock guitarists of the 80's. Since his death, they have become a joke...."},{"rating":"1","title":"yo dog!!!","review":"Boooooooo! Def leppard suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckz. BOOOOOOO!

You're dehydrated from the very dry recirculated air and you try to get an entire can of soda instead of a little four ounce cup, why are you so greedy? You don't get the can and later go down the galley (to save putting on a call light and summoning a flight attendant, which makes her feel like servant, and according to this books some FA's just ignore call lights anyway), how dare you take up aisle room or bother the flight attendants!! Flight attendants fly for the free travel and they hate your guts. Bow low before them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum.","review":"This book is little more than a long article and is, I'm afraid, nothing special. Ms. Foss became a flight attendant after that show biz career failed to work out, then wrote this book and some kind of musical based on same. The book is a long series of gripes about the job/passengers/travel. That's about it.\\"Plane Insanity\\" is a similar book but much more entertaining, I would recommend you read that if you want to read about flight atendants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Gothic Romance","review":"This story is a very standard, practically by-the-numbers, gothic romance. It is rather ironic, because the author keeps calling attention to the fact that the heroine is a fan of gothic romance novels, invoking parodies like Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, yet she never once turns convention on its ear. Elements of Rebecca and Jane Eyre are also present, but unlike those novels there isn't much of an emotional payoff here.I found the book to be poorly paced and many themes, especially potentially engaging subplots and seemingly supernatural themes, are introduced but never developed or explored, while many rather tiresome ones (and supporting characters) are focused on fully.(Lastly, I bought this book because I was looking mermaid stories. This book had very little to do with mermaids.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Strings I've Found","review":"I got these strings last week and I really like them. I really like the wound 3rd. Usually that string is really difficult for me to tune because of how the tone differs from the 4th string but with these strings it sounds great. Not totally sure why but I'm giving credit to the relative thickness of the strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lasting Impact","review":"A teacher and a lifelong criminal meet in a pharmacy in a small, out of season French town. The hotel is closed, the thief and his headache wind up at the teacher's big old family house. Days pass. One laconic, one loquacious, each is ever more drawn to the other's life. Saturday approaches; each prepares and subtly prepares the other for the approaching personal crossroads. And for both Saturday goes terribly wrong but brings one last shared miraculous moment and vision to move each man beyond what his life before has been. Meticulously acted by Jean Rochefort and a weary Johnny Halladay and tensely quiet until its jarring conclusion, Man on a Train retains its grip long after the final credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man on the Train","review":"It is very fascinating to see the evolution of Jonny Halliday (remember him in the 60s?

And then watch as the sparks fly.An exciting movie when all is said and done, and a welcome change from the confusing, if not sensorially overloading, Matrix or the cartoonish X-men.Take an evening to enjoy this film and follow with a nice quite dinner with a friend and a glass of French wine...JWZ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greener Grass","review":"A bank robber and a retired school teacher meet in a pharmacy.... It sounds like the set-up to a bad joke but is instead the opening to a fascinating and often charming study of two characters facing mortality who pause to consider what life would have been like if they had chosen different paths.These two paths meet at the aforementioned pharmacy and the two characters compare their differences each with a romanticized view of the role of their counterpart. In the short time they have before their mutual appointments with fate, they attempt to walk in each other's shoes (in one case literally) and each discover the secret of the other's world.The title of the film brings to mind the film \\"Strangers on a Train\\", perhaps intentionally, but here the two men are proposing to swap lives rather than deaths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Class and style","review":"This is what About Schmidt should have been like: regrets about life, but with class and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but puzzling at the end","review":"This is a movie about an unlikely friendship that develops between two very different middle-aged men after a chance encounter in a village drugstore.

Grand Kids love it. Repairs are the issue and you will need them. I have two other Power Wheels products and true to form, this one broke after two months; right on schedule, and much sooner than the high price should allow. Fun fun but inevitable repairs are a HUGE hassle. Our Gnome and the Jeep move at the same pace now. The tires and torque are a plus for yard travel. Battery charge time is is a BIG negative.

First, the production value is horrid. The insertion of a sound track with audience applause is not only cheesy, but it makes it seem as though it is a paid advertisement for the George Foreman Grill.The second problem is that the product lacks content. The DVD is nothing more than a blatant commercial for his book and proposes nothing new.

Having literally gone through over a dozen pairs of the original Stan Smiths, I'd always worn out the soles long before the uppers wore out.

In conclusion, this is an essential for a Pink Floyd collection no argument."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music.","review":"I think the lyrics are kind of weak on a few select tracks on this album, but this might (note: I only said _might_) just be the best Pink Floyd album ever in terms of ambience and guitar. Those are some pretty moving tunes. Plug Old Roger in to the scenario and input his lyrics and I think this could have been the best Pink Floyd album ever, right on top of Animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen a few times before you judge.","review":"When I first played this CD, I thought, \\"This doesn't sound anything like Pink Floyd.\\" But after a listening a few more times, it really caught on. High Hopes is probably one of the best Pink Floyd songs ever. It may sound different than the classic Floyd works that Waters worked on, but that doesn't diminish its quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM THEM?","review":"THE DIVISION BELL IS A GREAT ALBUM. I DON'T SEE WHY PEOPLE SAY IT DOESN'T HAVE THE PINK FLOYD SOUND. IT'S THEIR SECOND STUDIO ALBUM WITHOUT ROGER WATERS. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE DON'T REALLY LIKE THE BAND WITHOUT WATERS. IT'S TRUE THAT ROGER WATERS IS VERY TALENTED, BUT HE GOT ON WITH HIS LIFE AND SO SHOULD YOU. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND REALLY LISTEN TO THE ALBUM. IF YOU FIND YOU LOVE IT, YOU GOT MY POINT. IF YOU STILL DON'T LIKE IT, TRY ONE OF ROGER WATER'S SOLO ALBUMS. OR JUST STICK TO PINK FLOYD ALBUMS THAT INCLUDE WATERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent effort","review":"Good instrumentals with good blues and acoustic rock. \\"Take It Back\\" sound a lot like a U2 song, but that doesn't mean it's not a good song. \\"High Hopes\\" is the real gem on the album. An excellent song with a wide open feel that is accentuated by the tolling of the bell in the background. \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" is a good bluesy song that is trademark David Gilmour. Every song is meticulously crafted into what is one of Floyd's best albums. Prof. Stephen Hawking's appearance on \\"Keep Talking\\" is a very interesting addition. Either way, this album is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilmour, Mason, Wright","review":"Why do people put this album down just because Waters is no longer in the band. Get over it, Waters choose to leave the band. If you have a problem with the new Pink Floyd, buy their older albums or Waters solo albums. Actually, Waters solo albums all got bad ratings when they were released, what does that tell you. Pink Floyd is still Pink Floyd without Waters, it's Waters who's nothing without Pink Floyd. Besides, Pink Floyd is only a name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live Pink Floyd","review":"The Division Bell is a great album. Listen to the song Poles Apart, it could be about Gilmour and Waters. Any Pink Floyd fan should get this album, it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Floyd","review":"I loved this album. I have been a PF fan for years, I grew up with their music. (2nd generation Floyd fan). I admit I had to listen to the album a few times, but I really love it. Here we are 7 years later (Where is the new album??????) and I still listen to it and my son (3rd generation PF fan) listens to it also. Gilmour's strong suit was never lyrics, but the music is haunting and beautiful. I was never a Roger Waters fan (his voice always sounded like something or someone in agonizing pain), but he could write some great thought provoking lyrics. The mix of the four (Gilmour, Mason, Wright and Waters) will always be Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon IS Pink Floyd), but Gilmour and company (without Waters) is great to listen to also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Day Masterpiece !","review":"The Division Bell album has so much to offer,Rock&Roll,Acoustic Ballads,Blues,all cleverly fused together to make an incredible Pink Floyd album.It's a melodic MONSTER!!!!David Gilmour truely shines on every cut.I can't stop playing it, a definite step to sounding like some of the classic Floyd albums, most Pink Floyd fan's should find it to be a very worthwhile purchase for there cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This shows what Post Waters Pink Floyd can really do!","review":"I must say that I am very impressed. After the dissapointing A Momentary Lapse of Reason I was pretty leary when buying this album. Quite honestly it ranks up there with Dark Side, WYWH, and The Wall. Musically it eclipses everything the Floyd has done since WYWH (Shine On You Crazy Diamond). Gilmour's guitar work is simply astounding and I was very pleased to see Wright getting the lead vocal on a track. Lyrically it is still isn't up to par with some of Waters work but it isn't bad. All in all, it's one of the best Pink Floyd albums out there and proves that the post Waters Pink Floyd is doing just fine. Besides, any Floyd fan who thinks that Waters actually wrote the music to all those he has his name on is fooling themselves (or better yet, is letting Waters ego fool them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd will never die!","review":"I don't understand this big battle over who is best Roger, David, or Syd. To me they are all equally great and along with Richard and Nick they make Pink Floyd the best band. The Division bell is almost a review of their past only without the typical references to Syd. It is really about themselves and not dwelling on everything else they have written about. By the way keep listening after High Hopes for another minute and you'll hear a faint telephone conversation between a guy and someone named Charlie, almost a highlight of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music for soulless robots to listen to","review":"What made Pink Floyd so amazing was their ability to write such evocative music, music that made you feel...it sends chills down the spine, makes you laugh, makes you cry...but this album makes me want to puke. It sounds as if pink floyd has finally done what happens to even the best...they got old. I suppose they must have fallen into a rut. Gilmour's playing licks he used on every one of his solo albums, and the singing, while passionate, begins to drone on uninspiringly after the first five minutes. For any band, this is a bad album. For pink floyd, it's abyssmal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Pink Floyd","review":"The main reviewer of this album must be a techno-freak or something, but to the rest of us who like Pink Floyd this is an AWESOME album. I have owned this album for over 6 years and I still love it. Cluster one is a memorable piano/guitar opening which reminds of an elegant car ad. The best song on the album is high hopes, which embraces the atmosphere of the whole album. This album is really one of the only ones I have ever listened to that manages to take me to a different world (it reminds me of green wetlands). Other songs that are very good on it is A great day for freedom, Take it back, and especially Coming back to life. If only I can find more music that are as freshly unique and masterfully crafted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unappreciated","review":"When first hearing The Division Bell you get an awkward feeling because it's not quite like the other great albums. This album is different and you must warm up to it. Many people will try to say its not that good because it was made in the 90s or other reasons but this album is very good. It shows just as much musical talent as Dark Side of the Moon with less effects. It's a cleaner Floyd album but never the less it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Floyd Fans Should Open Their Eyes","review":"I am not a newcomer. I own the classics of Pink Floyd such as \\"The Wall\\" \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" \\"Animals\\" and many more. Yet Division Bell was very surprising. After having a huge downfall after Walters left, I thought that my favorite band was done for. Yet, here comes the Division Bell, with hits such as the intrumental \\"Marooned\\" and \\"Coming Back to Life\\" The album even starts amazing with \\"Cluster One\\". With some little lows \\"Keep Talking\\" and \\"What Do You Want From Me\\", it still ends magnificent with \\"High Hopes\\" which is probably my favorite song out of the whole album. Floyd fans who think this album is horrible should be ashamed of themselves. Its not \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" but it still captures my attention and I can't help listening to it again and again. Very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid pink floyd","review":"all in all a good cd. Definately not there best but still better then most bands greatest hits. the album starts off slowly but builds up steam. it seems the best tracks where placed at the end. My personal favorites where Keep Talking and the climactic High Hopes. If you are a Floyd fan you will like this cd. if u are not chances are you wont."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Dark Side, but Pretty Darn Good","review":"Ok, if you stand it up against Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here, it comes up short. But compared to the other music being produced in early to mid 1990s this album is one of the best of the decade. Inventive, interesting, listenable, moving and dynamic, these old British guys (less the other old British guy Roger Waters)make an awesome album. Gilmore's playing is still unique- no one else can quite capture his phrasing and tone. If you want to own the 10 best Rock albums from the 90s this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"This being the first Pink Floyd album I bought that lacked Roger Waters, I wasn't expecting a lot. How could Pink Floyd possibly go on without the genius behind Animals and The Wall? However, I was pleasantly surprised! This album helped to show me just how good of a band-leader Gilmour was, and how well the band got on without Waters AND Barrett. Songs like \\"What do you want from me?\\", \\"High Hopes\\", and \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\" are all great songs that feel new but also reminiscent of Pink Floyd's good ol' days of crazy overdubs and beautiful lyrics. A nice sort of \\"Getting back to our roots\\", especially after the dry and Water-dominated \\"The Final Cut\\".I would HIGHLY recommend this album to any Pink Floyd fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A touch of the new.","review":"Written years after the previous works, \\"the division bell\\" has much of the raw feel of the previous works while still being decidedly modern and polished.

Probably the bands biggest move into popular sound it is a must for all CD collections"},{"rating":"1","title":"My, how the mighty have fallen","review":"Now, when I first got this album, I thought it was a vast improvement over Floyd-Mach-Three's last effort, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" But, the more I listen to it, the more I realize it's just a bunch of boring tripe.There are good songs on the album, but not many: \\"Cluster One\\" is good. Good way to open an album. \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\" is a triumphant return to the world of vocalizing for Mr. Wright. It's a fine, jazzy tune. \\"High Hopes\\" is a nice way to end the Floyd's career. Very reminiscent of past songs.The rest are either poor, or listenable only. \\"Keep Talking\\" grates on my nerves severely. I used to like \\"Coming Back to Life,\\" but it's just worn thin with me. \\"What Do You Want from Me\\" has alright lyrics, if only they had come up with original music. \\"Have A Cigar,\\" anyone?Skip this. Get \\"Saucerful of Secrets.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Lapse of Reason, but that's not saying much","review":"This is a far better album than Gilmour's previous Floyd album without Waters. However, it is still far inferior to Pink Floyd's brilliant albums of the 70's, as well as Waters' solo album Amused To Death. Some of the songs are pretty decent--they all lack emotion, but are fairly melodic. The \\"What do you want from me\\" song is really annoying, though. I like Gilmour's solo albums a lot better than this, however. Reccommended only is you already have everything else Pink Floyd has made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic Drivel","review":"I have all of PF's official releases, lots of individual solo works, and plenty of imports......The Division Bell is not Pink Floyd....I have the impression that this album is three dudes and a hoard of studio men/record execs attempting to sound like what they think \\"Pink Floyd\\" is supposed to sound like.....it is unfortunately musically bland at best, and the lyrics without Roger are mostly lightweight cheese. Gilmour's guitar is still true, and some of the instrumental passages are ok, but it is a shame that this albumm bears the name of the band that has released so many classics in their time....Formulaic Drivel....I ended up giving it away; sad, eh?."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"I received this in record speed, especially during the holiday mail chaos.

But this album showed everyone what that can do. Even without Waters' lyrics, they were trying to do their effort on the musical power. So this album could be very different with others Floyd's album. Anyway, the Cluster One, Take it Back, and High Hopes are really brilliant work from Dave and Richard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"David Gilmour is as much of a musical genius as anyone else who has ever carried the Floyd name.

I was never a fan of Roger - Captain Ahab - Waters, but I agree with his saying the band died creatively many years ago. Also, with all these dozens of extra musicians playing one must ask: who the hell is Pink Floyd? The three remaining old men? All twenty people on this record? Answer: whatever sells! And millions of sentimental idiots like me forked over the $17.95 and listened hopefully to Son of Dark Side VII. Sure it sounds like \\"Pink Floyd\\" but moves me not at all.

There is Pulse aswell that's pretty damn good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faux Floyd","review":"Folks, you really can't have a true Pink Floyd album without Roger Waters. They can call it what they want, but this is Gilmour and Crew and it's not all that good. Not nearly as intellectually steeped as real Floyd and not as passionate. They do a nice job creating the Floyd sound at times and the production/sound quality is fine, but this is just not the real thing. Gilmour's latest work \\"Smile\\" is far better and it also features Rick Wight (RIP.) In my opinion, Smile works much better because Dave is not trying to be Pink Floyd, but is just following his creative instincts. This is the last album any Floyd fan should buy. The best reason to own it is to have a complete collection, which is why I have it. For those just getting into Floyd, I'd recommend Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here. Division Bell is one of the very few ways one could go wrong with Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently, Gilmours wife isnt a very good writer","review":"Roger Waters, the creative genius, couldn't take the non-stop crybabying from David Gilmour and Rick Wright who never seemed to have anything to contribute and so he left Pink Floyd. So, with all the talent gone from the band all that was left were the three Ringo's of the band.So, Gilmour did all he could do....beg his wife, Polly Samson, to try to sound like Pink Floyd and write lyrics. Well, she tried and the result was this album.It's bad folks......REAL bad.Buy Animals, buy The Wall, buy The Final Cut, but for heaven's sake do not buy this awful, awful album. It is just a cardboard epitaph to a great band that stopped being great when the genius behind the band left in 1983.The only purpose of this album is to make more money for David Gilmour which he is obviously using to buy cheeseburgers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"Already had my own copy and bought this one as a Christmas present.

It's smooth, generic pop music that evokes sensations of cellophane and artificial flowers and bright shiny linoleum floors and cold steel buggies. It really fits in well with our society, I think. I gave it a low rating, though, because I was expecting to hear the Pink Floyd. But now that I think about it, TDB may be a Gilmour/Mason/Wright excursion into postmodern irony. On that level, it certainly succeeds. Okay, I get it now. Well done, guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Here is a completly objective review: this album [stinks]. The \\"atmouspheric\\" sounds are cold and hostile, the melodies and hooks are feeble, the lyrics are ...drivel, and the (over)production is disturbing and alienating.Fans of this album always claim that those who critisize it only do so because they are \\"pro-waters\\", and don't give it a chance... The real issue here is that people are blind in their worship of \\"pink floyd\\", and are willing to accept and be brainwashed in to thinking that this [stuff] has something of value, which it most certainly does not. It's an insulting parody of what pink floyd used to be. Gilmore, Wright, and Mason have officially joined the ranks of sell-outs, and I hope they're happy. Roger Waters and Syd Barrett are the only members of the group I have respect for anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold and distant, album leaves me empty","review":"I just cant warm up to anything on this album. It reminds me of some of the NewAge stuff back in the 80s mixed with some of the candy rock of the time. Like George Winston's piano on \\"Winter\\" where the pauses between the notes added meaning. It seems Gilmour was playing with the space between the notes. Definitely not the space between his ears. If you like this try Jean Michelle Jarre or Kitaro. They do a much better job. Lord knows I've tried to listen to MLOR and Division Bell but PF truely died with the parting of Waters. This is just retire money for Gilmour or he as gone by way of Sid Barrett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn! Wake me when it is over","review":"It is truly sad to see how far this once great band has slipped. To say this last effort is uninspired is a mild understatement. This is another David Gilmour mockery. The sad thing is that, it is really not Gilmour at all. Since nobody left in the band really has any vision or anything to say, they had to hire song writers to pen most of this garbage. I guess they told the writers to try to do a parody of an earlier Pink Floyd album. Sadly, they chose to parody \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" Tragic, however I guess David needs the money. Lord knows that cheeseburgers are expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pink Floyd album ever.","review":"This album is a disaster. If you can imagine the sound of slow rock/jazz mixed with new wave and done in the suckiest way possible . . . it would still be better than this album. While earlier albums were genious, this is a wannabe album in that same pattern. The songs sing a bunch about nothing, whereas when you listen to earlier albums, you can almost see a mysterious land and/or concept that many songs allude to. After listening to this album once, I immediately had to pop in ummagumma (an earlier album) and listen to \\"The Narrow Way\\" just so I could hear brilliance once again after that crap. This album is almost slanderous to the great name of Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Fanboys Only","review":"This album is nothing more than fanboy fodder for people who will blindly praise anything with the words \\"Pink Floyd\\" on it. And I'm in no way a Roger Waters sympathizer; his solo work (which should technically include The Final Cut) is every bit the uninspired mess that the two Floyd albums without him are. That explosion you hear at the end of The Wall is the symbolic end of the musical genius/relevance of all involved. This album is to Pink Floyd what We Can't Dance is to Genesis: an embarrassment that isn't even in the ballpark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifically overrated!","review":"While I typically do not make it a habit of reviewing albums I do not like, I make an exception for this particular album because it is maintaining a four star rating, which it in no way deserves.This is the worst album \\"Pink Floyd\\" ever made, and compared to the thoroughly mediocre 'Momentary Lapse of Reason' and the 'UmmaGumma' studio/noise tracks, that's actually saying more than you might think. Only Floyd fans who own every other album PF ever made, as well as the first two Waters solo albums plus all the Syd Barrett solo stuff should even think about buying this waste of polycarbonate."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET WATERS & GILMOUR BACK TOGETHER?!!!!","review":"This does have some good \\"Floyd\\" moments both lyrically and musically. BUT IT HAS NO EDGE!!! I am so disapointed by Gilmour's solo album and by this album now that I've busted it out and tried to give it another round. It sounds like Dark Side after hearing Gilmour's new album, but it still stinks. Waters was the edge and the thunder of Pink Floyd and Gilmour is just floating around without him. It would be like calling The Beatles The Beatles without Lennon. I've seen Waters live and \\"Pink Floyd\\" in '94 and Waters show had more heart and soul. The Floyd show was cold and meant for fans who think Gilmour's name is Pink Floyd. The sum was greater than the individual parts in Pink Floyd and they all continue to show it.

People will always complain that it's not the original Pink Floyd without Rogers fronting, well, i'll tell you strait: the band with Rogers fronting isn't the original floyd either, so stop your bitching. We'd all have been better off with Syd staying on as the frontman, then we would have been able to enjoy floyd's dreamy creative peak with a sense of good humor too. I don't care if you enjoyed Rogers more or not, this IS pink floyd, and this is another good album by them, that DOESN'T sounds like a Rogers-era album, which is a plus.

But maybe that was their best! Since Roger Waters has left the band, they are not creative anymore. Never! I still remember the day I bought this album. With big hope, and Bamm--. What a disappointment!! I do not know if Roger Waters was really ego mania or something arrogant. But he must have been the real core of Floyd.

But what they deliver on \\"Division Bell\\" is a very uneven project that can't be saved by a cast of thousands -- they use extra musicians, vocalists, and even LYRICISTS!Sadly, at times, their efforts are downright laughable (\\"Wearing the Inside Out\\"). Mostly, however, they serve up lengthy, meandering ruminations on hate that include not-so-subtle jabs at former band member Roger Waters. \\"Hey you... did you ever realise what you'd become?\\"And after an hour, all Gimour can conclude is \\"you can't just win.\\" However, the music purchaser CAN still win by avoiding \\"The Division Bell\\" and sticking with the band's classic material from the late-60s and 70s.These days, Pink isn't well."},{"rating":"1","title":"More poor man's Pink Floyd?

I'm not just being anti-Gilmour/pro-Waters either, because I actually thought that Momentary Lapse of Reason was a fairly decent CD. At least they were performing like a band again. Unfortunately, this album gives us more reason to understand that Waters wasn't just trying to be a perfectionist, he was simply trying to ensure the production of quality music, of which little is found here. Nobody seems to have the ability to write a decent song without bringing in dozens of collaborators, and Rick Wright's singing is probably the worst part of this entire production, almost as bad as the computer-generated vocals on Keep Talking. Do yourself a favor, check out Roger Water's \\"Amused to Death\\" for a taste of how good the Floyd USED to be. It ranks miles above this embarassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sure cure for insomnia","review":"Waters without Gilmour is melody-free and as mean-spirited as they come. Conversely, Gilmour without Waters is brain-dead and tedious. This record is vastly overproduced and under-composed. Somewhere along the line Gilmour even lost his beautiful guitar tone, and traded it in for a sterile-sounding roar. It's hard for me to tell one song from another on this record; the only emotion I feel is a vague sense of relief when Gilmour stops singing the dreadful lyrics he and his girlfriend concocted to bridge the gaps between aimless meanderings. Roger Waters wasn't the Pink Floyd, but this is proof that David Gilmour isn't the Floyd either.

As a guitar player I must admit that Gilmore's style and tone is beyond reproach and the songs are fresh and performed with an amazing feel. The production, of course, is immaculate.

I will try what the other reviewer suggested and see if bending the pieces a little might help. Further, the egg comes with a long tag that needs to be removed for better play. Removing the tag is not so easy as it is well sewn onto the product, and the egg is easily damaged when trying to cut it off (don't bother trying to tear it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but hard for the kids to open","review":"I really wanted to get my boys a few of the eggs because their friend had one similar to the Haba eggs and they loved it.

It was wedged in so tight there was no way to get my finger in between the egg and her lip without hurting her, which is exactly what ended up happening. By the time we got it out, her mouth was bleeding and she was throughly freaked out and in pain. I felt awful and wished I had never bought this stupid egg for her older sister. It really never opened right as others have mentioned.

I'm not exaggerating, I'm a very strong person, but can barely get them opened once in a while. Because they are so hard to open, my kids used their mouths, trying to pry them open...the metal bent, the paint scratched off...I ended up throwing the shell part away b/c I was worried about them getting hurt with them.

There is heavy Cypress Hill influence, but Funk Doobiest has a more comical take (not so gangster). Give it a listen and give the guys mad credit.

Yet, there's something reassuring about these self-styled troubadors, voicing anti-war thoughts for the masses back in '06 on a 'freedom of speech' tour as documented here. Yes, they were better back in the 60s when their songwriting chops were fresher. But give them credit for putting themselves out there with an audience divided by the message. I wondered why some fans sounded put off if they bought tickets. Did they expect just a routine rock concert, and no messages? They couldn't have been real fans, then, since CSN&Y were singing protest songs back in the late 60s and have never stopped. Free speech is always a very difficult issue in the land of the free."},{"rating":"1","title":"De Ja Vu","review":"I think the Audio De Ja Vu album is one of the best things ever done.What an incredible disappointment to see this DVD.

Instead, it's 90 minutes or so of Neil Young's personal anti-George Bush agenda. This is a total propaganda film, and I believe the majority of people out there go to a concert to hear the music and not to attend a political rally, which is what most of CSNY's shows from this documentary regressed into. There is no doubt that CSNY is one of the greatest bands ever, fueled and led by the musical genius of Neil Young, but when a Canadian like Neil Young becomes over-obsessed with American politics, it greatly detracts from the music and diminishes the rest of the band as well, who I'm sure were coerced into placating Neil Young by kow-towing to his political ranting in order to secure him for a very lucrative tour.

His second album to me takes him to another level. This time he tries to get a little street on his fans with jams like \\"Keep it on the Down Low\\" and \\"Up Around my Way\\", but where he really excels is the love ballads. The lyrics in these songs rival any great lyrics from anyone, hands down! Like in \\"Every Beat of my Heart\\" where he says,\\"I don't care what other people say, here underneath the stars, now Jupiter and Mars don't seem so far away....\\". CLASSIC! And who in their right mind could forget the lyrics in \\"Still in Love\\" along with the beautiful orchestra music in the background. WOW!

It helps you understand why people act the way they do. People have been shocked when I have been able to tell them THEIR birth order after being around them. Whether you have children or not . . .

I think a lot of the birth order theory is pretty accurate; it actually did make me feel better to know my perfectionism is partially due to my first-born status, and therefore not ENTIRELY my fault!That said, the writing is tripe. The language is incredibly cheesy, VERY pop, and very simplistic. It's bland, and the author's sense of humor and cultural references are VERY grounded in his generation (which just makes him sound annoyingly out of touch). He also draws excessive attention to himself, his family, and his accomplishments, and he name-drops a LOT.

So, nothing whatsoever against Bethany or her family.However, I think Hollywood's execution of Bethany's story in this film is completely lame. It is so chock full of nauseating cheese and crappy acting (mostly by Carrie Underwood and Dennis Quaid) that I quickly lost interest.

Its hard to find a good, clean movie for the entire family to watch together ~ this is one of them!

I hate to call it an accident as a shark bite is NOT what I would consider an accident, but don't know how else to phrase it.Anything is possible, if you have the forbearance and strength to work through it.

I only reccomend this to kids at least 8 or 10 years old because of the shark scene and they might get a little bit bored with it. I did get a little bored, but I still reccomend it.

They had a solid real-life story, enough of a budget to have Hellen Hunt and Dennis Quaid and some gorgeous surfing based shots and yet I think it was the worst movie possible that had those 3 elements involved.

Without a doubt the author makes a compelling case for why the U.S. stock and bond markets are likely to underperform for the foreseeable future. This is not an easy or fast read, but definately well worth the time of anyone who wants to understand the fundamentals so they can be better positioned for investing successfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let-down!","review":"This book is too tedious for people without math aptitude. (Full Disclosure: I have advanced math abilities.) It does indeed plod along and includes tables that are unreadable because of the amount of detail. Fortunately, they can be downloaded at the author's web site and blown up to a barely readable 8 X 11 in. size. (This won't help the color blind, however.) All comes together in Chapter 11, i.e., what do do. His completely unoriginal proposal: ladder bonds and re-balance your portfolio. Really? The advantages of this approach over standing still are barely discernible in his graphs showing the benefit. This book is like so many financial books, they tease and tease and let you down when they tell you the trick. The real trick most of these books reveal is to write a book that is mostly filled with promises disappointingly delivered in the final chapter and give it a catchy title so that people will feel they must buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How and why secular market cycles affect the market","review":"Unexpected Returns: Understanding Secular Stock Market Cycles is an in-depth answer to the simple question: why is the stock market acting differently in the 2000s than it did in the 1980s and 1990s? Based on years of extensive research, and written by the founder and president of Dallas-based investment firm Crestmont Holdings, Unexpected Returns explains how and why secular market cycles affect the market over periods as long as years or decades. Presenting advanced financial theories in terms as simplified as possible for the lay reader to absorb as he or she progresses through the book, Unexpected Returns covers the history of the stock market, secular cycles, so-called \\"financial physics\\", solid investment philosophies and strategies, and much more. Highly recommended for anyone with a serious interest in learning just how the stock market works, whether for theoretical or down-to-earth practical use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Individual stocks and indexes don't always move together","review":"Easterling has written a good book. The scholarship is there. Print quality is excellent and graphs are pleasing to the eye. On the downside,the author repeats himself unnecessarily at several points. The data on long term variability in the market and PE ratios is useful and illuminating but one must remember these are correlations and not numbers produced in a scientific experiment. Cause and effect can not be determined. Readers should note that the book is about the market as a whole and not individual stocks. Skilled (or perhaps lucky) investors in individual stocks can still beat the averages even in periods where the market is producing small or negative returns. (Easterling's solution to a so-so market is to invest in Hedge Funds, the downside of which makes many investors nervous). Nevertheless, this is a useful book with a broad, scholarly perspective on stock market behavior. You will be a better investor for reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not much practical info","review":"Author does a very nice job of providing the groundwork for expectations in the market by looking at various periods. Overall it is a nice book and I especially like the color figures. However, I would have liked to have seen more realistic applications. Theory and historical data can only help you so much in the stock market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Returns","review":"This work must be read in conjunction with the crestmont research website which provides updates to the charts illustrated in the book. A great analysis on investing in bear markets. These stratigies coupled with absolute return investing should be part of many portfolios in these challanging economic times. If this book was revised to reflect current market conditions it could be one of the most important works on investment.

I only wish I had purchased this book when John Mauldin first recommended it months ago. Following the trend in various sectors was easy then. I have lost money trying to continue to sail with the trend, and with today's volitilty, a system that no longer works. With Mr. Easterlings help, I now am aware I must tack, jibe, and yes even row, in the direction created by cycles of volitilty and forget buy and hold. Although it means I must work harder to be a success with my investing, this book has been a very timely addition.

Without him, it would have been just another Van Damme movie set in an eastern European country with bad local actors. The plot was simple, a couple loses their daughter and has to enlist Van Damme's character to help get her back. Anna-Louise Plowman was adequate as the near hysterical mom who's not quite the shrinking violet you might expect, and Charlotte Beaumont was terrific as the daughter. But it was Flanigan and his expressive face that stole the show. Let's hope this exposure leads to bigger and better roles. Oh, and Van Damme was more like his old self than usual also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"This was a very good DVD - which I hadn't really expected. Has some good action, a good story and Joe Flanigan shirtless, what's not to love? Honestly I thought JCVD and Joe F did an excellent acting job in this one and would not mind seeing them team up together again. The story has a few plot issues and some of the explosions are a bit underwhelming but other than that the movie carries you along at a good pace. I'd recommend it.(also saw it on Google Play when it showed up last week, still buying the DVD)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Flanigan rocks!","review":"I have to admit that I bought this movie as a fan of Joe Flanigan. Not really a fan of fighter films or JCVD films. I was pleasantly surprised that I found the movie engaging all around. Sad that it deals with an issue of human sex trafficking, but the movie dealt with the topic on a more personal level. All the acting was very good--I think Joe Flanigan was cast really well--he brought depth and real emotion as the frustrated, proactive distraught father of the abducted girl. Overall a decent film, I think will satisfy JCVD fans, Joe Flanigan fans and the casual viewer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"6 bullets","review":"it was truly a van damme movie, action and passion.

This promo was sent to me by a friend in the industry who knew I was a old Ministry fan from way back. Truth be told, it sat on my shelves for way to long before I listened to it.The fact is this album was way before it's time. Had it come out in 2001 they would have been headlining the Family Values or Warp tours for the last few years and not been swept under the rug. Much like Infectious Grooves, it will go down in history as one of the true talents that very few of us were lucky to hear of.There are not a lot of albums you can listen to front to back, but there is not a bad song on \\"Lung Fu Mo She.\\" It's a shame we will never hear more from this landmark group.Buy it without regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words...who-ah!","review":"I first heard Marz on ICP's tour...he ripped up the stage.

McMoneagle purportedly writes from his experience with the US Army's RV program, but he documents nothing substantial. His presentation is disjointed and further confused by a gloss of Eastern martial arts philosophy -- he even went so far as to copywrite the term \\"RV do\\" -- enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"The information needs to be updated.","review":"This book has very old information about Remote Viewing, it needs to be updated.

This book is essential to any serious student or researcher in the psychic field. McMoneagle understands the psychological parameters within which the psychic works. It makes no difference if your particular interest in psychic healing, auras or psychometry; what McMoneagle discusses is very relevant to you.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to get a blck belt in remote viewing","review":"This is one of Joe's best works.

Joe McMoneagle made the big GROK happen for me! All my questions answered. His additional techniques helped me realize that I did not have to adhere strictly to the methods I had been learning. That once the discipline had been developed, I could find and utilize my own talents and leanings.Thank You, Joe, elucidation and illuminatation! I bought 2. One to keep and one to circulate. After all, the faster the knowledge of this skill spreads, the sooner humanity can claim its birthright of freedom, knowledge, and Oneness with all that is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much on protocol - nothing on technique","review":"The author dissects RV into protocol; how the paranormal ability to view remotely is harnessed, and method; the actual mental technique(s) by which things and events can be viewed remotely.What the book says on protocol is enlightening and probably very helpful to prospective RVs. The author draws on decades of RV success and failures conducted in a scientific manner, and should know what works and what does not.Readers hoping to find pearls of wisdom on how to develop their own paranormal ability are in for a disappointment. Because in this area, the author offers nothing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"...ummmm. Not so hot.","review":"I do believe this man knows what he's talking about but if you're looking for a manual on practical application of Remote Viewing, don't start here.He rights with a slightly arrogant overtone but does explain some fundamental elements of remote viewing. It's OK, but it's a handbook; Nothing more.And certainly not worthy of some of its former reveiws in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely brutal to read","review":"Let me begin by admitting that I did not even finish this book, because the writing was so awful. Clearly, McMoneagle did not use a ghost writer to assist him -- and he badly needs one. I lost count of the number of times when he said \\"[blah] [blah] which is discussed in Chapter x.\\" This book is such a drugery to read that I just can't stomach another page.Now let me address the content of the book: personally, I find the comparision between remote viewing and martial arts mildly uninteresting at first, and it doesn't get any better with age. I think McMoneagle watched one too many \\"Kung Fu\\" episodes way back when, and it inappropriately spills over into this work.Whatever insights McMoneagle has into remote viewing are utterly disguised and mangled by his inability to form a coherent, concise paragraph. I have never read a published book with such poor writing. My only wish is that I could rate this book with zero stars, because that is what is deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"The name of this book is miss leading...","review":"As a Shaman Priest I was taught from a very young age how to do remote viewing. Remote Viewing secrets is interesting reading but when it comes down to who can and who can't it is completly off the wall from the way our students learn.

I have since tried to find the video on PBS & Amazon but haven't had any luck. It was an hour long and in the American Experience series. Judith Rossner's book is based on Emmeline's story as she states in the forward, but so much is unknown of what really happened the book is labeled fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly Dull","review":"I suppose I'll be the thorn among all the glowing praise for this book, but I found it incredibly dull. Having just ripped through \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\\" I was hoping to have the same type of compelling experience, but was sadly mistaken. I got virtually no emotion from this book and the historial \\"details\\" were so general anyone could have thought them up. The dialogue was flat out bad, not at all like the sharply observed voices of \\"Goodbar\\". This was the writer who, in \\"Goodbar\\", sardonically described Earth as a \\"two bit town\\", so I know she has it in her to produce great wit and great phrasing, but none of that was present in this novel. To me, this felt like a dispassionate \\"college writing 101\\" exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emmeline","review":"I bought a book entitled \\"Emmeline\\" by Judith Rossner. I knew this book was out of print as it was published in the 1980s, so I expected a used book.

But I would recommend it even if I weren't the publisher. It offers great insights into how its Indian characters (and some Americans, too) cope with a globalized world and their own inner demons. Dr. Chatterjee has a promising career as a novelist ahead of him. He's made a noteworthy start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"The plot was on the boring side. The stupid wishsong turned back to normal. And the scions separate for good after the book's over. Well??!! I'm surprised Par was able to use the wishsong at all! If there's going to be another series about the shannarans, some more elven blood would be nice, with the characters wanting to use their magic. 5 stars!!?? You must be kidding. The whole thing was predictable. The parting of the old friends made me feel depressed.

If you've slogged this far through the series, you've had a supply of Terry Brooks to last several lifetimes. What happened to the charm of his first, Sword of Shannara? The epic proportions of this book are just too much. Make the characters human again, please, not just a bunch of pawns who do nothing but suffer. Kudos to arion@aol.com, who has perceptively picked out some of the book's most annoying features. How about a lot of buildup in the first three books, going to waste? How about chapters that jump around from one character to another? It's a literary device necessary for an epic-scale novel, I know, but by the time you reach this book, it's just damn annoying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brooks Masterpiece","review":"This book is so amazing it's crazy. It ends the Heritage of Shannara series and Brooks gets better with every book he writes. The characters, are still phenomenal! (And that's putting it lightly!) Seriously, though the characters are a total success. The battle scenes are cool as is everything else about The Talisamans of Shannara. Awesome book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing ending to a great series!","review":"In the last book in the Heritage of Shannara series Terry Brooks has almost outdone himself. This is certainly his best since Elfstones and might be its equal (First King of Shannara is still the best). Although the basic plot is beginning to get stale, I would still eagerly await a new Shannara series. Perhaps a realistic plot where the Ohmsfords AREN'T scared of using their magic would be nice. The middle is a little boring but from the kidnapping of Wren on it is very, very good. I would recommend this book to all fantasy fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great fantasy!","review":"This a great conclusion to THE HERITEGE OF SHANNARA series and I advise anyone who enjoys stories of magic to read this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Fight For the Four Lands Begins!","review":"The Talismans of Shannara is the conclusion to the sequence started in The Scions of Shannara and continuing in The Druid of Shannara and The Elf Queen of Shannara. All the story threads come together. Coll risks everything to save Par from complete madness. Wren and the returned Elves fight against the Shadowen controlled armies of the Federation. Walker fights the Four Horsemen. It all culmanates at Rainbow Lake where the Scions search for the missing Wren. Par comes face-to-face with his worst fears and the secret behind the Shadowen's power is revealed.It all sets up the events of the Voyage trilogy and the close of this sequence put Terry Brooks in his own league."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same, more of the same, more of...","review":"<sigh> It's sad, really. Terry Brooks has penned some mildly entertaining, albeit not very original, stories in his day, but with each passing novel they grow worse and worse. Now, rather than imitate the-author-who-will-remain-nameless, it seems as if he is imitating *himself*, making for some very poor, and very boring reading.Unless you are one of the slathering Terry-Brooks-can-do-no-wrong fans, I'd suggest skipping this over. Brooks has not improved over the years, and has in fact grown worse, despite what his utterly-devoted-cult will tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely outstanding","review":"this is a gem of a recording, each track is 100% dexter gordon with a dutch backup group. no, the audio quality is not the greatest, but the way the mics are positioned it foregrounds his horn, and dexter's absolutely blowing his heart out, be it hot or cool.unlike many of the more polished albums he made, this has an off the cuff, unrestrained quality, and ballads like \\"what's new\\" are where the approach really shines, with his melancholy sax cutting through plenty of silence.i consider this to be essential listening for anyone exploring the multifaceted dexter gordon."},{"rating":"1","title":"STICKY WICKET","review":"On this 1969 recording, travelling jazzman Dexter Gordon is surrounded by an all-Dutch rhythm section made up of Cees Slinger (piano), Jacques Schols (bass) and Han Bennink (drums). This album was recorded live at the Amsterdam Paradiso, which used to be a church ! The sound is a bit rough, about what you might expect from a decent bootleg, so it's a bit rough around the edges at times, but then, so was Gordon's blowing ! Versions of standards like \\"Willow weep for me\\" and \\"Scrapple from the apple\\" (all rather lengthy, as was the Gordon way of doing things live) are coupled with originals like \\"Sticky wicket\\" (here titled \\"Junior\\") and \\"Fried bananas\\", which would be recorded for Prestige some time later in the same year, and which remained favorite blowing vehicles for Gordon for the remainder of his career. Die-hard fans will enjoy this CD, but the casual listener had better look elsewhere for the best in Dexter Gordon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Misled","review":"This recording by Dexter Gordon actually contains four jazz standards and two of his originals, \\"Fried Bananas\\" and \\"Junior.\\" The advertised CD is full of blues tunes and must be done by a blues artist, not Dexter Gordon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good...cut lousy!","review":"I have to duplicate the other poor review of this blade. Although I am not a fabricator I do a few metal projects and was looking forward to a great tool for cutting thin wall tubing. I made 8 cuts on 3\\" x 1\\" 1/8\\" wall tubing and the fist 6 cuts were like heaven, cut like butter. Because I was skeptical about the performance I cut slowly and did not tax the blade and there was plenty of time between cuts, the blade did not get to war to touch. The last two cuts was when the blade gave out. Up to that point no indication of dulling.Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with aluminum - a lot!","review":"That blade is the greatest thing since sliced bread. In fact it cuts through aluminum like a hot knife through butter. Because I live in Florida, I must use materials for outdoor projects that are corrosion resistant. Ergo, I use a lot of architectural and structural aluminum for such projects. Neither the blade or the stock heats up and the chips are small and uniform. I use it on a 10\\" Radial Arm saw. The cuts are perfect and the precision is within microns. I hardly even have to file or sand the cut edges, as the blade does not make deep kurf grooves as it cuts, as do some other blades. I should have researched and purchased this blade years ago! Once I did all the research online and found the blade I thought would suit my needs, Amazon came throught with the lowest price and free shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and depressing","review":"Being a big fan of \\"Goodfellas,\\" I was looking forward to this documentary. Unfortunately, this is pretty dull. Henry is discovered as a cook in a small Nebraska town that has a significant meth problem. This film covers Henry's difficulties in staying straight and his domestic and drug problems, which are more depressing than interesting. Henry mumbles so bad that the film makers were forced to use subtitles for him. There is very little discussion of Henry's \\"old days\\" in New York and the special features on \\"Goodfellas\\" are better if that is what you are looking for. Thus, I suggest you skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"I thought this would be a good DVD but was very dissapointed.

I did purchase a copy of this CD, but consider it a waste of money, unfortunately. I hope this has taught a lesson...When people watch a movie that's heavily laden with music and is about a person who's in the music profession, and they rush out to buy the sound track, they want to buy the music they heard in the actual movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack?","review":"Ain't so.

The formula was simple-- feature an hour's performance by a popular band, unplugged and follow it up with a release of the same material a short while later. Like the Flower Hour before it, the unplugged series was a huge hit. In 1996, Kiss took the stage and blew everyone away. Armed with Ovation and Ibanez acoustic/electrics, they surpassed everyone's expectation and produced tones equivalent to their standard electric fare.

KISS have always maintained they were about the fans, and I tend to believe it despite the bands obvious money whoring.All the songs on this CD show the guys at their best, the culmination of years of honing their live act is undeniable, and the music just plain sounds great.Got turned on to a couple songs I missed the first time around, and I defy you to watch the video and not grin when Peter and Ace come on stage.Big fake sellouts?

Everyone I know owns a copy of this unique recording as well as myself. Just think if KISS had been around during the colonial times when all they had was acoustic guitars, they'd made everyone flip their wigs !

It's nice to hear the acoustic treatment of songs like \\"Comin' Home\\" and \\"Rock And Roll All Nite,\\" and Ace's cover of the Stones' \\"2000 Man\\" is welcome in any form, but \\"A World Without Heroes\\"? Give me a break. Based on the reception this album got, the band decided to reform for one more tour (or was it two or three?) with the greasepaint and while it initially seemed like a good idea, they soon wore out their welcome, playing by my best count at least three \\"final\\" shows in the U.S. alone.

I also like \\"No One Left To Run With\\" by Greg Allman. It has a Bo Diddly riff and lyrics that just about anyone over the age of 40 can relate to.

I was suprised to find, then, that the performances on this album are just pale and uninspiring.Aside from a GLARING bass error towards the end of Soulshine (which could easily have been overdubbed), the tempos are slow and the delivery is lethargic, with none of the sense of urgency that marks some of their other recorded output (and nothing compared to alive show). It's not a \\"studio vs. live\\" thing--listen to the incredible studio tracks like Blue Sky or recent stuff off of Hittin the Note--it just sounds thin and formulaic.The songs themselves are excellent--it's just that this CD sounds like a recording of pre-tour rehearsal. If you want a solid version of these tunes, buy An Evening With the Allman Brothers--2nd Set.

True Shure microphones are typically very high quality microphones when they are direct from the Shure factory. If you go for the deal, check your microphone as soon as it arrives. If there are problems with your high-end being very sensitive and feeding-back and you have no low-end, it's probably a counterfeit. Shure 57's are pretty well balanced across the board with very little adjustments on your EQ.Go ahead, pay a higher price and buy them from your local music dealer or from an Internet store that you trust.

This Doctor is a bit cranky and crotchety compared to the others and is not yet enamored with the human race, so it's an interesting contrast to some of the later Doctor reincarnations who thought of Earth as a second home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"This movie was a great start for Dr. Who. It is different than the newer show's but that is to be expected. The shows themselves are amazing in their own and begins to show how Dr. Who became what it is today. William Hartnell is a great actor and this is well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Out of Print","review":"This is NOT out of print, just backordered. Don't panic and pay crazy prices. Just be patient and re-watch another episode (you have many glorious ones to choose from)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginnings","review":"This is a must have for all Dr. Who fans. It shows how the program first began. The first serial may have the doctor a little out of his usual personallity. Be sure and watch the pilot of the first show. See how this never aired pilot differs from the first program aired. You'll find the dr. a lot more combative and disagreeable in the pilot. But the Daleks episode is classic doctor, and shows his true nature. We see the doctors most iconic nemesis for the first time and you dislike them immediately. Great place to start your back cataloge of Dr. Who, all the way at episode 1. Be sure and watch all the documentuaries they are very insiteful. Very much worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not your modern Doctor Who","review":"As a 5 star fan of the 21st century version of Doctor Who, I found this entire package a waste of time. To me Doctor Who is intended to be witty and energetic, and brilliant.The Doctor Who portrayed in this package is the total opposite. No one in this cast is witty. The plots are boring and the Doctor is annoying. I think he was meant to be. The crew survives in spite of themselves in these three stories and certainly not because of anything the Doctor does.Even the 1950's series Superman has better plots even though each story here takes several episodes.Not remembering a lot about the episodes I watched as a teen, I was disappointed by this package. I was pleased to see in another package that the third Doctor is starting to be more like the modern one, and even the first Doctor as shown in the story The Three Doctors is an improved character.I was happy to see the historical feature on the DVD set. And some of the comedy skits are entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Whom?","review":"Hartnell is not a very likeable Dr. Who. The acting is over the top, and the sets are, well, childish. I have to keep reminding myself when this series was made. I have a Flash Gordon from an earlier time and find it less grating than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good looking versions of the beginning of Doctor Who","review":"If you're a Doctor Who fan you certainly have a copy of these first episodes downloaded from somewhere or other, or on a VHS tape in a pile behind the coach. You should buy these disks instead of watching those nasty old copies. These have as good of a look as is possible from the source material, and really mean that you can appreciate the storytelling without the distraction of scratchy and grainy artifacts on the video. Instead you can be distracted by the notion of all props costing less than you have in pocket change in your pocket right now.It's not the modern Doctor Who, but it is Doctor Who and his beginnings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monumental","review":"Whether you stumbled onto Mandrill's page or knew exactly what you were doing when you got here - PICK UP THIS ALBUM.

There a good quality strap for a fair price. I recommend these to anyone who lifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be good...now cheaply made","review":"I bought a pair of these wraps from Dick's and loved them. They were built to last and worked well when doing bench press etc. Unfortunately, I lost them. I purchased the identical product from amazon and right away the product seemed very cheap. The elastic was weak and the thumb loop was of poor quality. The first time I used them, the velcro threads came undone when trying to remove. Amazon sent me a new pair, still cheap, and they second workout using them, the velcro came off again! AVOID BUYING them or else take them off very carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"These work great","review":"I've had some difficulty with my wrist, mainly due to repetitive stress. I tried a standard wrist brace, but these are far better, and cheaper too. I had a pair from years ago, but wearing them as a brace while typing wore them out. I bought two pair, and I'm quite pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful wrist wraps","review":"These wrist wraps are awful. Do NOT buy them if you want a wrist wrap that is tough and dependable. Again, do NOT buy these wrist wraps if you want something that is tough and dependable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good support, but ripped first time I used them","review":"They must be making these cheaper than they used to. My current pair has lasted 5 years but were starting to get really grungy. Decided to get another pair. Used these for a heavy chest workout and the support they provided was fine. When I undid the strap though, one of the velco fasteners ripped right off so now it's unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completey inconsequential!","review":"I LOOOOVE the recent batch of French films that have made it \\"big\\" over here: \\"The Taste of Others,\\" \\"Un Air de Famille\\" and ESPECIALLY \\"The Dinner Game.\\" But this? An utter bore that just doesn't do anything or go anywhere. Pass on this and instead definitely see the other three mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Stars","review":"This CD puts me in a happy sort of trance. I have to resist listening to it or I'll over do it. The flow, variance & composition of the songs, musicianship and details of the recording not to mention the eery lyrics. Where's this guy been hiding? Hopefully he'll hide out some more to prevent mainstream from destroying his artistry. Thanks Jim - I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the next one's better","review":"There was only one true star involved with the recording of \\"WEJ\\", and that was the producer, Paul Rabjohns. Paul, principally a composer for film and pro tools guru, signed on to produce for a very small amount of money, then spent that sum buying odd instruments like the church organ in \\"Sleepy-Town\\". At the end of the six weeks we were nowhere near done, and yet Paul continued to work on for no pay for another six weeks. So, to conclude, one star, Paul Rabjohns. However, the next album is better than WEJ, so keep your ears perked for its arrival sometime in the next fifty or so years. Now, my baby is crying and my sweetheart is trying to get the lasagna out of the oven. Visit me over at Jiim White; The Unofficial Refuge, where I check my messages every day. Your friend, Jim White reporting from hotter than the backside of Hades, West Pensacola, Florida in the unfortunate month of August."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim White is a cheeseball","review":"If you took Tom Waits from circa Rain Dogs, loaded him up anti-depressants, got Michael Franks to sing his songs and got the Backstreet Boys to produce it, you would have Wrong-Eyed Jesus.This recording is as \\"alternative\\" as your grandma's bra, and has about as much of an edge as an old butterknife.Jim White is not a smart man, judging by his lyrics and lack of originality, but he has wandered way off the mainstream track and deep into Tom Waits and/or Silver Jews territory. The effect is like a vapid frat-boy wandering into a dive bar, sitting next to Charles Bukowski and trying to strike up a conversation.Jim, go home. Leave this genre to the big boys. You should be covering Bread and America tunes in a Holiday Inn lounge.This is seriously bad, stupid music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is just plumb amazing.","review":"I could go on and tell you how Jim White's debut album sounds a little like this, or a cross between a pinch of that, and a dash of this, or how he sounds a lot like this feller over here. I'm not though, he is Jim White, and his sound is both unique and moving. Own this album, for your own good, on whatever level you appreciate the art of music, Wrong-Eyed Jesus will satisfy. He's a nice guy to boot, once, while waiting in the rain by the tour bus after an incredible show, he brought me a bottle of water and chatted some, how cool is that? Thanks man, for a great album. (and the water)"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Two tracks especially: perfect day to chase tornados and still waters.

This Tom Waits meets country meets folk meets American pop incorporates more voices and styles in one album than I've heard in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Everything about this movie is a monstrosity. The only thing that would even be considered as descent is the story line. How does a machine/human have the ability to cry? Unless there's an evolution in his organic parts that allow him to have human fluids, there is no sense at all. Then in the past, Alex Murphy looks like he's in his 60s, wasn't he about 40 when he transfered in Detroit in Robocop? The other thing about this crap is it's a ripoff from Terminator 3. 2 robots with humans beating each other up, and one computer that can take over computers everywhere. Skynet anyone? I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on. The only true Robocop is Peter Weller w/ Paul Verhoeven and Irvin Kershner as the directors.

This item was intended to be a gift, and I really can't see the recipient displaying either of these on his bookshelf. Aside from the fact that visitors who are unfamiliar with the first title might think he has something offensive on his bookshelf, I was expecting something neutral that escapes notice - like a dictionary or a biography. I'm uncomfortable gifting something politically charged or with religious themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book title","review":"Like others, I was bothered by the book title.

I would suggest a more innocuous book(s) for future mailings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"The bottom of the books don't line up exactly. It is not noticeable on the shelf though. Other than that this is great for items that don't necessarily have to be secure, but that you would like out of sight.

The history book fits in well with my collection, the other one not so much.I don't have the patience to make one myself, so this will work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hidey Spot for Small Valuables","review":"The book safe, while kind of corny, is a great idea. Especially if you have a lot of books.Which I do. Its easy to hide on a busy shelf.They used a real book too and somehow cut the inside out for the hidden compartment.It will easily hold jewelry, watches, and in my case a small 380 caliber pistol.I highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to increase their personal security just a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Vault","review":"This so called book is great to store things that you would not anyone to know about.

Despite the cost we ordered it for his birthday. What came was a used paperback book - and no titanic model. Despite the text which says \\"The Titanic Book and Submersible Model\\" and the accompanying photo of the model, no model is actually included! So for $100, you are mailed a used paperback book. Unbelievable that this merchant is represented on Amazon. I returned the book the very same day and received a prompt refund, but no explanation and, as I continue to see, no correction to the listing. Horrible to watch your eight year old sob with disappointment on his birthday. What a rotten trick...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent informative book and high quality model","review":"I ordered this book and model for my nine year old son who is very interested in the Titanic. I loved the book with its factual information and vivid pictures but what impressed me the most was the quality of the plastic model that accompanied the book. It was simple to put together and prepainted ( thank goodness!!) and was not flimsy when once built. I liked that it could be left intact or shown how it broke apart during its sinking. This book and model is definetly well worth the price and I commend the manufacturers. I finally received something I feel was well worth the money I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!!!!!!","review":"This is a beautiful film, BUT life can be harsh. I don't recomend this for sensitive children. There was death by lightening which we delt with. But, death by murder...In the scene there is a newborn who can't stand even after hours. All us grownups know it's not going to make it. Then a different band of horses move into the area and come to investigate the struggling newborn. It's sweet, one of the mares in this band tries to help the baby up. THEN... the stallion from this band comes up to the baby and seems to nuzzle it and you think \\"oh, how sweet, he's trying to help it too\\" He grabs the baby by the neck and starts viciously swinging it around like a rag doll. My two nine-year-olds screamed for an hour. \\"How could he do that to the poor baby? Why did the mommy let that happen...?\\" A real lesson in how life is not fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film - Get it from PBS!!","review":"This is a great film both for horse lovers and just nature interest. There are some harsh moments, like when one horse kills a runt foal, so parents beware.As of writing this, the cheapest seller is asking $125.00 for this 2-part Cloud - a stinkin' ripoff.

I didn't laugh once, and usually I can find the humor in anything.Not only was I disappointed by the film, but the subtitling suddenly disappears about halfway through and doesn't show up again until about 20 minutes later.

The basic story is one of a barbarian named Tagart, whose tribe is annihilated by a group of \\"civilized\\" farmers. In the background lurks a more advanced civilization known as the Flint Lords.The barbarian vs. society angle is well written (and rather gruesome), worthy of any Conan story. However, the author does not give the reader the feel of his unique setting.

It enhances your imagination, and creates a sense of beauty and enlightment.\\"After the storm\\" by Normnan Brown gives you a peace of that imagination. Just about every track on this album is soulful. My favorite is the track \\"Lets come together\\". This album is just a peace of Norman Brown work.

This CD was one of the first Jazz cd's I bought and I've never looked back. I have listened to all his releases and I have to say that this one is my all time favorite. As I go back and listen to this CD it sounds just as good as it did the first time I listened to it.

The musical accompaniment adds the final ingredient for a delightfully moving rendition of God's Word. Honestly, I normally avoid all audio books. I am a reader, not a listener.

On the drives to work, I was able to listen to a clear, well-done, light dramatization of a scripturally faithful (New International Version) presentation.

I've listened to the whole New Testament now and I have to say that I am disappointed with this volume's interpretation. I love the idea of actors portraying the Bible to make it more accessible, but I guess the downside of having actors portray it is that they will interpret it in their own way. I found the person portraying Jesus to come across as overly preachy and at times even mean-spirited, and Paul talked too fast for me to believe in his character--he spoke so fast throughout the CDs that he sounded overly scripted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy!","review":"I will say upfront that I did not listen to the whole thing, but to an audio sample. However, in light of other reviewers having the same experience I did, I would hazard that my feelings about the sample would go with the rest of it: waaaaayyyyyy too noisy and distracting! I couldn't concentrate on the words because of all that was going on in the background, and they spoke so fast that it did not even feel like a dramatization even. I expect the background noises and music on \\"Adventures in Odyssey\\" but then they speak appropriately and dramatize it, not just reading the words.I don't see how this could be helpful for someone who wants to hear the Word of God. It is more distracting than anything.I encourage anyone considering this purchase to listen to a sample before buying it. There is one on Amazon at the moment but I don't know if it will still be there.

The paper is thinner so the book is less bulky. Page number resets at the beginning of volume 2 and 3. (not renumbered.) Thus the book content is not altered from the 2nd edition (three volumes set) from MIT Press in 1969.One major change is that there is one index at the end of the book which covers all three volumes. The volume is indicated together with the page number. This improves the convenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"An excellent book covering a breadth of mathematical fields.

It's simply a testament to why Rhett's still around making music.On Stage at the World Café is a must-have for any Rhett/Old 97's fan. I also have the 97's live DVD as well as their Alive and Wired cd. While Rhett's albums (as well as the Old 97's) are incredible, seeing and hearing him/them live is a whole different beast entirely. The energy is palpable, and in one of the interviews on this DVD, Rhett mentions it, saying something to the effect of \\"It may not be cool to be this excited about rock and roll, but at least it's honest.\\"What are you doing?Get.

Also wonderful are the vocal and instrumental versions of \\"Cha Cha Cha du Loup\\"... the arrangement of \\"Les Amours Perdues\\" is clever, along with \\"New York USA\\".

I use them for lat pulldowns because I have a weak grip.They are better than nothing, but not that great. The reason they aren't that great is that the hook is a very shallow J shape - more like a cross between an L shape and a J shape. Therefore, when I use them, I'm always scared that the bar is going to slip off the hook. During my last work out the bar actually *did* slip off the hook, causing the weights to unceremoniously crash to the ground.Thus, I don't have confidence when pulling and I can't pull to failure because the bar keeps sliding off the hook.Also, the cloth covering the hook has torn off, exposing the metal hook.I'm going to try Versa Gripps Classic Series Weight Lifting Grips.

The nadir of 80s music, along with _Look What The Cat Dragged In_ and _Soul Provider_. To hear this sort of pop music done right, I suggest you turn to _Singles 45 and Under_. Yeah.

I replaced it on CD a few years ago and was extremely disappointed to see that my favorite song, \\"TIME,\\" was not included! Not including it makes no sense whatsoever, considering that CDs can of course hold more music than cassettes. So I also had to buy Culture Club's greatest hits CD to get \\"Time\\" (hmmm...do you suppose that's why the song wasn't included?). Even without that song, this CD is still a prime example of mid-80's pop. It makes me nostalgic to listen to it, but it's also just great music.

As a matter of fact, this edition of Culture Club's debut shamelessly misses the band's best song ever, \\"Time (Clock of the heart)\\". The song was a top ten single in many countries and is one of the band's signature songs, and it WAS on \\"Kissing to be clever\\" when it was released in the early 80's.

So many bands today sound like they've learned from him or even used his tracks? -- Radiohead, Portishead and Garbage, to name a few. The best way I can describe it is to call it 1960's French-pop-grunge. Some call Gainsbourg the \\"French Bob Dylan\\" but his music is far too innovative and eclectic to be limited by that.

I may read one more of his novels and then decide if he is an author i would pursue."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNAIL PACED YAWNER","review":"Phil Rickman is known for his long, heavily plotted novels and this one is no exception. While one must admit to Rickman's skills in developing characters and offering multi-layered plots, I found this thriller to be less than thrilling and way too long to sustain interest. I had to force myself to finish it as Rickman did manage to at least pique my interest. Set in a small English village, the plot focuses on a female minister and her rather annoying daughter and some kind of mysticism surrounding a former minister who supposedly committed suicide centuries before. An attempt to stage a play revolving around this suicide brings out the demons in the small town. There are so many characters and such rambling passages that WINE OF ANGELS ends up tedious, repetitive and by the time the mystery is solved, one forgets who the characters are. Shaving off a couple of hundred pages may have made this a good read; I do not, however, recommend it unless you have patience and perseverance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible disappointment","review":"I have bogged down halfway through this book and don't plan to finish it.

There's also the paranormal. The vicarage seems to be haunted.Merrily and Jane are delightful, as is the supporting cast. In reading a Phil Rickman novel, it's necessary to sit back and let him take you through a wide assortman of storylines. Be patient, and enjoy the ride. They're always tied together neatly and unexpectedly.I've come late to this series, but am thrilled by it.

Some of the projects look dated of course as fashions have changed and techniques have evolved. Then again, the photos of Kathleen Dustin's work are a fascinating snapshot and, when compared with her work today, made me realize how far the medium can be taken. If you are more interested in step by step jewelry projects, Katherine Duncan Aimone's Art of Jewelry Polymer Clay is a challenging but great addition to your bookshelf (includes Jeffrey Lloyd Dever's pods, aaah!!). Lisa Pavelka's Complete Book of Polymer Clay is another comprehensive book, including the 'newer' techniques (transfers, Sutton slice etc).

Here is this year's. If you haven't bought it yet don't worry, there are dozens of them like it out there and 2005 will, no doubt, bring us another one while literally hundreds of Parton songs sit in the BMG vaults gathering dust and many, many, many of her original albums remains out of print and have never even been released on CD a format that is over 20 years old.

There are a couple sub-par tracks, but overall, the CD is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supurb CD : Great vocals, greater music.....","review":"As a die hard car audio fanatic, I now use this disc as a reference CD when installing any system. The sounds range from pounding bass to super highs, and Basia's voice is fantastic. The first cut, Drunk on Love, is my personal favorite, followed closely by The Sweetest Illusion. I highly recommend this CD, or any of her others, to anyone who can appreciate a really great entertainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the wait!","review":"There was a four year break from London Warsaw New York to The Sweetest Illusion, BUT.... it was worth the wait! The CD is nearly one hour of of Basia'a best work. It seems with each album, the quality of the music improves. \\"(Love is the) Sweetest Illusion\\" and \\"Third Time Lucky\\" are two examples of the quality of the CD. These two cuts have soothing vocals mixed with the perfect mix of jazz and latin rhythms and tones. Basia's voice is strong, not only hitting each note, but her range, both high and low--adding feeling in each song. Just an aside, several songs have a interesting word play. Add this album to your basket if you enjoying jazz or soft pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"POLAND CAN KEEP BASIA...","review":"Basia has an excellent singing voice, and this CD has good production values, if you like your music over dubbed and over produced. Unfortunately, Basia has failed to capture my heart, as I simply did not enjoy her music. It reminded me of nightclub lounge music, which has never been my cup of tea. There is not one track on this CD that I would listen to more than once. That is not to say that Basia is not talented. On the contrary, this woman from Poland can sing. It is just that the music she sings does absolutely nothing for me. Sorry, Basia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basia We Miss You! Please make more music!","review":"For the listener who is not yet familiar with Basia, let me try to put into words the unique experience. Basia is a Polish singer heavily focused on latin-flavored beats. Her beginnings with the invaluable music of Matt Bianco led to the release of only 4 studio albums, this being the latest. To the uninitiated this is likely the weakest of the four but still an outstanding production that warrants its place in any cd collection. The joy and playfulness of Baasia's music is rarely matched (perhaps best matched by Matt Bianco) and merits a listen for any fan of jazz, latin, vocalist, even dance music fan.The worst thing that can be said about this cd is that it is the last one (studio album) she has released in nearly 10 years. Scoop it up today and join the movement to bring Basia back to the studio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes up on two DVD separate players","review":"I had read of others having problems with this DVD.

Perhaps not....","review":"Fitting tribute to the greatest actor ever....nobody put such intensity into B-film scripts like Lugosi did.... This guy poured his heart and soul into his work, turning an otherwise mediocre line into a memorable occasion that would make even the weakest script seem a thing of twisted beauty....

Murders in the Rue Morgue is also mind-numbing in its implication....utterly weird would describe every film on this disc.... Masterful indeed...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice to have.","review":"Ive been waiting for these (especially the Black Cat) for a long time. The price is right folks.

I've picked up a few public domain collections and there he is. This collection of course is great since the transfers are done with care. Most of the films are about an hour long so you can rewatch them and see the amazing chemistry between Lugosi and Karloff during this period. Sure Karloff's star was shining, but neither man had Gene Hackman-ish careers. Both got their \\"comebacks\\" in the end. Karloff made his own playing himself in \\"Targets\\" and Bela had Martin Landau give him respect in \\"Ed Wood.\\"This collection deserves space next to Universal Monsters. Hopefully Karloff will also get a set named after him in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Lugosi/Karloff collection","review":"Other than \\"Rue Morgue\\" these all have Boris Karloff and Lugosi, with Karloff generally getting the meatier role. Why wasn't \\"White Zombie\\" Lugosi's classic included? Still these are all good, and do show Lugosi in roles other than a fiend so you can get a better appreciation of him as an actor. Worth it for any fan of the period/genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a drag!","review":"This cough, cough movie was so boring that we had to shut it down. Don't bother.Why does this junk even exist?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great movie and A dark comedy indeed","review":"I picked this movie out as I browsed the shelves at the local video store where I usually spend one hour each visit searching for a good film. Sadly, great films are hard to come by and usually now come from abroad. The movie's sequences range from somber to hilarious and for those who speak Spanish, the film is especially enjoyable. The acting is quite well done and the cast portrays the life of six unemployed friends for whom everyday is the same as the day before. The bar which they frequent is an excellent backdrop for the friendly bickering that goes on between the men. For those who seek a truly enthralling foregin film, \\"Mondays in the Sun\\" is a must and I certainly plan to buy the DVD and add this wonderful film to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterling acting, shallow story","review":"The story is imbued with the European mindset that people are owed a job and a meaningful life by either businesses or the government. Those who accept that view sacrifice their responsibility, and therefore a chunk of their humanity. So, the characters in this film hobble along rather pathetically and childishly, waiting for someone to restart their lives. Bardem is a fine actor, and the others do well, but this is a slight film offering no useful insights. It stands in stark contrast to films by the great director, Zhang Yimou, whose characters inhabit far more difficult conditions, but who struggle mightily to overcome the odds and maintain their pride. As one of the characters hints when slandering Koreans, a Europe awash in the welfare state has much to fear from industrious workers from Asia and elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch the grass grow","review":"I felt this had a slow-moving plot. It took a long time to unwind and then had a rapid wrap-up. Suddenly everything was resolved and the film was over. I was very disappointed with that.

By giving special emphasis to how the New Testament has helped shape the church's identity and theological outlook throughout the centuries and the role it has played within the broader cultures of both East and West, this book assists readers in exercising creative, informed leadership within their own communities of faith. A distinctive feature of the book is its simultaneous publication in two formats: a standard printed edition with comprehensive yet detailed coverage; and the Expanded CD-ROM Version, which includes supporting endnotes, extensive annotated bibliographies on each New Testament book, additional maps, diagrams, and charts, and other resources for classroom use and personal study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor Atomic on DVD makes the stage experience specially poignant","review":"As one who has seen both the San Francisco and the new MET staged version of this important 21st century opera, I highly recommend the DVD as a \\"close up\\" experience of the memorable dramatic moments in the Peter Sellars production.Sellars directed the DVD and has orchestrated this production to bring out the interplay among the characters and to capture intimate moments that could not be seen this way on stage.At the same time, it captures the fleeting movements of the Lucinda Childs dancers among the scientists and workers and their last minute preparations for the Trinity test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Modern Opera","review":"An amazing opera.

So, there must be a happy ending...And that is one of the reasons I lower my rating. The final part of this film is so sweet that I got tooth-ache:(Another reason why I am disappointed about the whole story is one particular scene - worth the biggest drama queen in the world.

Depressingly, good marksmanship books on field shooting are few and far between. Most high level shooting books focus on specific competition formats because it seems most authors and readers outside of the formal competition shooting world don't understand or particularly care about top notch skill. Witness the rise of the bench rest, the monolith of mediocre, cluttering up public shooting ranges.The book is good, as far as it goes, but the topic warrants a more thorough coverage and Cooper was an ideal person to write it.

No one knows more about the Battle of Tannenberg than Dennis Showalter. He expertly uses archival evidence, official histories, and first-hand accounts to give us the most subtle and persuasive account of the full meaning of this key battle of the Great War. Along the way, he teaches us a lot about how armies fight in the first few weeks of a war. Even the much-vaunted German Army made mistakes, as Showalter clearly shows. Yet, their system was able to recover from these mistakes far more quickly than the blundering Russians. Even so, Tannenberg was decisive only in prolonging the war--not in ending it. Showalter points out the many ironies of this battle that will resonate with readers today. A great book; its only fault is its slow beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"insufferable","review":"I tried to read this book. I really did. Unfortunately the author is so long winded it was excruciating. He takes some obvious good source material and research and drowns it in the worst kind of ham handed attempt to display his literary acumen, from the constant use of german words and phrases without even a contextual definition, to following one staement with another, contradictory statement, without apparently realizing it. He also blithely passes off opinion as fact, at times, undermining his credibilty. Worse, though, is the ad nauseum dwelling on the irrelevant minutia of susbidiary subjects that need only a thumbnail portrait to get his point across, thus losing the point entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Brothers needs to try again!","review":"Come on Warner Brothers!

Sorry, you can't go home again, especially if home is a band that had identity problems and poor production. The blues tracks are amateurish by any standard. Let me correct that: they are painful to listen to. The Steve Katz songs perhaps could be revived by an American Idol wannabe on his way down the schmaltz ladder. There are a few intresting tracks that survive. I only wish that this had been up on Itunes so I could have downloaded those @ 99 cents per until I realized that it was time to quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed to say the least","review":"First, I purchased this CD based on one of the Blue's Project's hit songs, \\"The Flute Thing\\", which I remember from the 60's. Watching this group, announced by Paul Simon on the DVD \\"Monterey Pop\\", I was transported back to 1967. After searching several Blues Project's CD compilations, I chose Anthology. I thought maybe the seller actually sent the wrong CD! The music was, well, really inferior, almost Monkee-like. I don't like to bash anything from the 60's, my era, but this album should be titled \\"The Worst of the Blues Project\\". If they can title an album by Jefferson Airplane as such, it can't be too bad for the Blues Project. All in all, this music sounds like it is being played by a high school garage band. The vocals are just not worth listening to, I feel bad about writing this, but be warned, if you are expecting really good blues, or even something that sounds like jazz (which is really what The Flute Thing is) then, buy some other CD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"I bought one of their original albums way back when. Some of the songs are catchy. You find yourself singing or humming them like \\"I can't keep from crying sometimes\\" or \\"Wake me shake me\\". \\"Steve's song\\" sounds almost oriental. \\"The Flute Thing\\" is hauntingly good. Overall, I would call them hard rock with a blues flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"In high school this was one of my favorite albums. It was nice to find it and listen to it anytime. The music really holds up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues Project","review":"A fantastic bit of musical history from the late 1960's. Mike Bloomfield was a superb guitar player with a sterling resume'. Al Kooper played with Dylan on \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" where he had met Bloomfield. Kooper went on to form \\"Blood, Sweat and Tears\\" before it became the singer's band. The rest of the supporting cast were or became music legends with solid credentials. The song selections are solid and a tribute to improvisation and the blues genre. Highly recommend this music offering to show the 1960's were not all about pop, psychedlia and the hit making corporate music machines feeding the masses pap. Excellent listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"still smooth","review":"I was fortunate enough to hear the band perform several times both in New York and Philadelphia. I was very pleased with the audio quality, the presentation was nice. Most important to me is it is an accurate testament to a group I loved. This gives me the essentials I wanted without spending an absurd price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting historical mystery","review":"Based on a real life mystery this book was first published some years ago. I heard from the publisher that is was available again. Not the most suspenseful mystery but very interesting, especially for an anthropology buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is just a fun album to listen too. Filled with Classic 90s rock, you will be singing along in no time to songs filled for humor, excitement, drunkeness, love, and fun. A must for any fan of the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great party CD","review":"Catchy music that is easy to sing to, even if you have no singing voice. I have always loved this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic and Fun","review":"I had bought this album years ago on tape cassette and it finally broke so I bought it on cd this time. Love it, love it, love it! These guys always make me happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"T-shirt Order","review":"It was great to get this hard to find t-shirt. I am a new fan of the Refreshments (now called Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watered Down Version of \\"Wheelie\\" But Still Great","review":"This is a great disc. I first heard heard the song Girly while tubing down the Salt River in AZ and had to buy the disc as soon as possible. It took awhile because they were pulling their indie release \\"Wheelie\\" off the shelves in preparation for the release of \\"FFBB\\". \\"Wheelie\\" had a more raw sound, and \\"FFBB\\" is the major label rerelease with a couple extra songs. But since you most likely won't be able to get your hands on \\"Wheelie\\", check out \\"FFBB\\" it's still a great disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I Own","review":"Every single track is golden on this Cd. It is great riffs with a mexican influence, and still to this day, it is my favorite CD to listen to out my collection of 400+ CDs. If you like good music, good lyrics, and riveting riffs, you will love this. It is a must have...enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS NOW!","review":"I'm mostly a punk and metal fan, and yet I have only two things to say about this album: 1.) It should be issued at birth. 2.) Buy two copies in case one ever gets lost or ruined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Treasure","review":"This is actually one of my favorite albums. Once it gets into my car stereo, it tends to stay there for weeks. I bought it for the well-known \\"Banditos\\" and the rest just grew on me. Some of the songs should be on b-movie soundtracks (and would help you like the movie). Some are just poignant - \\"Mekong\\" reminds me of all the business travel I've done where the hotel bar was the only place to go and meet your new best friend who is doing the same thing. I've always considered this one of my desert island CDs because it's solid cover to cover and no matter how many times I play it, I still really love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 10 best discs of 96","review":"Outstanding disc that grows on you the more you listen to it. Sort of reminds me of early Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers but with more of an edge. Southwestern boogie blues that sneak up on you, and you find yourself driving aimlessly down the road listening to this one over and over again"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Great songs, raw energy... very little studio addition to what they sound like live. Southwestern rock with metaphysical lyrics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I was blown away from the very moment I first heard this CD. The lyrics are witty and crisp and the sound is simply excellent. I immediately liked \\"Down Together\\", \\"Suckerpunch\\", \\"Carefree\\" and \\"Nada\\" while the others grew on me quick. The transition from the peppy rock found in most of the beginning tracks to the more chilled attitude in \\"Mekong\\" and \\"Nada\\" makes this CD all the more enjoyable. Furthermore, the humor found in most of the songs, such as the lead vocalist's \\"conversation\\" with the \\"big ol' guy\\" in \\"Girly\\", gives the music some witty substance. All in all, a great CD that I'd recommend to anyone looking for this type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change","review":"Change is a good video if you like to see home built trucks being jumped all over the place. No really good race footage, but alot of side by side running in the whoops. Over all a pretty good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DBI, don't buy it.","review":"Did not work on leather bags, L.Vuitton, Gucci, or Channel. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprise of a movie!","review":"Ewan McGregor gives an outstanding performance. Very well done. And the story line is interesting; it makes you stop and think of the possibilities. For the most part, the scientific references behind the project were accurate; a few mistakes but those can be overlooked in the grand scheme of things. It was a pleasant and enjoyable surprise; much better than I'd expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and heart warming","review":"Loved this story of love, proving anything is possible, humor in just about everything and the beauty that the world beholds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"This film was funny and romantic. Nicely done, although not super believable. Ewan McGregor was fantastic as always. It was entertaining and visually very beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie for All Audiences","review":"I saw this movie at a theater and liked it so well I decided to purchase it as a gift for a friend. It is a funny, heart-warming tale which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"On Sunday, we go to Target.\\"","review":"A zillionaire Yemeni sheik likes fly fishing, so his British aide (Emily Blunt) enlists the help of a fisheries expert (Ewan McGregor) to bring 10,000 salmon to his desert country.This movie is heavy on talk, light on action, and feels like a true story (but isn't). McGregor and Blunt make a good, low-key couple and Amr Waked is excellent as the kindly sheik. Kristin Scott Thomas steals the show, however, in a small but witty part as a Ministry official; she gives her trademark sarcastic performance and injects much needed humor into an otherwise tepid story.This is a sweet, but slow and predictable story (I wouldn't call it a romantic comedy) that would be of particular interest to fly fishing fans. 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANKS AMAZON This is a great fish story","review":"Inspired cinematography. Very talented salmon....and the actors are really good too! Seriously though....this is a beautiful, touching film. Inspires optimism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"While somewhat predictable, it had some surprising moments. McGregor was excellent as usual. Not Academy Award winning, but worth the viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie.","review":"I liked it. Great movie. Nice story. Very good acting. Thumbs up from me. Like to see more like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I was looking for something more profound about middle eastern relations. Instead I got a tepid british comedy. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say I didn't it like it.","review":"It was nice but I couldn't buy into the love story or the importance of salmon fishing in the desert. I like emily Blunt and Ewan MacGregor but somehow this story fell flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"I was intrigued by the title and Ewan is a great actor. Very well done heartwarming story, I would recommend it to my mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd duck","review":"I don't know what other title might be used for this one. It's not a sports show. It's not a cooking show. It is a love of fishing. And a growing love affair that somehow doesn't give up. And yes, Yemen is still Yemen. But I took a chance on this one and wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't play on amazon instant video","review":"Very frustrating b/c it was downloaded But then it wouldn't play so I ended up paying $3.99 and never got to watch it plus it's impossible to try to find help on the Amazon website there's no contact information"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work.","review":"This DVD does not play in my blu ray machine. It comes up with a message that it is the wrong zone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too political for me","review":"I did not care for the seemingly underlying message that all people want to do in the Middle East is be like Westerners and go salmon fishing. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Wow. This movie was terrible. How it got several recommendations is beyond my scope of understanding. I would rather pull my toe nails out with pliers than watch this again. Yes, I really didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops.","review":"A rarity these days. A widely-touted film that fails on almost every count: Plot, characters, acting, historical/social veracity, and others too numerous to mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly","review":"I think this film is silly. The writer (it was apparently based on a book) has no insights to convey about love, Arabs, Yemeni society, fishing, life in a British government, or anything I'm aware of.Nevertheless, the project was green-lighted all the way through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we expected","review":"Well if you are looking for a faith based movie - this is not one. Don't be fooled by the previews. We thought this was a PG movie... glad the kids weren't watching. There is plenty of cursing, foul language, adulterous behavior, disrespect, sinful angry parenting, typical \\"when marriage gets tough just divorce\\", self-centered individuals, sex, etc.... It could of been a good movie. It had talented actors, beautiful back drops, scenery, it was well filmed and crafted... but that all means nothing when you add in all the negatives I mentioned. It's just garbage and worthless- even if there is this little glimmer of hope at the end. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen not what it is proposed as in the previews. Not satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"no play","review":"I downloaded the movie onto my Kindle and it refused to play!! I was not a happy camper. I filed a complaint and received a refund. Never received an explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen","review":"Very different plot. Rich shiek likes to fish, so he hires an English engineer to build him a dam and stock the river with salmon. Involves a love triangle that has a happy ending. Beautiful photography. Just a nice, warm, happy story, with, of course, a few twists to keep it interesting. Missed it on the big screen. Glad I bought it to watch at home in Blue Ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Just wasn't sure about this one! I usually 100% trust Emily Blunt AND Ewan McGreggor, but this film wasn't my favorite. Felt like it was rushed and predictable. Could have been more understated and less over the top. The landscapes of Scotland and Yemen were, of course, redemptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"GF and I enjoy this movie","review":"I didn't know what to expect from this movie but it was an enjoyable romantic movie, that wasn't over the top. It had a few laughs and each character was well done. I especially liked the Sheikh's character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"A rarity these days: a good story. Well acted, beautifully photographed, and not derivative at all. We need more films such as this. More from the Scots, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea but not attention-grabbing","review":"I liked the premise but it really didn't hold my attention.

I suppose my fault for placing the order, but what stupid person sent this to me, knowing that I would not be able to play it it in England. very shabby way to treat a customer.

Even though it is intended to be a much more intimate and nuanced movie, it never stirs the viewer's emotions enough to achieve \\"suspension of disbelief\\" since it is so utterly unbelievable. That is a shame for the cast, who try mightily to reach the audience. But, this movie fails with terminal cuteness. I don't think that even a thirteen year old could find its silliness engaging. Sometimes you can just try too hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen","review":"\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing!!!!!!!!!!I cannot say enough good stuff about this movie! it was funny, feel good, romantic. hopeful, interesting, greatcasting, beautiful photography and wonderful, believable content.

Very entertaining. No violence, gore, or graphic language to disrupt. Good old fashioned quality entertainment. Leaves you feeling good at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visionary","review":"I like how the movie does a brief intellectual teaching of being a visionary and the requirement of faith that needs to be applied to become a full-blown visionary. It may be brief, but the writer is perfect in getting the message across about how to complete that visionary path. Sometimes it takes just a brief message to tell a whole story through the eyes of the believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss It","review":"This was a great all around movie - humor, love, interesting premie, great characters, unique plot line, well acted and directed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light comedy","review":"Good story line and characters.

My wife & I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing, enjoyable and entertaining movie","review":"I watch this movie over and over.

It has so much potential, and I thought it would a cute movie. The only excuse I can give it is that they must have tried to follow too closely to the book... which was a mistake. The film is WAY to long and tries to cover too many issues. The only good thing about it is Emily Blunt, who is decent, but it's not even worth a rental. So sad, it could have been a great film.

It is a story that runs the range of personal emotions, with great acting and camera work. The story itself is intriguing, stocking salmon in the Yemen River. Sounds impossible, but is it?

The 3 separate \\"worlds\\" - London, Scotland, and Yemen were done in great contrast, but finely connected.
