The year before, Gretchen had been in a serious car accident, which caused her to fall behind in her schoolwork and require repeating eighth grade. Naturally, she's horrified at the prospect, but determined to try making the best of her new school.But just about everything that could go wrong, does. Like some sort of weird Murphy's Law, Kobie attracts the wrath of Jeanette, a tough older girl, and Sandy, a kindhearted follower...both of whom, in their own ways, keep getting Kobie into trouble.When Jeanette threatens to kill Kobie, she decides to take matters into her own hands...This book is laugh-out-loud funny, one of Ransom's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no!","review":"This video is nowhere near as appealing visually as the CD was musically.

It's too bad the DVD doesn't include all the cuts (16 tracks) that the CD of the same name does (\\"Legend - Bob Marley\\"). I would have especially like to have seen a video of \\"Waiting in Vain\\" which was covered by Annie Lennox (formally of the Eurythmics) on her \\"Medusa\\" CD (I highly recomend \\"Medusa\\" if your a fan of Annie Lennox, or the Eurythmics). This is a good addition to your DVD collection for Bob Marley fans. There are three other (or more?) DVDs of Bob Marley and the Wailers on Amazon. If you enjoy documentaries sprinkled with video exerpts from from Bob's career there is also \\"Bob Marley\\" recently released on DVD. I have personally purchased four DVDs of Bob Marley from Amazon. I guess it doesn't get much better if you enjoy reggae music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuine Upanishad","review":"I was very impressed with the insight that this DVD shows into Bob's character, it seems to be an inspired work. The concert songs are good, but the real gem is the \\"Time Will Tell\\" documentary. This is a living Upanishad, which means \\"sitting at the feet of the master.\\" If one comes to this with sensitivity and openness it becomes an opportunity for Bob's spirit to relate to you where you are in your own growth, it embodies a living presence, sort of speak. Highly recommended, enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LEGEND and TIME WILL TELL","review":"Awesome 5.1 sound and clear crisp video.

Even I watch enough children's television to know that Kari Anderson is not exactly in touch with children. My three year old even commented that the tape was \\"cheesy\\". Unfortunately, I think that the instructor just has a poor, if sincere, understanding of children and the effect is a lacking rapport.Not a complete zero as the children have moved around a bit and it served the purpose we were after which was to encourage exercise.

The bottom has 4 large holes (1.5 inch diameter) and 6 smaller holes (0.75 inch diameter. I suppose the holes are there to allow critters such as spiders and mice to easily access the mailbox for their homes. The front door has large raised \\"U.S. Mail\\" letters and a large raised eagle symbol that destroys a smooth surface for posting self-adhesive mailbox numbers over practically the entire front of the door. There is a small, one inch space at the bottom of the door for numbers but no where near enough space for a standard 2 inch number or letter. Too bad the dimwitted Fulton engineers who designed this crap were incapable of seeing the problems with such a design. Bottom line is this...do NOT walk away from this mailbox....RUN !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but the DVD is incomplete","review":"Very few of the examples in the book are demonstrated. The DVD focuses more on developing correct picking technique and only demonstrates several of the 50 or so exercises. However this is still a good book as is Jazz Chops by Buck Brown.I would say that Jody concentrates much more on chords than single lines in this workout book, as the single lines are mindless permutations for beginners while the chords are at an intermediate level. Strange mix of ideas here. Maybe Im biased because Im considered a lead guitar player though I believe that is a polite way of saying my rhythm is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle 3 version.","review":"On the Kindle.

The drama was well acted by Mr. Kingsley who saved the film from having been way too long and poorly acted. Supporting cast was not too bad, but the whole film is too long for most people to sit through. This one is for the History Buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"very powerful","review":"This is one of the more powerful movies made on the life of Anne Frank. It looks at Anne's life in Amsterdam before the war, her time in hiding, and what happened after they were betrayed. the scenes in the camp are very hard to watch. the final few parts in the camp had me in tears and I normally do not cry during movies. I suggest everyone sees this movie. It will change your life to some degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Frank The Whole Story","review":"Our class recently viewed Anne Frank the movie. I reccomend this movie to people of all ages. It was a good movie, and showed what happened during the war. This movie tells what Anne Frank did in two years of hideing. This movie shows what life was like back then, if you were Jewish. This movie also showed how Jews suffered in concentration camps. Camps such as Bergen Belsum had poor food supply and no clothes. Jewish people in thoes camps suffered and died from sickness, lice, starvation, and scabies. Over all the movie is really great and I think students should watch this movie and learn about all the hard times jewish people went through during the hollicost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well put together, but not a good topic.","review":"The movie was very life like, and would like to see the actors and director together, just not doing such a sad subject.

This film let me see all the image that passed through this period.I forgot the name of the girl who plays Anne Frank, She is Extra. This film is not easy to understand in detail and also not commercial. It need theconcentratation till the end.

If I would be in 1940."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad !","review":"I had seen the movie, once in highschool. I remember as a young teen being given the Diary of Anne Frank, I read it over and over again. I also watched the movie several times.

Its well made and I would be glad to recommend this movie to anyone interested in Anne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This film is very realistic, and while it doesn't really shy away from the realities countless suffered during the Holocaust, it is \\"safe or proper enough\\" to show to eighth graders. I believe History teachers show stronger films to students, but as a Language Arts teacher, I don't really have the same allowances. I want to reiterate that it is very realistic and excellently executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Frank - The Whole Story; a truly moving film:","review":"Anne Frank - The Whole Story was probably the most moving film I have ever watched.If you're going to order it, get the handkerchief or tissues out for the end because the scenes of the Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and the way all those poor, innocent Jews were treated are so distressing.I think Hannah Taylor Gordon was such a good look-alike to Anne Frank and played her part so well; if the real Anne Frank were still alive, you could put the two girls side by side and they'd look so alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Anne Frank Choice","review":"Love this version! While names have been changed from the play, it still shows background information and alot of the problems that took place while the Franks were in hiding.

It has always been a very moving story to me. It has inspired me to read volumes about others who were in the same or worse situations. I have seen other movies about her, but this was by far the best portrayal that I have ever seen. Hannah Taylor-Gordon was Anne Frank to me. Every character that was selected to play in this movie was excellent. As to the scenes in the concentration camps, I think it is important to educate people about what happened. Some people say that it is a little much, but you know what, you can't change history. That is how it happened, horrible as it is to watch. Many of the survivors are beginning to die and if people aren't willing to pick up a book and read about it, I think the best way to educate people is to show them. Nothing like that should ever happen again. Never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for someone who's new to pregnancy","review":"When my husband and I wanted to start a family I picked up an armful of books and started reading.

Oath of Seduction is a fast read with no extraordinary plot, but it kept me hooked from the first page to the last!If you are like me, looking for a hot read with a bit more than just emotionless get-to-the-act characters, this book should be for you. The futuristic setting reminds me a bit of \\"Warrior's woman\\" from Johanna Lindsey. If you liked this book and are up for a more risqué reading then do not hesitate further...And if you like strong woman with strong personality that keep men at bay with snappy retort, read the 2nd book of the series: Oath of Challenge (have a look on her website marlychance.com)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot!

The guy was while at times tender was arrogant in expecting her to make all the changes and got annoyed when she misunderstood on some culture aspects. I agree with a previous reviewer about the \\"link\\" that it feels wrong.-spoiler-a link is when a second male connects with the female's mind at her peak orgasm. The can have intercourse or not but he must be in skin contact with the female. Then when later meet they greet by kissing each other with mild passion (tongue action). I found that distasteful, i prefer for the full ménage; they are only with each other and no one else (no contact with another). Supposedly since they are telepathic race the link is to provide protection for the feamale' mind.ProsThe male was tender at times and highly sexual who honestly cared for his packmate.

The characters are flawed to different extents and are realistic and true to life. The plot is incredible; it will keep you guessing the entire time.

But as others remark it drops the connection just like that every now and then , and every couple of days you need to unplug it because it plays dead ( won't connect to the ISP ) .Now it could be many things as there are many parameters including ISP , cable modem compability and P2P usuage but I've done all I can ( firmware , forums etc. ) , neatgear support is not help at all and if i knew that I wouldn't buy it .And I'm still waiting for my Amazon-Netgear rebate 3 months after ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Router is good but the card...","review":"...is crap. Quit working after a few months. Although when it was working it was fast. The wireless card can't hold a signal even when it's literally inches away from the Netgear antenna! Meanwhile the built in wireless card in a IBM T42 has no problem connecting to the Netgear router.Netgear products are questionable and you take a chance. When they work, they work great, but once they stop working don't bother with support or trying to fix it. Save time and fustration and just throw it away and get another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recommend this unit","review":"Pros- Looks nice- Easy to setupCons- External ac/dc adaptor- Has problem dropping connections (possibly due to overheating). Netgear forums blasted this unit.- Was performing firmware upgrade and it failed to upgrade - had to send it back.Had to send unit back at own expense.- Netgear support has somewhat long wait times and the phone tree can be confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of upgrading the firmware online!","review":"This router worked fairly well - until I tried to upgrade its firmware. In hindsight, I should've downloaded the file and then loaded it from my computer. But, I accepted Netgear's invitation to upgrade via their site, online. Realizing the danger of interruptions, I had both my router and my computer on backup battery power, as a hedge against any power outage. What I hadn't counted on, was the loss of my internet connection - right in the middle of the upgrade! Now, the router has no IP-address, and no way for me to communicate with it. Netgear tech support was less than useless, once I could actually get them to reply. Their only advice: use the \\"reset\\" button to put it back to the factory settings - which I'd already tried, having read the manual myself. So, scratch one router. I went ahead and bought a Linksys to replace it, and it seems to be a lot more reliable anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the hassle","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but this product failed after just six months. I also had another Netgear router fail immediately. I just can't recommend them after all the time and hassle it takes to discover that your hardware is bad. I have an apple airport...and of course it \\"just works.\\" I've ordered a Belkin pre-N and will report on its efficacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"'OK' type product. Not that great","review":"This product is just OK type. Nothing so great about it. Initial setup is hard. I had to roll back to factory settings many times to bring this item to working stage.After one month of usage, the signal stength started fluctuating randomly. Most irritating problem I found was with the netgearwireless adapter itself. it stops working if the computer was started from hibernation ( I usually do that way). To make adapter to work, you need to remove and insert back. Does that not suck?."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This product worked right out of the box. No glitches nothing! Perfect! I was kind of skeptical when reading the other reviews but it seems they relate to an older version of the firmware and drivers. Netgear must have corrected those problems and therefore, I highly recommend this product. One reviewer tried to mix the PC card and the router and got into trouble and he also recommends not mixing the operating systems. I think, that recommendation is not sound. I am using a Windows 98SE desktop system and a Windows XP Home on my laptop and it works great. The $35 rebate makes this a steal! Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but trouble","review":"I have had this unit for about 7 months now and it has been nothing but trouble. It constantly stops working and I have to unplug it from the wall and plug it back it to get it working again. Often, this method of resetting doesn't even work. Sometimes, I have to do a physical reset with the button on the back of the unit to make it work again. I am running the latest firmware, and still nothing but trouble. I recently said \\"the heck with it\\" and purchased a D-Link Xtreme G kit and it is working as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLASH IN THE PAN","review":"Bought the router/laptop card kit in August 2004, began having problems with it in early December. By mid-December it was completely dead. After reading reviews by others I decided not to pursue warranty remedy, but, instead, threw the router and card in the trash and bought a Belkin Pre-N router and card instead. Netgear warranty states for one year you \\"may\\" receive a \\"re-furbished\\" product as a warranty exchange. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that means they have a high rate of returns. After one year? Sorry, buy a replacement item. Belkin has a lifetime warranty; buy it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it , I tried 2 models and none worked !!!","review":"This router is really fast when it works. Unfortunately, it reboots constantly, even after upgrading to the newest firmware. First, I thought it was defective so I returned it for a replacement. The second one had exactly the same problem. Neatgear has to work this out and release a new firmware upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recomend this book","review":"We have a violant world out there now, why expose a already violant brain to this book. Not ment for a godly person to read. I left it in a airport, didn't even want it in my house"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish at best","review":"Someone told me that if I liked suspense novels, I'd better get a hold of an Alex Cross book. Maybe I picked the wrong one to get started with, but \\"Cat & Mouse\\" started off weak and got worse. I've read better character development while flipping thru \\"National Enquirer\\" at the supermarket checkout. The word \\"cartoonish\\" comes to mind. As for plot, this book has nothing that couldn't be found in reruns of \\"The A-Team.\\" And Mr. T is about as believable as the people in this book. I will give points for some relatively chilling moments involving Soneji, and some reverential descriptions of my hometown's architecture, but overall, I expected much much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Letter to James Patterson","review":"Alex Cross deserves so much better. Don't rush us through moments with his family, give him a less ho-hum case and give him a girlfriend with a personality. There were no decent females characters in this thing at all let alone anyone to compare with Kate (Kiss the Girls) or Jesse (Along came a Spider) And Gary deserved a much better swan song. The previous books had conflict, suspense and likable down to earth people, while this is just a mess of gore and explotation of a potentially great character. If you can't give Alex Cross the way I know and love him, I'd prefer if you never wrote another book about him again. I encourage others who feel the same to make themselves heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic Gore and little else","review":"The premise sounded intriguing but didn't deliver. I found this is the book to read if you want to know what a body looks like after the facial skin is torn off--you get the idea. The shock value of frequent disembowelment and dissecting of victims was what was relied upon by the author to hold your interest. I could think of real page turners that are written without all this gore. I didn't find the hero likable or interesting, just muy macho. I give this one 1 star because the author can make you visualize the grossness of the murders quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss the Girls was the only good book in the Cross series.","review":"I've read the entire Cross series, and the only one that I truly liked was Kiss the Girls. Cat and Mouse read like a bad romance novel too many times. The other parts were a predictable suspense novel. The characters were stereotypes, you didn't care what happened to them. I also didn't like the structure of the book, how it was split into two parts. The only reason you might want to read this book is if you want to find out what happens to Soneji. Not that the plotline of Soneji/Murphy was written all that well in the other books. Kiss the Girls is a better bet than Cat and Mouse, and Jack and Jill wasn't too bad either. Kiss the Girls is more suspenseful and has a better story. Jack and Jill isn't as trashy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong start and then a limp to the finish line.","review":"James Patterson usually writes fast paced novels that thrill you to the end. After Gary Soneji dies in Cat and Mouse, this book takes a nose dive. The second half of the book was a great disappointment. The identity of Mr. Smith is obvious from the beginning and the character is very uninteresting. Dr. Cross' insights into Mr. Smith's psyche and his so-called solving of the mass murders are ludicrous. For added drama, Dr. Cross and his family are viciously beaten (ho hum), but I never believed that any member of the family was seriously injured. Only a half-hearted effort is made to keep you in suspence. The end of the book was simply stupid. Perhaps if James Patterson made every chapter longer than a page and half, he would have done more character and plot development. Patterson can do, and has done, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last Patterson","review":"Having read so many raves about Mr. Patterson's work I looked forward to reading Cat and Mouse. What a disappointment! It was deficient in believability and good dialogue. Mr. Patterson, have you ever really listened to a little girl speak? Her dialogue was like much of the plot - unbelievable. I was bored rather than thrilled with the action when I was not being repelled by the brutality. The author really overreached in trying to scare the reader. I stress \\"trying\\"; he did not succeed with this reader. Nobody seemed real - not even the \\"good guys\\". I was indifferent to Dr. Cross, Sampson and Christine as they seemed so inauthentic. Grandma was the only distinctive character. The writing is really quite amateurish, repetitious and cliche ridden. I gave it two stars for the rapid read it provided on a long plane trip. Next time I'll bring along a Jonathan Kellerman or a Susan Isaacs for snappy dialogue and engrossing characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Villain Helps to Reinvigorate the Series","review":"Question: How can a successful mystery writer breath new life into a series that felt stale after only three installments? Answer: Bring back a villain who readers already embraced. In this novel, Gary Sonjei is back and meaner than ever. Alex Cross must embark on a game of cat and mouse to bring the killer to justice once and for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"One of the most pathetic excuses for a novel I have seen in a long time. I needed something easy to fall asleep, but the level of this book was just insulting. It was so bad that I had to post my first comment EVER on Amazon. Painfully obvious, completely divorced from reality, unconnected and patchy story, incomplete, childish... The hero is full of himself, his grandma is full of herself, his kids are too, the bad guys are full of themselves, essentially - everybody was on an ego trip: best, strongest, hottest and brightest. The characters had absolutely no depth, and while I know that these novels don't aim for that, it would have been nice to try. Descriptions mostly involve naming what food they ate. The most insulting part is where the author completely ignores the near-tragedy of a family, which keeps behaving and living as if they all only had a bad dream... Can we give a 0 stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh so bland.","review":"ive read 2 books now of pattersons and both left me feeling like ive wasted my time and money. his characters are one dimensional. cross for example is as vanilla as they come....boooooring. the only thing that saved this book from a 1 star was a scene involving a dog house. one scene out of the whole book. every chapter involving cross fawning over his love interest ( his childrens principal) was laughably bad and merits skipping. the way patterson chose to create his villain was unoriginal. if youre looking for bathroom reading material and not a serious read this might be for you. otherwise save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God! What have you done James?","review":"Along Came a Spider was brilliant. Kiss the Girls was good. Jack and Jill was okay. Notice the pattern.Cat and Mouse follows the tend and ends up being a terrible novel and hence explains the poor rating this reviewer gave (1 measly star). Cat and Mouse follows the adventures of Alex Cross, the black detective/psychologist, who has a knack for bringing down incredibly stupid serial killers and go about their disturbing fetishes with the most absurd of motives.Below I will list some of the mistakes with this novel:- The character of 'Mr Smith' is totally unbeilable, and his motives are never fully explained- When the Cross family is brutally attacked, why didn't Soneji's pal just kill them allI can go on forever, but I just don't have the time. Two mistakes should be sufficient. Anyway, I sure hope Patterson writes better novels because I seriously can't be bothered writing more reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming qualities","review":"This is the worst book I have read in some time. The writing is pedestrian, the characters are shallow and the the plot is ridiculous. Otherwise it was worth what I paid. ( I found it)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson's latest will keep you awake until you're done.","review":"This was another outrageously gruesome (and I mean that with all good intentions) thriller pitting Alex Cross against his old protagonist Gary Soneji and another equally as bad villian for good measure. No one does psychopaths better than Patterson. I am only sad that Soneji is gone for good. Or is he?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time and money","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. As two other reviewers noticed, Patterson makes excessive and superfluous use of both italics and exclamation points. Very tacky, not to mention annoying. The characters were insipid and the plot was fragmented.I bought this book at the grocery store because I needed something to read. I would have been better off reading the instructions on my bag of rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A THRILLING BOOK BUT...","review":"This is the second novel by Patterson I've read so far. The first one was JACK and JILL and I enjoyed it very much. CAT and MOUSE was quite good. Suspense and mystery (as well as gore) can be found in this book and make it a real page-turner. I've decided to rate this book 4 stars because I was disappointed by the dull description of our \\"local hero\\" Alex Cross and his family. They are simply too perfect to be true, the real \\"american loving family\\". Alex Cross is always right, nice and an astonishing loving father. Moreover, the dialogues between cops in this book are bizarre. Do all the cops talk about their look, the size of their ass and call each other \\"sugar\\" when they spend some time together? Besides these \\"minor details\\", this book was thrilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"never delivered","review":"a Christmas gift for my adult daughter...thanks a lot...it still isn't here and i ordered it in plenty of time...today is 12/21...need to make it up to her? send her the entire series at your expense...i am so disappointed...so disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"The sound went out half way through the darn thing.

Best cross book so far. I can't wait to see what is in store next."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!","review":"I'd never read any James Patterson before, but was in the mood for some light, easy fiction. What I got was so poorly written and predictable that I couldn't believe that it's on the best seller list. The plot is boring, at best, and the characters are so cliche that the book becomes irritating after the first few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you time with this one!","review":"One of the worst books I ever read (recycled it just before finishing the last page)! A book's quality can be determined by comparing it with other similar books. If you thought this book was good, please read the much superior \\"Headhunter\\" or \\"Ripper\\" by Michael Slade to see the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite audio tape","review":"The two readers were beyond magnificent. While listening to this tape, it was more like watching a Steven Stielberg performance at the movies, they were that good. The story line was easy to follow and compelling. I use audio tapes when I workout. I enjoyed this tape so much that I wanted to go to the gym every day. I could use a dozen more Patterson audios, with these same readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up - but I have a question ...","review":"I found Cat and Mouse to be almost as good as Along Came a Spider - and that's saying a lot! Here's my question for those of you who have read this... I must have been falling asleep when it explained how Gary Soneji got out of prison, can anyone tell me where to find it in Cat and Mouse? After finishing the book, I scanned the first few chapters but couldn't find it. If you know, please email me at unman@home.com Thanks! This was a very fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!!!","review":"I have been a Johnathan Kellerman fan in the past. After reading \\"Cat & Mouse\\" I have a new love! Patterson shows us both the best of love and the worst. He gave us beauty and shocked us with grim psychopathology. I can't wait for his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It!","review":"The only reason I finished this book is that it read so quickly, much like finishing a really bad movie on the USA network. There were just too many holes in the storyline. Too many instances where the serial killer could have been caught (maybe Patterson should have studied up on the FBI's techniques and the technology they currently have). First Patterson I read...and the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"I can't believe I read this thing. This is nothing like his previous books: \\"along came a spider\\" and \\"kiss the girls\\". The characters in those novels had personality. This book was a repeat of the past novels, but more predictable and defiantly more boring. If you liked this book, you'll be amazed by his previous books on Alex Cross."},{"rating":"2","title":"page turner and completly breath taking","review":"Fantastic and I just cant wait til the next installment of Dr Cross. Just cant imagine what was going to happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson is much better than that !","review":"Those who've read Patterson's Along Came the Spider or Kiss the Girls would expect a good thriller and suspense. That's not what happens with Cat & Mouse. We go through several attempts of describing horrible acts on a supposed psychological persecution and some bad interpretations of the evil human mind... mixed to a flawless familiar life where Alex Cross's girl friend and children are beautiful, intelligent and perfect. Our hero Alex Cross is the best detective in the force and can do everything, including play a piano like Liberace!! It's too much ! For those who read other Patterson's books, this one is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will really keep you reading!","review":"I think this is the best one yet! I have not read all of Patterson's, but this one was quite thrilling, and had you on the edge of your seat, on every page! The twist at the end of the book involving the bad guy was great. I await his next book eagerly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and predictable","review":"This is the first Patterson book that I've read. I find it difficult to believe that Cat & Mouse flourished on the bestseller list. The characters have no depth and the plot seems to be put together as the book was written. It seems there was no idea put forth before the book was started. Usually, if I read a book by an author, and I like the book, I will read more books by the same author. In this case, I was severely disappointed and I do not plan to purchase any more Patterson books in fear that it is written in the same poor style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable characters, wooden prose","review":"This may be the worst book I've ever read. I thought it would keep me entertained on a 12 hour flight, but I struggled to finish it. The characters were so one dimensional and unrealized that I didn't really care whether they lived or died. All characters were caricatures, not people. The plot severely strained my ability to suspend disbelief. This is an absolute stinker of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dire, plotless and amateur","review":"The first few James Patterson novels were excellent. This seems to have sapped his creative juices dry as the plot in this book held less intrigue than an episode of Scooby Doo. Clumsy writing, annoying constant chapters (cheap trick to convey fast paced action.. perhaps writing properly would help instead???) and halfway through the book a moment that has you howling with laughter, with so many changes of narration perspective I gave up trying to work out exactly who was spouting what...Very very disappointing - in the corner Mr Patterson and wear this pointy hat...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, but tarnished by obscenties and violence","review":"When I bought this book, I thought I would be getting a good suspenseful story. To be fair the plot was very exciting and constantly kept you turning the pages. I think the short chapters and the storylines were very interesting. However, I got a lot more than I wanted. The language was explicit, the violence gruesome, and the sexual references obscene. Surely, the book could have been a lot better without these things. They were completely unnecessary. I was so disgusted I threw the book out and was mad I had wasted my money on it. It would be better to spend money on books like John Grishams' The Partner. It offers the suspense without everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I just don't understand how James Patterson became a best selling author. Patterson should have retired Alex Cross after \\"Along Came a Spider.\\" What two men call each other \\"Sugar?\\" James Patterson does not deserved to be on the same planet as Richard North Patterson or Nelson DeMille, let alone the same bestseller lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible -- threw it out.","review":"\\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Along Came a Spider\\" were great -- what happened here? This has to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever read, not to mention boring and implausible. And what's up with the italics? I gave up halfway through and threw it out. Boo."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson at his best!!!!","review":"Having read, and thoroughly enjoyed Along Came a Spider, Jack and Jill, and Kiss the Girls I knew that I would love Cat and Mouse. I more than love it!! This book reaches out and grabs you and for weeks after your done with it you will still be wondering whether or not someone is out there to get revenge on you!! I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last Patterson I'll read.","review":"Wow--two serial killers for the price of one! But this \\"doubling\\" technique diminishes both stories. I was surprised to learn Patterson has several books to his credit. For much of the first half it seemed the author was saying \\"Golly gee! I'm a writer!\\" The characters have no real distinguishing features--none stand out. I felt uninvolved, distanced from all of them. It read like a movie script--one quick scene after another. Lost interest several times. Skipped many of the \\"sensitive\\" (boring) scenes. The ending of both killers were anti-climactic cop-outs. This should have been stronger considering the subject matter. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"I used to like James Patterson. In the past few years, however, his books have become increasingly tedious, predictable, and boring. This one is the worst. Its badly written (I don't think he has any sentences longer than about 10 words, and he certainly doesn't have any chapters longer than 3 pages) I only bothered to finish this book because I had paid full price for it -- which compounded my mistake; I not only wasted my money, I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstream Drivel With An Obvious Ending","review":"I could tell right away who the real murderer was & why & how they would catch him. This man does not know the meaning of suspense. Since only the bad guys seem to have any spark, I found myself rooting for them instead of the blandola hero. If the FBI is actually as clueless as depicted in Patterson's novels, I fear for the welfare of our country's citizens. And the sappy romance without the smallest element of originality (all the men find only supermodel-type women endearing) was just more than I could bear. As they smooched, I retched. The writing was so bad that the lame story loomed even lamer in the landscape of bad books the American popular presses keep popping out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Just Terrible Book","review":"This book is not quite as bad as some of James Patterson's others (SEE HOW THEY RUN takes the cake), but it is pretty close. The characters are all paper thin, especially the gleefully psychotic serial killer(s) who provide the motive-less antagonists yet again. Alex Cross is back again, but is put out of commission about halfway through the book. As a matter of fact, this book is divided almost equally in half. The first half involves the serial killer Gary Soneji, the second involves a killer so silly that his entire existence can obviously be defined as \\"Plot Twist.\\" Ultimately, you may read through this entire book in a relatively short amount of time. By the time it's over, like many of Patterson's other books, you'll be left wondering why."},{"rating":"1","title":"overdone! Needs focus, direction.","review":"I found this book more convoluted than an elephant's intestine. It had \\"I'm writing for Hollywood, hope the studios are looking at this\\" written all over the watered down, overcooked story story. Gary Sonjei had AIDs, this was supposed to be ravashing his body, yet he showed no signs or the overused disease. It was gratuitious, as were all of the chase, shoot 'em up scenes. The tale lasted too long, needed a couple of hundred pages cut, several characters who added nothing but names and cinfusion needed to be edited out. Killing the villain (Sonjei, who was cheapened in this tale) early on, stopping the story to inject the love scenes, introducing another villan for the second half of the book, showed how unfocused Mr. Patterson really was. It felt like he did a cut and paste from scenes he didn't use in other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never read another","review":"This book exceeded every preconceived notion of how bad a book could be. James Patterson seems allergic to both long sentences and chapters, giving it a feel that it was transcribed from Morse Code on an old telegraph machine. The bad guys are one dimensional. The good guys are one dimensional. The plot is thin and contrived to the point of hilarity. Nothing about this book is convincing except in removing all desire to read another book by him. Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to force myself to finish it","review":"It took me three months to read this book. No, I'm not illiterate, I just let it collect dust on my bedside table while I started and finished other books. Alex Cross had no flaws, the villians had no redeeming qualities. There was no twist, no suspense--it's not that I guessed who the killer was in the beginning, I just didn't care. Maybe I'll try another Patterson book in the future, but not until the boredom Cat & Mouse produced fades from my memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross series","review":"James Patterson always keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the Alex Cross books and this is no exception!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast-paced, vivid murder mystery thriller evolves","review":"Anthony Heald's fine stage and acting skills include many Broadway credits, so if you're an avid theatre-goer his voice on James Patterson's CAT AND MOUSE may sound familiar, spicing a vivid and fast-paced story of a murderer who has come to slay a family only to find competition with another murderer with the same goals. A fast-paced, vivid murder mystery thriller evolves, perfect for libraries catering to fans of either Patterson or audio thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a very short question??","review":"I realize that I just did a skim reading of this book..but somehowmissed something..Did it explain HOW Gary removed himself from a Maximumsecurity prison?? I may have missed it. Overall, this book was BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"This was the 1st book that I read out of the \\"Alex Cross\\" based novels. Perhaps one needs to read the others before this one, however I doubt that it would change the outcome of this review. The plot dragged on like an old record. It was a struggle to finish. There is an interesting twist of events, however the sluggish journey to that twist is too long. The twist that could have been really great was almost matter of fact. Literally one minute the reader is bored stiff, then out of nowhere it's solved and over, seemingly with in pages of the end of the book. Very dissapointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"predictable","review":"Most of the alex cross stories are becoming predictable...like a recipe is being followed.

I found the narrative confusing as Patterson switched from first to third person and then switched people narrating in first person. I was disappointed in the way he chose to end the Soneji episode and move to the Mr. Smith scenario. I would have liked to see more of Soneji. In that regard, I had the killer figured out before Alex did. And finally, I thought Patterson overdid the descriptions in the various bloodlettings that seemed to go on endlessly in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never would have guessed!!!!","review":"This book was a great mystery. When you find out who the real murderer is it is so surprising. The storyline was good and the telling was great. This was the first James Patterson book I have read but I will definitely read more.

Couldn't put it down...A real page turner!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Alex Cross book...","review":"Admittedly, I would not recommend this book to someone just starting out on the Alex Cross venture, but this was a satisfying followup to one of my favorite characters. Bashing this book is like trying to watch one complicated episode of the X-Files and vowing never to watch it again because you didn't get it. This book was meant for the Alex Cross fans. I loved the way it expanded his character, and even gave us a little more John Sampson. If you've read James Patterson's other Alex Cross books, this is a definite read. If you haven't, start with Along Came A Spider, or Kiss the Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"I've read many of his books and they are usually good. This one couldn't hold my interest. It would probably be an OK action movie, but reading about his following this guy all over got boring. Not enough story line. Had to skip many pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like Cross, OKAY?","review":"To date, I have never finished an Alex Cross novel. He is remarkably boring and too predictable. Sure he's a detective with a heart of gold (He drives buses for poor kids, he slaves in the soup kitchens for poor kids...heck!), but he needs to toughen up. Anyway. Cat and Mouse is jarring, slow, and unimaginative. I think Patty is trying to escape the confines of Cross seeing as though several recent novels (When the Wind Blows, Cradle and ALL) have been offered. Oh! And who could forget that Diary one. I finish every Patterson novel that doesn't involve Cross, but I am however going to pick up Kiss the Girls, because I have heard that that one is a real, genuine corker. I think I might even buy the Diary one in paperback, because I know for a fact I will finish it. Cat and Mouse...nah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Cat and Mouse went awry and James Patterson didn't have the time or desire to go back and fix it before the publication date.First, I'm not a fan of the Gary Soneji character who Patterson dotes on in all his novels. I liked having the threat of Soneji in Jack and Jill, but as a main character, he becomes a tedious, repetitious attempt for Alex Cross to create a psychological profile. It is plain annoying. Then Mr. Smith felt like a scrap of writing that Patterson had lying around that he wanted to use somewhere. The second, first person narrator through the mid section of the book was an obvious and unsatisfying attempt to attach it. Bad!What's good? I love the primary characters. Alex, Nana, Jannie, Damon, Christine Johnson are excellent. The relationships are outstanding. John Sampson is also a very cool character and was severely underused in this story. Tom Pierce got too much focus and Sampson was forgotten. James Patterson falls way short in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read with lots of action.","review":"James Patterson creates stories that make pages turn at a rapid pace.I thought the first half packed more punch as Alex Cross finally gets closure on the Gary Soneji case. Very intense and absolutely riveting.The second part where the hunt for \\"Mr. Smith\\" transpires up and down the East Coast is more oriented to the psychological aspects and gripping in its own right.I thought Gary Soneji to be a more loathsome villain than Mr. Smith. The other members of the police, FBI and Interpol that Alex Cross and his partner Sampson work with are believable and easy to cheer for.Putting the clues together that Mr. Smith has left after his crimes is great intellectual drama.The murders Mr. Smith commits are very gruesome. Their descriptions are very graphic and maybe a little over the top. Some suspension of disbelief is necessary.Overall a fine read. Another strong outing from Mr. Patterson.KVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I must start out by saying that I did not finish the entire book, i COULDN'T! I loved ALONG CAME A SPIDER and KISS THE GIRLS. I found them to be terrifying and very suspenseful. This book was neither. As I've said, I didn't finish this book, so maybe it gets better in the end. I found this book to be ludicrous, alsolutely not suspenseful and I could have done without the big sex scene.It had nothing to do with the story, and was kinda creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat and Mouse, by James Patterson","review":"Cat and Mouse is the fourth book in the Alex Cross series. It has lots of suspense and keeps you hanging on until the last word. If you like mysteries I think you will enjoy the Alex Cross series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Cat & Mouse by James patterson","review":"I'm finishing up a old series of James Patterson books and the best way to find these old book is on Amazon. Got my book right away, and in good conditions. I'm always happy with my Amazon purchases. This is not his best book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down!","review":"James Patterson has done it again! Another 'can't-put-it-down' creation...I am totally hooked and can't help but follow Alex Cross to see where the story ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting read yet somewhat anti-climactic","review":"Alex Cross is one of my favorite characters when it comes to series books like Patterson's \\"Along Came a Spider\\",\\"Kiss the Girls\\", and \\"Cat & Mouse.\\" It's rare that a reader finds a heroic, intellectual African-American protagonist in these types of best selling thrillers. However as much depth and rewarding character development he's given Cross, he spoils his latest installment \\"Cat & Mouse\\" with a somewhat anti-climactic resolve. Don't get me wrong, the story is riddled with clever plot twists and unstoppable pacing. Perhaps ironically, these Patterson trademarks are what left me hoping for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding wonderful,suspendful,romantic,can't put it down","review":"the book took me in quick, all i wanted to do is keep reading and reading to see what was gonna happen... i was so worried when alex cross and his family got hurt.. i love to read about the way he works. i enjoy the way he takes the time for his family and friends . i think it was time for alex and christine to get together . i think this is one of the best so far.. i hope he keeps writting about alex cross and sampson for many more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's back!","review":"Just when you think you've got it all figured out, Patterson throws in another twist. A previous killer, Gary Soneji, is back, along with a killer who is terrorizing Europe. The chase is on, and as always, James Patterson carries it off and leaves you wanting more. Patterson doesn't tie up the end of every book with a nice neat bow, and you never know when a killer is going to show up again. So far, the Alex Cross series shows no sign of slowing down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the first novel by this author I have read, and it will probably be the last. The characters are so flat and cardboard-ish that I stopped caring about what happened to them. There were some good plot twists, but the book feels overloaded; two parallel plot lines are one too much.The idea of near-superhuman villains worked in novels like 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs' because of the very good writing skills of their author; Patterson does not have these skills, and the super-villains in this book feel as silly as the villains in a James Bond film. Since Patterson's previous books have received good reviews assume this book was a 'pot-boiler' written in haste, or written during a period of blocked creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat & Mouse","review":"I think that James Patterson is a fine author who can write astory that will keep you enthralled, willing to know what is coming upwhich makes you, glued to your seat. This one however, I just purelyhated. The charcters were flat, so was the plot, being aspredictable. I consider myself a fast paced reader, but this thrillertook me at least 3 weeks to finish. The ending is believable andtastelessly brought on. Scratch that, the WHOLE plot and every eventis pretty much predictable. My worst regrets are A. Reading this bookand B. Not returning it.If I were the reader, wouldn't waste yourmoney on this tasteless, lifeless,... non-James Pattersonnovel. Sorry James Patterson, I pity you for even spending time towrite this book. Cradle and All was far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun To Read!","review":"After reading some of Patterson's non-Alex Cross books vs. \\"Along Came A Spider\\", \\"Kiss The Girls\\" and now, \\"Cat & Mouse\\", I've definitely come to the conclusion that I need to stick to the Alex Cross books. They're much more exciting and much more fun to read than his other books without that character in it. With that said, \\"Cat & Mouse\\" was exciting to read and the pages just turned at an incredibly fast pace for me. I'm still wondering, though, how exactly did Gary Soneji get out of jail! At the end of \\"Along Came A Spider\\", Soneji left a message at Alex Cross' car. Was that my \\"hint\\" that he was already out of jail? If not, I'm TOTALLY confused as to how he got out of jail and there was NO MENTION of an escape/release from jail throughout the book! But, after I accepted that I wasn't going to get an answer to my question, I still found the story engaging and I still enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy, unfinished effort","review":"What do you get when you're way behind on a deadline and about to lose a lucrative contract? You get Cat & Mouse: two rough drafts of two different books slapped together and foisted onto an unwary public as a single finished novel.What an embarrassing effort. This book is badly in need of some serious editing. It is clumsily written and full of repetitions, more like something written by a junior high student than a nationally acclaimed author. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this book. The Soneji story is a major disappointment. Apologies should be made to Alex Cross fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion. The character development was weak. The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention. If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first. I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson Scores Again","review":"As always James Patterson scores another homerun. YOu can't go wrong with a James Patterson book. I've read them all and never been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Cat and Mouse","review":"This is a gripping book albeit rather crass at times. Not sure I liked the parallel serial killers as it gave the impression that the plot lacked tension. I will read another of the author's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did i even start it?","review":"That was the question i kept asking myself while i was reading that crap. I wish i knew of an Alex Cross. That guy is amazing! A detective, PHd, great single father, and scores with the most beautiful chick in washington! His kids are awesome, too! I was waiting for Jeanne to psycoanalyze Soneji! If it took that long to catch/kill Soneji, than i'm worried for America's future. Patterson's writing kills me. He sounds so rundandant when ever he gets into the mind of Soneji (how smart he is, how dumb the cops are). My girlfriend said it best when she said it looks like patterson picked up a how-to-write-a-novel book, and followed chapter by chapter. Put it this way. I left the book in a hotel room for the maids to deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"Seriously, I could not believe how bad it was. Really no redeeming values at all.The author uses exclamation points contstantly! Instead of writing to create drama, he uses punctuation! And italics!You learn nothing. It's a waste of time, unless you just want to shake your head and wonder that the book was ever published, or be motivated to write yourself, because if he's a bestselling author, surely you can be as well.Please stick to Elmore Leonard, Thomas Harris, Walter Mosley, etc., for your mystery thrillers. This one is just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TIME...","review":"I have read several Patterson books and this one can be summed up in one sentence...\\"Many words, little value\\" It's flat, obvious, and down right boring. I guessed the \\"big surprise\\" very early on as probably everyone else did. I am currently reading 'Maximun ride:Angel experiment' and even though it's classed as a 'juvenile book' is more intelligent and enjoyable (so far) than this one.I'm hoping that Alex Cross is gone never to return and Patterson gets back to writing interesting books. I have faith he can do it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money and Boring, ...","review":"Although I kinda liked Hide and Seek, had some doubts after having read Jack and Jill, I bought C&M.

Precious time wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent very fast moving twists snd turns in plot","review":"this is defintly one of his best very intriguing great chachter devlopment and great way to tie all of Dr.Alex Cross loose ends together!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad title to a good Cross book","review":"After reading the awesome books of Kiss the Girls and Jack and Jill, I thought that Cat & Mouse would be fitting to its own title, but unfortunately, a better title could have been something like The Burning of a Cross. I mean, Cross should have been stressed out after chasing all of these wackos! The love scenes in the latest Patterson novel are unnecessary, but still okay. Soneji was finished off too quickly for someone who was so smart in Along Came a Spider, and Mr. Smith was just too silly of a character. Perhaps Patterson has learned of his mistakes and will think of some way to bring back Soneji, a villain that will be missed, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately James Patterson is no Ian Fleming!","review":"Alex Cross isn't 007 or even in his league. What a disappointment. No page-turning suspense. No shocker. No fun and games with the reader. Guess that's why Alex Cross never made it to the big screen. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone seems to love it or hate it. I loved it","review":"I found the twists and turns left me more than a little anxious and I went through this book with incredible ease and speed.

Thanks to this book,I may change the rule. This author stole 6 hours of my life from me that I will never be able to get back. A \\"must miss\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two separate stories","review":"There seemed to be two separate stories in here that were only vaguely related: The hunt for Gary Soneji and the hunt for Mr. Smith. It was also suprisingly predictable. The novel also lost credibility with me when the author jumped from Alex writing in the first person, to writing in the third person, to the other detective writing in the first person. I think this was one of Patterson's weaker novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have I read this before??","review":"Right from the start of this book everything seemed familiar..and I don't mean just the characters. Although Alex Cross is an interesting subject Patterson should change the plot of this detectives life/work more from book to book or move on. This book even refers to \\"Along came a spider\\" and the simalarities of the \\"bad guy\\" in both. I am a fan of Patterson's but I'll be sure to read the inside of the cover more carefully before buying next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this if you love graphic gore and little else.","review":"The premise of this one sounded intriguing. I found out that this is the book to read if you want to know what a body looks like after the facial skin is torn off--you get the idea. The shock value of frequent disembowelment and dissecting of victims was what was relied upon by the author to hold your interest. I could think of real page turners that are written without all the gore. I didn't find the \\"hero\\" likable or interesting, just muy macho. I give this one 2 stars because the author can make you visualize the explicit details quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim, violent and boring","review":"This is the first book by Patterson that I have ever read, and I do not intend to buy another.

It offered a safe, effective way to deal with stress, so I bought the book. To put it mildly, it exheeded my expectations. The instructions were clear and simple. I followed them. In the weeks and months that followed, I felt the pain and tension in my muscles dissapperar; I gained a flexability and peace of mind I had never known before.

Some of the exercise steps described items in Photoshop Elements that didn't exist. In some cases I found things that came close... I think. My guess is the author was working with a different version of the program as he was developing the book and never went back to check things with the final version.

I just pray the other two in the trilogy will also be picked up before next Advent season.Jotham's Journey is the best Advent resource I have ever read. The story is not only exciting and thrilling, but it gives the reader great historical insight. Your family will have a difficult time stopping at the end of each day's reading because each day ends with an exciting cliff hanger. You will follow Jotham right up to being present at the birth of Christ, just as your family celebrates the same miracle.Please, do not miss the opportunity to experience Jotham with your family. This is also a fantastic gift to give any one you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Opportunity to Enjoy Advent","review":"This book, and it's companions have been the ideal way for us to sit down as a family each evening in preperation for Christmas.

We have all three of the trilogy and will be rereading them starting next year! I can't imagine ad Advent without these books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful Christmas tradition","review":"This book is a great way to bring your focus where it belongs in the busy weeks leading up to Christmas. It's an exciting story full of cliffhangers and anticipation. It can be quite intense so I wouldn't recommend for children under 6 with a healthy understanding of death. Each segment of the story has a follow up to tie it into your life personally. My husband and I loved using this book for advent this year and look forward to trying the rest of the series, and one day sharing it with our children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"This was our 2nd purchase of this book as a gift for someone we know. Our own copy of this book, we have used this story book readings for our family 3 times already! It is excellent story telling, by far the best of all Arnold Ytreeide's books (though all of them are very good). Nearly each story leaves you on a cliff hanger so you can't wait to read the next. The cultural and historical setting are very realistic for the time. This is a great resource for family reading times for the Christmas season. We have also read Ytreeide's - Bartholomew's Passage which was also very good and also ends at the birth of the Messiah. Amon's Adventure was a wonderful read as well up to the death and resurrection of Christ. We are looking forward to Tabitha's Travel's this coming Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"full of suspense but also contains bible lessons","review":"I really liked this book. It is divided into 25 days for advent I and found myself wanting to read ahead because there seems to be a cliffhanger at the end of each day's reading. There are several plot twists, some I saw coming, some not. There is a lesson at the end of each day's story, most with verses from the Bible.My only complaint about the book is that the villain, \\"Decha of Megiddo\\" is like Freddy Krueger or \\"Jason\\" from the \\"Friday the 13th\\" movies, he just keeps coming no matter what injuries are inflicted on him. The author even seems to forget that he should be injured and not able to do things he does at the end of the book. But your kids will probably forget too.And of course, it's only really good for one year because after that your kids will know what's going to happen. The daily lessons are tied in with the story, so they wouldn't be as useful by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book for Advent. Action packed way to teach morals","review":"I was looking for an Advent book for my 12 year old twins and thought this one might be good. The book kept their interest so well they reminded me when it was time to light our candles and read the daily portion of the story. They were so interested in the story they wanted us to read ahead in the book. The story was very suspenseful at times and it was hard not to read ahead to see how Jotham's situation turned out. My 13 year old daughter and son are again looking forward to reading this book this advent.I recommend this book for all ages, including adults. Great Book!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for young children","review":"I had heard a lot of good reviews and enthusiasm for this story. I really like the concept of reading a small portion of the story each day during advent. But when I pre read the story before reading it to my children (8 and 5 y.o.) I was very surprised at the scariness and violence in it. I know my children would have nightmares if we read this before bed and even I was scared! I also found the Christian application a little corny at times and random in its nature. I ended up selling the book without reading it to my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited stopwatch","review":"This stopwatch has one very serious defect.

I don't believe that it should be banned from libraries or schools, having read it at a young age with no particular evils coming from it, but I also don't believe that it is a book that should be scrutinized as it is now. I think that everyone will take away something different from this book, and that it should be discussed, but while reading this in class everyone came up with the \\"right\\" answers, not their own personal opinions and ideas.An extension of Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn is a book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.-LJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"tiny pictures, and a tad esoteric","review":"I found it interesting, but I don't really understand who this is geared towards.

Typically for the genre, the author has not consulted any primary sources, choosing instead to focus on publications of dubious authority, from hyper-Presbyterian polemic (Hislop's ... more \\"The Two Babylons\\") to confabulated works of \\"freethinkers\\" like G.A. Wells, whose own works are full of assertions that are not and cannot be bibliographically supported. Even the title of the book is less than honest : far from being an examination of the evidence, it is a jaw-dropping tour through a psyche so distorted by its own assumptions that it is literally incapable of entertaining for a moment any thought which has not been produced by them. From the publisher that also brings us the quasi-factual fantasies of Zechariah Sitchin and a (pseudonymous, one assumes) Joan d'Arc; possibly useful in busy households as a hedge against a shortage of toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer Beware","review":"This is not a toy.

It gives you a well thought out, personalized view on the day to day experiences, guidelines, and beliefs of a trained and obviously more than qualified practitioner.It also is a great reference guide to the uses of the essential oils.Giving chemical component breakdowns as well as daily uses.Having read this book I use it as my own guide daily, and thank you Jennine, for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly unscientific and self-contradicting.","review":"I had high hopes for this book, and read it all the way through waiting for it to get better. It never did -- the writing is AWFUL (desparately needed a professional editor) and the author contradicts herself. Furthermore, I am a chemist with some psychopharmacological training, and based on the title, expected this book to be somewhat scientific. No luck on that, either. Kurt Schnaubelt (PhD) does a better job of presenting nuanced, experimentally supported information, whereas this book barely skims the surface. The information on the autonomic nervous system seems lifted from a first-year textbook, if that... the only interesting, original part of Ms. Stromkins book is her assertion that people respond differently to essential oils based on their autonomic nervous system. However, this assertion remains TOTALLY UNSUBSTANTIATED by any kind of controlled experiment -- and worse, her anecdotal evidence is weak and contradictory. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia and comfort food recipes make this book a winner","review":"This is a wonderful book, especially for any babyboomer who originally hails from Brooklyn or even just the New York City area. The stories are heartwarming and paired with marvelous photos that capture the essence of Brooklyn culture from the 40s through the 80s. Some of these recipes are right out of my childhood and food that I haven't thought of in years.

It's all fast and somewhat superficial (there is so much to cover), but the recipes all look interesting - the majority are Italian and Jewish of course - but so much else. I'm online now to buy the book for my best friend for her birthday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful book for any former Brooklinite","review":"I loved this cookbook! It not only has the recipe for Lundy's famous Manhattan clam chowder, it also tells about Fox's U-bet Syrup, the Dodgers, Flatbush, the old Flatbush & Kings Highway cafeterias, Ba-Tempte pickles,Coney Island, Sheepshead Bay & much more....Detailed stories & recipies of all the neighborhoods from Williamsburg to Mill Basin....Many ethnicities & recipes for many of their foods: Irish, Italian, Polish, German, Jewish. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! It covers the decades from the 1940s through the 1970s and would be esecially fun for folks who are baby boomers, like myself. Brought back many memories and I've tried many of the recipes -- they still work and are very good. Bravo!! A very good cookbook and a very interesting history of Brooklyn. Highly recommended Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poems for the Soul","review":"I saw Ms. Walker read poems from this book last night in Los Angeles. She spoke of how she thought she was done with writing and then the poetry started one day. She described the return to poetry as a \\"spring\\" beginning to flow again. Anyone involved in creative pursuits, such as writing poetry, can surely relate to the \\"spring\\" metaphor. These poems are simply beautiful and seem effortless as you read them. They seem to come from a vast, open space. Reading the poetry engages the reader in a celebration of life, the spirit, and hope for humanity. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS TRASH","review":"This book is the biggest piece of literary trash I have seen in a long time. It is a collection of peace-mongering propaganda that seems to take issue with political reality as much as the author does in her own life. The agendas in her poems spoil the spirit of the pieces and make the reader resent the author. The poems are rather sophomoric at best, and are poorly written. Most of them make no sense; you would have to be inside Ms. Walker's head to comprehend her contorted style. It appears that Ms. Walker should re-enroll in a college level poetry class. THIS BOOK IS TRASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK--I TOOK MY COPY BACK AFTER 24 HOURS."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Beautiful","review":"I haven't listened to a CD more since Jagged Little Pill. Through a friend of a friend, the name James Blunt was dropped in the conversation so I decided to buy the CD, having heard it was great.That person was wrong. This CD is fantastic! It is so incredibly heartfelt. I listen to this CD over and over and over, and it being only about 40 minutes long, that's not hard to do. The shortness in length is my only complaint.The songs \\"You're Beautiful\\" and \\"Good-Bye My Lover\\" actually gave me chills when I listened to them the first half a dozen times, and the feeling has diminished only slightly after hearing them countless times by now.I can't say enough for James Blunt as an artist. His lyrics are wonderful and actually meaningful, which is a rarity indeed in today's music business. His voice is rather high, but now I don't even think twice about it when I hear him sing, it takes only a short while to get used to.I don't think a CD can ever come more highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD","review":"James Blunt has a unique voice.

His voice is just stunningly georgous, it has a pained and fragile quality but with a sublime hypnosis that will have playing this album repeatedly. He sings like a wounded Angel.Mr Blunt has been so successful in his home country (The UK) that he was recently headlined at the famous Glastonbury Festival, he deserves every success in his music career.

At the concert, while waiting for the inherently bubbly Mraz to take the stage, somebody in the audience yelled for Blunt to sing something \\"happy.\\" But personally, I don't think \\"happy\\" is in Blunt's repertoire. James Blunt is someone you listen to when you feel like...feeling sad. His voice is heartbroken, his lyrics are heartwrenching, and he has a pretty good reason to be depressed, if you ask me.Overall, his songs have such depth and beauty to them that evoke emotions, unlike many popular artists of the day.

It is worse than \\"Fish-heads\\" (at least that song was amusing). He has no talent. Simple songwriting has produced some of the best pop/rock songs ever, but simple and low quality just equals bad.

A lyrical example:\\"I saw your face in a crowded place, and i don't know what to do\\". Sounds like something anyone could have written anytime. The melody in this song is extremely weak, repetitious and tiring in combination with James' voice that most of all sounds like a goat (which usually aren't associated with great singers).If you can't sing, why not let someone else sing your songs?I know I might be at risk of being shot by ex-soldier Blunt, but it's a risk I have to take.

I have to agree though that some songs are somewhat catchy, but it's nothing special. \\"Voice of an angel\\" my butt, his voice gets annoying after awhile.

I truly would not be surprised if Alanis Morissette fans dug this. And Morissette fans frankly don't have any taste. Also, I noticed that this review has been looked at by the most people... Blunt is apparantly what people are checking out, and that's sad, when there is so much more out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply \\"Beautiful\\" lol","review":"OMG .... this cd is sooooo beautiful..... I LOVE LOVE LOVE that song \\"Your Beautiful\\" because it's like so emotional and (no pun intended!) beautiful. It makes me cry like every time I listen to it. I would totally buy this cd just for that song b/c it is so meaningful...For example: \\"You're beautiful, You're beautiful... You're Beautiful\\"OMG OMG so awsome.... like you can totally see the girl he's talking about and he's so in love. omg. this song is just so amazing.

If you like Celine Dion and emotionally vacuous power ballads that profusely effuse about love but in actuality have nothing to say about real emotion, then this record will tickle you in places that you didn't know could be tickled. However, I am not one of these people, and as such I would not buy this album or recommend it to anybody with a modicum of emotional intelligence. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this album at all costs, and perhaps buy a Kelly Clarkson record -- she does the same thing but with a less annoyingly cloying falsetto. Thanks for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caterwauling...","review":"I had the...misfortune...of hearing Goodbye My Lover while listening to James' CD yesterday at a friend's house. I was drawn to the song, much like you are drawn to the window when you hear the sounds of felines caterwauling outside. Do people buy his stuff? Are they the same people who forward those emails about the sick kids asking for puppies or the ones with poems written from the grave, saying if you don't forward it to nine people, a large Acme safe will fall on your head?I don't have ice water in my veins, but his lyrics were the most maudlin I've heard in a long time....that, along with his feigned teary-eyed expression he gets while he sings....I was nearly heaving by the end. I just don't get it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explicit lyrics are better","review":"Listening to Beautiful, you will notice a distict difference between this CD and the radio version which is sold by Amazon as the \\"clean\\" version. As long as you are not buying this underage or for someone underage or sensitive to language, the explicit lyric version is far more powerful and sympathetic to what he is trying to say in these well written songs.He has a distinctive voice and that on another level, at this time in our world's history, we need this work and others like it to make sense of the chaos around us.This is an excellent collection very well produced. And a great price! Grab it, its a clear winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album - a bit Beatles-y","review":"OK we've all heard James Blunt's song You're Beautiful on either the radio or the TV but the album is more than that. For a start you have to really listen to the words and I just love his voice. The album has some adult language but I don't think that detracts from the songs which I have been playing over and over since I bought the album.I'm not a big fan of the Beatles but I think James has been influenced by them at some point. Move over Robbie Williams you've got competition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to bedlam or not... this UK rocker is HOT!!!","review":"Lately, it's rare that I find a new CD that I truly love. Well it's time to put that feeling to rest. Today, I purchased Back to Bedlam by James Blunt.I know many are put off by the array of current pop artists, but James Blunt deserves a chance. Every song is pure delight. James Blunt pours his heart and soul into each composition and his emotions shine through. This is not one of those CDs that you buy for the hit single and hate the rest. The rest is a bonus; because its just as good, if not better, than the hits. In addition to \\"You're Beautiful\\" and \\"Goodbye My Lover\\", my favorite tracks are \\"Wisemen\\", \\"Tears And Rain\\" and \\"Billy\\". If you are fans of David Gray and Damien Rice, you will be enchanted with Back to Bedlam.For more information about James Blunt, visit his website at www.jamesblunt.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Every Song!","review":"I'm very picky and I have a short attention span with music. It takes me about a minute to get bored of a song before changing it. And I normally end up liking only 2 or 3 tracks in a whole album. But this album... Wow! It's the kind of album you can just leave playing without touching the skip button! It's great if you want to just enjoy some good sounds; and it's even better if you want to hear some great lyrics. James Blunt writes his own music so when he sings you can hear and feel the emotion pouring out of him. He's a true artist and a total pleasure. I really recommend this CD. Enjoy! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the Media wanted...","review":"i was just reading some really bad reviews about this artist...its really not fair...just because all of a sudden James Blunt became famous it doesnt mean he's not a good writer neither a good musician...Listening to this album, i realized that its really like a way out of the entire superficial new music industry...yes, James' music isnt really deep and not that hard to understand, therefore i think that by the credit that he has received he has helped in a way the better artists out there because people are finally starting to consider music as something beautiful and not raunchy, lame and stupid...i give this album 3.5 ,james did a very hard job, not to mention that he co-wrote or wrote all of the 10 songs and played at least one instrument in every track...high is a really beautiful song, easy to listen to...no bravery is pensive and meaningful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting Pop Swill","review":"The lyrics quite literally could have been and sound as if they were written by a love-smitten 13 year old. I suppose, however, that as long as love is a concept that hits home, there will inevitabley be \\"artists\\" like this, monopolizing on it with their own pathetic 10 tracks of heart-wrenching \\"bedlam.\\" If you often describe your musical taste as \\"generic\\" or \\"simple,\\" this is unequivocally for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is excellent.","review":"First, on the album... James' compositions are simple (like Howie Day and as a guitarist I know what I'm talking about) but very melodic, he's a great song-writer, I usually don't really care for the voice but he has a very good voice too (not irritating at all as two ignorants said here... listen to My Chemical Romance to see what is an irritating voice).Secondly on James Blunt... HE is NOT a poser unlike 95% of the music stars (won't name any because there are too many) today, James is simple and doesn't have a big head because he passed from soldier to the stupid fame, he stays James Blunt and I respect him for that.The album has many good songs and in my whole life so far I didn't find many albums with many good songs, maybe the only one in 2005.If you love acoustic songs like me, buy this album and you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"David Gray on helium","review":"I dunno, man... I was open to this, I really was, but I just can't quite \\"go there\\"...A little too corny (the reviewer below is right), a little too heart-on-sleeve sincere.

This guy sounds like he's been listening to The Bee Gee's since he was ten years old. Atleast The Bee Gee's had talent, something this guy doesn't have! I hate \\"You're Beautiful\\" it's so mainstream pop and syrupy it's sickening. As a matter of fact the whole cd is just that! \\"Cry\\" and \\"Billy\\" are about as weak as you can get, both crappy acoustic guitar tunes. Let me tell you James Blunt would have never have made it in the seventies. Artists like Cat Stevens, Paul Simon, Gordon Lightfoot, Jim Croce, and James Taylor could run rings around Mr. Blunt. It's too bad, but our music industry is hopeless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Singer","review":"The first time I ever heard of James Blunt was on the radio and they were playing his first big hit \\"You're Beautiful\\". I just thought to myself \\"Woah, who's this dude with that horrible singing voice?\\" One of my friends loves him and she lent me the CD because she had asked me if I've heard of James Blunt, and I told her no. When I popped the CD in my stereo. I realized this was the same guy from the radio. I listened to the whole thing, because I just thought that he might actually have some good songs, but I was wrong, all his songs were super boring, and his voice is just ear grating, it was like when you scratch a chalkboard.On a positive note he is not a bad songwriter, he just can't sing, so he would be better off at just writing songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreal","review":"This CD is the best to come along in a VERY long time. Great music, with heartfelt lyrics, James is Brilliant. Each song tells a story, that we have all been through at one time or another. A must have for people who like relaxing meaningful music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing.","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that find his voice annoying. I hate that he yodels the last syllable of EVERY word. Just because you CAN do that doesn't mean that you should. I have no problem with men singing in high voices. Dexter Holland of the Offspring, Michael Jackson (Don't laugh at me), Freddy Mercury, and Ozzy (back in the day at least) have high male voices...but they don't sound like THIS. I'm even partial to Colin Meloy of The Decemberists. \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic (another high-voiced singer) did a much better version of one of these songs called \\"You're Pitiful\\". I highly recommend you check it out. My two-star rating is based only on the simple acoustic instrumentation (which I enjoy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Out Your Straight Razors...","review":"I bought this album on the recommendation of my 9-year old daughter and on the strength of one song, \\"You're Beautiful\\". I also liked the fact that Blunt has a long military lineage in his family.This is the most depressing bunch of junk I have ever heard. This is why I-tunes have taken off and any technological arrangement that allows people the choice of jettisoning most of the stuff on albums to get to the good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good singer, weird marketing strategy.","review":"If Blunt's music is so great and if he is a military war veteran.... why does he have to grow his hair into a Beatles mop and in his video take his smelly shoes off in a ceremonial zen-like fashion? What's is all that about? We can also do without all the potty-mouth language. It's overdone and it's impact is long gone today.He has a good voice and his songs are fine.... now James, clean up your language, stop pretending to be a member of Paul Revere and the Raiders, and know it's okay to be well groomed and looking sharp... and you will get 2 more stars from this reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst album...EVER","review":"This album is a cynical exercise - nothing more.

I was very embarrassed when she informed me of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album deserves no stars","review":"Some deluded person with bad hearing compared James Blunt to Tori Amos. Hardly. He was lucky with 'Beautiful'. Listen closely- that sucks too! The ramblings of an emotionally desperate middle school student. I rue the day she made eye contact with James. This album is like hummingbird nectar- lotsa sugar but no substance. I hate that I was tricked into buying it. I hate that James Blunt took 80 minutes of my life that I will never recover. I was so hopeful when I bought it. Bottom line: Melodramatic lyrics coupled with uninspired music. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice like a male Dolly Parton","review":"Or something like that. I just know his voice has a rich warm character that melts me. When I first heard him, the DJ was all \\"I almost cried the first time I heard this\\" and I was all \\"whatever\\" but then he played Goodbye My Lover and it sounded so unique. (And it wasn't because it was recorded in Carrie Fisher's bathroom.) He's sorta Kat Stevens.

I am returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-serious pop","review":"The production is lush. Mr. Blunt has that kind of raspy tenor that sounds sincere and inoffensive at the same time. It's elevator music, the kind of music some people put on to chill. Kem, Norah Jones and a long list of others make this kind of candy. It sells because it fills a need. But is stuff like this memorable or profound? No. Look at the lyrics of this CD. It reads like bad high school poetry. Are the melodies particularly interesting? It's the kind of stuff someone with very modest musical talent can thump away on a piano or guitar.Why the hype for this CD? I have no idea. It's a pleasant enough listen and is well produced. It's decent enough music to smooch to. I can point to tens of CDs made this year that are of this ilk that haven't been selling nearly as well. Someone has to be anointed by the press, and this is James Blunt's turn. Lucky guy. He's won the lottery with rather ordinary music."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Warning","review":"I was unaware that James Blunt's Back to Bedlam CD came in two versions-- clean and filled with foul language. When I ordered the used version, I saw no warning that there would be expletives in songs I had heard without profanity. This should have been put right in the description -- I am unhappy about the CD, and upset that such beautiful songs are ruined with inappropriate language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Haunting","review":"All of the songs on Back to Bedlam showcase James Blunt's signature voice, which is emotionally moving. His sound is comparable to that of Damien Rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Thought Bedlam Was a Place for the Insane","review":"There's nothing insane about James Blunt's first Album. It's beautifully constructed and designed to appeal to a wide range of potential listeners. I must fit into this range because it appealed to me big time.

Brilliant. Blunt is a singer songwriter who doesn't have to break any musical boundaries to instantly be likable. He's a bit folk, a bit pop, and a bit rock, and these combinations are incredible in the way that he mixes them on Back to Bedlam. Plus his lyrics seem genuine and his voice is very unique. Standout tracks would be the aforementioned \\"You're Beautiful\\", \\"Goodbye My Lover\\", \\"Tears and Rain\\", \\"No Bravery\\", and my favorite, \\"Wisemen\\". Get this album if you like cool music, and when he makes his next one, buy that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away.","review":"Usually I buy good old fashioned 'Rock'. (In fact the day I bought this album I also bought QOTSA, Foo's and Aerosmith.) But of the four this is the one that is the most compelling.

You can't go wrong with this album unless you only like death metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Perspective...","review":"I discovered James Blunt a few days ago during my morning commute. A DJ at WPLJ in New York had just returned from a trip to Europe and couldn't stop raving about the single \\"You're Beautiful.\\" Coincidentally, Blunt happened to be in New York at the time and - even though his record hadn't been officially released in America yet - invited him onto the program to perform a set. On the strength of that performance, I went out and purchased the import album.Blunt - who has a colorful past in the Royal Armed Forces - may be a great, emerging singer-songwriter. His debut album is mature and tuneful, with deftly written lyrics. It is unusual to have a pop-song make reference to Dorian Grey nowadays, but Blunt pulls it off. Now, I am hearing \\"You're Beautiful\\" on mainstream American stations, so I can only assume his popularity will continue to rise."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best CD Ive heard all year","review":"This album is really remarkable. Its one of the few albums where every song is great. I love being able to play track 1 and not having to worry about skipping songs because they are all really enjoyable to listen to.Its kind of hard to explain his style. He does emotional without being whiney, and he does catchy without selling out. It has pop-elements but its more than that.I am usually hesitant to try new artists because most music albums disappoint me - they'll have 2 or 3 good songs (the singles usually) and the rest are crap. I am a fan of industrial music/heavy metal, and I am not ashamed to admit that James Blunt has blown me away.James Blunt is a very talented singer/songwriter with a lot of experiences to share.

I must say that James Blunt is one of those types of artists that seems to have it all....(ie cool voice, emotional lyrics etc) however his ability to write a catchy song (save You're Beautiful) is simply void. Someone in this list of reviewers compared him to Elton John. LOL....That's a good one. This disk isn't horrible. But it's not particularly inspiring either. Nothing on the disk motivates me to listen a 2nd or 3rd time.By the way, we were unfortunate enough to get the CD with the f-word explicative in the song, You're Beautiful, which blared out with our 3 kids listening in the car. Thanks alot, James."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully unique","review":"I don't know how anyone can't love this guy's voice. I LOVE it. It is unique and beautiful.

He takes me to a place that very few artists can bring me."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!","review":"This CD is MAZING from start to finish! James Blunt is a great singer/songwriter! His song writing is very personal and, yet, comes out very melodic and catchy. He has a very unique voice that just captivates you and pulls you in to each and every song. With A CD filled with ballads' it does not fail to please at any point on any of the CD's 10 songs. There is really no one to compare him to musically.

His songwriting is achingly simple (almost too earnest to be believed), but that's most of the beauty of it: everybody at some point in their lives has had an experience like the one Blunt's amazing voice sings of in his debut single, \\"You're Beautiful,\\" in which his lead character sees the woman of his dreams and wonders if he'll ever get a second look.

I am a massage therapist and this brace helps decrease the back pressure so I can continue to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best from 2005","review":"It's surprisingly satisfying to hear progressive jazz played on a nylon string guitar. The electric guitar is a beautiful instrument, and distortion and other electronic effects are wonderful, but there is something distinctively immediate and warm about the sound of nylon. This music is a combination of African folk and pop music and early fusion, and reminds me in places of Dave Holland. Like George Benson and Kurt Rosenwinkel, Lionel Louke sings with his single note playing, which gives the music more emotional complexity and depth, and although he plays an acoustic guitar throughout he uses distortion and a wah-wah on the last two tracks. The album is beautifully produced and packaged, and the acoustic bass--Massimo Biolcati--and the drums--Ferenc Nemeth--are energetic, clear and precise. I don't know why this album has not received more attention. It's certainly one of the best 2005 albums that I've heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Back Story, but Musically Uninteresting","review":"The Gilfema Trio hails from Benin, Sweeden, and Hungary; the \\"+2\\" others play the clarinet and the ocarina. The group aims for an African - jazz - world fusion sound and incorporates clapping, vocals in an African language, and nylon string guitars. So, it could make for some interesting music, but I think instead this music comes out sounding confused, unsure of itself, and a bit cheesy. The ocarina is especially bizarre (e.g. on track 5) since I thought those things only existed at Renaissance Fairs. Salome(tk 4) sticks closest to a modern jazz feel, features the clarinetist and is recommended. I don't listen to a lot of world music so maybe all of this album is more revolutionary in that setting. But in my opinion, it doesn't mesh into anything worth much air time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bings croons some jazz while Bix blows some hot riffs...","review":"Bing Crosby is probably the most underrated jazz singer(with the acception of Doris Day) who really was singing jazz while stiff singers like Irving Kaufman and John McCormick were as stiff as a rod. Crosby(who was highly influenced by Louis Armstrong's singing at the time) and Bix(who was also influenced by Armstrong's playing, but never imitated him) are featured here of course with Paul Whiteman's somewhat dated band, while Whiteman's outfit was playing dated uhm-pa-pa's Bing and Bix we're jazzing it up, which Whiteman didn't like at all, however Bing & Bix did add a lot of jazz content to Whiteman's outfit. This CD is mainly recomended to fans of Bix and Bing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bix Is Missing","review":"These are interesting early Bing recordings, but Bix is virtually nowhere to be heard except lost in the horn section of the Paul Whiteman band.

The red light should continue to flash.3) Press mute (press black wheel on headset straight down) until green light appears on headset, then let go of wheel. Green light should remain on.4) Disconnect AC power adapter from bottom of base station for 5 seconds, then reconnect it.5) Headset is finished pairing when red light on base is fully illuminated and green light on headset disappears.6) Test by removing headset from base and pressing talk button - they should now be connected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came without the ear piece as shown in the photo","review":"I received my product from PC Universe, and there was no ear piece as shown in the photo of the product.

The ending was almost an afterthought. It genuinely seemed like the director looked at his/her watch and told the crew to wrap it up.There are two reasons why I gave it two stars instead of one: 1) the creatures were well done. While they never had me jumping in fear, they were pretty cool for B movie monsters. 2) It was fun spotting familiar actors.Unfortunately, neither of those two compensate for a badly written movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Kiddie Borrowers","review":"I love a great western movie, but when you mix horror with it man what a delight.

Just a total waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burrowing Under the Skin to the Reality of the American West","review":"Well, here's a dying species: a beautifully made horror film with great attention to detail and respect for the viewer's intelligence. That THE BURROWERS was not released theatrically is further testament to the current \\"dumbing down\\" of the Hollywood experience. The powers-that-be decided that the first weekend wouldn't go boffo and canceled release--thus, a major film goes direct to DVD. Pity. Everything works here, nothing's wasted, a labor of love that is as much an alternative history as it is traditional horror. It offers up a vision of an America where the death of the great herds of buffalo that used to roam the land signifies a dread that lies beyond greed, selfishness and the blind stumbling inertia of manifest destiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"simply boring!!

It is a real horror western, and blends the two genres very well. The costumes, dialogue, setting, and casting all come together to create a very genuine Old West tableau... which is then invaded by a genuinely creepy, shockingly weird menace from beneath the earth. The horror of this story is visceral, bleak, and uncompromising. It is not a wall-to-wall gorefest, but once bad things start to happen they do not stop.

The acting is poor. The camera work is jumpy at times, someone was having a difficult time holding the camera still.I know the job of advertisers is to promise a great product to make everyone rush out to buy it, and unfortunately there are those who fell for it hook, line and sinker here.A few of the death scenes were creative, but overall the movie was just not good. Save your money, this movie will probably be on the Sci-Fi channel shortly. The creature effects are rather good, and it was refreshing to see only a partial use of disappointing CGI but it could not make it more watchable.Overall the film does not take you anywhere. Even in the final moments, which is one of the most anti-climactic horror endings in all of horror films.A constantly boring creature-feature Western.Do yourself a favor: do miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete ripoff!","review":"This movie is a complete waste of time and money.

It is mostly monologue. But instead of one woman on a stage this movie has her in various setting and various costumes. The movie story line is her writing remembrances to their eleven children of her husband, their marriage and their ministry.She tells of their many hardships using the kind of language common to that era. She gracefully weaves biblical responses to the challenges that gave them hope and strength to endure. This long narrative is an eloquent testimony of the goodness and grace of God to take special care of His people during times of greatest difficulty.This movie is highly recommended viewing to get an insider viewpoint of one person that greatly impacted church history. And it is evident that his wife played a huge role his success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight Into The Personal Life and Love of Jonathan Edwards","review":"This is a one-woman play portraying Jonathan Edwards's wife writing to a daughter. The letter covers their courtship, babies, and relationship to the people of the parish. It includes happy events and tragedies, ending in the reason for the letter and the quote from Jonathan Edwards about his marriage, 'An Uncommon Union'.This is a rather plain, unpolished and inexpensively produced DVD, but it gets the message across effectively and appropriately.I got the DVD after recently reading a very intensive book about the scholarly work of Pastor Jonathan Edwards. His work doesn't show a personal side. I wanted to know more about the person who wrote so passionately about God, Heaven, and Hell.I know Jonathan Edwards better now that I have watched this very simple but powerful presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked properly 7 months, then failures","review":"This router worked fine for 7 months. Then it would consistently fail when the room temperature exceed around 85 degrees F. Many customer service calls, experiments as they directed, and two replacements failed to resolve the problem. The second replacement worked for a few days, but before the weather got warm enough to tell if it also had the problem, this router died completely, taking the power supply down with it.

I guess I was hoping for a view of Mormons who, after study and thought, left the church because of doctrinal differences, historical problems, and so on. Many in this book claimed that they had never read the \\"Book of Mormon\\" from cover to cover or had not read it seriously.

What is funny about a group of guys that get so drunk/drugged out that they can not remember what happened the night before?There was an older movie that the guy wakes up in an alley and finds that he may have sold his girlfriend the night before and he retraces his foot steps to find her and get her back.

There's some suspense in this movie--but of course it's of the \\"no don't do something stupid AGAIN\\" type of suspense. There's not even a point to this movie other than guys getting their buddy messed up at a bachelor party weekend and trying to fix their screw up when they can't find him. Although another movie, Bruno, was fairly gross, it was making a point--making fun of how consumer driven, prejudiced, and egotistical American culture is. The Hangover has as poor of a story as Old School and I just wish I'd never wasted my time watching this thing. Stay away from this movie unless you enjoy shows like Jackass and American Pie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dreadful film","review":"That 210 people gave this movie a \\"5\\" makes me fear the future of this nation. The Hangover is an adult film aimed at foul-minded twelve-year-olds. Since I am neither, I lasted a half hour before I could stand no more. There was nothing in that time that was funny and not a thing that was even remotely believeable. The film was headed down a sadly predictable course toward total tastelessness, although it was darn close to that already. It doesn't matter a bit that the blu-ray picture quality was pristine because there is nothing to see. I'm only sorry I had to grant this movie one star, which it richly does not deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok...","review":"If you're looking for a whole lot of extra footage- this doesn't really have it. The extra pictures were ok, nothing special. High score because it's an amazing movie but the regular edition is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best R-rated comedy since \\"Wedding Crashers\\"","review":"I was reluctant to see this movie since I was indifferent to Todd Phillips previous comedy, \\"Old School\\", but I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself laughing at the antics and mishaps of these middle aged men who discover utter chaos when they find their Las Vegas hotel room ravaged and with wild animals. All the actors are fine but special mention should be made of Bradley Cooper formerly the swinest suitor of Rachel McAdams in \\"Wedding Crashers\\", who's superb here as the confused bachelor who's trying to make sense of the chaos. If you're depressed in these tough financial times--this comedy will bring you out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest","review":"I saw this movie in the theater. I don't go to the theater much anymore with Blu-ray's in the mail, big LCD screens, and 7.1 DTS and all. So, when I do go, I truly believe that the movie will be worth it. This movie hit the bulls-eye. With all of the sub standard comedies coming out lately, this was a welcome change. My Fiance and I haven't laughed at a movie so hard ever! And what I said about the theater, goes double for spending money on the Blu-ray itself, and I AM buying this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I rolled on the carpet laughing!!!","review":"....literally.... What a funny movie. Very RRR rated of course. Extremely funny situations, comments and dialogue. Funniest movie I've seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a skit, turned movie","review":"The writer took an oft-used skit (the \\"I did WHAT last night when I was drunk?#!?\\") and prolonged it to movie length. I knew exactly what I was in for, 24 minutes into the film.That being said, I have the crude, sick sense of humor movies liked this are tailored for, yet I only found myself laughing, maybe, twice throughout the entire film (and just briefly at best). I laughed hysterically through Mary, Borat, American Pie, Jackass, etc. and even Bruno, but, this movie didn't do anything for me. It very nearly bored me.Maybe it was because most of the \\"hilarious\\" incidents in the film were nothing I hadn't seen before in a plethora of other movies? Naturally, you can't expect a movie to be 100% original and unique; especially a comedy. But it seems like the writer made no attempt at it.I still enjoyed it enough to stay in my seat, but to nowhere near the degree that a majority of these other reviews emit. IMO, the movie was definitely overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie gets 5 stars....the DVD release gets 2!","review":"I love the movie...it makes me laugh so hard, I cackle. The problem is that I bought a DVD with zero features. I knew this was the case before I bought it...but I wanted that digital copy that is splashed on the outside of the disc. My iPod is just itching for it. Only, once you open the case, you find that the digital copy you just paid extra for is for Windows Media Player ONLY! No iTunes compatible version. BOOO Warner Brothers. Harry Potter 6 had an iTunes version. Why not this movie?!? Completely and utterly disappointed....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh. My. God.","review":"I'm definitely not a prude and enjoy a raunchy movie as much as the next person, but that wasn't even the problem with this film; it just was NOT funny! I laughed one time the whole movie and that was at a supporting character, not even one of the main stars. Save your money, folks. The only person who should think this film is entertaining is a 15 year old BOY and even that is insulting to 15 year old boys! The reason so many people are giving it rave reviews is, they're (a) 15 year old boys, or, (b) brain dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predicatble and boring","review":"This is one of the truly most disapointing movies I have ever watched. Whoever made this threw every cliche' from every other bachelor party movie into a pot and cooked up this mess. Boring. Don't bother. Wow, it's a sad state of affairs when a movie this bad gets so many positive reviews. Don't get me wrong, I love stupid, crude, funny movies, but I struggled to work up a chuckle or two during this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Part With Mike Tyson was Hilarious!!!","review":"the rest of the movie was a train wreck. You would have to be a complete idiot to find this funny. It's disappointing to discover that apparently 90% of American youths are complete idiots.Heaven weeps above the earth all night till morn,In darkness weeps as all ashamed to weepFor the earth hath made her state forlorn"},{"rating":"1","title":"cant download!!!","review":"Bought the movie but cant download to kindle!!! I can watch, but the download tab is half hidden under the watch tab!!! Don't have Internet access where I want to watch. Gonna send back kindle if this is the crap I gotta deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 euro and 120 mins of my life that I can never get back.","review":"Seeing all the positive ratings given by my fellow man for this stinking heap of pus makes me think I need to start building me a spaceship.A Golden Globe for that????Give me warp speed.NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Old for This","review":"I picked this up on disc because I had encountered various mentions online of people finding it hilarious, and I dote on comedy. This one is slickly produced though sickly written from an unswervingly adolescent point of view. Comedy works best when one or more of the characters is sympathetic: we laugh at the terrible difficulties this character gets into while hoping for him to triumph over them in the end.I was able to generate no such hope for these four guys. My sympathies were more engaged by the Las Vegas people, seen and unseen, whose job it was to clean up after these slobs. Personally, I thought the stripper that the dentist married a far more suitable mate than the fiancee with whom he had already built a wretchedly dysfunctional relationship. So, while the quartet does indeed get into terrible difficulties, my greatest hope was for them to wend their way toward a Darwin Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great art, but great nonetheless","review":"I enjoy all kinds of art. Highbrow this ain't but the extreme ludicrous-ness of the circumstances that befall these characters is so over-the-top, and the characters so likable and engaging with all their flaws, and the sheer joy of the ensemble playing, led masterfully by the smooth and daring Bradley Cooper, made this a must-have for my collection. I laughed out loud watching it alone in my room and plan to watch it over again and again over time when I need a lift or a two-hour vacation. Zack G. Practically steals the show with the character's off-the-wall thought processes but everyone shines, except for poor Justin Bartha who doesn't have much to do, a function of the plot. As memorable a film as any that were paraded on the red carpet at the glitzy awards ceremonies for the year 2009."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now a classic","review":"THis movie is so funny. Definately not one that you watch with your 60 year old parents, but one you watch with your more crude friends. I purchased this for my brother-in-law who usually hates any fictional movie, but he loved this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hangover is Hilarious","review":"This movie is hilarious. I didn't get a chance to see it in theatres. When I finally bought the DVD and saw the movie I could not stop laughing. I recommend this movie for anyone who wants a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Funniest","review":"HIGHLY recommended. One of the funniest flicks! Keeps you laughing throughout; not Scary Movie So Stupid its Funny, but FUNNY! Just funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Problem!!","review":"DVD was reasonably priced, arrived quickly and in excellent condition. What more could you ask?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand the hype about this movie","review":"I heard this movie is so funny that you'll laugh your butt off. I compared notes with a couple friends whose reaction was similar to mine. This was not funny to me. What made it not funny to me is that practically 99% of the stuff in here that happened was unrealistic. And I find these unrealistic movies to not be entertaining. The only part of it that I recall seemed realistic was when that one character was going to the bathroom, and instead of just turning his head, he turned his entire body while still taking care of business at the toilet. That I could see happening if somebody was drunk.There are various types of humor out there, but not everyone likes all types of humor. I think comedies need to have a subcategory according to the type of humor to help people to further identify if they like it or not. And this is not my type of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"not really funny- predictable. silly sophmoric delve into arrested development. Cliches abound. I imagine that the second movie is the same?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny Bachelor Party Movie","review":"Three of us watched this and laughed our arse off. The characters were super funny. Chan was great. Tyson good. Heather Graham was sexy as usual. I loved the idea you had to piece together what happened. I even watched the special features. Overall it's a 4 - 5 stars. I'm not sure if there is another better bachelor party movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see","review":"I was a little hesitant to see this movie, it seemed like one of the all too recent movies where all of the good parts are featured in the trailer, and that's all you've got. So not the case. Not only was it a packed theatre at the midnight showing, but there was not any interval longer than three minutes that had a quiet audience. Nobody could stop laughing!From Zach Galifiakanis, we had a stellar show. His ability to play the creepy weirdo is out of this world. His wolf pack speech was amazing.The cameo from Mike Tyson was hilarious!Don't miss the end credits where a lot of the missing information is revealed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings a smile to my face............................","review":"Loved this movie.....when I'm stressed out, this is my new go to movie. Love it, love it, love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny, total waste of time","review":"I agree with the others who gave this a one-star review. I watched it as so many people said it was \\"hilarious\\" and a sequel was made. But I didn't laugh once. It was less a comedy than a bumbling mystery to figure out what happened the previous night. If you want something that aims at college-age humor, watch Animal House. This is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the worst real hangover I've ever had","review":"I rented The Hangover on iTunes, thinking it might be pretty entertaining. What a waste of $3.99; I'm only glad I had the good sense not to buy it. It's the kind of humor designed to be a laff-riot for the lowest common denominator of movie viewers. The Golden Globe awards committee must have been tripping on acid when they chose this piece of crap as best comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hangover","review":"Because of all the hype, I couldn't wait to see this movie. What a disappointment! Not funny at all, totally implausible and stupid. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hungover Watching This Nonsense","review":"The fact that anyone thought this was a funny, charming movie makes me want to resign from the human race. Mistreatment of a baby, defiling of anything decent about relationships, an unfunny script, etc. etc....anyone who liked this movie is an idiot. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst.","review":"Absolutely one of the worse movies out there, the plot and the acting were atrocious, sure the trailers were funny, that was what influenced me to rent the movie. This is one of those movies after watching it you say \\"Omigod people pay money to see this\\" luckey for me I only spent $1.99 to rent it. A real stinkeroo."},{"rating":"1","title":"RECYCLED TR-AASH!!!!","review":"this movie is only funny if it is your first time seeing a comedy-a great premise ruined by recycled garbage jokes (i guess they were supposed to be funny and would be if you havent' seen them before in other movies). a few decent moments doesnt' turn this movie around which was basically coasting on the coatails and fame of old school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangover with a major headache","review":"This movie was very painful to watch. I watched it with my hubby and by the time the movie was midway through, we couldn't wait for it to end. It started out funny enough, but then it quickly went down hill from there...and it just kept going... and going...and going. First of all, there's dearth of material to be had about a guy who's about to get married. He went to Vegas with his buddies to enjoy the last few days as a bachelor and everybody got drunk and don't remember anything in the morning. Fine. We got that. What we didn't get was the AWFUL stereotyping of the Asian guys, as well as the stereotyping of the possessive girlfriend. It's one cliche after another! What pushed us over the edge was the sexual innuendo used on the baby. That was really, REALLY, a bad taste in filmmaking! (Don't we have enough perverts?) Mike Tyson was great playing himself. In fact, the actors in this movie were great playing their part. It was the script that sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let down","review":"Wow, after all the hype and good reviews I found this movie boring and dumb. I just couldn't find the humor in most of it and it was poor acting and a poor story. I still don't get why people thought it was funny. I would recommend Jim Carey's movies like Dumb and Dumber, Pet Detective and The Mask if you want truly funny, well scripted movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I think this is one of the most overrated comedies of all time,the acting was fine but the writing was weak and predictable..I almost didn't finish it but figured it had to get better...I was wrong"},{"rating":"1","title":"Majorly disappointing","review":"I was SO looking forward to the laugh-fest I'd been promised by several people - mix of male and female friends. Wow, was I ever disappointed in this waste of time and space. I never - ever - laughed out loud. I was actually hoping that the tiger would EAT Zach what's-his-face. Just awful. Not even mildly entertaining. To each his own, I guess, just not for me. Too bad I can't give it 0 stars. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Movie","review":"I saw this when it first came out in theaters and it was completely sold out, for good reason.

Immediately after seeing this movie, I went online to Amazon and requested an email notifying me when The Hangover would be released on DVD. So, here I am, sitting on my couch, running late for work, ordering a copy of The Hangover.

Charlie Chaplin was more sophisticated than The Hangover.Lame. Un-funny. This movie is the equivalent a child with a booger on the end of his finger sticking it out at you and expecting you to laugh. Funny to him, not to me.In addition, this film is proof Roger Ebert can no longer be trusted. The blurb on the back of the box quotes Ebert as rating this three and a half stars, with this assessment: \\"Now this is what I'm talkin' about. A funny movie, flat out, all the way through.\\"There's nothing wrong with dumbness and wackiness. Laurel and Hardy. I rest my case. But that was inspired dumbness. Seinfeld was inspired wackiness.

No thanks.","review":"I hate this movie because I'd only been watching it for 10 seconds before the film insulted all gay people. I only had to wait two minutes for the next insult to all gay people. In two more minutes a third vile insult to gays followed. I then turned it off. I don't watch films hoping to be insulted. Everyone associated with this film is now non-existent to me.

The characters are all great and work together extremely well. Zach Galifianakis is, in particular, hilarious. I've watched this movie twice so far (once in theaters and once at home) and both times my jaw hurt at the end from laughing so hard. It was non-stop great scenes, funnier than old school, funnier than wedding crashers. Chances are, if you are looking at this review, you've heard about this movie from friends/family, the good things that you've heard are true. I'd recommend it for all adults, not just young. I'm in my twenties but convinced my parents to see it and they were very pleased (again, though, not for those with issues about raunchy things and talk). Get it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies....ever!","review":"I couldnt stop laughing when I saw this in the movies. Every scene perfectly played out. It was to me one long joke with the ending being the punchline...and a very funny one at that. There are some comedies that get old after watching it once or twice but this doesnt.

It wasn't.I stuck through it because it got a series of positive reviews, at least if you check on Metacritic, and I couldn't figure out why.The story is well put together and well-directed, but for me it's not funny enough to be an outrageous comedy, not charming enough to be a romantic comedy, and not perceptive enough to offer any real insights into life.

These two movies (Dude and Bachelor) I think were great movies. This movie lacked the humor and wit they portrayed and found Hangover boring.I felt like Hangover was a long commercial about how \\"everything works out fine\\" in/after Las Vegas.

When it comes out on DVD, I will definitely be adding it to my movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie of the year so far!","review":"Funniest movie of the year, hands down! I remember seeing 'Knocked Up' in a crowded theater in Chicago, and thought it was one of the funniest movies ever. But seeing it again at home, I thought it was okay, but not The Greatest Comedy of the Decade like it seemed in the packed movie house.'The Hangover', on the other hand, was just as funny when watched at home, and it didn't need a crowd to egg me on. I'm sitting in my basement and laughing uproaringly into an empty room! And not caring!!Basic premise - four guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party. They wake up, and no one remembers what happens, and the groom is missing.

The scenes are unpredictable, and it just keeps getting worse and worse for the cast, and funnier for us. Easily makes my top 5 for favorite comedy.

SPOILER ALERT: My only complaint is the one mis-step I noticed in the plot. When they are looking for the one guy (forgive me, haven't watched it in a few months) who ends up being on the roof the whole time, why didn't the people who got that mattress off the roof find him? Surely they would have found him up there! But other than that, I thought the movie was amazing. Great laughs and like one other reviewer said, there was hardly any down-time when it came to laughing out loud! Almost laughed the whole time with this one.

What I found was, yes, a pretty formulaic (it's funny how people perceive the same film differently) and average (read: moronic) American comedy.The premise for wackiness to ensue is a good one, but it has been done better in movies such as Very Bad Things (which, granted, is a different type of film).In addition to a few funny lines and one-liners I felt the funniest (best) part was Galifianakis' Polaroid sequence - and that was during the end credits! Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good modern comedy as anyone, such as Superbad - but a movie like Superbad has one crucial difference: a fantastic script. Despite the delicious premise, The Hangover only has a very average one and ultimately fails to deliver.One special mention for the worst play-it-safe soundtrack in recent memory.

It was a real disappointment - way over-rated. There were a couple of funny lines (too few and far between), but overall I would say its not worth the time or the $2.99 rental fee. Its not that I dislike \\"over the edge\\" humor (I liked Borat enough to buy it). The real problem with this film is that its just not that funny.

So let me start by saying almost NO movie could live up to that hype, and this one didn't. there was a laugh here and there. although i don't care to admit it i laughed at the baby part, but overall the movie didn't make me laugh like an old school, animalhouse, American pie, airplane, dumb and dumber etc... I wanted to find out what happened at the end but many of the gags were very predictable if that makes sense. if you could possibly watch this movie without the expectations it might be a 2 or even a 3 star movie, but if you're feed the hype i was- you'll find yourself very disappointed. sorry in advance to all the hangover lovers out there i don't mean to upset you."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT WANT BLUE RAY","review":"Clearly it states this item was supposed to be a DVD.

You would need to pay me, pretty well, to see this movie again. It's like they stole they plot from \\"Dude Where's My Car\\" and replaced the car with a guy. The humor was extremely juvenile and repetitive.I understand it's supposed to be a funny movie, I enjoy most Will Ferrell movies for example, but this movie wasn't even funny. I can't even say it had a few funny parts, it had maybe one, two tops.I kept waiting for the \\"movie of the year\\" type scenes and they never came.Simply awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude! This film is for you.","review":"If you're a frat boy or wannabe, then this film was made with you in mind. My husband and I got a free copy of it with a film-by-mail subscription. I was looking forward to watching it, since I love stupid comedies like Airplane, Police Academy, and Naked Gun. We tucked into it with some beer and Indian takeout. First, I need to tell you that if your IQ is over 90, you are going to need to be drunk and/or high to make it through this. It's immature without being fun and... god. It just reminds me of some of the bad writing the boys used to do in high school English class, trying too hard to be cool; not witty, and not original. All of the women in it are bad stereotypes and did I mention it's not very funny? I feel like a grumpy old lady, but just Blues Brothers or something instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend it to anybody","review":"The movie tells you that to be happy you must have bad relationships, use heavy drugs to do things that you will not remember next day and being irresponsible is a nice way of life.

Anyone who watched that movie, and felt creepy afterward will understand the similarity. Yes, I laughed, very heartily at times, and yet I found myself ashamed at the same time. I suppose we're supposed to feel okay at the behavior of these guys because after all, they were drugged with a so-called date-rape drug, but for any film to really work,(at least for me) some of the characters need to be sympathetic. With the possible exception of Doug (Justin Bartha), who appears sparingly in the movie, these guys aren't. Now, with a movie titled \\"The Hangover\\", I knew not to expect Shakespeare, or even Abbott and Costello, but with so many patently offensive attempts at humor- a \\"masturbating\\" baby, and quite realistic-appearing fellatio during the end credits, I... well, you have to draw the line somewhere, and this movie crossed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly","review":"I would not recommend this movie.

I started reading the books on the subject and while the language was warm and fuzzy and easily kept your attention, I really didn't get much in the way of technical detail. The examples in the All in One book helped me nail down the more complex topics like delegates and remoting that other books only lightly touched. The one negative to this book is you need some experience in order to understand it. If you lack experience then my advice would be to buy both the MSPress Study Guides and this All in One. Use the MS book to get a feel for the concepts and use the All in One to start coding examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea ... bad execution","review":"This book was a great idea in concept but it lacks in in execution. It suffers from poor editing. The examples often lack some critical piece that would make it very difficult for a beginner to complete the excercises and have working examples.Either the technical editor was sloppy or the proof reader/editor was a non technical person and so could not properly evaluate the logic of what was being written.There is a published errors page on the publishers web site however the sheet only covers the first few chapters.Its very frustrating when you are trying to learn something and the samples don't work and since you are learning you dont' know why?I would NOT depend on this book as the only study guide for the exams.There is a cd ,which comes with test questions, which is helpful however I'm not sure having taken one of the exams in question that the test questions prepare you for the level of difficulty of the actual exams.Good Luck!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have study guide.","review":"While it may be not the only study guide and resource you should read to prepare for the MCAD/MCSD exams, it is certainly a must have for your study and as a reference.

The way the concert was shot is very nice and the visuals are very nice as well.Dave Ghan to his credit is an ultimate showman and puts alot of \\"soul\\" into his singing,but the guy just sounds AWFUL! Dave tries to sing out to much and it comes of like raspy whinning.Just listen. Martin sound's great but he only sings a few songs.

I thought Dave's voice sounded REALLY bad. When I saw DM in concert this tour, I didn't really notice Dave not hitting the notes, but it's glaringly apparent here. Sometimes it's to the point of cringing. I know Dave has been slightly off key ever since the Violator tour, but I never noticed it this much until the DVD. Ouch.I also take exception to the setlist. For instance, I thought \\"Clean\\" was the highlight of the show when I saw them. But here, it was replaced with \\"Condemnation,\\" quite possibly the WORST DM concert song - at least one where, every time I've heard it played, half the crowd goes to the restroom or buys another beer. Why do they keep playing it? I also don't understand why \\"I Feel Loved\\" didn't make the cut. They played it at the show I was at.Anyway, if you want a good performance, buy '101.'

THe milk container and the element and the plugin are all one piece!!! But not to worry if you get water in the plug in area and it won't work just wait three or four days and it may recover! Not good for someone who drinks soy milk or raw almond milk every day.THe blade is so razor sharp it is very likely you will be injured while attempting to get the thing clean anyway. More thought should be put into this- otherwise great concept- of a machine.

Just be careful when you wash it. Overall a good buy.

I think it was a good ending to the Alfred Bester Legacy. It was just so great, you really got to know Bester, feel for him. Some parts of the storyline were just downright funny, I mean, a book critic? Though some of the other reviews do sound like Bester's own . . . what does that mean? Oh well, I don't know. All I know is that I walked away feeling complete. The first book is about the birth of the Corps. The second about it's maturity and the beginnings of Bester. The third about the last of the man you love to hate, B5's own Q, good ol' Al Bester, Psi-Cop extrordinaire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, okay, I guess.","review":"The first two books in this trilogy had more of the Babylon 5 feel I've come to know. This book fell pretty flat. Bester from the show (and the first two books) is truly a more complex person then the one presented here. In the other two books, I could hear Garibaldi speak his lines. In this book, not really. With almost all elements of the B5 universe missing, this book could have been about anyone, anywhere. Plus, unless sleeper drugs have improved (of which improvements are not mentioned in the books from what I saw), they take hours to kick in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Conclusion","review":"I felt that this book was a somewhat disappointing conclusion to the series.

Like or dislike of the character is not as important as learning the real motivations behind what makes that character.I found myself feeling the gambit of emotions for this man, from love to hate, compassion to rooting for his demise. This series gave you insight into the Psi Corps, and it's background. It spans from well before show's time frame until well after it. It was well written, and very engaging. The moral questions that were raised here continue the tradition of Babylon 5's thought provoking storytelling. If you like B5, read this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a hole in your book.","review":"Let me start out by saying that I think this was a good book and a pretty fast read. I does answer questions about Bester.But what me and everyone else is saying that we are missing a good 10 years between 2262 and 2272 when the book takes place.

It seems like the lowest quality newsprint type paper was used. For a workshop manual this is impractical and will shorten the useful life of the book - in workshop conditions a manual such as this is subject to exposure to moisture, oils and greases etc and therefore the paper should be of a good standard.

I have spent more hours on the phone with the Belkin technical support folks than I want to count. Had the router replaced once with only slight improvement. The problem is the continued disconnect when gaming or using Skype/MSN Messenger or Yahoo Messenger. There is no difference even when I hard wire the computer to the router it will still have disconnect issues. Must be a problem within the firmware.

A free four-year old Linksys router which I received with my Earthlink \\"home networking\\" package (and which this Belkin was supposed to replace) always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed, and Linksys is supposed to be notoriously Mac-unfriendly.

Including \\"contributions\\" from Milosevic to make the case for these brain-dead theories is like quoting from \\"Mein Kampf\\" to prove that Hitler was a peace-loving individual.

T. R. Reid obviously knows the culture he is describing, as well as its history and literature. I chuckled at the sections describing the types of fast food one can buy in Tokyo; I made mental notes of many of the sayings of Confucius for future use; and I couldn't resist exclaiming frequently to my husband, \\"Did you know that...?\\" I feel as if I now understand a very big part of our world much better. T. R. Reid is now in London. Will he do for our understanding of the Brits what he did for our knowledge of Asia?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight","review":"The author lived in Asia for several years. In the book he discusses what we in the west might learn from the east. The east has lower crime rates, lower unemployment, safe, clean public places. He traces the roots of the Asian miracle to the emphasis and tradition of the Confucian ethic. That is the basic thesis of the book, but a large part of the pleasure of the book comes from Mr Reid's direct, down home writing style. He has many hilarious anecdotes. Mistranslated English, exotic asian pizzas... He writes about a steel company that made a giant indoor ski area and how that grew from an effort to keep people employed. His neighbor, an elderly gentleman intructs him an Japanese customs... Never dogmatic, always entertaining. The basic message is there are things we can learn from asia, so he lets us see some of the good stuff going on there. Certainly a good message."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Bore","review":"Begins with good writing and interesting tales, then suddenly dies in a morass of stale Confucian history. The book goes from a witty account of Asian life to endless Confucian minutia. I enjoy reading Confucian philosophy and Asian history, but this stuff just was not readable.

This is his talent no doubt, to write with such confidence about phenomena that are merely extrapolations of fairly entrenched stereotypes. His observations are semi-plausible to the uninformed, as most stereotypes and generalizations are, which is why this book likely will be such a success. TR writes and speaks well, but PLEASE disregard the content of his words."},{"rating":"1","title":"A naive account of Asian success","review":"I was surprised to find that Reid has lived outside of the U.S. for so many years because in this book he exemplifies the American liberal mindset that characterizes all things Western (or American) as bad and all things Eastern (or foreign) as good. I can see that he has tried to give a balanced account of two cultures, but he sets up a dichotomy and lands on the Eastern side.Of course, there need not be sides, and Reid's point that Confucian values are essentially the same as Judeo-Christian values is well-taken. But his thesis is naive and weakly-argued. He consistently underrates the social advantages of homogeneity, ignores the social price of conformity, and overrates the mechanism of propoganda. To transfer Japanese methods of socal indoctrination to the U. S.(as Reid describes them) would simply not work.On the plus side, Reid offers a fascinating account of Confucianism and a few fun anecdotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"It is a little boring in parts, but has a lot of very interesting stuff in it if you ever wondered about living in Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was mostly good,informative, and often funny.","review":"I enjoyed this book.

I didn't think the book was too bad when I first glanced through it. But the more I looked through the book and really looked at the scarves (and then read the annoying celebrity interviews), I realized what a waste of money it would be to keep the book. The other reviewer was right, you can go to your local yarn shop, browse the shelves for cool yarns, and then come up with something more creative than these patterns (even if you are a novice knitter).

If you're looking for scarf patterns, there are magazines and books with more creative and unique patterns. Better yet, go to your local yarn shop and have them show you all the yarns you can use to knit a garter stitch scarf--the possibilities are endless. Spend your money on yarn, not on this book.

I purchased the book based on Vogue's reputation and expected to find an interesting selection of patterns and styles. Big mistake!

While there is a certain amount of \\"telegraphing\\" of future plots, Turtledove gives his readers an understanding of the forces of history, and how the swirling political chaos can haunt the lives of ordnary people. The different decisions made by the leaders of the Blood and Iron universe show his readers how different decisions can lead to bloody warfare, hate and prejidice, in an unending and ever cycling circle of death and distruction.Most importanly, the lesson of this work can be glimpsed (however dimly) here in our own world. This is why I think this series is so important.

This book was one of those few. It's not a story so much as a seemingly endless series of 'scenes' in what appears to be a chronology of sorts. The problem is that there is absolutely no continuity or narrative thread. Nothing tying the characters or plot together (at least not in the approximately one-third of the book I slogged through). My other major objection is Mr. Turtledove's copious use of a particular racial epithet commonly called \\"the 'N' word.\\" I don't generally object to the use of such language if it advances plot or character development, but Mr. Turtledove sprinkles this word around with such abandon that I have to wonder if he has some underlying motive. This book might make the bestseller list in the Hillbilly Weekly Standard but I found it to be a pointless bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The U.S./German alliance has one WWI.

In the series so far, the South won the First and Second Wars Between the States, thanks to the interference of France and Great Britain. This drove the North into the arms of Imperial Germany. Together, and helped by the Red Negro revolt in the South, they beat the British/French/Confederate side in the World War.But nothing fails like success. The public is war weary and crying for reform, the conquered Canadians are restless, and the South is suffering the agonies of defeat. AMERICAN EMPIRE: BLOOD AND IRON traces the immediate aftermath of the war, as we see the Union tell itself there's nothing to worry about, and the Confederacy starts preparing for The Next War, and African Confederates caught between a rock and a hard place. What next? I can't wait to find out.

I was recently at the book show in Chicago and was stopped dead in my tracks by the photographs and the delightful captions in this book. The bears are cute beyond words, the captions are endearing, and the young photographer and writer is going to go places. He is destined for quite a career.

The one that bothered me most - and it would have been so easy for an alert editor to catch - was that apparently the heroine's father has a living brother. Anyone familiar with the British peerage would have known that this brother would definitely have the title and probably the ancestral manor as well. Lady Elizabeth would be entitled only to what was not entailed. What's so annoying is the reference to this uncle was totally gratuitous. It could easily have been her mother's brother, or her father's sister's husband, or the paragraph could have been omitted entirely.This is not an auspicious beginning to a series. I hope Kingsbury spends a little time getting to know her subject better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Best","review":"Engaging, erudite, comprehensive, precise.

Too many got caught up in the day trading frenzy of recent years. Siegel's book teaches us the patience of longer term investing and how that method can be used to reduce risk. Since we have been a bear market for some time now, risk reduction is an essential ingredient for today's successful investor. In conjunction with this book, I recommend another that demonstrates a different way to minimize market risk: THE SHORT BOOK ON OPTIONS demystifies options and shows the reader how to use them to make a portfolio safer and more profitable. Using Siegel's method of stock investment, coupled with using options makes for a safer method of investing safely. It works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"More trivia that advice","review":"Partly an investment advice book, but more filled with history and trivia about the stock market, plus many of the author's academic studies rewritten as book chapters and thrown in.

While I am less interested in this, I can understand why this would be a hot topic to many hunters. The person who co-authored this book, Tony Knight, is credited with starting this phenomenon in the 1980s.This is great introduction and I would highly recommend it for someone interested in the sport.

The Karcher pressure washer had more power at this price range even though the Sistema had a higher PSI rating.

I think that authors mistakengly assumed that they represent all professional men. We can only hope they were wrong! If they aren't, we must steer clear off all \\"professionals\\" for our own sake. There's no place for Love in the authors' world. I don't think authors will ever be satisfied by the woman whom they find using their own guidelines, a woman who can fit them or can sucessfully pretend that she can. The next step, after a few years, would be cheating with your wife's best friend, I'm afraid.. So, ladies: do you want to be enslaved to desires, needs and likes of a man who entirely doesn't care about you or cares if you're healthy and alive only as much as he'd care about his any other property, like a car? Do you want to serve HIS CAREER with YOUR LIFE? Buy this book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"The only insight provided by this book is that there are still old-school, chauvanstic males even in \\"Generation X\\" and they're disguising themselves as modern, professional men. What sane woman would want to marry a man that expects HER life to revolve around him, his needs, his interests, his career and his emotional well-being while requiring her to stifle her own thoughts, interests, etc. lest they conflict with his version of a \\"perfect wife\\"? If a woman \\"lands\\" such a husband by completely changing herself, then the marriage has no basis in common values or interests, etc. A recipe for divorce and a clear display of the arrogance and immaturity of the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Divorce Will Follow","review":"This is an example of 50's style male chauvinism of the worst sort. The drivel expressed here (i.e.,his career will always come first) is an insult to any adult woman or, for that matter, any adult man. These authors have written a childish fantasy. I can only hope that no one who is seriously contemplating marriage would bother reading this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like How to Get Mr. Wrong to Pop the Question","review":"Yeah, I don't recommend this book. I don't even think it's just noneffectual, I think it could be damaging and lead you getting involved with low-class men. The mentality here is not of the caliber of men I'm hoping you want for yourself.But, here are some books I do recommend very much, that I think can help you find a real Mr. Right: THE SURRENDERED SINGLE, GETTING TO COMMITMENT, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, WHY MEN MARRY SOME WOMEN AND NOT OTHERS. Also I recommend reading this book while in a relationship or marriage: RELATIONSHIP RESCUE. As you read these, one at a time, you will feel yourself steering along the right path. May good things happen for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare!","review":"You don't want to wind up with one of these guys! It's better to find yourself a drug dealer.. The book is a display of inhumanity and chauvinism. Authors insist of creating a little world where everything revolves around the Sun--his Professional Grace.

Try to write to prison penpals or something like that: you'll find more love from convicted killers then from these guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every single women should read this if you want to get married","review":"I read the earlier book about what every woman should know. I thought it was great, insightful, and my male paralegal said that the authors should be kicked for letting out so many male secrets. So, the first book was helpful, and after dating the same guy for over a year and me getting older I bought this one. I'm engaged now."},{"rating":"2","title":"How About After Getting Married?","review":"This book has given me some insights into how professional men think about courtship and marriage, etc. The three phases of a man's career sounds reasonable to me. Furthermore, I would like to read about their thoughts on keeping a marriage (not just the physical aspect) fresh and interesting and why professional men have affairs after they have married their wives. It would not hurt to investigate these issues even before one starts to date a professional man."},{"rating":"2","title":"in touch with my childhood","review":"I was so stoked to find this, it was a favorite movie of mine as a child and was wonderful to watch it again.

Then all of you can take good care of the hamster, learn more and more with each passing day, and have fun all the while without using a computer game 24/7!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Little Guide","review":"This book provides what seems to be a comprehensive guide to owning and caring for a hamster. It actually convinced me NOT to get another hamster after our first pet got fatally ill shortly after we bought her. Doing it right seems to be too much for me and my young children. Would be great for a teen or adult, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has Dina Meyer, what more could you want from a movie","review":"Bristling with sexual tension and corporate intrigue, Crimes of Passion is the story of what happens when two workers who are secret lovers team up in an attempt to score a huge sexual harassment settlement against their employer, a major corporation. When the detective assigned tot he case discovers their scheme and tries to blackmail them, the two are caught in a twisted web of deceit and betrayal. (from the back cover)This movie has decent acting and a pretty good plot. You know almost immediately that the main character, who thinks he is running he show, is being double-crossed. What you don't know is who or how many people are setting him up for the fall. I must say the kind of surprise ending is very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"Wow, I just read Ms. Gavin's book as part of my research for a novel set during World War I.

They would work if a lamp was plugged into the control spot, but not when the computer was plugged into the control spot, even when the sensitivity setting was adjusted as far as it could go. Their website simply stated that if this was the case, something else should be plugged into the control spot; but the whole point of purchasing them was so that when we turned off our computers, the peripherals would go off as well. I returned all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it - but IT - IS - JUNK","review":"I needed this thing to work. I really did. But no matter what kind of micro-adjustment I make to the sensitivity, it either does not power things up, or does not power things down. The 'master' is a run of the mill Dell desktop - and the product documentation specifies that this works with computers. I may understand if I plugged in an alarm clock or something as the master, but no - was playing by the book and got burned. The thing is no more useful than a regular power strip.

It works as advertised for me--none of the problems experienced by other reviewers. It reliably shuts down all power to selected items plugged into it when the main item is turned off. In my case, it shuts down my speakers, external hard drives, printer, etc when my computer is off, but leaves on my DSL modem and wireless router for my wife to use. It works for me as advertised--I shut down my PC and all of my external peripherals (monitor, hard drives) power down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life, too sensitive","review":"Smart Strip SCG4 failed after a short while. When it switched on it would just buzz. Also, before it failed it was nearly impossible to set the adjustment so that it would switch on and off when I turned on/off the laptop connected to the control outlet.

But it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing if you practice it","review":"The book's cover and first few chapters could give a person the wrong idea, but go ahead, buy this book, and read it through to the end. In my opinion, any book that amplifies biblical principles is well worth the time and money and this one excels at that. Dr. Welch masterfully builds his case throughout each chapter resulting in a solid case for revering Almighty God and Him alone. The previous reviews below detail this out for you. If you already practice 'the fear of the Lord', you can pass on this book; otherwise, buy one, read it and begin benefiting from all God has for you! You will begin to see the reoccurring theme of the 'Fear of the Lord' in almost every book in the Bible and the promises to those that do fear or respect God *above all else*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I read this book over the course of a year with two friends. The three of us have very different personalities and are in different life stages. It was incredibly helpful to read it slowly and let this paradigm shift sink in: We need to need people less and love people more.After reading it I feel equipped to take on life's challenges (disappointment, loss, anxiety, etc)with a healthy perspective - one where following and pleasing God is more important than following and pleasing man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convincing and Convicting","review":"Is your heart an empty love cup or an idol factory? Modern psychology (Christian or not) would often point to our hearts as voids waiting to be filled. Welch, echoing Calvin, points in a different, more biblical direction. Welch points out that the Bible has little to nothing to say about the \\"love cup\\" idea, directing instead to love God and others. The central premise of the book is that as we grow in fear of the Lord we learn to fear others less and this leads us to love them more. The practical outworking of these principles is a process of knowing God and considering our ways in light of His Word. The second half of the book illustrates these ideas in a detailed and personal way, helping us see how they would play out in a person's life. Welch has written a book which is thoroughly biblical and directs us to a better way of living than the tired promises of self-esteem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Diagnosis to the \\"Fear of man.\\"","review":"Mr. Welch is a physician of the soul. Right from the start he says, \\"The most radical treatment for the fear of man is the fear of the Lord.\\" Further he states, \\"Regarding other people, our problem is that we need them (for ourselves) more than we love them (for the glory of God). The task God sets for us is to need them less and love them more. Instead of looking for ways to manipulate others, we will ask God what our duty is toward them.\\" I think he really gets to the heart of what the problem is with this statement: \\"The fear of man is the sinful exaggerations of a normal experience.\\" If you take away nothing more than that statement, and apply it to your life, you will be blessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concepts about Fear of Man","review":"A good friend recommended this book to address our fear of man instead of our holy fear of God. After a slew of complaining parents at school and an ever-tightening knot in my stomach, I decided that I wanted to read it. As it addresses the topic of fear, I think there was much to glean. However, it was a bit too counsel-ly for me. Some aspects reminded me of the books I had to read in a counseling class in college, and that's not a good thing.Welch offers important reminders that as Christians, we must not give in to becoming people pleasers, a temptation that I lean toward.

I am unable to do so because the book for me came across as a theological textbook. Although the theology is accurate I felt it was misplaced and the writing lacked relational intelligence. I thought the author dealt with very sensitive issues with an abrupt and unfeeling manner. I think this book could be good for seminary students but not really for women struggling with victimization.

Her insight cuts through the usual psycho-babble and gets right to what matters most to us as human beings. This book gives us the boost we need to go out there and do what matters most to us. No more trying to meet the expectations of others first. She has really made me think and evaluate my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctrinaire rubbish","review":"Don't fall for this. The authors are conservative propagandists who engage in the kind of fake scholarship that the American Enterprise Institute and its ilk specializes in. Remember when you were first learning to write a term paper and the teacher said \\"don't make the facts fit your argument; your argument has to rest on the facts\\"? Well the authors were busy running for class president and missed that little lesson. In their world, there is no reason to worry about discrimination laws, or social security, or poverty relief because no-one is ever destitute, excluded or unable to get decent work. Anyone with a passing acquaintance with reality can recognise this for the class warfare that it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product I have ever used","review":"Nilodor is the worst smelling product I have ever used. I have 6 dogs and trust me we have accidents. I read the reviews about the odor but had no idea that it would take weeks for the nilodor odor to leave. It was almost better to leave the doggie odor than to use Nilodor. Even with the doors and windows open the odor was still there and would hit you as you walk in the door.

This book says that your salvation is in your hands. If you don't walk a certain way or think a certain way then you are doomed. I am not able to be perfect so therefore according to this book and Arminianism I am eternally damned. The thing is, it makes so much more sense than the other viewpoint, of eternal security. The Bible is like a two faced friend. In the end it is not your friend, when your soul and life is on the line, it will turn and slash you to death. In the end, we're all going to hell. This book just helps you realize the fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, time","review":"This book is terrible. The editors and writers haven't even mastered fifth grade selling and grammar. The book spells Ronald Reagan's name incorrectly, the book uses \\"Capitol\\" when the word should be \\"Capital\\" and the book mistakes \\"insure\\" for \\"ensure,\\" among other errors. Many of the graphics are unreadable and are very unhelpful. Why are they even in the book? To fill space? The book includes basic information on how to obtain a passport, information which easily is available from any passport office or any county clerk's office, for that matter. The book wastes space with lists of numbers for airlines, numbers which are available in the phone book, on the Internet or from any travel agent.

I'm so glad that I didn't buy this version, as it is painful to watch. I guess some companies/artistic directors want to make a statement, but I don't know why they feel the need to film it. There comes a point when no matter how good the voices are, they can't overcome the distractions of a poorly conceived production. It would be nice to see a full scale opulent production of this opera, as the story and time period lend themselves to that. So far, the Renee Fleming version comes closest to what opera purists may desire, but even that production has it's issues.

It doesn't go 200 yards like the bag says, but it will go on average about 150 to 300 feet fully pulled back at a 60 degree angle. But I do enjoy playing with it with younger kids as they love how far the balloon goes and it makes the \\"splat\\" on impact.A few points I suggest you read over...- DO NOT make water balloons bigger than about the size of a tennis ball. When you pull the sling back with the balloon in it, it will explode.- Don't pull the sling back more than 6 feet from where your two helpers are at.- The grips are held in place by the tubing being bent inside the middle of the grip. Eventually they will pop out and the grip will be free moving. It doesn't affect the performance, but it is annoying.All in all, this isnt a bad sling. I'd recommend it. Hope this helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"\\"We used the sling shot two times before the rubber straps snapped off.

In Frost's conservative tone, he still achieves a degree of radicalism, as the road not taken on a frosty winter morning, while being Thoreau-ish, and as warm and philosophical as a bowl of Campbell's soup, is also often filled with striking psychological ghosts and tragic human consequences, both the good and the evil of the human heart. \\"The Witch of Coos\\", stands out as a poem extravaganza, offering unsettling spookery, profound humanism and amusing folk story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nambib Desert","review":"This was an excellent video.

Queen did it, Zepplin did it...welcome to reality folks!).Don't get me wrong, the Darkness has talent and they use it well (I have seen them live and they sounded great).

Also, the songs are just weak! There are only 4 decent tracks here:One Way TicketBaldHazel EyesIs It Just MeDo yourself a favor and download these songs for 99 cents each and just skip the rest of the album. It's just too dull and the guitarwork is kinda repetitive.Oh, and Hawkins bad vocals show the worst on the ballads.ouck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Throwback to Rock Glory","review":"With the driving guitar riffs and screeching vocals, The Darkness represents a throwback to the glory days of bands such as AC-DC and Van Halen. This is excellent music to drive fast to, or to work out to. I discovered after being pulled in by their one big recent hit \\"I Believe in a Thing Called Love\\" from their album \\"Permission to Land\\". After hearing the tracks on this album, I realized I had stumbled on a hidden gem of a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vast improvement over Permission to Land","review":"I was skeptical about this CD at first as I had listened to The Darkness' first album, Permission to Land, and didn't care for it at all. With this album, however, The Darkness has grown on me and I highly recommend it -- especially to fans of Queen. At times I get the feeling they're actually channeling Queen through their harmonies, Dan Hawkins' guitar, and Justin Hawkins' falsetto. You'll either love the falsetto or hate it, but you'll have to admit the guy's got talent! My favorite track is 'Hazel Eyes,' which has a sort of Celtic-gone-wild feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit dissapointing.","review":"I thought all of the songs on Permission to Land were excellent, and I thought the songs on One Way Ticket are just \\"OK.\\" Be sure to read the lyrics while listen to the song, as otherwise you will probably have no clue what Justin is singing about. My favorite track is most definately \\"Hazel Eyes.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sophmore Slump Here!!","review":"How do you follow up a fantastic Debut album?

A testament to all that is guitar driven RAWK. OWTTHAB on the other hand is a different story. Who the hell produced this album? They should be shot. All the edge of the previous album has been replaced with a bunch of overproduced crap. Dan and Justin are way too good of guitar players to have wasted their talent on a crap album like this. I hope this album grows on me, because it is SEVERELY dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The train derailed....","review":"I loved Permission To Land and The Darkness' live show I attended was fantastic so I expected something great the second time around. Instead what I found was a weak effort watered down with significant overproduction and lame melodies. Where are the great hooks and hard-driving beat that defined the first album? If Permission To Land reminded me of AC/DC then One Way Ticket is a sad Whitesnake imitation. Painful...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onr way ticket to the trash can","review":"Listening to this makes me wanna pull out my classic AC/DC albums with Bon Scott of the 70's, cause I know they sound similar and are better. This band is so unoriginal its surprising how popular they are cause to me they are just another crap 70's rock rip-off band."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a dud","review":"Entertainment Weekly was right on with their grade of \\"D+\\" for this CD. I bought it because I liked the previous Darkness release, but this one veers strongly into silly hard rock that is at best annoying and at worst completely lacking in any entertainment value whatsoever. There were moments on this CD where I heard traces of Boston, the \\"lite metal\\" of Scorpions or Def Lep, and most of all a whole lot of Queen. Unfortunately they've captured only the SOUND of those bands without any of the sparkle or melodic skill that made them special. I'm pretty amazed that there are people giving this album 5 STARS. (!!!????) It just goes to show, there's no accounting for taste (or a complete absence of it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Way Ticket to Hell... And No Return","review":"Allright! This album has divided people in two groups. Some critics hates this really and think the whole band is joke. Other critics and listeners praise the Darkness like a new saviour of rock n' roll. One magazine chose this the best album of 2005. Unbelieveable and very true!Ok. In my opinion, they made a good music video for One Way Ticket which is rather good song. Unfortunately, after that song there comes 5 really boring, headless and cliche rock songsBald is the best and moving song in this album. The rockers really are afraid of 100 times more to come bald than hell or monsters. Girlfriend, English Country Garden and Blind Man are terrific songs and real pleasure for you who can't hear anything.This record will sell millions because there are enough people who still believe the return of the real classic rock...Finally, there is no return from Hell if you once go there."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great to be a teenager again, again","review":"I'm 35. I spent years 10-thru-20 growing up in the 80s. When The Darkness' released \\"Permission To Land\\" in 2003, I listened to it over and over again, at 33 remembering how fun music used to be when I was 13. Now, on the day of their new release \\"One Way Ticket To Hell\\", I'm doing it all over again. I see no reason for issuing my critical opinion on each of the 10 tracks here. Would you really care anyway? After all, anyone reading this either loves The Darkness already, or denies that they do while secretely worshipping them. \\"One Way Ticket\\" is a lot like a concept album in that it's consistently fun to listen to. The concept is \\"fun\\". So buy it and have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a couple spins","review":"At first I thought this was a little weak, but after giving it a few listens, turns out this is a really good rock album. Not sure yet if it'll grow on me enough to say it's better than the first one, but it's definitely catchy, well produced, and more mature than I'd expected. The sarcasm and wit are still there, although not so in-your-face, but anyone who really likes fun hard rock should check it out. The album's artwork is brilliant as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the best songs on this album were reflective on the rest of the tracks, this would be a classic album.","review":"I'm too tired at this point to finish this.Listen to Hazel Eyes, Dinner Lady Arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"IDIOTS WHO POST","review":"If you dont like the Darkness, then why are u posting, u dumbass. OH AND THE ALBUM ROCKS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have broken up after Permission to Land","review":"I read somewhere that The Darkness almost broke up after the success of their first CD. They should have if this is their idea of a follow-up. Where did the fun and great riffs of Permission to Land go? These songs are awful. They wander round and round and never go anywhere. Instead of the silly lyrics of the first CD, sometimes here they try to sound serious and end up sounding ridiculous. The music is trying hard to be Queen but that's a unique style and hard to pull off. The Darkness come away sounding as if they have no idea how to write a song. They should have stuck to the straight ahead approach they employed for Permission to Land. This was one of the worst music purchases I ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Huge dissapointment after their great last album.","review":"This album was one the biggest dissapointment of 2005 for me. Their first album, \\"Permission To Land\\", was simply awesome. Creative, innovative, good guitar work, and fun. This one is soft, over-produced, not interesting and very boring. I can't believe this is even the same band.

But this book shows the long forgotten tribulations and controversies that got us to today's known state.This text is rather specialised. You need to be thoroughly conversant with electromagnetism. On a par with Jackson's text, \\"Classical Electrodynamics\\". But presumably you also have an interest in the history of your field. Darrigol shows that the path was often obscure. Only in full hindsight, after Maxwell and also Einstein made their contributions, did it all come clear.The scarcity of vector notation in the 19th century accounts can make reading some of the equations a little awkward.

When it comes to diet there are certain foods one should avoid such as diet soda or artificial ANYTHING. He really didn't go along with these ideals and basically focused upon calories and not so much the nutritional aspects of food. But overall he would be a good transition from a strictly junk food diet to something a little more healthy.

The writer's comments are as boring as the websites he lists; either his sarcasm doesn't translate without emoticons, or he simply isn't a very good writer. This book would have worked much better as just a website itself. I may have bookmarked the website, but I definitely wouldn't pay for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for internet newbies","review":"My mother bought this book, and I thought that it was a bad idea to purchase it, because websites (especially the more useless ones) are ephemeral. However, most of the sites are still online as of November 2004. I have been using the internet for many years, and a large number of these sites were ones I was already aware of. My mother, though, is sort of a newbie, and she really enjoyed visiting these sites; she has gotten some great laughs out of them.

The pacing is difficult and therefore there is no rhythm. The author chooses to insert rhyme with no \\"rhyme or reason\\", and uses ridiculous font changes, bold facing, sizing, wavy characters etc. with no purpose.

Originally a stage production, it is no doubt a fiendishly difficult piece to perform. As such, some scenes and dialogue are not entirely convincing. However, it is done extraordinarily well too in places and that makes it worth getting. Leonard Fry's performance as the birthday boy is truly superb for the precision with which he (and not without provocation), dispenses his character's venom and drives the knives in. He is ironically very likeable for it because in doing so he stoically confronts the ghosts in his own character and those which his guests will not face in theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strike Up The Band","review":"Here it is guys!

The thought of a movie examining the homosexual psyche in '70 was absolutely unheard of. The American public had enough of a problem just contemplating the thought of a gay lifestyle, let alone deal with a storyline that not only examined the prejudice found in the public-at-large but presented the viewer with a glimpse of the homosexual that showed us that at the end of the day they really aren't much different than we are. This is honest, thought provoking cinema at its best.

It's the perfect game to pick up and play when I'm bored or need to kill a little time without being \\"sucked in.\\" It is quite addicting, but not so much that I want to sit down and play it all afternoon. The only thing I don't like about it is that the game hasn't been updated from the NES version AT ALL. So all of the original flaws (can't play against a computer, getting capsules of colors you already killed off) are still there. Otherwise it's a great game! I might have to get my brother a copy so we can play together..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks the same, plays worse.","review":"There were only a couple NES games I ended up playing after new consoles kept coming out. Dr. Mario was one of them. This game doesn't live up to the original. It pretty much looks the same, and it sounds the same, but here are the problems that keep me from playing it: The game isn't smooth like the original. Remember those tricky situations where you would have to slide a pill under other pills while flipping it? Forget it. Holding left and right is slower than the original, and flipping is slower as well. Finally, a minor problem is that when you hold down a pill to make it fall faster, the yellow turns into red as it falls. The pills are too small. They should make a Dr. Mario for DS with the double screens..Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Mario!","review":"I loved playing this game when I was a kid, so when i found a version I could play on my DS Lite, I scooped it up!

If your like puzzle games, you'll like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tiny to see","review":"I loved the original Dr. Mario, so when I got a GameBoy version I was excited. It's very Tetris-like, except for making complete rows, you are matching up 4 like colors of pill halves to the same color virus until they have all been matched and eliminated. Unfortunately, the \\"pills\\" are so tiny that it is difficult to enjoy this process. My vision is fine, yet I find myself squinting at the screen trying to make out the different colors in order to decide where to drop them. This was a good idea, but it doesn't work on such a small scale. However, if trying to make out minute details doesn't bother you, then you will probably enjoy this classic - especially if you love Tetris and are burned out on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and addicting","review":"This game is nothing but the same thing over and over but increasingly harder.

So it is with great sadness that I have to steer people away from this Music Video. It is so BORING! There are so many awesome sights to see in Scotland, and so much of the footage in this video was of water and dark clouds. Much of the castles were shot from very far away, and at times there were things you would have wanted to get a better or longer look at, and they just skipped on by. Then at other times when you wished they would move along, they lingered on and on. And how could anyone substantiate showing Scottish scenery while playing Classical and Opera music!

As soon as I put one into the pocket of my shirt and put a pen and a pen light in it, the outside flap began to curl up - this wouldn't have happened back in the day and is unacceptable today.

Therefore, after reading this gobbler I could hardly believe they were written by the same person. The character development is virtually nonexistent, the dialogue-really, the writing style in general- is clanky, and the plot seems to be little more than a frame for sex scenes. The ending also comes across as rather too convenient.

In short, pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par...","review":"I have read a good many of this author's works, and while there is certainly some good narrative here, the book seems to loose focus somewhere in the middle and never quite gain it back.

It's stories like this, and others in the media that stir up negative and fearful emotions towards the peaceful, nature loving witch's of today.However, fiction being what it is, even as a story, this book is just horrible. There is aweful character development, and immediately you are thrown into a highly sexual situation without even really understanding how you got there.If you like hot and sweaty sex with no real story behind it, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a good story, run screaming away from this book.

It does charge the unit very well if you have the DVR which comes with the AC adaptor. I have had no success with recording directly from a regular TV, how many hotel rooms have a VCR or DVD player? It looks like the travel adaptor has to be jacked into a player with a video out. I have been able to record off a plasma screen TV only because it does have a video out. It is useless for play back on the TV. and in truth you do not NEED the travel adaptor to play back. If you want to play back just get the replacement cable/jack, jack into the head phone out on the 404, jack into the the video and audio in on your TV/VCR... hit the LCD/TV button on the side of the 404 and watch your video. All and all I think this is a waste of money, the DVR station does work and is pretty small, comes with the AC adaptor, cables and works as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing work from a usually fine novelist","review":"Agustin Cabán, music critic for a San Juan newspaper, has just retired, and is writing his memoirs and sharing them with his editor.

The miniatures are now made out of plastic instead of tin, but are otherwise very well-crafted. Gaming materials seem solid and durable. The only minus is the packaging: there are no containers for the many loose parts in the box. But of course you can easily provide for those yourself.The original -out of print- edition is said to have better materials, but lacks some of the improvements made here (more courses, model courses in the rulebook, character sheets for the robots to help organize play, ...) and is somewhat of a collector's item, making it an expensive second-hand item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good strategy game","review":"Bought this game for my husband for his birthday.

So I was surprised how much I did like it! It's fast moving and takes some strategy and spacial thinking. I think up to 8 can play, but that doesn't make it slow (waiting forever until it's your turn again). We have one person move all the players according to their cards rather than each player move himself. It goes faster that way. It's basically trying to make your robot (game piece) get to sertain places on the board without getting lasered too many times. There are conveyer belts that move you and things that spin you, so you have to take that into account. Very fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT game - great secretive teaching tool!","review":"Our family loves this game so much.

Basically, I think this book was very uninteresting to read and I would not recommend it to others. At any point in a college degree, I think 90% of the information Mr. Castells provides is elementary. Most students know a lot of this information coming into college, much less this late in our college career. There were only a select number of things that I did not know previously, none of which will be beneficial to my degree or career.

In the beginning of the book Dr. Castell did a good job of describing the internet and where it came from. He also told the difference between hackers and crackers and other computer terms. He did contradict himself it seemed later in the book by talking about hackers and crackers. Toward the end of the book it became repetitive as well as common sense information. It seemed that Dr. Castell ran out of items to say so needed to talk about something to fill the pages. Overall, I feel this book was not a good learning tool for the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Internet Galaxy","review":"After reading The Internet Galaxy by Manuel Castells, I can honestly say that I have not learned as much as I would have hoped. Castells does a great job of outlining how the Internet came to be. In addition, he makes controversial statements that have the ability to facilitate discussions/debates. However, there is a lot of unnecessary information in the book. He gives many statistics and thoughts that are pretty much common sense for anyone with any computer savvy. Finally, he fails to discuss the issue of technology in education, which is a very important issue to many in this class. Overall, I think it would be a good book to read for someone who did not have any previous knowledge of what the Internet entailed. However, for those readers with any Internet experience, it is hard to get through all of the useless statistics to get to the heart of Internet issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book for someone with little knowledge of technology","review":"I read this book for a graduate class and was very displeased.

I would recommend this book to a high school technology class or maybe a basic college course in technology, but definitely not for graduate studies. Castells is very knowledgeable but can become very cumbersome in his writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Internet Galaxy","review":"Much of what Manuel Castells addressed in his book, The Internet Galaxy, represents a new breakthrough idea that the Internet plays an important role in our society. Basically, this should be a technology issue that most readers are familiar with, but he can use his knowledge including with his incredible talent to generate the linkage between the technological basis and social, philosophical perspective. There is a lot of useful information combined together in each chapter through this book.

He is troubled and sometimes the scenes of him trying to discover comfort in the world read as hilarious, but often as not they made me want to snooze. However, I still want to learn More about this family, so the author did almost everything else right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Going, Not At All Like \\"The Children's Book\\"","review":"Having enjoyed my first A. S. Byatt book (\\"The Children's Book\\"), purchased this and its 2 sequels hoping to reprise the experience. Started with the first of the trilogy, \\"The Virgin in the Garden\\" and found it extremely tough to read. The edition I got has print that seems to get ever smaller as the paragraphs got longer, and while well-written and terribly erudite (as one would expect from the author), it's a tough, tough read. It's slow, things don't really connect, and I hate to say, I finally gave up after about 100 pages. Maybe this means I am just too ignorant and too common to appreciate her writing but it was disappointing. I flipped through the 2 sequels which only seemed to get weirder so donated all three to my laundry room library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"She obviously knows how to write. However, I didn't like or identify, or find interesting any of the characters. In addition she is very good at spouting out allusions, but most of them hindered the plot development instead of helping it.After reading this I did not read the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have no idea what \\"Virgin\\" is all about,","review":"except to sell books. I cannot identify with any of the characters. Incredibly outlandish (another reviewer said \\"unpredictable\\" -- a real understatement). I picked the book up a discount retailer after thumbing through it. Set in Yorkshire, England, 1952/1953, it provided me memories of Robin's Hood Bay (the hike); the names of all the plants (interestingly, gorse was never mentioned -- did I miss that one?); and the petit point hassocks for the pews at St Bartholomew's. Hmmmm.At the time Virginia Woolf's \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" was published, a critic said it would not be read in 50 years. I can't imagine \\"The Virgin in the Garden\\" being read 50 years from now, but with sequels, etc., it appears the author is hoping for lucrative movie deals, ala Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"brutal going","review":"there's no music, as it were, in what a.s. byatt does: i have read three of her novels now and i'm, i think, in a pretty good position to judge her stuff as utterly pretentious and banal. read just one page of hers and compare it to a paragraph (a single sentence?!) of James Joyce. i am an english prof--hence all the lit allusions in this novel just kinda made me sick. she drops so many names/quotations you need an imaginary broom to sweep them away. dreadful dreck. you need something Englishy to read--investigate William Boyd or Julian Barnes. byatt is like a parody of good writing. only salman rushdie's fiction is more onanistic (though his criticism's pretty cool). byatt is the literary equivalent of Stevie Nicks! Icky!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soap!","review":"A coworker of mine got me started on this soap. Was looking for something that made me feel clean but didn't dry out my skin or make it feel greasy. This stuff is awesome. I've used it for a few years now and it's one of the only soaps that works for me. Also got rid of shaving gel as this works great. (I've tried the \\"Welenda\\" (sp?) calendula soap and I find that bar way too fragrant.) Even my other half likes the Pre De Prov bar. Highly recommend giving it a whirl.Why not 5 stars?

This book explores the important inovations and contributions LDS theology makes to the larger framework of Christian theology. The book is a bit technical for those with no background in philosophy or theology, but perfect for the student of these subjects who wants to understand LDS philosophical perspectives. Included is an excellent appendix on the LDS concept of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and concise overview of essential Mormon theology","review":"Do not think of this as an A-Z explanation of Mormon dogma, but rather an analysis of essential Mormon beliefs about the nature of deity and how they fit within the context of traditional Christian philosophy. Dr. McMurrin covers many historical dilemmas in theology, such as the extent of God's power, original sin and the problem of evil, specifically addressing how Mormonism's unique synthesis of heresy and orthodoxy equip it to respond well to these challenges. He also addresses the level of awareness within Mormonism of these concepts, and how neo-orthodox movements in Mormonism have caused some to unwittingly distance themselves from its most beneficial doctrines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very (maybe overly) sophisticated analysis","review":"Readers of this book should be familiar with sophisticated philosophic language and concepts.

He talks more about advertising than Mastery. One good statistic he uses is his conversion rate. Other than that, if you are not a DP, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A $30 advertisement, folks, that's it","review":"I'm an experienced Internet sales director and I have to agree with the other reviewer that this book is nothing more than a thinly-veiled ad for Mr. Coleman's services. There were only a few useful nuggets of information dispersed throughout a 300-page diatribe of how effective his far-eastern, pschographic (?) principles of persuasion are. He even spends considerable time getting you ready for the explosion of business you will recieve once applying these principles to your department. Right. Very little, if any, actual instruction accompanies his psychobabble in this awkwardly organized book--I guess that's what we need to pay him for. Honestly, it's somewhat insulting. Save your money. BTW - one of these reviews HAD to be written by (or inspired by) the author himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infomercial form of a book","review":"If you think Ron @ Ronco adds to the quality of TV viewing, then you'll think Coleman is a literary genius. Otherwise, stay clear and find some actual sales experts. Eddie Coleman is all hype - his company name is Hyperdrive, maybe that's why. Once the hype wears off, there is no substance. I know, I've met him a few times within auto industry circles. If you don't already know (either instinctively or from even very limited experience) the basic information put forth in this poorly written book, then you should possibly consider not even being in sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Think This Guy Has Ever Sold Cars","review":"I've worked Internet car sales for a few years and I've always made a living, even during the Recession. A good book is short and to the point. This isn't it. Not enough of the meat I need to close deals and work with the guy who wants to buy a car below invoice.

My students really enjoyed the book. They loved hearing how the pig and cow worked on changing their sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly but sweet","review":"My 2-year-old daughter now insists on this book every night at bedtime, and that is a rare occurrence for her. We first checked it out from the library, and after having to renew it twice, broke down and got our own copy. She loves to hear all the silly animal sounds, and I think that's the main hook for her, but the pictures are vivid and fun, too. It's also a fun read-aloud book, which is great when you're the parent who gets to read it over and over and over... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cow and The Pig Who Went Quackers","review":"In \\"The Cow That Went Oink\\", one cow could not moo. He said \\"Oink.\\" One pig could not oink. He said \\"Moo.\\" All of the other animals laugh at the cow and the pig. The cow teaches the pig to oink and the pig teaches the cow to moo.I suppose that I am in the minority because I did not like this story at all. Perhaps if this book focused more on the teasing that the two animals received, I would have been inclined to give a better rating.I did not see a reason why children would care what either of the animals sounded like. Most two years olds (the group that I work with) are just beginning to associate the animals to the sounds that they make. This book would only seek to confuse youngsters who are beginning to develop their own language skills.The text is simple enough so that it could only be suitable for young children of this age group. Perhaps three's and four's can appreciate the symbolism of this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Must Have!","review":"From a parent and kindergarten teacher's perspective, this is a fantastic book. It is one of our family's favorites. We laugh throughout the book each time we read it. Bernard Most's simple and clever use of language and illustrations makes it a classic to read over and over.

In each chapter Bode tells a tale from his youth about sailing his small blue sloop off of Long Island. He weaves in some of the life-lessons he's learned from reflecting on those experiences without being too sappy about it. Bode is also able to convey some of the intangible reasons why sailors love sailing, reasons that are sometimes hard to articulate. Overall, this book is a quick, light, inspirational read. It's a perfect gift for any pensive sailors in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read...","review":"High praise for First You Have to Row a Little Boat! Although I am only 15, this book has touched me in many ways. I've been sailing as long as I can remember and the book was given to me as a gift by my sailing coach of many years. It is her favorite book and after reading it quickly became mine as well. The lessons are simple and true, it takes but a second to read and a lifetime to muster over. Richard Bode has created a nothing short of a masterpiece. Even for someone with little or none sailing experience, the lessons are universal and I'm sure you will find a deep connection to a much loved pastime. I find new things to marvel over everytime I read it, truly a book that won't collect dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"First You Have to Row a Little Boat","review":"The book arrived within a week of ordering it, in excellent condition. It's the second copy I've purchased - so many pearls of wisdom within its covers - and it appeared to be brand new, despite being touted as used.

Starnes depicts the fall from grace of a wayward Baptist minister and the regaining of peace and direction of a disgruntled, if not depressed, deejay after they meet on a Greyhound bus destined for Las Vegas. Only someone like Starnes--who was born, raised, educated, and who has experienced the inner sanctum of Southern culture-- can produce a work of this poignancy and insight into the vicissitudes of Southern culture.

Both of these statements do not apply to Nerds 2.01. The author acknowledges his lack of technical knowledge early on and it hurts his ability to convey this story.

This disc casts a wide net, gathering Berrigan's highlight performances with early editions of the Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller and Dorsey Brothers bands, as well as in smaller combos along with jazzmen such as Bud Freeman and Cozy Cole. These tracks share in common a penchant for the neo-Dixieland trad-jazz style that this generation of early '30s swingsters often reveled in... It's fun, spirited material -- they obviously had a gas playing this sort of music -- but since the performances are almost all instrumental, other than an opening tune featuring Connee Boswell on \\"Me Minus You,\\" we miss out on Berrigan's unique skill at accompanying singers, which I think was one of his greatest strengths. A swell set, but his later work as a bandleader is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Taro Hakase","review":"I bought this CD some time ago as I am a fan of Taro Hakase, who is absolutely fabulous, and I ended up throwing it away.

I gained nothing from this film. I already have lots of compassion for the suffering of others. I already know enough about the Holocaust. I already have seen enough kids die, working in medicine. I've seen enough pain, angst, suffering... I like to be entertained by films or moved by films... but not horrified and depressed by films. And this film is depressing.

We need more beauty, less garbage. A truly wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Overlooked Masterpiece of Cinema","review":"This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. For me, this was not only an exceptional film involving the Holocaust and World War II, but an incredibly moving and emotional tale of a friendship that developed that knew no prejudice or intolerance. Those involved in the the creation and operation of concentration camps often had housing for themselves and their family close by. How haunting to have your family living in close proximity to where so much torture and death was being carried out. Karma can be cruel and this is played out in a chilling fashion. I do NOT want to include any information that could serve as a spoiler, so I ask you trust that the film will not disappoint.

I enjoyed reading it. I have always been interested in stories regarding the Holocaust and I think it is important to keep our youth educated on the topic. I do not want to spoil any part of the book, but I became frustrated with the main character Bruno towards the end of the book because of his \\"stupidity\\" I would call it.

And guess what?- I sobbed like a baby in front of all my friends.Although the last parts of the movie are very sad and deeply patronizing, it is overall a very good adaption of the book that caused so much controversy among young readers like me(I'm 15 by the way)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boy in the striped Pajamas","review":"Absolutely a must see.

It portrays the innocence of humanity and the evil that existed during the Holocaust.

It's not without its flaws, but it does show many sides of this tragic historic time. A German boy and his family move to a new home during WW II. His father is assumed to be a high ranking soldier at Auschwitz. The story centers on the boy and how his parents try to keep the horror of reality of what is going on there from him. He slowly discovers the ugly truth a little too late!While the story is engrossing, I felt there was something missing in this heartbreaking film. I would have liked to have seen more detail and contrast between the father's point of view and his families'.This is not to say this is not worth your time, but it does fall short in some areas.

I could not hold back the tears for both boys in this movie! These two children actors were GREAT and should have won an award.

Either of my suggested titles would have been more appropriate.Sophie's List is Beautiful: Overall the movie is sentinmental contrivance that looked like it was put together by amateurs doing their best to combine Sophie's Choice and Life is Beautiful with a little bit of Schindler's List and The Tin Drum thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately for them, the end product is an utter failure. It's difficult to watch without laughing.Curiousity Killed Little Adolf: The most/only intriguing thing in this waste of celluloid is the boy in the lead. He looks amazingly like a juvenile Hitler. So when he gets what gets in the end, it is somewhat uplifting.The Holocaust was an outrage, the ugliest example of what man in his broken state is capable of.

After being shocked by the ending, in my opinion, there is no way any child younger than high school needs to learn about history through \\"wishful payback emotional manipulation\\" of this tawdry kind. I just about threw up at the end because I related to the mother's reaction in such a personal way - she was a fabulous actress even if the story line made her seem inconsistent - I naively had no idea where it was leading till late into the movie and kept watching because I couldn't believe it would end there.But yep -that's exactly what happened. Even the friendship between the little boys (Aryan and Jew) I feel was sullied by this twisted ending which was not a voluntary act of love and friendship on either child's part.

No doubt laughing his way to the bank on his stupid road of life. And then he has the GAUL to narrate the remainder of the book with theoretical Madonna \\"thoughts\\"....as if this guy even has a clue what goes on in her head.

Most of this book comes off like a \\"docu-drama\\" (for example, how could the author possibly know what Madonna is thinking as she stares at her newest wrinkles in the mirror?) Also, the author's characterization of Madonna's 80's fling, Prince, sounds like he watched \\"Purple Rain\\" (a 17-yr-old movie) a few times to be able to describe him. In other words, there's little more than generalizations, hearsay, & gossip presented as an actual biography.

Despite massive attempts by GemPlus and other 'leaders' described in this book, the entire thing has been just one more marketing-driven attempt to force unneeded technology on the masses.

This was a wonderful production and Ben Cross did a great job in it. The only issue I had is that the writers did not need to take some of the liberties they did with it. Was Solomon a womanizer? Yes--look at the many wives he had...Did he marry the Queen of Sheba--Hell no! He didn't have children with her either. Had they stuck to the plot of people trying to keep him off of the throne and NOT added a false storyline, this picture may have sold far more tickets. Look at \\"The Passion\\". Gibson did stick to that storyline for better or worse--with the exception of the evil looking spectre creature following the procession to the cross.However if you are a Ben Cross fan, this is simply worth the purchase for his performance in it.

Maybe one of their mid range better albums. Definitely worth owning, particularly say if you like the band. You won't be disappointed (well, except for the Gloria song I'd say. Oh, what could have been.)There's no band like HALF JAPANESE. Each of their albums is worth owning (ok, except the latest, Hello). They all have at least several great songs. This one sure does.

The former is your average club mix with an irritating effect applied to the lead vocals throughout. The latter is an interesting interpretation but undanceable, which defeats the purpose of the song. The other \\"Blood...\\" mixes are your standard club fare.

Blood On The Dance Floor is the perfect song for remixes, and all of the remixes are very well done. The TM's Switchblade Edit and Mix are the best two on the album, but I still enjoy the others. The original version of Blood On The Dance Floor is ok, but is not outstanding. The remix of Dangerous is, to put it simply, horrible. Get this album if you like fun remixes, but if you are a big Michael Jackson fan, this may not be the song for you because it's different from most of his other work. It's more harsh and aggressive.

The subject of the film had an intuition (as a male teenager, no less) he thankfully followed and which would become the course of his life.

I'd like to watch it with my family, but there is a part where the guy is talking about how he felt like a rock star, and that he had groupies, and they show a sex scene, which is just stupid and unnecessary, and only detracts from the rest of the film, which is very classy.

Well, I had to see it, and I was not disappointed. I am buying Petit's book, as well. The entire feat, start to finish, just blows my mind, especially the dedication and participation of these other people in his life. They, too, walked on the wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man on a Wire","review":"Excellent, daring, insanity driven person.

It is better than I thought that it would be. This man is truly an artist. He has unbelievable balance control and better yet he knows how to stay focused passionately. Just think how much Focus and Confidence you have to have to pursue something like this. Could you do it? I also found the movie extremely interesting showing all of the planning that had to take place to make the event happen. The movie is not really about a Man on a Wire. It is about planning, dreams, passion, goals, developing skills, layout etc... I agree that there were scenes that were staged or reenacted, because they had to be. The actual events are real, and they grabbed me. My only disappointment was that he was arrested for being an artist and not bothering anyone. I can watch this movie again and again. It is Unbelievable and Real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled by the word \\"Large\\"","review":"I purchased this \\"Large\\" headphone case here at Amazon to protect my headphones, as it turns out they are only large in relation to ear buds!

To the contrary, it is a slow, static and imponderable foreign-language film containing minimal dialogue, wooden acting and a paucity of action. Boils down to a barely watchable one-man show most notable for its lenghty pauses, odd facial mannerisms and endless ritual bowings. To add to the misery, the subtitles disappear whenever English is spoken, which hampers the accessibity of hearing impaired viewers. This is is doubly unfortunate, since the \\"Emperor's\\" spoken English is broken and barely comprehensible--even to people that can hear perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very strange film","review":"One of the strangest movies I've seen in a very long time, it is about the final days of World War II and the life of the Japanese emperor Hirohito. I am not sure if he really spoke in a strange, affected way, or if he always made an O with his mouth and jutted his lips out, but that's what you see in the movie.

The lyrics are quite garbled, and the song's content makes no sense. I am a tried and true fan of Michael Jackson and feel that \\"Stranger in Moscow\\" does not live up to some of Michael Jackson's other hits such as \\"Remember the Time\\" which had a nice theme and nice beats to it; \\"Stranger in Moscow has no theme and disoriented beats. \\"You Are Not Alone\\" is a touching, heartfelt love song; \\"Stranger in Moscow\\" cannot be heartfelt because of the lack of emotion that is conveyed in the song. \\"Stranger in Moscow\\" is not something I recommend to anybody.

When I bought this product in a rush at a store, and compared them with my \\"Balanced B-100 Complex\\" at home I was in shock. My 'balanced' vitamins cost me $1 per bottle/50 tabs. That would equate to $6 compared to this bottle by Nature Made. I got mine at Vitamin World, they have a 'basket' of all vitamins on sale with expiration as far as 2012 for $1 for most of the bottles in the basket, and smart people instead buy overpriced vitamins from shelves, I never know why. Anyway, comparing both, my has B1-100mg, B2-100mg, Niacin 100mg, B6-100mg, Folic Acid-400mcg, B12-100mcg, Biotin-100mcg, Pantothenic acid-100mg. ALL for $1 per 50 pills in a bottle!

Then I noticed that the expiration date for my bottle was October 2012. I thought what? I rubbed my eyes and the date was the same. So there it is -- Amazon sold me a bottle of 360 (not 300 as the info states on the site) and they would expire in 60 days! Not at all acceptable. It was old stock that should have been discarded. That is not how you treat loyal customers.

From the very first paragraph the book begins to disappoint. (\\"A torrential torrent\\"? Really?) Anyway- the characters were half developed, the plot line skimpy, the dialogue trite, and the spelling errors abundant. It reads as is Fern Michaels is trying to be Janet Evanovich and cannot pull it off. She's just not funny. I have been reading Michaels for years and stayed loyal even through the downward spiral of her writing in the \\"revenge\\" series, but I have lost all faith in her now. I doubt I will bother to read her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torrential torrents and other nonsense","review":"The first line in the book talks about rain as a torrential torrent.

Ten years ago, she was overwhelmed that he made her the executrix of his will. He had made up his mind for personal reasons that he did not want to donate any organs in the event of his death. Darby had been away in Scotland when Russ died. She is devastated to learn that his stepmother Bella had signed papers to donate his organs. Darby's quirky aunts, Dodo, Diddy, Ducky Lane were surrogate mothers to Darby and the Gunn children growing up. It becomes their mission to stop Bella Gunn from trying to irrevocably change their neighborhood. The dialogue and narrative at times was uneven; but the main characters kept things interesting. By and large a very good romantic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"death leads to romance","review":"This terrific novel shows how we can bring happiness to people we never met, after we die, donating our organs, even against our will as it happens with Russ who died in an accident.This unforgetteable novel also shows that the death of a person can bring families who are torn apart, back together again with some goodwill, in this case, a son leaves two siblings and an ailing father behind.The focal point in this contemporary novel is Darby, the dollhouse builder who finds romance with her dead college friend's brother Ben. They battle the wicked stepmother who is not so wicked after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money on this novel","review":"A friend gave me a box of books, and all terrific authors, I picked this Fern Michaels right up, because I knew that she was a best-selling author. Within the first few chapters, I thought it might have been her first book, between the really poor dialog, and flat characters, it was a terrible read. The plot jumps around, and I have no feeling whatsoever for Darby and Ben. And trying to decipher what each Beer swilling Aunt's personality was like was impossible. Ducky? Dodo? Diddy? REALLY? And for one (for the life of me cannot remember) to don a ninja outfit to scare a dog into a bath?? REALLY? None of the characters are believable. And for someone to be dead set against organ donation? Who even thinks that anymore? Then the story veers off to a lost son in Japan. None of this story is worth the time and trouble to read. The cover-art has nothing to do with anything in the book either. Truly a dismal read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This book was horrible, read all of the other one star reviews and then add this note: What 35 year old man, who was abandoned at birth, would leave his country (Japan) and his profession to come to the USA with his wife and three children (with another baby on the way!) to live near a mother he never knew?

Some of the characters were funny, but there were several unrealistic perks and twists, as well as a very lackluster and sappy ending. Dodo and her son, for example.

Overall a very, very disappointing book - whether you like Fern Michaels or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major turn-off","review":"This might have been a lightly entertaining novel if it weren't for the anti-organ donor attitude that cropped up so very often.

Didn't she used to be a good writer? This is a story that could be made to be almost believable, but instead it seems ridiculous. Her characters have also been getting on my nerves.

I'd highly recommend them to anyone who likes a ripping good plot, with well delineated characters, good research and a racy imagination. Onstott's novels about Haiti and its rise from brutal French slavery has to be among the best written.Admittedly not everyone's cup of tea, Horner and Onstott's books have violence galore, hot sex, and an interesting take on everything.

They researched who the victims and survivors were, the weather conditions and iceberg reports, the design of the ship and why it sank, and the current exploration of the wreckage. They wrote journals as if they were those who survived and those who perished, wrote persuasive letters for/against displaying artifacts, and even researched the vintage clothing of the 1912s.

This was by far the best Titanic story I have seen and I've seen them all. The black and white doesn't even bother me. Spends more time on the actual disaster. Most of the Titanic stories turn into a soap opera. This one does not. Then there is an added bonus of the movie played again but narrated by 2 men that are experts in the disaster that explain everything. So you get 2 stories for the price of one. Worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Very disappointed, the first cd would not play,ordered another, same problem. Obviously this product was not checked for quality.

When will Criterion realize that they would sell a lot more old movies by making their range cheaper. Some of their range is nearly 40 dollars for movies that are often 50 years old. These movies may be classics or even minor classics but somehow I feel Criterion is only interested in making money rather than educating us. Why not do both for a more reasonable price, Criterion?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful Titanic movie! It is very accurate for the 1950's, and the plot isn't meddled with as many fictional charactors as Cameron's film. But to the people who think that he copied off of this film, you are wrong! The falling smokestack scene, the Mr. Andrews scene, esc.. are historical facts. You may want to learn more about what really happened before you go around saying things like you know what you're talking about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie still remains the best Titanic flick made.James Cameron's Titanic recreated the ship historically but did not recreate the panic or human drama as much as this movie. I was disappointed with Criterion's version of this movie. The picture was no better than VHS. The sound...MONO....What gives? With many classics of this era being brillantly transformed by DVD, this one is ordinary and does not deserve the price requested. The audio commentary by Lynch and Marshall is also outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie would not play... :(","review":"Just a heads up to potential buyers; this blue ray disk would not load for me and I tried two different players...:("},{"rating":"2","title":"A nihgt to remember (Criterion Collection) blu-ray","review":"This is a sad but good movie remembering the sinking of the Titanic.

Unlike other studio takes on the story, Baker sticks to real-life details, crafting an intelligent, suspenseful re-enactment of the fateful night, while glimpsing many human stories behind the disaster. Featuring lavish costumes and exquisite production design, as well as a cast of more than 200 actors, \\"Night\\" is a high-seas outing you'll remember for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"No glitz, docu-drama that packs a hard punch.","review":"Keep Hollywood out of the movies! Don't let the age of this film fool you, this is an excellent hard hitting drama, just as good now as when it first came out. There is no fat in this film, no window dressing.

See this soon and forget DiCaprio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not its own merits?","review":"It's unfortunate that so many people buy into the idea that they cannot praise anything without simultaneously running something else down.The Titanic's brief, ironic and tragic history has been told and re-told several times and the various tellings have their own merits and demerits.

It feels like it is made of cheap plastic, like a toy. The protruding buttons make it much too easy to hang up with your cheek. Sound quality is not as good as the older monochrome display Nokia that this phone replaced.Unfortunately, this was the only candybar style Nokia that Cingular was carrying when we upgraded. This design seems to be falling out of style, but we love them for their ruggedness. You drop them, and at worst the shell comes off and you snap it back on. If the shell does get damaged, get a new one and the phone looks like new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't hear","review":"I bought this phone because it was the cheapest model and I was in a pinch. My previous one and Cingular wouldn't give me a replacement until I signed a new 2-year contract. FYI: Cingular is no good. I can barely hear with this phone, so I have frequent ear pain after pressing it so hard to the side of my head. Other than that, I do like getting on the internet so quickly, though the loading time and graphics leave much to be desired. So in sum, pay a little more for a better phone and get away from Cingular as fast as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Nokia customer.

I end up accidentally hitting the arrow keys every other time I try to press it.Second - sometimes the phone seems to not respond to key presses or respond with significant latency. I don't know if this is hardware or software-related. But it's infuriating. I've missed calls and other problems due to it.Yeah - only two problems. But they're BIG problems. I am disappointed. I'll be getting a new phone soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ringtones? Keypads?","review":"Everyone seems like this phone but this phone doesn't fit for everyone's size. The phone is great for its small size but I have problems with keypads due to tiny size and awkward position and has its very limited capacities plus ringtones. It would not let me use its silent mode without making a sound when i set it for vibrate mode. I find it very dissappointing design and manipulating cost-effective prohibitiveness to the usefullness of messaging and web-browsing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you value your hearing","review":"I've always bought Nokia cell phones, because they usually offered the most friendly, intuitive interface. I hate this phone. Who would have thought that a cell phone wouldn't come with volume controls?I have the ring tone on the lowest setting and it still makes me jump when it rings inside my purse, and I have NEVER seen a phone without the ability to adjust the audio levels while talking!! I feel like I'm losing my hearing in my right ear, although now I hold the phone about an inch away from my ear while talking.The middle wheel is too small even with my small fingers, I'm always hitting a button vs. the wheel. When I press the end call button, for some reason it always activates the speakerphone first. I bought it with a 2 year warranty so feel I'm stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good simple phone","review":"I have had this model phone from Cingular for about two months without problems. Also got one for my mother who is not very technically savvy and needed something simple. You really get don't many of the bells and whistles of other phones but if you want something with a decent speaker and good reception this will fit the bill. I have dropped the phone from a hight of 3 feet 3 times without it showing any damage (it was in a leather case for 2 drops). Also its a very \\"nice\\" looking phone.Only a few critisms. Seems a bit small for my male hand, but maybe I am a bit clumbsy. Its NOT ready to be an FM radio out of the box. I called Cingular and they told me Nokia had an accessory for it. Going to Nokia's webpage you are informed the addon component will be out soon. This brings me to my last point which is that there are not a lot of ringtones or accessories for this model as of this date, but I image this will change soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"took some getting used to","review":"I have to admit when I first got this phone I did not like it at all. In fact I had every intention of getting rid of it ASAP. I have since decided to keep it because it really is a nice phone. I had a Motorola before this and the reception was horrible. This phone has outstanding reception and in response to a previous review yes there is a way to adjust the volume. I had the opposite problem...my volume was too low and I could not figure out how to adjust it. There is NO mention of it in the handbook which is odd, but just google it and you will find the instructions how to do it. Once I got the volume controls taken care of it was smooth sailing. I would like a few more choices for wallpaper and ringtones but if you need a tough little phone that gets the job done this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've bought a Sony DCRIP5 instead!!!","review":"I just got this camcorder and I got very disappointed.

My 2 yr old son broke his book the first day by pulling the pages apart. This wasn't too hard to do. Basically, the pages are split in half so you can make the figure in the picture look like it is moving. If you pull the top half up and the bottom half down too hard, the page comes out. It's a cute concept and my son loves the pictures of the Toy Story characters but the book just isn't sturdy enough to stand up to a toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Run (Disney Finger Fun Book)","review":"This book is a board book and very cute. It has pages that separate into two parts to simulate movement of the Toy Story people on each page. It fell apart within the first five minutes of gentle play by my 18 month old.

This book picks up from the tv series where Londo Mollari has acended to the position of Emperor. In the last three tv episodes, much is alluded to as to what happened to Londo and his friend Vir Cotto. This book jumps right into what is alluded to, and how Londo handles his \\"hidden enslavement\\" to the Drakh. The twists and turns the plot takes are excellent reminders of the twists and turns that Londo's scheming and planning took the entire tv show over its five seasons. Very good beginning to a series, and it leaves you wanting more in the final pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vir Ascendant!","review":"This work gives an extraordinary insight into the Drahk/Keeper relationship with the Emperor of Centuri Prime that is not to be missed. Both Londo and Vir's characters are so well described that you can somehow see and hear them as though one was watching them on the Television. The only real problem with this novel is the timeline: certain events occuring over a few B5 episodes are spread out over many months in the novel. But it is an oversight worth overlooking as the result is rich in detail, providing a behind the scenes look at many of the events in the final episodes of the fifth season of B5. One also begins to see the foundations of Vir's rise to power, his source of strength that will eventually lead him to take up his prophesized position on the throne. In a sense, one feels as though this trilogy will be more about Vir than Londo, as Londo seems trapped in a situation from which there is no forseeable escape. An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite good","review":"First off I would like to say the authors like Peter David are what has killed sci-fi literature. This book, and the others in the series, only offers stale and emotionless sequence actions taken by the fairly flat characters in the book. It would have been more enjoyable as a two-page outline of events. At least then I would not have felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contradicts TV Series","review":"Everything about Peter David's writing is accurate---he does excel at writing/expanding on great television shows, and this book is no exception. However, I found it very difficult to enjoy since there a gross contradictions in the Babylon 5 timeline. Fans of the series will remember Londo visiting Sheridan and Delenn on Minbar to give them the urn at the end of Season 5. That season is 2262. For some reason, Peter David places this in 2264 or 2265. Why? I have no idea, but how can these books be considered canon with such contradictions rampant? Also, Garibaldi appears to still have his job with the Alliance after a point in the series where he was placed on suspension for being drunk. If the Great Maker himself J. Michael Straczynski proofreads and sanctions these manuscripts, how and why are such inconsistencies in print? For these inexcusable oversights, I have no choice but to rate this book 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved B5, this is a must read","review":"Unfortunately, if you have not, you will be extemely confused. The book does little to bring you up to speed on the plot thus far. Like the show, which I recommend to any scifi fan as one of the finest works in the genre, the book builds on what has gone before.The characters are true to form and facinating. The HMS, the creater of the show, once described B5's center plot as the war over londo mollari's soul. That being the case, this book is an excellent installment in that saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"rite were the show left off!","review":"It follows the last year of the Final season of Babylon 5 with pace and enthusiasm.

It is hard to briefly describe a BAH story, and this story is no exception. There are damsels in distress, a hero who always get the snot beat out of him (but, does that stop him? NOOOOO!), and even vampires. The action is non-stop, and down and dirty, with just enough love interest to keep it interesting! This is my favorite Zolotow story.

Great sound track, great action, great humor. I only wish I could get a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Glow","review":"I can't believe I live in a country where mt fellow countrymen have put this #2 and Transporter 2 as the the #1 selling movie.It is SICKENING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours of my life I really WANT BACK!!!!","review":"OK, before last fall, I had never heard of the Last Dragon. So I was talking to my friend one day, and he mentioned it, and I asked if DMX (the rapper) was in it. He, in turn, laughed at me. So it is because of his laughter that I watched this movie. I, along with my roommate, set up for a night of movie watching....What a mistake! First of all, we talked all during the film about how corny and stupid it was. I know I'm going against the rest of the reviews, but movies like this do nothing for me. And then the part where we found out who The Master was....talk about WACK!!!!All in all, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you like corny 80s stuff, you may enjoy this. I, on the other hand, really want those two hours back."},{"rating":"2","title":"the master","review":"this is by far one of my favorite movies. i saw it for the first time when i was very young and fell in love with it. this movie is great for any fan of hip hop, bruce lee, break dancing, or just cheesy 80's cinema. this has to be one of the greatest movies of all time, from the first scene, you will definately know \\"who is the mastter?\\" there is an abundance of action, the comedy in the movie is endless, and the plot is so endless to follow. one could definately learn some moves from this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey my man, what it look like?!","review":"What it look like is a blast from the past. I originally saw this movie when I was in Jr high, and finally being able to watch it again -on DVD no less- brings back a flood of memories with the music, clothes and one liners. This is a definite treat for anyone who grew up during the eighties!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Blast","review":"This movie, produced by Motown's Barry Gordy, is an absolute blast! The hero, Bruce Leroy Green (Tiamak) idealizes Bruce Lee. He teaches martial arts as well as being a student of the arts, trying to recah the final level.The villians, campy, yet convincing, are Mr. Arkiadian anbd Show Nuff. One wants Green out of the way to strong arm Vanity to play music videos of his girlfriend. The other, Mr. Nuff, wants to prove he is the \\"Badest\\" fighter in Harlem. This movie is pure fun. It never takes itself seriously and thanks to the producers, the film quality is number one.A must see for all martial arts fan and others can enjoy this movie as well. It has wide appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"bring \\"the glow\\" to DVD","review":"This movie rocks.

And at such a great time. I know my VHS copy from HBO has about had it and im not willing to spend $80.00 + to get a copy off e-bay. So thanks for brining it back into print, it's about time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Best\\" Dragon","review":"I remember seeing this movie when I was only 11 years old. Guess What...it still hasn't lost its \\"kick\\" (pun intended). It never loses itself with too much martial arts or the wacky/fun storyline. Despite all that, the lesson delivered is made clear throughout the film and especially the conclusion. You owe it to yourself to see theis flick; so don't waste anymore time and GET The Last Dragon NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The good ol' days","review":"I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember.

Thanks Amazon team."},{"rating":"2","title":"ya gots to go wit da GLOW","review":"I have to admit I'm partial to this movie. It's just too camp to not like. I first viewed it in the mid 80's when it was released and I thought then and believe now that it's a great send up of all the karate movies I've ever seen. Best line of the movie belongs to Laura (Vanity) when she says to Bruce Leroy (Taimak) \\"You look like a Master to me.\\" There aren't any serious elements to this movie but if you're young (or just young at heart), you'll enjoy the \\"good guys win\\" ending to this camp flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Dragon","review":"It was amazing better than expected. a classic kung fu movie that everyone should watch.

Wow what a difference.I made the barbecued salmon for my family for Mother's day, and no one touched the chicken. It was cooked perfectly and had loads of flavor. Then I tried the baked filets with spinach and pine nuts, and I was hooked.The tips are a big help and the book is fun to read. I think anyone who wants to eat more fish would love this book because it is full of ideas that simple enough to do, but full of flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a watch for divers who travel","review":"I got this watch for Christmas (possibly at my strong suggestion). No warning at all in the description that you can not change from Imperial to Metric (can't change from Feet to Meters, or Fahrenheit to Celsius).Are you kidding me??? Are the people at Citizen totally RETARDED? or do they think that their US clients will never travel outside the US to go diving. Last time I checked: The Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, the Mediterranean - pretty much the entire world uses metric.Every other sports watch I have ever owned easily changed unit between the two. Somehow the design challenged people at Citizen didn't get the memo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanium bracelet","review":"Ordered the watch and couldn't turn the bezel. Titanium bracelet is a joke compared to a original citizen titanium bracelet. This is some sort of cheap chinese bracelet. When i took the bracelet of it was directly possible to use the bezel.

People do travel..a"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"You're right. I didn't like it. But I had to buy it just to see how bad it really was. And I wasn't disappointed...Following hot on the heels of \\"Lovemarks\\" comes yet another vacuous 4-color brochure from Kevin Roberts for his firm Saatchi & Saatchi. In which he tells us that the only way to connect with humans is via sisomo. Which is no doubt why we have five senses. Duh. He should have saved some scarce natural resources and just put out a video on the web. At least that would have been sisomo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underneath the glossy production...nothing new to say. \\"Medium\\" is definitely the message.","review":"Kevin Roberts appears desperate to coin a new word for our already overwrought lexicon of corporate jargon - but in creating another book in what is clearly a strategic plan by Saatchis to seize some kind of 'ownership of tomorrow' - the author forgot to come up with any new ideas. Could Sight Sound and Motion really be the saviour of modern communication and advertising? Gee whizz. Don't tell Hollywood, or they'll invent the talkies.This book is empty and smug. I give it two stars because the layout is lovely - a fresh updating of the work that Quentin Fiore did for Marshall McLuhan in his \\"Medium is the Massage.\\"But I found it a pity that McLuhan, in his books from the 1960s, has far more to say about today's media than does Roberts in 2006.For an alternative you might like to try:Juicing the Orange: How to Turn Creativity into a Powerful Business Advantage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic!","review":"This book is idiotic! It might have been interesting if it had been written in 1937 (the year Walter Benjamin wrote the prohetic \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction), but even in 1937 the author's self-satisfied voice and cutsie delivery would have undermined whatever credibility the book might otherwise have had. Do not waste your time on this book. Unless you have been asleep for the last half century, you will find nothing that you do not already know within the covers of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"This book was suggested by amazon to me as relating to writing effective web copy and web marketing.However, I found it difficult to understand and it did not give too many suggestions on web marketing, so I was dissappointed. I already knew the new media - web 2.0 stuff (youtube, myspace, blogs, forums, etc.) exists and is taking away from old style media (TV, radio, etc.).This booked seemed to only state the obvious that advertising and marketing has changed dramatically. You need to learn how to market using the new media. Find a book that teaches you how to use the new stuff rather than a book that just tells you that it exists.I can say one thing for the book. It does look cool and have cool photos. It would be nice on your coffee table and impress visitors because they will not understand it and will think that you do. I moved it from one to two stars for look and coolness."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Kevin loved himself any more, he'd have to be twins.","review":"There is a very, very short bi-line article trying to get out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"This particular book seems to be a little more complicated. Maybe more pages would have been helpful. However, my daughter loves the \\"Rookie Read About\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid history lesson, and lesson in avarice","review":"A very compelling history of the European tradition of porcelain making. Although it does plod along in places this is more reflective of the history than Ms. Gleeson's storytelling. I mainly picked the book up because of the ties to alchemy at the begining, and really I didn't expect to read much past that, but it kept me engaged throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startling tale of the development of European china.","review":"This is an enchantingly written tale of intrigue, chicanery, outright fraud, swindling, and above all, of greed. It also tells of the story of the development of the Arcanum of Porcelain, the treasured secret to the making of, and decoration of, fine china porcelain. Porcelain was so fine you could see the sun through it, harder than ordinary steel, and more expensive than gold.How can a story about so odd a subject be so entrancing? Well, there were some bloody-minded people involved....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Arcanum: The Extraordinary True Story","review":"I found the Arcanum to be a fascinating read, wether you care about porcelin or not. Gleeson is a great story teller. The book reads like a mystery thriller that you don't want to put down. I have given three copies to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative approach to teaching reading","review":"While these sets are not a complete reading program, they offer a good base for homeschool families with a interest in phonics-based reading. The stories are a bit silly, and the illustrations are well done. The rods are an enjoyable manipulative with many uses beyond the texts themselves. The activities included with each book extend the learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived quickly and fluffily","review":"I had ordered this as a Christmas gift for my octopus-enthusiast girlfriend.Probably due to the fact that she already has so many octopus animals, she did not love this one.I, on the other hand, like this one much more than the others she has.It is far more soft and cuddly than the others that I have come across and would be perfect for a small child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Durable/Washable Addition to Our Toy Collection","review":"My 10 month old daughter loves this toy.

About 12 early chapters of this book are on CD ONLY, in PDF format. I for one, don't want to sit and study a computer monitor, when I am going to study, I want it on paper! So, I opened the PDF file and found the sections of information that I needed, then went to print... Guess what... Mr. Goodman disabled the printing function in the PDF files.

Okay, granted it's a reference material, and quite comprehensive...but in the abscense of any real entry point for even an intermediate JavaScript user, why couldn't there have been some more intelligent indexing?There's nothing that really lays out the scope of JavaScript and it's various conflicting Document Object models and allows you to find what you're looking for right now.One reviewer said he READ the 1000+ page book and found that to be very valuable, but frankly, there's so many really understandable Javascript books out there, with ALMOST the same wealth of information, I'd rather read one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Important Pages are Missing!","review":"The book is a very fine work and quite definitive but the pages that deal with some basic concepts are only on the CD.

I have a SanDisk 4GB card that the game won't save to. Trust me, there's nothing wrong with the card. The card, game and PSP were all brand new, bought the same day.I'm currently fighting it out with Konami to get a refund since the store I bought the game from won't allow you to return a game that's been opened.Bottom line -- if you don't have a Sony 256MB Memory Stick, you can't save, so unless you like starting from scratch each time you turn on your PSP, forget about it.

You're pretty much trapped into a boring schedule of being locked in your apartment, or out at school with only a couple of minutes to do anything. There's an incredibly limited amount of things you can do in each section of the game, and when you finally get somewhere (or get a date) the payoff is anti-climactic. Game has a few bugs too.

As my teacher was incompetent and simply took samples out of the book and did them on the board, I found myself relying on teaching myself the material out of the book. Unfortunately, the amount of explanation in the text is... minimal, at best. It usually just says \\"This is what you do, and it works because it's MATH.\\" The examples skip a fair number of algebraic steps--great, if you remember every bit of your middle and high school math classes, but very confusing if you forget anything. I ended up failing the class because I couldn't learn an adequate amount out of this book.I used a different book for Calc I, and this can't hold a candle to it.

When I was trying to do my homework, I looked in the book for information, and it did not have what I needed. I even asked another instructor at the tutoring center for help. She asked to see my book so she could figure out what to do, and she said, \\"This is all the information this book gives on limits!?\\" If you are an instructor, do not make your students use this book!

They are often oversimplified or overly complicated compared to the exercises used as homework. The student solution manual is good for what problems it has.

This would be fine if all educators did this, but, unfortunately, they do not. I am in one such class. The professor seems to adhere to this book's philosophy and tests students on problems that he does not teach, similar to the book. The book does not help at all.

Some of the standout tracks include \\"Open Wide\\", \\"All I Want\\", and \\"Sunrising\\". U2 and Coldplay influences are noticeable, but the band has its own sound. They spent a lot of time adding very cool sound effects to the songs to create multi-layered soundscapes, and the results are definitely ear-pleasing. Owyoung's excellent voice sounds a bit like that of Martin Smith of Delirious on some of the slower tracks. On \\"If You Find Her\\", he shows ability to hit the high notes as well. As an aside, the 2004 album \\"Divine Invitation\\" the band made under their former name is also worth checking out. The band's new name was taken from a C.S. Lewis poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"I always thought that Something like silas was good and when they changed their name I wasn't worried they would get worse, but this album is light years ahead of anything else they have ever done! It is amazing. If you like emo/coldplay, Juliana Theory, Copeland, switchfoot, dashboard, type stuff, you will love this. I just got it yesterday and i have listened to it like 5 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"'twas ok at first","review":"I really had some high hopes for this album after hearing a single track on Pandora (a recommendation engine for music lovers). But then I downloaded the album and was unimpressed. Too much religious overtone. Which is sad, because they have a good sound... although kind of whiny at times. Personally, I don't like religion in my music and I don't like it in the schools. If I wanted it, I would pick out music that was in a \\"bible\\" section. If you want religion overpowering music/society/anything else, then bring your own religion to it.. or at least have the decency to advertise it (instead of wasting my time).Final thought: glad I didn't pay for this pile of rubbish. Don't YOU buy it either (unless you're one of the sunday/god crew.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desires Of Innocence","review":"If you like Showtime movies and the actress Gabrielle Hall then you will like this movie.It was a movie I liked and was looking for,sometime and finely found. I liked the plot and the twist and turns and divided loyalty. For a \\"B\\" movie the characters are believable and played well. There are parts of the movie that are dated to the 1990 ies and would never happen today, but if you can look on this movie as what it is a fictional movie set in the 1990 and a movie to enjoy on that basis, you will enjoy it I hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to know the REAL reason the Left hates the Catholic Church???","review":"STRIKE..the biography of Agnieszka Kowalska whose revolt against Communism inspired the creation of Solidarity and thus the liberation of Poland from the jackboot of the Left.Filmed entirely at the Lenin shipyards where it took place...........Probably one of the best Polish movie I have ever seen. Covering the years 1961 to 1981, this is very well done with a surprisingly crackerjack musical store. The film..more than any other I have seen...... shows just how important Pope John Paul II was to that nation. The film seems be have some ambivalence about Lech Walensa(sp) that, not being Polish, I did not understand. I thought he was a Polish hero? But otherwise, this is a great film about Poland both under the Communist jackboot AND how that country---through its Catholic faith...started the chain reaction that eventually destroyed the Soviet Union.Really REALLY good film!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Instructor","review":"Just finished this workout and did not enjoy Lisa Rinna. She is a terrible instructor. Her count is off from the music, she misses steps which should have been edited out, and she does not even bother to do a mirror image for the camera which means as she is saying use left it appears she is using right. I have been a dance instructor for many, many years and it is common practice and very helpful to your students to reserve your moves to help teach. Because of my experience I was able to follow the routines but I think inexperienced people could be turned around. It is definitely better to watch the back up dancers than Lisa. Fun routines and a decent workout but I didn't find her enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Hilarious and shocking. Loved it.","review":"I recently saw this movie at a local indie film fest and I thought it was the best movie of the whole weekend-long fest. This is a great horror-comedy. I loved it. Shocking humor, hot girls, blood, and [...]! What more could you want in a horror movie? I saw it with 2 of the actors and the director in the audience. They were very cool and nice. They even gave me a poster for the film. This movie is kinda underground and might be hard to find in the video chains but just buy it here on amazon, it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best horror comedy since Dead Alive","review":"I saw this film at Sarasota Film Festival about a year ago. I wasn't sure what to expect but knowing the title gave me incentive to see how 'blood' and a 'car' could be possibly enfused together to create a movie. It was hilarious! Blood Car was far-fetched to the point where there was no way you couldn't laugh. Lots of blood, an intimidating thug, ridiculous government officials, some hot girls, a nice kid turned bad(for a cause), and some innocent school children come together to make Blood Car the funniest, bloodiest movie in years to come. If you like comedy and low budget horror then don't hesitate to purchase Blood Car.

There are low budget films and no budget films and Blood Car falls into the latter. It played like a John Walters movie and I kept expecting Divine and Edith Massey to walk on. There was no gore and not particulary funny in fact I could nt wait for it to end. Might have appriciated it more if I had had a few cans. If you are into films made up of one old car, two upturned boxes for sales units and the same stretch of road with half a dozen amateur actors haming it up then Blood Car could be for you otherwise leave it well alone"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Satire; A Little Gore--What's Not to Love?","review":"This little indie is a real find.

There was virtually NO GORE, it's filled with nonsense sex scenes to take up time because the acting talent and plot is so weak. No, it's not funny.

Notable observations include that of nature as a metaphor, an abstract, freeform world to apply meaning to and derive meaning from. He makes a good case for natural settings as critical to our mental and physical well being.Unfortunately the core notion of biophilia is fuzzy at best, not scientifically studied at all-one could make a case that this is all just talk.

With a comedy career spanning over 50 years, this Irish-American life erudite never walked on egg shells or pulled any punches!Sadly, he was only a few months away from receiving The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. I'm sure he was aware of how much he was loved and how special his brand of comedy is. I'm glad he went out on a high note with one of his funniest comedy specials ever!.....It's Bad For Ya!

There is no reason why the home cook cannot at least be given the option of measuring the ingredients by weight instead of volume.This book is fine as a collection of recipes (although a few could have benefited from further testing), but if you are interested in really learning baking techniques, there are better books out there (Jeffrey Hammelman's new book on bread, Pie and Pastry Bible....)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say enough wonderful things about this book!","review":"My dream is to one day own a small bakery in my community.

There were several typos in the book. It really affected the story when the wrong type of SUV was noted (made me wonder if they bought a new one and I missed a memo).

I had a hard time putting this one down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I love Brenda Joyce's series on Francesca Cahill, so I am very familiar with her work. This book however made me want to skip to the end quickly. There was more hesitation than necessary on the part of the hero Cliff. The heroine of the novel, Amanda was an interesting character bent on living her life as she knew it. I think the novel is not one of Joyce's best and was too long for the content of the story. Many of the pages seemed like filler to me than packed with necessary development. Ah well. I will continue to read Joyce anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are her leading men getting wimpier??","review":"This book had some terrific moments, but with the peaks, come the valleys. Some parts vapid, others repetitive. How many times can the man's loins fill and swell before he does something about it? Another quirk I've noticed in her last two books that somewhat annoys me is how often the hero's eyes fill with tears. C'mon Joyce, we still like real men, quit making them so soft. You'll notice the same pattern in Stolen Bride with Sean O'Neil's character. Aside from that, it had a good setting, plot and the characters actually got to know one another over a reasonable amount of time. I also like the way Rex and Blanche were subtly written in (teaser for the next de Warren installment). It wasn't a bad read, you'll know when your hitting a plateau and those pages are easy enough to skim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Journey!","review":"This is the first book I have read cover to cover, in one day, in a long time.

I've just finished reading 'I Knit Water' and I loved it. I really feel that it's one of those rare, beautiful bittersweet books that don't come along too often.

The \\"paper rest\\" actually folds down and sits under the keyboard, so to use it you have to lift the keyboard off of the platform, fold the paper rest up and put the keyboard back on the platform. That part is a little cumbersome but if you don't need the paper rest, you'll never know it's there and if you need it, you can just leave it up. The platform is very hard and as stated, can actually hang over the edge of the desk. You could also use the platform as a lap desk and sit the keyboard or your laptop on it. As for the adjustable part, the platform sits flat - the gel/foam wrist pad sits in a hard surround and you can flip it over to change the height of the wrist pad. On one side, it sits higher in the surround and on the other side it sits lower.Overall - I like it and it is a very nice platform/gel wrist pad for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This platform has been one step in helping me to alleviate shoulder pain due to long hours on the computer.

A good general overview does not have to contain printouts of code and mind-numbing equations, but it does have more substance and conceptual information than this \\"business week\\" like book long article. That's the point. The contents of this book would be fine for a business magazine article but not for a book. Too much prose and at the end not even an intelligent reader can make sense of what is really feasible with this technology and how it can be approached. There are much better general data mining books in the market, books without codes and weird equations for the mathematical illiterate, but with strong conceptual explanations and fundations. See, for instance, \\"Data Mining\\" by Pieter Adriaans for a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"This is one of the worst books on data mining available. It is not intended for marketers nor researchers. You don't need any knowledge about neural networks and -even worse- you will not learn anything. It only talks about the IBM Neural Network Utility.

I have owned many pairs and continue to use them nearly everyday. The fit is perfect, they stay on, and the black stealth looks great!Now, lets get to the bad. I work A LOT with my hands and these gloves don't last very long at all. I know they are fairly thin, and not meant for heavy duty work but still... I end up wearing holes through the fingers rather quick.If you are looking for a great, all around glove this is the way to go.

Otherwise no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for lightweight tasks, but wear out under heavy use","review":"These gloves are very comfortable and allow better use of fingers for fine tasks. They feel like a pair of fine driving gloves (as one user with the same complaint put it), but their advertising implies that they are for doing real work. The thin, soft, leather wears out very quickly when used where there is any significant friction or abrasion (e.g., handling firewood, shoveling dirt or gravel, handling a loaded wheelbarrow, picking up rocks, etc.). They are fine with smooth-handled tools, like polished metal or fiberglass, but wear out quickly when used with smooth, but weathered, wooden handled tools, for example. I will buy a replacement pair, but will be more selective about what I use them for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gloves","review":"I had a pair of these (not the stealth style) and lost one of them so when I saw Amazon selling them for only 20 bucks I grabbed them.They have excellent grip, are very comfortable and they look really cool.

For one thing they fit much tighter and I would be surprised if they actually sized much more than a XL even though they are selling them as XXL. The long and short of it is that I returned them due to sizing issues. Based on the XXL sixing I would say to order a size up if you want a good fit.Other changes include changed closure and fabric around the thumb and index finger. I do not know if these changes are good or bad as I have not used them but feel the changes to the closure which is now much thicker plastic are bad.Can someone recommend a good glove in XXL to replace this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have","review":"i had been spending my money on the rubber gloves but had that's a joke unless your changing oil i bought these because i got tired of busting my fingers and theses are great not only do i enjoy wherein them but they keep my hands dry too unlike rubber gloves i can work in them all day and im not having to change them out because the y ripped or i cant stand how wet my hands are from sweating"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Handsome Wristwatch","review":"I am more than pleased with the Armani watch I ordered.

Needed a gigabit swtich and settled on this one based on price and reputation. The configuration has the ports and power plugs on the back and the display on the front. It would be nice to have all on one side to make it a little easier to install but that is personal preference.The feedback you get on the display is really nice. Very easy to read and determine which devices are connected as 100 or 1000 megabit.The unit seems to run pretty warm. I tested it's AC current draw with my volt meter to see how much juice it would be using. It was pulling approximately 0.09 amps at 120v. I also have an 8 port netgear gigabit swich to compare and draws 0.03 amps so it so it definitely draws a decent amount of energy relatively. Both units were at idle with nothing but power plugged in.My only real gripe is the fan.

This Spa is well worth the price and I have been happy with this product since it's first use. I would highly recommend this to anyone that does not have the time or the financial means to go to a salon every week to pamper yourself.

However, I bought it dubbed in the 1990s and the quality is not very good. I badly want the complete series on DVD. WOULD AMAZON PLEASE TRY TO GET IT!Please use your ingenuity; it should be possible to get it, if not from the original source or the tv station/s who serialized it, then from someone who has a good copy on VHS. It should be possible for AMAZON to render it in DVD form.I might add that it does seem that Amazon does now state with the item that it is a documentary and not the original series. That is important. I have now learnt that the TV series was run on NBC. It should not be impossible for Amazon to get it.

I'm grateful I bought it from the library and didn't waste any money on it.The plot is quite unbelievable and boring - I found it impossible to believe that the heroine would be so obsessed with the death of a woman who is essentially the local baglady 20 years or so after it happens. I also found her liberal white condension towards Annie, the lady who dies, quite offensive. The major reason though was that after the first few pages I knew that a lot of cats would probably be killed quite horribly and I never read books where there is gratituous cruelty to animals.

The dialogue was so presumptuous and strait out of a bad soap opera.The plot was silly and I really did not feel any sympathy for any of the characters. The animal cruelty was ramptant through out the book and most of it was very unnecessary to the plot, but the author seems to have the need to go on and on with the subject of torturing cats and uses this as shock value but it only makes her as a writer and a person appear to be mentally disturbed.

THE ICE HOUSE was also great and I recommend either of those over this one.Other reviewers have done justice to the plot and offered a more positive reading. I'll just offer the analysis that a writing strength can cut both ways. Minette Walters' characters and plots are brilliantly detailed and complex. . .. but if I don't really care about or connect with the characters and/or the unsolved mystery then the density becomes dulling and I am largely unable to follow it with any enthusiatic attentiveness.And to chime in on one other controversy, I am neutral regarding the cruelty to cats here as well--it seemed to me to be a minimal and anecdotal part of the story"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Law & Order Fans","review":"If you want to know the background, the nitty gritty, or the details of the cast, this is the book for you!

Not the usual over the top sex which is nice for a change. Bertrice Small is an excellent story writer. I am so looking forward to the next in the series. I hope they are all this good. I hope there are other fantasy books similar to this one if anyone knows of them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the first one of Beatrice Smalls books i've read but I absolutely loved it. I can't wait for the next book to come out. In reference to some of you, I think that the choice of words she uses are appropriate for the book. It is supposed to be set in different times, i think the choice of words fits the book well. And as for the importance of the bathing, if it wasn't for that she wouldn't have met org therefore it is essential to the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another triumph for Bertrice Small","review":"I've been a fan of Bertrice Small's work for close to 20 years, and while LARA is a departure for her normal historicals, I found this book to be a pleasant surprise! I have never read Fantasy before, but, I found Mrs. Small's World of Hetar a wonderful place filled with faries, \\"small\\" giants, magical princes, along with a number of other fantastic characters. Mrs. Small's views on the cultures and peoples of Hetar couldn't be more relevant at this time in our society. The main character, Lara, is a strong woman, and she is able to overcome much adversity and is trying hard to fulfill her destiny. Fans of Mrs. Small's other works should give this one a try, I think that they will be pleasantly surprised. I, for one, cannot wait for Book Two in the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No awesome passion that I can see","review":"All right, I admit I only got to page 200, so maybe there's some love and passion ahead. But I feel like I'm waiting for the story to begin. Lara has zero personality. She's beautiful, but there should be more. Repetitions galore--how many times do we need to hear how her mother abandoned her? No story, dull characters, I can't go on reading. I've read many of Ms. Small's earlier books and enjoyed them. Something here does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried","review":"I was so tired of how beautiful lara was we get it i thought it was so stupid when he tells her your beautiful and she says i know take a damn compliment.....

The first in line to purchase anything she publishes without even reading the jacket. This book was a huge disappointment. While I appreciate her trying something new in creating a ficticious world, it is in no way up to her usual standards. I found the characters simplistic and unbelievable. The same explantions are given over and over (how she came to be sold and her mother deserting her). It was like she was just trying to fill up a page.I still love the author and wait anxiously for her next book (I have read all of them). I hope it will be better thought out, and not just a book that looks like it was thrown together to fulfill her contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy and Romance Lovers, Run Away!!!","review":"Those of you looking for romance (hot and sexy or sweet and heartwarming) or rousing fantasy adventures are looking in the wrong place if you're on this page. Run in the oppsite direction, now! This tripe opens with an \\"as you know, Bob\\"-style infodump unworthy of the most incompetent fantasy, in a world that might or might not engaging in better hands--I can't care enough to tell. By the time I gave up (around page 60), there was still no sign of Lara's male romantic lead, and barely any sign of Lara herself--even when she shows up, she doesn't exhibit much personality. If she doesn't care about being sold into sexual slavery, why should I care about her? I did page ahead, looking for a sign of her romantic lead, but I never did see him.I'd give this book zero or negative stars if I could. It's not even in the ballpark of a romance, and it fails pretty horribly at fantasy, too. I say this as a devoted reader of both genres, as a warning to others: run away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"MINDLESS??? No, it's more like creative and artistic minds can understand and appreciate the difference between fantasy and reality. Personally, Lara was a true, positive influence in my life and I would recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Fantasy","review":"Like her other books Lara, half fairy half human, has a destiny to fulfill and comes to terms with this. She is smart and is trained in fighting, becoming a warrior like her father. Lara is not abused and does not abuse. The sex is not anything close to being S&M. I enjoy all of Ms Small's books and this one was a great treat because I like fantasy books also. I can't wait to see how the next 2 books in the Hetar turn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, slow, poorly written","review":"The pace of this book makes drying paint look exciting. And even with power skimming I had to stop half way thru, I realized I just didn't care about the charaters at all. I didn't care what happened. The heroine is a cardboard person, poorly drawn. In no way believable, yawn. THe world is boring and predicable, honestly with so many great books to read why waste your time on this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I would never have guessed this was a Bertrice Small novel. The Kadin, the Sky O'Malley saga, and others contained strong powerful heroines and strong stories. This heroine was just lame. And the men...all they wanted to do was 'mount' her -- and they did, a lot. Why was the author compelled to spend so much time describing debasing sex scenes when the heroine even said it was debasing... many, many times too!?!? It wasn't until I was 3/4 through the book when there was finally a \\"make love\\" type of scene. And the number of times the heroine recounted her life's story to everyone she met was growing old, quick! I can't begin to explan how unappealing the story was and then to add the sex (not intimacy) it was a waste of Ms. Small's talent.I read once that Ms. Small's doesn't deviate from her standard story concept, even in Fantasy. I agree with that. The addition of Faerie magic, sorcery, etc., doesnt anchor this book. It just lacks a story much less a strong lead character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agartha","review":"I read this book when it first came out, I was totally inspired to put the words into practice, and guess what, it works. This book took me into a very real world of plant deva's, non local relationships, and gentle, lovely true advice. I've bought many copies for friends, all of whom enjoyed it as much as I did. I loved following the authors experience of growth as she first, as a novice meditator, meets her guide \\"Mentor\\", and later shows the wisdom she herself has gained from the whole experience of channeling. I just loved this book. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman journeys within to another world","review":"Agartha is the name given to the channel by her un-physical teacher. This book gives information about possibilities we have in our lives both individually and collectively. If you read \\"Seth Speaks\\" from cover to cover, you will also love this book.

The DVD transfer could look better considering its age, but what is included here is totally hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is when it started getting good","review":"For me, the fifth season of South Park was the season where the show really started getting good. Some of my all-time favorite episodes are here including: Cripple Fight and Cartman Land. It seemed that this was the season where Matt & Trey really started to draw their ideas from current events and added their own take on what was happening in the world, unlike the first few seasons which focused on strictly how far they could go with dirty humor.Plus, Jimmy debuts in season 5, he's one of South Park's best characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Censorship","review":"Notice that there is no \\"Buy this Season\\" button? That's because there are 2 episodes missing. Episode 10 \\"How to Eat with Your Butt\\" is not listed. I have no idea why. There is an HD version of that episode available.The real tragedy, though, is that episode 3 \\"Super Best Friends\\" is not listed. Why? Because Mohammed is depicted.Other religious figures are here as well including Jesus, Joseph Smith and Moses, but the episode is not available because of Mohammed.South Park exists to make fun, and they send up everyone.

This season has some of my favorite episodes; Super best friends - Jesus teams up with some of religions greatest names to destroy David Blaine.

Overall, a very storng season and a must have for fans of south park!"},{"rating":"1","title":"South Park Season 5 review","review":"The season stinks. The stories get dumber every season. I mean a stoned walking & talking towel made by the government,a couple with real butts for faces,a kid killing a bully's parents to make them into chili and then making the bully eat it just becuase he cheated him out of some money? They also make fun Osama Bin Laden just months after 9/11. You make me sick. The only episode I do like is Kenny Dies because it teaches us we should take life for granted but even that is ruined by a dumb,sick ending. Overall,Buy for Kenny Dies and nothing else.

If I want to see behavior like this I can easily go to any nightclub and it would be more interesting. Sorry, didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of movie","review":"With its Pulp Fiction-like dialogue and wit, London does a brilliant job of grabbing and maintaining the viewer's attention throughout, especially in the flashback scenes. It is an intelligent movie that requires your attention to detail to appreciate it satrical and dark humor. The themes may be common, however, this movie is completely original in its presentation. Tired of Will Farrel and American Pie-like humor? Give London a try and experience a smarter and more artistic form romantic heart break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof Positive that Some Things Don't Go Better with Coke.","review":"Despite the fact that almost everybody in this movie seems to be doing the drug themselves, I don't think the substance would be able to help the viewer get into this lousy lack of story. In fact, I had to fight to stay awake toward the end because all these characters do is hang out in a bathroom and swear all night while discussing God, sex, and suicide. The movie is pointless, and the discussions the characters have are totally vapid and pointless. Screaming at a bowl of rice? Boy, now that's some \\"brilliant\\" writing. A much better movie about the devastating effects of coke addiction that makes complete sense is the long lost Johnna Lee movie Shattered Innocence."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"This movie was just awful.

All it was, was just sex, drugs, and too much use of the f word. None of it was necessary. The movie was all about a idiot trying to get his girlfriend back before she leaves New York. Whoever written the script must only have one vocabulary and it's the f word. I couldn't stand how much each character in the movies said the f word over and over again, especially Chris Evans. The part about the cocaine was also dumb and you have immature rich teens snorting coke just to be cool. There is no plot to the film and it doesn't deliver any messages or anything. I mean, my message is expand the your vocabulary, don't use coke, get mental help, so that no will become as stupid as the idiots in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know","review":"I really don't know about this one. I mean, it was an alright movie, but still was really whiny and spent entirely too much time in the bathroom.Way too much Tarentino dialogue, with dumb lines that ended up with \\"man\\" or \\"what the f--- dude\\". Pretty over the top and lame. There was stuff that made no sense in the movie also.Stathom's character says he's impotent ,but yet he goes home with a hot chick, talking about havin sex. Whatever.

Jessica Biel is HOT, but she's not really a big player in this movie. Her character is important, but doesn't get as much screen time as one would expect. Chris Evans was just as mediocre as ever, he might as well have been the Human Torch from Fantastic Four.

No dialogue at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed","review":"While the stop action is great this takes major liberties with the story as well as down plays the music that sets this story apart. Someone decided that being PC is more important than following the story. The hunters are bad, the wolf goes free, and Sasha the duck never comes back. What a huge disappointment -- if you know the story don't bother with this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased as Christmas Gift","review":"I hoped to make it as a gift to teach a youngster about instruments of the orchestra. Very little emphasis is placed on instruments and their role in character development. The story line is revisionist from the original. Hunters are militaristic, mean and ineffective. The duck is a meal for the wolf and never rescued. The wolf is not shot by the hunters, but rescued and placed in a game preserve. I found it to be an overall disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misguided","review":"This is such a deviation from Prokofiev's original that I cannot recommend it at all. The original intent of this work is to get kids to apprecitate orchestral music. This version does not introduce Prokofiev's music until 10 minutes into the feature and during this time Peter accidentally bumps into one of the hunters while walking the street and the hunter proceeds to toss Peter into a trash dumpster and point a gun at his head. For the love of .... ; is anything sacred... as a music teacher, apart from the animation ...this is just rubbish and I can only imagine Prokofiev rolling over in his grave!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this short version of Peter and THe Wolf.

I actually would like to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I just lucked upon this on a PBS channel tonight and it's just an incredible rendition of the classic. The music is more enthusiastic than in most other versions of the story, the style is refreshingly original and uniquely interesting, and the film is entirely an engaging, charming experience from the first minute to the last. Every hand that touched this film belonged to someone that earnestly loved the material and it shows in every frame. This film soundly shames the bulk of offerings from much larger production companies and is worthy of your attention, and at 32 minutes, that's time very well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch with the kids...","review":"Overall it's a great classic, just remember like so many olde tales don't let the kids watch it alone!

I was very disappointed. The older versions are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This Peter follows closely to Prokofiev's music - but, if you expect some narrator to carry you along, you'll find yourself all alone. The story emerges by itself, wordlessly, and does so in the most beautiful way. The Cat comes through with all the feline smugness you could hope for. The Hunter - well there's a whole new tension that I think Prokofiev never had in mind. If you grew up on the vapidized versions I did, this comes across with a harsh edge, resolved eventually in Peter's favor.But, for me, this is all about the animation. As much as I love CGI, it has yet to capture the extra level of human involvement and craft that inheres in puppet animation. This isn't the \\"happy ever after\\" story the disneyfied version wants you to expect. Instead, it has kids dealing with harsh realities - the way they do in the real world, like it or not.Good music, good animation, and it doesn't talk down to the viewer. Doesn't talk at all, really, but that's part of the appeal.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much artistic license","review":"Considering this is a Russian tale, the artist took too much artistic license for the setting and characters for my liking.

The purpose behind teaching \\"Peter\\" in an elementary music setting is to introduce theme and variation as well as the instruments of the orchestra. I've always been so frustrated by the versions of this which have a narrator. Who needs a narrator when you already have a visual for students to watch? The narrators always take away from students' ability to listen to the music. In this version, no narrator exists leaving the story to the music and the beautiful stop motion animation. My students are better able to focus on the music (the themes and instruments) and vocally duplicate them after I use this DVD to enhance my unit plan on \\"Peter and the Wolf.\\" It makes me want to hug the director. -K.

The supplied compression connectors work fine with RG6-Quad and standard RG6 cable and the compression tool is a snap to use.

Item arrived in great condition. And the instruction on the back was clear enough for starter like me. However, there is a catch. The picture on the connectors was a bit inaccurate. The connector came with a black rubber washer-like component in the middle in which it retracts when your compress it with the cable. I practiced on another spare RG-6 cable with one connector and I was almost fooled by the way it works. I thought it was defective but I was wrong. This is what it was designed to do. When it retracts, it actually adds the water proof ability when you compress it.

I only wish it came with some kinda tool to help shove the cable into the cap. The tools included made every other part of the project easy however you still have to manually force the cable into the cap by hand and maybe it's because I'm an amature but getting it all the way in to eliminate the air gap was just about impossible. I'm surprised I didn't destroy the cable trying. In the end there is always still an air gap between the cable and the cap but fortunately it does not seem to affect the signal any.

The connectors in this kit did not work with the quad shield cable I own, plus the stripper is unlike any other I've seen, it does *not* strip both sections in one pass as other tools do, making the user guestimate the proper length (1/4\\") for each section - annoying.Also, the instructions fail to mention that you must remove the outer layer of foil and fold back the two layers of braiding for quad cables.

The kit overall works very well.The cutter does its job.The stripper, unlike many others, requires 2 steps. First you strip off a quarter inch to the center wire. Next you strip off a quarter inch of just the outer cover.The compression tool does its job and has a good feel to it--it seems to be well made. From what I've read, it also works with Thomas & Betts' (T&B;) Snap-N-Seal connectors. From experience, it works with PPC EX6XL connectors.The supplied connectors have a nice polished surface. They look better than PPC EX6XL connectors.No flaring tool is provided, but this would be nice to avoid having to spread the braided shield with your fingers. Depending on the cable, this can be a bit prickly. I had no problem with the Belden 1694a cable though.[...][...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"This tool did not work for me","review":"I am unhappy with this tool kit. The stripper is cheap plastic with a little blade. The crimp tool tends to just push out the cable from the connector instead of actually crimping anything. I did finally get one on but after a month the tv started looking fuzzy. I went to wiggle the wire and it came right out of the connector.

So far, regardless of connector brand, 100% success. A personal observation, heed the instructions that discourage turning the stripper more than one revolution, more is not better, it is possible to nick the center conductor and/or shield braid if you get aggressive.One more suggestion, for any connections that will be exposed to moisture, use a quality dielectric grease to seal the connector.

The problem seems to be that due to the thickness of the layers of shielding and the black outer insulation on the rg-6 quad cable I am trying to use (impact acoustincs) will not fit into the small collar on these connectors. I would need another tool just to get the connectors seated all the way on the coax. Something that would grip the coax close to the connector and then would jam the connector and the coax together. Once this was accomplished, then this crimper could be used to secure it on the cable.

I used it maybe 3 to 5 times a week to make what amounts to an egg sandwich like at McDs. The size is perfect and the first couple weeks were great...the egg never stuck and I used EVOO Pam. The sandwiches were great and I thought I'd finally found my pan. I use a very small rubber coated spatula which is perfect. Well, after the 2nd week the sticking started and it's now gotten to the point that it sticks all the time no matter what I do to protect against it. So, the pan has a life of roughly 2 weeks of non-stick use and about a month and a half of sticky use until you just can't take it anymore.Since the pan was roughly $6 I just bought another today to see if the experience repeats itself. Overall, I can't recommend it even with the re-design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but kind of useless.","review":"So I got this pan as a present. It's cute as a button and is made of solid materials. First the pros. It's not top of the line in terms of non-stick, but with a little butter it's pretty good. It heats evenly despite its size and mostly works. OK now the bad. The handle weighs more than the pan so it won't sit flat all the time. You have to wedge it and mess with it a LOT. Also, it's too small to fit a full size spatula in, so unless you have a mini one (like for pastries) don't count on flipping your egg. Now the worst part, the handle is ceramic, a great conductor of heat. Meaning you will burn yourself if you touch the handle without a glove. Do yourself a favor, spend a bit a more and get a good non-stick frying pan. This thing is now a cute Kitchen wall hanging for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small and awkward","review":"While cute, this little pan is difficult to use. There's no room to use a spatula, so you'd better like the eggs cooked through - you can't flip for over easy, and the egg white is too deep to do sunny-side up. Also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip, so you have to use a potholder.

The second half of the problem comes from the added weight caused by the addition of this decoration which makes this pan unstable and prone to tipping.

If you're looking to do table top set-ups with these lights, just as the other reviewer says, there are other, superior options, so don't bother.But if you buy the stands for them (a must!) they make great, simple lights for shooting indoor video. Things like interviews, or simple presentations, or low budget movies. They give off a good soft light, very little heat, and you can get daylight temperature bulbs to match the sunlight. So for indie filmmakers, or poor videographers shooting interviews who need something that isn't complete garbage, you could really get your money's worth. The only drawbacks here are the relatively low light output (though acceptable for most video), and they aren't conducive to repeated set-ups and tear downs - these aren't Arri HMI lights here that can take decades of abuse.

Over and over and over and over and over again the author claims that through his program 'Brain Respiration' one may become truly enlightened.

The eastern traditions note that this phenomena is reflected by the energy called \\"Ki\\" and is the common bond directly connecting body, mind and spirit. In Healing Society: A Prescription For Global Enlightenment, Seung Heun Lee reveals how we can draw upon this energy to strengthen our spiritual bodies, actually experience a direct connection to ultimate oneness down to the center of our very being. Seung Heun Lee clearly explains how this \\"noble enlightenment\\" is meant for everyone, and that by getting into contact with this sense of oneness men and women can illuminate the world and secure their children's future in a transformed world. Healing Society is a very highly recommended addition to Eastern tradition, spirituality, metaphysics, and self-help reading lists and reference collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same thing happened to me!","review":"I read A. Bailey's review, and the exact same thing happened to me! I love the product, but was completely surprised with the quick mechanical disfunctionings from such a reputable company. Perhaps it is not a Homedics issue, but a vendor issue. Is it possible the vendor knew he/she was selling a defective product? It is sad that we (A. Bailey & I) have to pay for shipping and repair on an item that we thought was new. Hopefully Amazon will take these reviews into consideration and come up with better ways to insure their vendors are truly reputable.

Mine as others have said was also purchased at Costco (San Diego) and stopped working after one day. Best massage chair ever (for one day). Wouldn't even power up after four or five uses.

It has brought great relief. It definitely has lots of power, and some days the massage starts out more painful than relaxing as the massager works on those painful spots. It finally does the trick if I am able to take the initial pain. Since I am short (4'11\\"), the massager hits my upper shoulder area, and it feels awesome. I could not believe a cushion with knobs would produce so much force, but it does. It was definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORGASM FOR YOUR BACK","review":"I GOT THIS ON SALE FOR A LITTLE MORE THAN $100. IT WAS WORTH IT! IT GIVES A GOOD DEEP STRONG BACK RUB.

I had tried the SBM-200 model in a store and loved it but when I heard the 300 version provided spot and width controls I thought that would be the better gift. Of the 7 times that the cushion was used since Christmas (two days), it was a hit. As my mother said, the best Christmas gift. But then the machine all of sudden had a mind of its own and shut down completely. It only allowed for the demo afterwards. When calling Homedics they said that this was highly unusual but based on the responses on this web-site I find that doubtful. Although my parents would like a replacement model, I don't think that would make the most sense, unfortunately. Until Homedics works out the kinks in this model I think we're going to stick with the SBM-200."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the Knot Queen","review":"Well, you either love it or you hate it.

This one's from the Discovery Channel store, but it's the same model as the SBM-300. I agree with all the other reviews. It feels great when it works. However, the first one broke after maybe 30 minutes of total use. The power button didn't work. I returned it for another one, and this one lasted maybe 20 minutes longer.

However, the device failed to work completely after being on for only about 30 minutes. The power light started to blink (which the manual indicates means the device is trying to turn off) and has not worked since. We tried letting it blink for 10-15 mintes, unplugged the unit from the power source (AC) for several hours and plugged it back in again, all to no avail. Turning to the homedic.com website provided no help whatsover as it only offered an online version of the owner manual. The unit will be retuned to the store this week for a refund.

Bummer to say the least. For the price, you'd think that Homedics would have that part covered for replacement. I got it for Christmas and it was a month or two before I even got around to trying it.

When I arrived at the store they had it on display, but I was a bit stumped because when I powered on the unit, it made a loud banging noise (I figured it was over used since it was on display). What do you know, one of my cushions did the exact same thing, remote wouldn't respond to anything, rollers won't go up or down. I'm exchanging it today and hopefully it will work as well.If you read all of these reviews to the very end, you will see tons of problems with this cushion's last year model (end of 2005-beginning of 2006).

My back has become increasingly troublesome, and I've been treating the sore spots with portable heat pads. Heat helps a lot! This is one feature that I WISH this massaging cushion had -- heat with movement would be perfect.I love the kneading action, though, even if it is a little rough at times. Mainly, the rough spots just indicate to me where I am holding tension and, as I work through the pain, my back, shoulders and neck no longer feel creaky. My posture seems to be improving as I've become more conscious of how I sit and stand. The rolling action doesn't do much for me -- seems a little weak. I can't seem to position myself so that it has some purpose.I'm still experimenting with all the possibilities and what works best for me.

This isn't quite as powerful as the dedicated massage chairs I've tried; however, it's still pretty nice. I find the shiatsu mode to be better/more effective than the rolling mode. It would also be great if the rollers were able to go higher (they go a bit above my shoulder blades). I don't really care for the vibrating seat cushion so I keep that turned off. You do need a larger seat to put this massager on as the cushions do take up a fair bit of space on the chair...something to keep in mind.I put this on my wish list just based on the reviews here. I'd say this unit is definitely worth the $120!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This 300 model is it!

Once I had them both apart I discovered hard greasy crud in the original. I cleaned & lubed the original & it works like a charm. So $101 spent on this & its garbage. I might as well went to the strip club with that money!Also the bracket was bent 90 degrees from where I needed it & they failed to drill out one of the mounting holes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of the era.","review":"This cd falls into the category 'if you only have one'; that is, if you only have one non-Ellington big band cd from the late 20s and early 30s, it would be difficult to find a better one this this. Redman more or less invented big band arrangements, so these are outstanding. The bands are outstanding, including those of F. Henderson, Armstrong, McKinney's Cotton Pickers and Redman's own band. Only the last 3 or 4 (of 25) tunes from the 2nd half of the 30s are a bit of a letdown but that's a small complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The prophets speak to our time","review":"THE PROPHETS ON MAIN STREET offers a brief summary of the major prophets of the Hebrew Bible and then writes what the author thinks each of them might say to America in our time. I found the book to be a good way to learn the major insights of these prophets, as well as a surprisingly relevant statement as to what they would say to our day.My favorite was the discussion of the book of Isaiah (which Corbett divides into two sections), but the most relevant book was Amos, who speaks directly to the materialism and financial greed of our day. Even though the book was written over 30 years ago, most of it is relevant.It is significant that an endorsement of the book was made by the late senator, Hubert H. Humphrey. I strongly endores the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Addition to My Favorites List","review":"I have recently discovered this work and how delighted I am that I did!

Toure is ANOTHER African-American writer who seems ill at ease with being an African-American; so he delves in the enormous bucket of Black Cultural Stereotypes to people his lackluster stories, all in the name of being hip. From fried chicken to [lusty] preachers to athletics, there is no Black cliche beneath Toure and his word processor. The entire book read as if it were written by a really dorky guy looking at a cool party through a window. He wasn't that good when he wrote for Rolling Stone, and he is even worse here. Whomever decided to give him his book deal needs to recoup their advance and have him try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touré's Tour de Force","review":"I bought this book for the story \\"Solomon's Big Day\\" which I heard read on NPR and was totally taken with and stayed in my car to hear the end of. The story is a great description of a young boy's creative spirit and his close call with fame. Though clearly fiction, it's not that far off from what I imagine to be reality.Then, there's the rest of the book and all the other captivating stories! Touré's ability to create a mood and draw me in is like going on a series of mini-vacations to other worlds. I'm so pleased to know of his existence and will track his future work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I read the first two stories in the bookstore \\"Steviewondermobile\\" and the second one about the Chruch of Kentucky Fried Souls and I thought they were fun and hilarious and refreshingly colorful. So I bought the book but the rest of them were no where near as good and many times bordered on boring. I wanted to like this book because I was laughing so hard at the Kentucky Fried Souls, but it was like he repeated the same ideas over and over again in increasingly less interesting ways. THis book did however sell out in my bookstore and I think its because the cover art is as entertaining as the Kentucky Fried Souls story. Is that story, however funny or colorful, worth the price of the book? Not really."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the sequel will be better...","review":"Now I'm not really a fan of magic realism. In fact, every other book I've tried to read in the genre I've never finished. This collection was actually not so bad. The stories take place in Soul City, a urban black utopia of sorts. Some of the stories left me a bit bored, but others were good. I got the chance to meet Toure and he read some of the stories that will be in his next book which centers around more residents of Soul City. I'll be sure to pick it up because it seems like he is only maturing as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Penned","review":"WRITING THE MODERN MYSTERY has been treading the boards since 1986.

What a marvelous tribute to the talent of Jeremy Brett. Each episode brings Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to the screen with precision and flare.

I received only 6 DVDs, under a box that labeled \\"Volume 1\\". Supposedly there's volume 2 somewhere that is not available on this site. For those who want the entire collection from this purchase, you should be advised that the description for this product is misleading. It comes with only 6 DVDs, and NOT the complete collection of the series. I would have given it a minus star for the hassle this purchase brought me, in calling customer service all the way from Thailand, and in the effort to pack and return the merchandise.

I LOVE AMAZON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremy Brett - The One and the Only Sherlock Holmes","review":"I have been dieing to acquire this set of DVDs for long. I truly enjoyed Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes over TV. I have been ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes and Jeremy Brett brought him to life like no one else before and no one shall after also. We truly miss him very much and would have enjoyed more of him than only 41 episodes! Many of the fans say the same words of him so I shall not repeat what has been already about him.My dream of possessing this collection came true when I actually received my order. I was so happy to watch it again on my PC. A collection for Sherlock Holmes fan would be incomplete without this fantastic recreation of Sherlock Holmes by Jeremy Brett !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Collector's Item","review":"This collection is a must for every fan of Sherlock Holmes. Jeremy Brett was the greatest portrayer of Sherlock Holmes of the twentieth century, perhaps of any century,and the Granada series captured the Victorian era with remarkable attention to detail. The episodes, although abridgments of the original stories, were written with great skill. I think Conan Doyle would have been proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brett is the definitive Holmes","review":"There are certain actors when they bring a character to life, bring the character as written to life. David Suchet is Poirot, Patrick Tull the definitive reader of the Aubrey/Maturin series by O'brian and Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock Holmes as written by Doyle. The others are cartoons beside his portrayal. For anyone who is already a Holmes fan or for someone who is wondering what all the hullabaloo is about, this is the dvd set for you. There are reasons classics are classics as written and Brett will show you why Holmes fascinates after all the years he has been before the public. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY FAR BEYOND THE RECENT COMICBOOK INTERPRETATION","review":"Jeremy Brett was the quintessential Sherlock Holmes, having studied both Doyle, and the writer's most famous protagonist to the point of obsession, so that every gesture, and mannerism radiated with authenticity, and it hardly hurt that his diction was nearly flawless. Everything about this series was first-rate, from production values, the music, and, of course, the truest portrayal of Watson ( by both David Burke, and later Edward Hardwicke ), to the sets themselves. Any fan of the literary version of Sherlock Holmes will be impressed by the Granada television series. This Holmes leaves all others in the dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: these are not accurate transfers.","review":"There is a major problem with DVD's like these,the original Granada tapes were mastered and shot in England in the PAL format for English tv- which runs at 25 frames-per-second. BUT this box has been slowed down to the NTSC format of 24 frames-per-second and thus it is an inaccurate representation of Jeremy Brett's frenetic performance. Basically an extra minute is added every 24 minutes.I ordered my complete set from Amazon.co.uk in the original 25fps PAL format. Why have remastered picture and sound at the wrong speed??"},{"rating":"1","title":"set arrived with disc problems","review":"The item Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Granada Television Series (12 DVD) (Purchased on 11/06/2009)was received and upon playing the discs, I found that one disc was impossible to read and would not play at all and, another had problems with search mode and transitioning to the next episode. I complained to Amazon and they refunded a partial payment.

No other series of Sherlock Holmes mysteries has such consistency of the characters. Not to mention, Dr. Watson is at last portrayed as Conan Doyle intended. Each episode stands alone, but viewing them sequentially adds yet another dimension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sherlock Holmes Ever","review":"If you have read A.C. Doyle's Holmes, there is no way you should like J. Brett as Holmes. He is just awful.....the epitome of 80's acting (and that's not a compliment). But don't think he is the only shortcoming of this series.Ronald Howard...Basil Rathbone....actors who portrayed Holmes well. Do yourself a favor and forget the Granada Series was ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Holmes!","review":"I watched this series when it began in the 1980s.

Would highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremy Brett rules as Sherlock Holmes!","review":"Over the years I have been watching the Granada series on Sherlock Holmes and enjoyed every minute. I have seen many different portrayals of Holmes on the media, but Jeremy Brett is THE Sherlock Holmes for me. His animated performances are intriguing and brilliant. The production values are also quite good. The two Watsons David Burke and Edward Hardwicke complemented Mr. Brett's performance quite well. The series portayed Holmes as a brilliant driven man including his dabling in the '10% solution' and is occasional depressive episodes. I would highly recommend this series to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Sherlock","review":"This is my second purchase of Sherlock Holmes : The Complete television series.

Loved them, but did notice that the video & audio weren't the best. Well, I bought this set, and started watching it tonight. What a big difference in quality. The video is superb, and the audio is crisp & clean. I have a 50\\" LCD HD flat screen TV, with an Onkyo sound system. Great picture and sound with this combo.

The Granada series is a collector item and I recommend it to Conan Doyle fans everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Adaptions True to the Conan-Doyle Canon","review":"If you're at all a Sherlock Holmes fan, I can't recommend this set highly enough. Considered the definitive rendition of the Conan-Doyle stories, the episodes are well-written, atmospheric, and well-acted. All of the stories were to be produced, but Jeremy Brett's unfortunate death ended the series early. Brett is practically perfect as Holmes, and the two actors playing Watson (David Burke (seasons 1 and 2) and Edward Hardwicke (remainder) are excellent characterizations. The transfer to DVD is very good. I've watched every episode since receiving the set. These stories never fail to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremy Brett is the best Sherlock of them all","review":"He truly captures the spirit of Sherlock Holmes and even looks the part better than anyone else I've seen portray Sherlock.

I have seen a few of these mysteries on U.S. public television, and they have generally been very good. However, I bought this as a gift for my wife, who has seen many more of these mysteries than I have and is a big fan of Sherlock Holmes in general. This gift seemed to please her immensely... and when she is happy, I am allowed to be happy, too... and I generally live in less physical danger for a little while.

The bottom plate is a bit larger and more square than I expected but whatever. Warning: This is about to be one of those annoying low rating reviews that has nothing to do with the product but everything to do with the packaging. OH MY GOD, after the other reviews here that announced the broken condition of the product, this company STILL sends poorly packaged merchandise?! Are you kidding me? Was it so foolish of me to take the chance that they could be bothered to read all of four reviews and see that their packaging is horrible? *Sigh.* Sadly, the answer to that question is \\"Yes.\\" So, the plate was broken cleanly in two pieces, diagonally from one corner clear to the other one.

Every presiding officer should have a copy available, and every member of a deliberative body should take some time to read up on it. Yes, it's thick, but there's a good reason for that--it covers everything. I have yet to have a question that this book could not answer definitively for me. Don't settle for a \\"watered down\\" verson of this book as your reference. Beginners probably shouldn't start with this book, but after having a basic introduction they should dive in head first. Even if you can't use it fast enough to raise a Point of Order at a meeting, use it after meetings to review things that seemed a little fishy or roughed over. You can then go into the next meeting sure that you know how to handle the situtation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy and Stylish","review":"The sandal is very comfortable.

That idea could acctully have made this a great game but the thing I realy hated is that this game is like the hardest game ever. If you die three times your done for. Also the enimies are way too hard. Being able to use magic was preaty cool though and unlike the first zelda game you can see people walk through the towns instead of standing in one spot which was preaty facinating back than. I wouldnt recomend buying this game but if you do see it for like a dollar or two than go check it out.

I'd have to say this is by far the worse of the 2.Unlike the Zombie Survival Guide, which actually reads like a real factual book, this one is just lacking. I realise its a parody book, but there wasn't a huge amount of detail or humor involved. Maybe it's aimed at a younger age group or possibly someone with a minimal knowledge of super heroes and comics, I don't know, but as an adult who was an avid comic book reader in my younger years it failed to make the grade. It just didn't quite capture me, I read it on and off over a couple of weeks and don't feel the urge to read the last few chapters.Maybe if it was sanctioned by Marvel or DC comics giving it more liscence to refer to more specific characters it would have been a better nostalgia peice, in its current form it reads like a weak joke stretched way too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was kinda disappointed with this manual. I had great expectations after reading the Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks, and was hoping for more of the same, but this book was a joke.

I was totally shocked to find that it actually was a made for tv drama.I find it sacriligious to base a romantic drama on what was one of the most notorious German POW camps, as to why they did this, begggars belief,when the actual true life adventures of life in Colditz, are far more interesting.As to the portrayal of the Germans brutal treatment of the prisoners is a total fabrication, it was quite the contrary.The three books written by the famous Colditz escapee Pat Reid are well worth getting, if anyone is actaully inetersetd in the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5","review":"Not that good. The acting was good with a host of stars in the early part of their career, but the storyline of repeated escape attempts was kind of silly. Basically, the prisoners were given ample room to walk around the castle, do what they want, and attempt to escape. The only punishment to scare them from trying was a month in the hole. Was this a real story? I find it hard to believe a prison designed specifically for the \\"best escape artists\\" would give their prisoners so much freedom.

The market for this movie is most likely to be WWII veterans, most of whom are now hard of hearing, and there are no subtitles! And turning up the volume didn't help because the accents are incomprehensible to Americans. Britain is so small that I suppose viewers there on the \\"telly\\" had no trouble understanding the \\"quaint\\" dialects of the actors because these are heard on the streets of London everyday, but not so in the US.

It's powerful and disturbing at the same time. Great characters, and they get you right where you live. You have no choice to feel their honesty here.

That is a personal preference, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Gem!","review":"This is a wonderful collection.I almost didn't even buy this CD haunted by shades of Don Ho.I am so glad that I did, this is a postcard of an idealised Hawaii, a pre Pearl Harbor paradise.

As a woman, this book was also offensive due to the authors advocacy of hooking up with a guy while traveling, then using him to leach free lodging, meals and entertainment. There is also a theme of alcohol use as an excuse for her poor decision-making.If you enjoy stories about vacation romances, this book may be appealing. But if you are seeking a resource as a woman traveling alone, please don't waste your money or indeed the 2 hours needed to breeze through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is a memoir, not serious travel advice for women traveling alone.

My intention was to attempt to understand the Muslim religion as it truly is, without any politically-correct \\"spin\\" put on the text.

He liked the looks of the CD, he pops it into the CD player and what does he get? Some incredibly good prog. metal. What a surprise for him. Naturally, I get the CD by default, but what a class act this band is.The vocals and guitars are harmonised wonderfully and there is some great heavy interludes that remind me of Dream Evil's earlier days. The solos are to the point and well-executed.Of course, like coffee or licorice, progressive/power metal is an aquired taste and is therefore not for everyone, but if you are a big fan of Symphony X only without the over-abundance of keyboards, this band is for you and I recommend you purchase this CD as soon as you can.

Ironically, when they do, they possibly seem to get overdone within the process. That happened to be the case with Mariah Carey & Boyz II Men, with their duet, or should I say quintet performance on One Sweet Day. The song is a good one at first, but definitely gets to become quite a sleeper. The 5 were very big songs at the time, but they seem like they're all trying to out do each other, and not really sing to their heart and the content.

I am just not happy with the cookbook although I was attracted to it by it name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not call it Jack Daniel's Boarding House","review":"I love Southern cooking but am disgusted by this book. They make mention that Miss Mary Bobo did not allow spirits across her doorway, yet the Jack Daniel's company decided to disregard how the woman was. They even made a point in saying that on dish every meal has Jack Daniels in it. Well the joke is on them, there are several recipes that I wanted to try but they have Jack Daniel's in it. I am just going to leave it out. If you are going to do a cookbook about a boarding house that has been around for generations leave the recipes alone. I borrowed the book from the library to see if I liked it before I bought it. It has saved me some money because I am taking the recipes I want and not wasting my money on the book. It has also saved me from wanting to visit the area since Jack Daniels must own the city of Lynchburg by now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Index Case is THE Deserver","review":"Regardless of what bands are your favorites, Index Case will rise above them.

The melodic fusion of clear supportive screaming in harmony with, outstanding lyrics, supreme unique vocals, and excellent music composition competes with the best of the best. Every song is its own artwork with intense alternate sounds and smooth interlacing compositions, bringing an album to the table that never gets old. Sadly, this cd won't get the recognition it deserves. Initially, I didn't care much for this cd though now they are my favorite band, exceeding bands such as Chevelle, Taproot, Adema,etc....I enjoyed this cd so much I have received Glass, their pre-record label cd, and I will own any more that come.

Most other books I looked at on Salem revolved soleley around the Witch Trials, or the House of the Seven Gables, or both--this book seemed to cover data from almost all \\"walks of life,\\" and because each chapter was penned or edited by a different author, there is variety in the ways that the information is presented as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salem: Place, Myth, and Memory","review":"I took Dane Morrison's graduate Historiography class 10 years ago. He taught me that one can learn more about an historian (Morrison etal) than about history (Salem) when reading history. The chapter about Salem's religious history seems to have been written by a Harvard Divinity School Pagan; half the chapter is about Laurie Cabot. The chapter about the House of Seven Gables tells us nothing of value or interest. I guess she didnt like what she read in my term paper about the House; the reason I didnt get a good grade in her Archeology class. Shultz' chapter on Hawthorne excellent.

This movie would have been a great opportunity for a new actress to debut. I could not believe \\"Sally Fields\\" in this role. Her past films affected me while watching this movie. A new actress might have been willing to put more realism into the character than a well known actress, afraid to show any skin. This is a prostitute. To be a good film requires enough realism to convince us. Other recent movies have fallen short of greatness because of this same short coming, lack of realistic portrayal of the character, thus the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad headphones","review":"These headphones are not very good at all.

Unfortunately, the book doesn't help with any of that.The book isn't organized so as to be useful as a reference, and it doesn't really offer much (if any) help on how to get started. Instead the book spends most of its space on discussions on advanced topics (branching, merging, automated builds, and so forth).

Finally, he is telling his full story, with the help of fellow ICF member Cass Pennant.Gardner's story is pretty simple and he doesn't dwell much on childhood, but spends most of the time getting right to the 'goods', as it is. He details a number of the encounters that he was involved in, but avoids the trap of bragging. He repeatedly mentions his honor, and from what you can gather reading the accounts, I think he really does act honorably.The book itself is a very quick read at only 240 pages or so, and with a moderate-sized print you can go through it in no time. Certainly worth a look if you've got any knowledge of the terrace wars of the 70's and 80's. Because for those that are, you have heard of Bill Gardner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man of honour","review":"The book is a GREAT read.I have many WHU friends - some of whom are top flight.Gardner's writting is very self-effacing.He brings to life the banter. Banter that can only be heard down Millwall or West Ham and maybe the Orient. A unique humour. Scousers and Mancs don't have it. The north London clubs don't possess it. The west London clubs wouldn't understand it.There's a sibling rivalry between WHU and MFC, whether you're from Bethnal Green or Bermondsey - maybe it's a docks thing? Hard times are always coupled with humour.Football violence of the late 60s. 70s and 80s can never be replicated, because of how stadiums are built now and security and the onus of bad behavier being ultimately with the club.This is a social history book. A good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible keyboard! Don't waste your money.","review":"Purchased this keyboard and mouse at a local Mac Store. The keyboard was terrible. Space bar didn't work, did work, didn't work. \\"R\\" and \\"Enter\\" worked intermittently. Keyboard was so unreliable that we were locked out of our online bank access because we kept typing in the wrong password because of the keyboard. Had to wait until the next day to call and get the online access unfrozen.Mouse was okay, stiffer than the Kensington wired mouse that we were used to.Took the set back to the store for a refund after two days of trying to adapt to the keyboard.

First I put foam on the battery door to keep the connections and that seemed to work for a while but eventually the problems kept coming back and out to the trash it went.

About a week ago the wireless connection started to short out. The keyboard would only work in certain places and the mouse was VERY finicky. I tried changing out the batteries and the USB port it was plugged into, but still the same problem. The design of the USB receiver leaves something to be desired, with the end sticking out so far on that thin piece, leaves room for it to break if bumped. (that is what happened as well.)

I have a problem with some stiffness in my finger because of typing to hard on traditional keyboards, so this thing was perfect for me. I think I actually type faster on this thing. Great tactile feel.As for the mouse, it doesn't really seem like a 1000dpi mouse, and the low profile takes some getting use to. It's a little strange, but I'm sure after a couple of months it should be fine. I just wish it was a little more precise.So, generally, very pleased with the product. The only other complaint about it is that the dongle has to be really close to the keyboard and mouse. So, don't pick this thing up if you're planning on using it more than 15 inches away from the dongle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not quite ready for everybody's Vista","review":"The keyboard worked great. But the mouse never worked on our Compaq Presario desktop running Vista. Vista tried locating a driver for it, but wasn't able to find one. Strangely, we tried it on a Toshiba laptop, and both mouse and keyboard worked just fine. So, your mileage may vary. We had zero success with Kensington's support (they simply told us that the MouseWorks software couldn't be used on Vista, but that wasn't the issue we were having).Thankfully, Amazon makes it easy to return products, so back it went, and we're now waiting for a separate mouse and keyboard to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably bad range - 1 meter/3 feet max in open air","review":"The range on this product is a bad joke.Trying to use this product with an HTPC. The mouse is incapable of receiving or broadcasting through the chassis even. In other words it won't move if the dongle is plugged in the back and the mouse is right in front. To say nothing of sitting on the couch 6 feet away of course. The keyboard seems to be able to be understood through the chassis of the computer but move 6 inches further away and forget it.When I plug the dongle into a female USB cable and bring it to the coffee table, I can measure its actual range in open air, with no obstructions.

Very sharp, nice Bokeh, great colors. And of course all the obvious advantages that you can see from the spec: f/2.8 (good for low light and for shallow DOF), SSM (very fast focus).Lately I learned about another advantage - you look professional when you carry this lens... I walked around in parades and concerts and people were happy to pose for me... Then they asked where it is going to be published... It was the first time that I could get shots of people without being afraid that they will break my camera.However, the professional look can sometimes be disadvantage, and in general this lens attracts lots of attention. It is also big and heavy. And expensive.Bottom line - I really love this lens and it produced many pictures that I couldn't get with other lenses (in terms of sharpness, colors and Bokeh). However, you should give it some time in order to get used to it and learn all the advantages (and disadvantages) of this lens.

His voice is an absolute joy to listen to, and I only gave this 4 stars because I know he recorded \\"Rose of Tralee,\\" and it's not here. That would have pushed this CD over the top.

Maybe it's because this album features more of a rock beat and synths, compared to her quieter more introspective efforts from before. But that is not to take away from this album. It is still a very good piece of work, at times excellent. And it will still please Jann's fans. She is an exceptional singer/songwriter/musician. The booklet too is exceptional. 36 pages long and packed with lovely photos and all the lyrics. I wish all cds came with such a nice booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jann Arden - Best Kept Secret","review":"If you enjoy the lyrics of Lucinda Williams, the music of Sarah McLachlan, or you're more the Nanci Griffith, Mary Chapin Carpenter, or Dar Williams type, you must listen to this CD.

Her number 10 track would probably be banned from some airplay like Lucinda Williams' song \\"Right in Time\\" << not sure of the title. Anyway, if you're not shocked by sassy \\"touch myself\\" type tunes with attitude, track 10 is for you. If you're looking for introspective, break-up, or current issue type songs, there's something on this CD for you.

My favourite song is \\"Taste of This\\". This song makes me feel so romantic, and in love, with life. Very sexy song. Very sensual. Every song on this cd is great. You will feel happy, sad, flirtatious. It is a very therapeutic cd. Buy it, you will not be disappointed. I have been playing it everynight, since I bought it. I take it in the car with me when I go out. The songs are very addictive. Thank you Jann Arden for this wonderful cd. And thank you for your past cd's, which I still listen too.

Also, you don't get much range of where you want to aim and where it lands is crazy - you can't tell most the time if you're in the rough or what.

It was probably thrown together at the last minute. I purchased this today, finished it an hour ago, and I'm still frustrated with it. However, I purchased the \\"First 280 years of Monty Python\\" book, and really like it so far. \\"The Pythons\\" is also good, but is kind of all over the place, but \\"280 years\\" is mainly focused on the television show.

I love the fact that it's from whole foods because basically I believe that's where it's at anyway---not in a whole litany of supplements. These are not super hyped-up with huge doses that overwhelm the body and I've never had any customer complain that they didn't agree with their tummy.

Wife was very happy that she didn't have to hold the wallcabinent on her head, while i did the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very awkward for ceilings, great for cabinets","review":"Purchased this to hang drywall on ceilings as advertised. The cleats are rudimentary and the 400lb capacity Jak is way overkill for a sheet of drywall. The real problem is lifting one edge of drywall over your head to a height of 8' (bending, cracking, difficult to position in tight spots), inserting the edge under the cleats, reaching for the T-Jak and adjusting the sliding nut to a height that will support the other edge of drywall. The instructions are completely inadequate - no tips or hints on making this awkward process safer or easier. Three sheets came crashing down around me before I could get them positioned.The T-Jak is just great for hanging cabinets. The adjusting nut means you can dial in cabinet height exactly. If you hang cabinets often, this is the tool.I'm a home repair professional. If I had to do it again, I would probably purchase the 3rd Hand as a more versatile addition to my business."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Jak TJ-104D Drywall Kit","review":"This is a handy product, excellent for installing cabinets and dry wall ... infact I use it as a third hand to assist with the installation of Crown Molding and shelves.

The rest of the score is mostly a constant rambling of music so simular to Tan Dun's Crouching Tiger I found it ruined the movie for me. The main cello theme is huanting and sad like the movie. The price of this disc is even sadder. Go for Crouching Tiger or The Last Samurai by Hans Zimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but badly done","review":"The idea for this book is good but the book was badly done. Unexpected style is something that intrigues me, but that's not what this book actually is. The book is pretty dated in the way it is done because it's all about one unknown designer's \\"take\\" on decorating. No one today wants to be dictated to or to just copy what another person has done. So this book misses the mark by several miles. If you want a decorating book that helps you create your own style, this is not it. Don't buy this. It seems more like a book about this designer's own ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big waste of my money","review":"I've never heard of this author, but I bought the book anyway, which was my mistake.

A lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Design","review":"I can't believe what a strong emotional effect these Kelly Wearstler interior designs have on me--some I love, some give me the creeps, but they all have such wit and power that I find myself looking at this book again and again--and I'm a shabby chic kind of gal. Of course it's disturbing that she features herself in so many of the photographs but I think she's a genius. Most design books have pictures of rooms are nice, or cozy, or calm. These are rooms are glamorous, smart, and sexy.Since I bought this book I've seen Wearstler's influence spreading everywhere. I just wish I could afford her to decorate my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"More bad design from LA -- I live here, so it's personal -- via yet another over-styled, over-hyped -- well, whatever they're being called (this month).Bottom line: Hicks did it already.

Also, it's littered with photos of Kelly, nearly 20 to be exact. Are they all of her working in her surroundings? No, they are her, posed like a prop in a movie set, sitting at the beach or gazing at antiques on her fabulous travels. What? They do nothing to reinforce her work, it seems only to prove how fabulous she is. Her designs are quite beautiful and sumptuous, but reading about 'me' and 'my' and 'I' gets tiring. Pretty to look at, I suppose good reading material if you can't fall asleep. I kinda wish I had bought this book used instead of paying full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, puhleeze","review":"If you want decorating ideas, do not buy this book. If you want to see a puff piece about the author and too many pictures of her, then this is for you. I have not heard of this author, and I don't care to know anything about her.

I could not find anything about this story to relate to, or connect with... at all. The plot is not very interesting. The humor is NOT very funny. I never laughed out loud once. The actors are great actors, but this film did not really show anything about their abilities. I felt like it was a thrown together movie, with a small budget that just gave these actors an opportunity to work together. Some speaking segments were cliche - I didn't know movies still had \\"Step on it!\\" in them. It's very clean however except for one blurry video image. The ending was better than expected, but I was not expecting much.Glad some people enjoyed this film. I'm not trusting Amazon reviews anymore though. The reviews here were high, but my experience with the movie was low."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST WASN'T FUNNY","review":"You would think with all these stars this would be a great movie. It wasn't. The movie moved very slow. The main characters outside of Macy were dull for a comedy. The idea was clever, but the dialogue was not what I would expect from a real comedy. I didn't have any laugh out loud moments for this \\"madcap comedy.\\" Three security guards are each in love with one particular piece of art. The museum is going to move the pieces so they decide to make fakes and substitute them for the real pieces. What was supposed to be \\"madcap\\" I assume, were the errors they made in swapping the paintings. It too was slow.

Honestly, my fiancee and I just bought it at a closing Hollywood Video for $1.49. It was cheap. But best of all, it was starring Morgan Freeman, Christopher Walken, and William H. Macy, three fantastic actors. But throughout the entire film, the chemistry between these actors was non-existent. The humor was very dull and Christopher Walken, no matter how hard he tried, couldn't get me to be interested in his paintings.

This is a must buy CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeniable musical perfection!","review":"Having been a fan of the Bacon Brothers for four years, I can honestly say that this CD is the most diverse and insightful of all of their music. There is something for all tastes- slow, fast, comical, and serious. In this CD, the listener is able to experience new levels of writing and arranging for this group. Michael's orchestration skills add greater fullness to the accompaniments, and the use of strings and a piano in Kevin's heart-felt \\"She is the Heart\\" is breath-taking. The entire band has added their own signatures to the sounds of each track, and the result is a professional, polished, and fresh sound. It is obvious that these guys know how to write from their souls, but they aren't afraid to kick back with a lighter side, as well. I highly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Different","review":"This third Bacon Brothers CD is a little different from the first two, a little more serious. It's great! I play it often, and hope they keep writing and recording. Also hope they play in Colorado Springs sometime next year. I'll be there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Actor? Love the Music.","review":"Can't Complain continues in the storytelling genre of the Bacon Brother's earlier works. From the rocking \\"I'm So Glad I'm Not Married\\" to the melodic \\"She is the Heart\\", Michael & Kevin's voices resonate with feeling. That raspiness of Kevin's vocals, coupled with the smoothness of Michael's vocals, is enough to make a girl swoon.While the lyrics of the songs on this CD don't seem as clever as on previous Bacon recordings, some of the tunes are quite catchy. After listening to the CD only 3 or 4 times, you'll find yourself humming the chorus of \\"Baby Steps\\" in your morning shower. While you're soaping up, picture Kevin just stepping out of his shower in the cinematic experience \\"Wild Things\\". Hmmmm. Nice, huh. But I digress...As on Forosoco and Getting There, the Bacon Brother's previous two CD's, the tunes on Can't Complain grow on you. And, in this fan's opinion, it's a welcome parasite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Complain...Can't Go Wrong!!","review":"If you like rock, country rock, country, folk, soul The Bacon Bros. are the ticket. With Michael's sweet, sweet voice, reminiscent of James Taylor mixed with Jim Croce and Kevin's voice, similar but rough around the edges, they are the perfect blend when they harmonize. Their original songs are a nice relief from what you hear coming out of the radio today. I am willing to wager that once you buy one of their CDs you'll have to buy them all. FOROSCO and Getting There are equally good. I highly recommend all three!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality kitchen faucet","review":"Very attractive and high quality kitchen faucet.

Rich is a musician who can play several instruments. Scott is an award winning elementary school teacher. Dave is an architect who helped with the post Katrina rebuild.

The cord is detachable, which is nice if you want a longer one you can buy your own.As for the noise canceling function. if your not actually listening to anything, you can hear it. For me it kinda sounds like a pulsing hum. I sit 4 feet away from a wall mounted air conditioning unit. Even with it turned on, i can still hear the AC unit in the background, just not as much.

I was pleasantly surprised with the audio quality - no they don't rival $300 audiophile equipment - duh! But they do offer completely acceptable sound. On some recordings I found it necessary to cut the bass boost to prevent distortion, or modify other tone controls for best sound. My only criticsm was a slight rattle when walking - which turned out to be the battery - a small piece of foam fixed that. As for noise cancellation - again very adequate - I spend 2 hours a day in a commuter van - and these completely remove the tire roar, wind noise, and most other racket. I tried switching the noise cancelation on and off and the difference is night and day ! A wonderful pleasure to have something actually work well, as designed, and as advertised, at a reasonable price. Kudo's to Philips !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent noise cancellation; better fit and comfort","review":"The Noise cancellaton function is not as good as a Bose, but you get what you pay for.

Basically a whole plastic and cardboard package within another super heavy duty plastic and cardboard package. And...also included is this ugly zipup hard shell covered with fabric case for your headphones. Who keeps their cheap-o headphones in a case? There must be thousands of these in landfills everywhere.

The way the arms are constructed naturally leads to them breaking if you need to extend the phones and then significantly widen them for them to fit over your head.The steel band that goes over your head basically levers out the plastic casing that is supposed to hold it in and act as a brake on the phone extension.This is very disappointing since these phones are very comfortable and perform very well for the environment I want to use them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not work","review":"DOA.

Although battery life wasn't great, I have nothing to compare to. This is my first noise cancelling headphones. What I can't accept is that it only took 10 months for the noise cancelling to stop working (I can hear the ocean when its on!) and a couple of weeks later the left speaker's hinge gave up. It is hanging by the wires now.Now, I'm not a \\"heavy duty\\" user. The headphones rarely left my work cube in the past 10 months and I can't imagine what repeating strain they had to endure to fail so badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips Headphones","review":"After receiving my headphones, I was very pleased with how comfortable they were to wear. The noise canceling circuitry does a good job of reducing background noises within it's specified frequency range. However I found the earphones are somewhat lacking on their ability to play low frequency sounds (bass). They are very clear in the mid to high frequency ranges. Also the included headphone cord is kinda short so if intend to plug into your home stereo and kick back in the recliner you may have to move a little closer. I will be using these mainly for travel, with that said they are fairly compact and the included case is sturdy enough to protect the headphones.

I had bought these specifically for a long plane flight, and the noise-cancelling function made no difference re: the engine noise. Worse, when I plugged them into the in-flight entertainment unit, turning on the noise-cancelling function effectively muted the sound of the system! Turning it off, however, amplified the sound coming from it, so much so that I had the volume on minimum and still felt it was a bit too loud (good thing I wasn't watching an action flick). To top it all off, there was a malfunction with the battery operating the noise-cancelling function, so it would just turn off by itself because it couldn't detect the battery anymore. While the sound quality is good and it muffles some sound due to it's earpieces, this is no noise-cancelling headphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Noise?","review":"With other noise cancelling headphones I've had it just cancelled the outside noise i.e. a lawn mower but gave you full vol. if you wnated it.

The Sony model created an uncomfortable feeling of pressure on my eardrums. Noise was reduced, but the noise-canceling was uncomfortable for long periods and made me worry that it was going to damage my hearing.These Philips headphones do not create that sensation, and the noise-canceling works well enough. Unfortunately, I started getting a very high-pitched sound in the right-headphone today that varies in tone, especially if I tap on that side. It sort of sounds like the whine you get when tuning an AM radio. It seems to come and go, but it might just go beyond my range of hearing. If it continues, I'll try trading them in for a new pair to see if it's just a defective unit. So far it seems to only happen when connected to my iPod with the noise canceling turned on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Effective","review":"These headphones are really comfortable and block out much outside noise without even turning on noise cancellation.

All I can say is that it appears that most of the reviewers are either loyal followers of the authors and/or don't read much else. The writing is simply awful. Stilted dialog and unimaginative descriptive narrative abounds. There are missing words, awkward phrases and incomplete sentences througout.

I really, really liked the Zion Chronicles and the Zion Covenant series, all of which I read several times. I was looking forward to a new series, especially one that involves Moshe Sachar.

What a huge mistake. The oval design has several HUGE issues. First and foremost, the ice gets jammed between the side wall and brings the machine to a halt and container so you litterly have to crush the ice to even get it to work. Second, after you have gone to all the trouble to crush the ice small enough, the motor doesn't latch on well so on occassion it will come loose while it is running. Third, because of the oval design, it seems to lack adequate ice capacity to cool and freeze the ice cream efficiently. Our old ice creem maker can make two batches of ice cream in the time it took this piece of junk to make one. Not sure what rival engineers were thinking when they created this, but clearly their focus was NOT on making ice cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the headache","review":"I wish I could give it - stars.This is a piece of junk.

You need to sit with it and babysit, which was really frustrating. About 30 minutes into my batch, the motor started popping out of the outside slots and I needed to repack 3 times to get the ice cream to a semi-finished state. I used 4 lbs. of salt, which usually freezes cream in about 30 minutes. This tried and true recipe had no air whipped into it - It was hard as a rock.

Do yourself a huge favor if you're looking for a shift in courage and hope and get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book.","review":"I cannot put into words how bad this book was, and how the author should just stop writing all together. Do not buy this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really inspiring and practical read!","review":"I decided to read this book after I saw that the author had provided an endorsement for the wonderful 'Serendipity's Secret', a book I absolutely loved. 'Feel the Fear..' says many of the same things as 'Serendipity's Secret' about overcoming your fears using practical tools such as visualisation, affirmations and taking positive action but presents them in more of a traditional text book format rather than a fable format. However, overall a recommended read which helps you to re-programme the way you perceive fearful situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question reviews","review":"If you are reading one star reviews I recommend you look at the date on some of these as they appear to be a lot on or around april 27 2009. That seems highly unlikely, makes me question them. I only put one star because if you are reading the one star reviews like I was then you might read this one. I haven't read it yet, my friend highly recommended it so I started to read the reviews when I noticed the odd occurance. Seems like someone really hated this bood and entered many reviews or such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the Fear and do it anyway","review":"I love this book. It's a step by step journey to stop being blocked by fear and live the life you were meant to live. One of the most powerful points in the book for me was that everyone feels fear. When you walk into a situation that makes you uncomfortable don't assume that everyone else isn't afraid along with you. Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway is a call to change yourself and start living."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!!!","review":"I have read this book twice now...and every time i come up with something else to help my way of thinking. i use to be overly negative and i hated it...so when i got this book recommended by my doctor...i feel like i have taken a 180 and have recommended it to several friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for improving your life","review":"I am a clinical social worker and have recommended this book to countless clients. It is an excellent introduction to cognitive-behavioral techniques and is helpful in dealing with a wide range of issues, from a breakup of a relationship to a job change to general self-esteem improvement. I especially like the exercises that give the reader an opportunity to try out the theories and apply them to everyday life. Some of her phrases (like \\"chatterbox\\") are corny and she repeats them too often, but try to look past it. The content is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Everyone","review":"Regardless of your age, this book should be read by everyone. I was told to read this book by my supervisor, and now it has changed my life forever. The book discusses ways of overcoming our chatterbox. More importantly, it guides you to overcoming any fear you face. Now, I feel that regardless of what is thrown at me I can handle it. We should never have any fear!!!!!!! It's the best book I have ever read dealing with personal growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive All the way...","review":"Feel the Fear and Do it Anyway is a great read. The positive and practical approach to fear and things we dread doing is quite useful.

This book totally opened my eyes to a better way of living. It has taught me how to truly 'handle' all aspects of my life and even though it is not a 'religious' book, I feel that it's principles are parallel with my own personal faith. I could not thank you enough for helping me on my journey. I am sure many people share these same feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"How are you being?","review":"So much about achieving anything worthwhile isn't just about \\"doing.\\" It's also about \\"being\\" -- the understanding of where we are now, the sensing of ourselves in the moment. This is probably the toughest thing to understand when moving forward on a goal. On the other side of fear is exhilaration, great power. Once we get this concept of \\"feeling the fear,\\" and sense it deep within our bones, the transformation can be spectacular as we rise to battle and defeat a most scary foe. So what's the downside of feeling the fear? Absolutely nothing. It's a good thing. It helps us know when we are most aware and whether we're on track. Like sadness and pain, it's an integral part of a well-lived life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well... here goes....","review":"I have crippling social anxiety that prevents me from telling people how I feel....I can't do this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"Psych professor in nurse practitioner school recommended this book. he recommends it to a lot of his patients so I bought it to see what it was all aboutl"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel the Terrible and Read it Anyway","review":"I knew after reading the reviews, this book was going to be terrible, but for some reason, I decided to read it anyway.Hated it, worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"I didn't make it all the way through, and if you try to read it you'll see why.

A friend of mine was reading this book to try and over come their fear of heights.

While this book makes out on the outside of the cover that it will give you courage in your life. It is a bunch of pop phrases she has make up that have silly meanings and after reading this book I feel the money would have been better spent elsewhere.

S Jeffers talks about how fear can keep us from moving ahead in different areas of out like. She provides practical steps on how to confront ones fears and work through these.

It wasn't for me. Then again, I'm not a fearful person.I would advise anyone who reads this, not to read it to the end.

The narrator's voice is not very pleasing to listen to and can become in fact a little distracting. Rather than listening to a clear professional voice, there's a nasal quality to it and a bit of a lisp. You hear a lot of her tongue, swallowing & spit in her mouth...a bit gross.

There's a little pocket in the corner where the booklet is supposed to be included (and has been on previous seasons), but it's empty. I just talked to Amazon customer service and they said there is a note for this product in the customer service system that the booklet is not included. I'm going to try to track one down from Fox Home Video (which makes the DVDs), but I'm not holding my breath. Most likely, I'll just have to print out an episode list from the Amazon site -- hardly ideal.

This is a dramatic turn around, because the Season Six set should have been released in both head and standard boxes. The replacement package to Season Six is where you put the disc case of the Homer head inside it.

The best place to stay is an old hotel that has a dark reputation. Twice in its history there have been terrible ax murders committed. First by an old lady and they by a young girl supposedly possessed by the lady. To make things worse, the daughter looks like the girl from the previous murder.But nothing can be simple when small towns and hauntings combine, especially when penned by Daniel \\"Ed Gorman\\" Ransom. More murders suddenly happen and the characters all get swept up in a cyclone of events that threatens lives as well as threatening to expose long-buried secrets. Secrets that have been hidden for years and whose revelations will cause further tragedy.Despite the cover, title, and blurb on the back of the book, the phone is just a minor detail in a much richer story that will make you think twice about stopping in that sleepy old small town."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Gag Gift for Parents-to-be!","review":"I laughed hystericallly when I first saw this book, mostly because my brother Spiro's name was in there!

I agree with other reviewers who remarked that Corbett is selling an introduction to his consulting firm.I bought the book to find out what I didn't know and to get direction on how to either learn it or do it. Corbett prefers to leave you hanging, perhaps to engage his consulting firm, but I think more than not, its just an incomplete work on outsourcing management.The points are interesting, but they're nothing you haven't read over and over in newspapers and business journals. Its a quick read that delivers little substance for the working manager.I see that alot of his cronies have offered their solicited opinions also here on his book.

This book is more of a consultant's calling card than a guide or manual of how to outsource correctly. It is certainly not the earth-shaker some of these other book reviews spout. Also, I have done a bestseller search several times here under term \\"outsourcing\\" and two other books have consistently come up as the bestseller, not this book as another reviewer below suggests. Let the buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Debate","review":"I can tell you in India and Singapore where I work in management for a rather large outsourcing firm (which, by the way has moved many USA jobs away from the Americas to us), that the book is well received.It might not be magical or ground-breaking but its instructional and thought-provoking no matter how many times you read its content and from wherever you may read it otherwise.Perhaps the Americans and Brits are still very angry that outsourcing has spoiled what they selfishly thought were only their career ladders and choices. Now that foreigners have opportunities brought clearer from a book like this, Americans get annoyed and nasty at the messenger.I am thankful to Mr Corbett for his contribution to equalizing our countries(even if that had to mean hurting the American worker.)He has given us overseas the information we needed to level the playing field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practitioner","review":"This book is a must read for anyone or any company seriously interested in utilizing outsourcing as either a strategic initiative or as a tactic to achieve specific strategic goals.

I bought this book, followed its guidelines, and yes I saved money on IT and customer service. I also got shoddy work and customers that cancelled their orders left and right after finding the Indian phone workers unhelpful and unintelligible. Do a little research and you'll find out that 1 in 3 outsourcing projects fail. Mine was one of those. With the growing backlash against business owners that farm their work overseas I think it's going to be 2 out of 3 soon. Make sure you check out the pros and cons of outsourcing thoroughly before falling for Corbett's song and dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Fishy here....check it out","review":"In November, our corporate AP office received an email from Corbett's group for my company to pay a $350 \\"application fee\\" to be considered one of the \\"Outsourcing 100\\" in an Advertising section of an April 2006 issue of Fortune that he is selecting. Further, his group asked for a $10,000 fee for a guaranteed position, regardless of the judging of corporate quality.It seems pretty low handed and all about money - not a true ranking of outsourcing's top groups.

This book addresses the when-did and who-was, as in personal memoirs. Its not what I would categorize a business book and I think that is what people have expected of it. You get what you pay for so don't let the value price fool you. It was one of the originals but the bookshelves have filled with dozens of much more value provided guides on the subject matter.Borrow - don't buy, is my advice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"Author Michael F. Corbett boldly stakes out the territory for his book on outsourcing. As a consultant and as an advocate of the offshore outsourcing movement, he states plainly that he wants this to become the essential guidebook for anyone considering outsourcing. Impressively, he takes great strides toward achieving just that. Clearly written and easily readable, his book refutes exaggerated concerns about job loss while providing nuts and bolts advice on getting started, picking a leader for your outsource project design team, negotiating contracts and maintaining your relationship with your outsourcing vendor. He makes a sound case for a strategic approach to outsourcing as a potential primary driver of the global economy. We find that his comprehensive treatment of outsourcing issues makes this a must-read for anyone who seeks a better understanding of the outsourcing phenomenon, particularly executives thinking about dipping their toes into offshore waters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"One day historians will look back on the first decade of the 21st century and talk about \\"the outsourcing bubble,\\" just as they now talk about \\"the dot.com bubble\\" of the 90's. Corbett is the head pitchman for this false solution to labor problems. He neglects to mention the staggering cost of lawyers versed in international contracts, the infrastructure problems, the widespread corruption in foreign governments and other factors that wipe out the wage savings involved in outsourcing. This book nearly wiped me out; don't let Corbett's ramblings do the same to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"hypocritical","review":"If Corbett thinks outsourcing is so great, why has he moved his own call center people back to the US?

Instead, the filmmakers seemed to choose the dullest and most lifeless subjects they could have picked, and presented them in an equally banal and uninteresting way.

That part is nice, but the protagonist was not enjoyable to me. I have been trying to find out if this Andrew Postman is the same Andrew Postman who gave the eulogy at his famous father's funeral (Neil Postman).

Jerry Mathers shows that he has kept a lot of common sense through the years of being a celebrity and the general turmoil in America during the past few decades. While he admits his own mistakes, he shines through as a decent person--just what we'd expect from \\"The Beav.\\" In addition to his life story, the book has background on the show \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" and some interesting extended quotations from other members of the cast. The book shows how \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" was a top quality TV show and how it provided elements of realism that are missing from today's supposedly more realistic programs.

I liked Jerry Mathers before I read the book, I adore him now. As a huge \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" fan growing up, and still now, I am very proud of what he has become especially enlight of the route other child actors have taken.

When reading this book, it draws you into the world of a deep undercover. You feel as though you are right there beside him risking your life to do the job which you he set out to do. The author draws you into the book by using his extensive knowledge of police work and that of others. Once you start reading the book, it is hard to put it away. The book keeps you in suspense to the degree that you have to keep reading to find out what will happen to the deep undercover.

To me, it's like trying to re-write Shakespeare in modern lingo. It's like taking a perfect filet mignon an pouring ketchupall over it. The first track is the \\"Ode to Joy\\" from Beethoven's 9th symphony, music so perfect, glorious and divine in its original form, that changing in any way renders it vulgar and tainted. In every piece De Los Rios inserts annoyingly clanging cymbals, drumming beats that sound like a cheap synthesizer. My advice to all those who think this is great, go get the original, you're cheating yourself out of something truly awesome. Listen to Beethoven's 9th played by the Berlin Philarmonic conducted by Herbert von Karajan, and at the end of the final movement you'll be moved to tears for the emotion such divine music will bring. Do the same with all the other pieces, infinitely better than this bastardized version."},{"rating":"2","title":"My intro to Waldo","review":"I first learned of Waldo De Los Rios from a surprising source, Rush Limbaugh.

The quality of the recordings is quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"These filters work very well.

I purchased this as a replacement for the standard filters that I normally use and because they were cheaper and another review said they would work I figured I'd try it. However, these were not a direct replacement (at least not right out of the box).

At first, I would leave them in with the humidifier on all day and, upon checking the filters in the evening, there was plenty of water in the reservoir, but the tops of the filters were still dry! Our room remained quite dry and uncomfortable through this period. Our humidifier has a sensor that detects moisture at the tops of the filters (to indicate when to replace old filters), which has been pretty consistently giving a negative reading. However, after a couple weeks of frustrating use, they seem to be working just a little better these days.Also, wtf is up with the packs of three? Had to buy two packs to round it out, so I'll be stuck with these crumby filters for a while, but will surely be looking for a different product next time we need filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good filter for the price","review":"Good filter for the price.

I assumed they might just have been OEM filters in non-retail packaging so I stored them away until I needed them.When I broke-open the plastic today, the filters emitted this strong an unpleasing rubber scent which came from the black mesh. It was made of some rubber material and dyed black. The original Holmes filters have a black mesh made of some type of non-rubber plastic.Installing these filters into my humidifier immediately spread their odor into the room. They are clearly a sub-standard product.EDIT: Filters-Now refunded my purchase. I had purchased them back in March and this review was written in June.

Personally, I loved hearing all of the diet \\"secrets\\" of the celebs. Although not all of the tips worked for me, I've lost 5 pounds with the help of this book, and this book only. It has great diet plans inside, as well as exercise tips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone proofread this?","review":"I agree with the reader(s) who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown-together, as if no one proofread it. In one chapter she'll recommend something; then later on she'll tell you it's ineffective and/or dangerous! She gives a long, long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss -- but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments, recommendations or opinions of her own. Personally I think most natural/ herbal supplements are a ripoff, but if she had given any testimonials by people who've found them to work, I might consider trying them. On the whole, this book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFF THE CHAIN","review":"This book is a bit old school but the remedies in here actually works and its always best to use things that are naturally prepared for us.

And then have literally 1 minute of puppies in the actual movie???? This movie is a disappointment, whether you were dying for some fuzzy love or not. The cinematography is downright embarrassing and cheesy. The main character was about as lovable as a troll with herpes and the guy she falls in love with was possibly the most boring man in the world: he carves crappy wood objects for a living!

No puppies, no kid stuff......try sexual innuendos (over and over), drug reference (\\"...meth lab in the basement\\"), and adult issues (parental death, confusion in job/career, on and on).

We're talking 78's kiddies. There's a mix of good ones and not so good on here but if you like Bing it's well worth it. There appears to be a selection that ranges from the thirties into the forties, so you can hear the slight change in his style. And then there's the amazing Andrew Sisters to back him up on a few.

My personal favorite episodes are Lisa The Vegetarian, Bart Sells His Soul, King-Size Homer(I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction!), Bart The Fink(I'm \\"sure\\" Krusty can find friends who like him for who he is), Homerpalooza, and The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular(and now what you've all been waiting for: Hard-core nudity!).

Can't wait for the 8th season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic season!","review":"The Simpsons, while at its peak, was one of the funniest, smartest, heartwarming, and just plain fun shows out there. It is sad that in recent years it has decided to try too hard to follow the footsteps of other shows, such as Family Guy and South Park instead of blazing its own creative trail. During season 7 of the series, however, the Simpsons was still incredibly funny and original. The episodes would often make you laugh, but would still deliver an overall positive moral message. The characters were well-balanced within the Simpson family, with episodes not entirely revolving around Homer falling into crazy schemes. The supporting characters were valuable to the situations and provided numerous laughs and gags. If you want a fun, compelling and overall enjoyable experience, I strongly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"terry jarvis reviews the simpsons series 7","review":"Probably the bes ever season of the series every episode great wow this was first on 11 years ago and still funny and if not even more funny the minute it is out i will bye itmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm simpsons dvd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Me Some Simpsons","review":"This is such a solid season, back when Simpsons didn't miss a beat.I've watched it through three times already.So happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best set ever!","review":"Best collection of Simpsons episodes out there.

I just hope they stand up to a few years of being in the rain, sun, heat and cold.(Update, 6 months later) One word of caution. Because these are made of some kind of plastic, DO NOT torque them down really really tight on your wheels, or else the teeth of the strap can get worn down in one spot. This can make the buckle jam and make it almost impossible to release. You'll be looking for a utility knife to cut the thing off.

Once they get too chewed up they stop releasing and you'll need to cut it off with a knife (be careful not to slash your bike tire).Once you replace them, you'll be reminded that they don't cinch down well enough to hold onto road bike rims - though they do hold onto MTB rims/tires well enough.I use these on an Ankle Biter rack from Yakima (at least until I find someone to buy it from me).

Towards the end of the radio mix, it turns into the Mr. Dupri mix without rap by Da Brat. In the extended mix Da Brat raps in the beginning of the song, so there's no rap in that remix either. The Reggae Soul mix is very funny and Lil' Vicious cracks me up with that crazy rap! I also have the Cassete Single, here are the tracks: Side 1: 1. Album Version 2. Mr. Dupri mix featuring Da Brat & Xscape Side 2: 1.

It has helped me to see things in a positive way, obtain goals, and affirm what I want or need -- and to let go of guilts, fears, and \\"hang ups\\" that I have 'acquired\\" over my lifetime. Working with this book, and Betty's \\"The Dream Book\\" have become a way of life for me. It's a great feeling and EASY -- I truly owe it to these books and Betty's EASY meditation technique taught in both books for the positive growth that I have made. Perfect book to start your own workshop with friends to get in and change yourself for the better. Consists of 7 chapters and \\"worksheets\\" at end of each chapter to explore yourself and your feelings. You OWE it to yourself to give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"seven steps to developing your intuitive powers","review":"I found this book to be most helpful in my personal development of what proves to be a strong intuitive ability. I must disagree with one of the other 'critics' reviews as I felt the references to God were not offensive. We live in a world with many different cultural and religious beliefs. Why can't we look to our 'neighbors' and realize we are different and accept without condemning? One should not take offense at such. I am not religious, but very spiritual and I believe that the world NEEDS multiple religions to satisfy so many different souls. So what if God were mentioned! There were also quotations by Emerson! Let it be and listen for what you went to the book to hear. Every experience in life adds to how we evolve as spiritual beings. I felt the book gave me insight in areas I lacked.The book basicly flows as a teaching tool, with feedback at the end of every chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slightly different oppinion","review":"Okay, only have a minute to write this review, but I would like to state that this book is one of the best I have read on the topic. It's about time someone wrote a book that reads to intelligent audiences who are interested in the deep symbolism that is purposly put into the anime. Going deeply into the religious connotations of things like Neon Genesis Evangelion is a breath of fresh air compaired to how many authors just breeze through it like it is \\"just that simple\\". This book was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conversing on a subject while lacking knowledge","review":"This book was written by a professor of Japanese culture and literature. She herself admits that she was not familiar to anime and manga before being introduced to it by a student. This shows, as the author makes many comparisons between series that are not compatible in order to draw out conclusions that seem forced. When I read of \\"Akira\\" being compared to \\"Ranma 1/2\\" and see that the supposed underlying theme is the alienation of Japanese youth, something about the text seems to smell. When she begins making slapstick comedy series out to be psychological commentaries on the concept of \\"carnival,\\" I find myself becoming sceptical about how much she understands the medium of anime. My overall perception of this book is not that she explains anime to the reader, but that she uses specific elements in anime to prove the preconceived points she wishes to get across. This is not the worst book about anime, but it is pretty close to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the money...","review":"Save yourself the money on this book. The author seems to read some anime reviews, \\"The Anime Companion\\", and some cultural anime books, and slop them together as though she's got original information. Some of which she STILL gets wrong. Incorrect pictures for some of the anime, too, only futher lowering the quality of this book...which is hard to do with pictures, you'd think."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting anime","review":"I bought this book for a friend that is very interested in anime.He tells me that it is very interesting and informative. He has been taking it to work to read during breaks so I guess he really likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very educational look at Anime","review":"Aside from a great cover, this book is an extremely interesting read, taking a whole new look at anime. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this isn't a guide to anime movies, or even anime in general. Rather, it takes fairly popular titles and explores the meaning behind the movies. A very interesting look at anime through the eyes of a professional. Enhances the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Orleans?","review":"I must admit that I picked up this book because it was written in New Orleans, and I love to read books in that setting. The fact that it was a forensic mystery was, I thought, a bonus, since I love forensic mysteries. Well, this book did disappoint me in all aspects. There is very little New Orleans flavour to the book at all, and the forensic information was extremely minimal. Not only that, but it wasn't even an exciting mystery. The character development was extremly weak.I did not enjoy this book and did not find it exciting to read. If you're looking for good forensics, try Kathy Reichs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Song Review","review":"I wish that the whole song could be played by some company on the WEB.

It goes into great detail about 007's villains, allies, gadgets, vehicles and of course, the women. It is witty and informative and looks at every film from Dr. No to Tomorrow Never Dies. The only criticisms are that the book omits minor characters and at times, the authors include too many of their own opinions which does not allow the reader to make their own mind up about the films. In summary, an excellent book worth the money with loads of colour pictures (some never seen before)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid yet uninspired","review":"This is a fairly comprehensive volume that will make most Bond fans happy. However, as an \\"authorized\\" history, it's missing an objective voice. It would have been nice to read some meaningful criticism of some of the dreadful flicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential for who?","review":"This book is the \\"official authorized guide\\" to the world of 007. It's just a pity that the authors are obviously not real Bond fans. The book casually glides past Fleming;s novels and the Bonds themselves and instead does a film-by-film recap. This would be nice were it not for the fact that you often get the sense that the authors were trying to divide Bond fans into 2 distinct camps rather than prasing the series as a whole. My personal tastes were also insulted as brilliant movies like \\"man With The Golden Gun\\" and \\"A View To A Kill\\" are slammed, mocked, and scorned, while later on they gush and sing the praises of the dull villain Carver from \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", and stop just short of calling George Lazenby the best Bond ever. I couldn't help getting a sense that this book was written to be deliberatley provocative and irritating, and really that's not what you want in a book called \\"The Essential Bond\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THAT bad...but could have been better","review":"I did want to get this book, simply because it does contain the BASICS to all the Bond movies up to THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH. It covers plots, characters, women, gadgets, etc.It's rather rote with the facts, and there are a few inconsistencies (Fleming himself was a tad guilty in that respect), so it's not a real big deal...the genre and the \\"legend\\" does (and will) live on.I found the movie \\"tie-ins\\" products the most intriguing, as I remember buying some of those when they first came out (wish I still had them too). Heck, I practically grew up with James Bond.While you might not agree with the author's point of view in some cases, you will still find this volume a good study in not only the basic facts & figures of each movie, but production tidbits, revenue returned on each movie, and the like.ALthough I wouldn't pay the full retail price for this, when it's at a SALE price...it's a darn good bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Bond book ever!","review":"Lee Pfeiffer & David Worrall are the best!

It's a fantastic reference source and should be required reading for any fan of the greatest secret agent ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essential Guide to Bond","review":"\\"The Essential Bond\\" is probably the best general reference work available today on the world of everyone's favorite cinema spy. Authors Lee Pfeiffer and Dave Worrall, long-established experts in the field of Bondage, have assembled an impressive array of previously unpublished photos (from the \\"Eon Archives\\"), as well as comprehensive data on every villain, Bond Girl, gadget, car, and weapon. They have also included thoughtful chapters on the Literary Bond (which should never be neglected), the members of the \\"Bond Family,\\" 007 and Popular Culture, and more. And lest anyone think this is (or wrongfully accuse the authors of writing) a \\"love letter\\" to Eon Productions (producers of the 20-film Bond franchise since 1962), P & W have included insightful, often highly-critical analyses of each film in the official Bond canon. If you buy only one book on James Bond, let this be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book, but not perfect","review":"The Essential Bond is arguably the best Bond reference available. All 200+ pages are packed with photos, bios, and all sorts of useful information about the James Bond movies. If you want to know which is the highest-grossing Bond film, where each movie was shot, and the complete cast of each movie, then this is the book for you. One complaint - the personal commentary the writers include regarding each film may put off novice Bond fans who have yet to see the movies, and it may seem derogatory to 007 aficionados who have already formulated their own opinions about each film. That said, The Essential Bond is still a great read for every fan of the 007 phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cow Dung","review":"I think 5 year olds can act better than the monotone asains and the embarrising steven seagle.

In addition to having a section devoted to rude comments, such as how to call someone \\"an idiot\\" in Spanish, it is also not always very accurate in its translations and information provided. It would also perhaps be a better learning tool if the authors had made a note as to which countries particular slang phrases are used. I saw some phrases that are only used in Mexico, some that are only used in Costa Rica, etc., but there is no way for the book's intended audience to know that. As both a teacher and a native Spanish speaker (Spaniard raised in Latin America), I would strongly recommend against using this book in a classroom setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ages 7 & up!","review":"The best thing is the phonetic spelling listed with each phrase or word. No grammar, no real in-depth Spanish rules or anything like that, but enough on each topic to actually give students a chance to communicate when they can't think of what to say! My High school students down to my 8 year olds all have enjoyed this book in and out of class.There's no place to write in it or do any work, which is again pleasing to the student - it's portrayed as \\"Don't let the adults catch you reading this!\\" which seems to encourage the students to read it, but I don't know if everyone would approve of that message...Of course, there will always be regionalisms, so it won't EXACTLY match the \\"street Spanish\\" you hear necessarily, but it's a great place to start!Cute little illustrations as well.

Its 80's and so bad. Really not sexy like she was when she came out in 2005. Also, why is she going in a rock direction on this concert? She is an astounding RnB/Pop artist and does not need to add loud guitars in her mix. The guitars actually detract bigtime from this performance. However, Her voice is perfect and the sound and visual quality are top notch. The show is non-stop energy. I just hope she can bring back the original Rihanna that wasn't all leather and spikes. I KNOW the next tour will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound and pic","review":"Its not DTS Master audio.I am really disappointed because its sounds and looks like a reg dvd, not a blu-ray.Dont wast your money on blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"Take away the flash, the makeup, the scandal, and everything 'around' Rihanna, and you are left with...well...not much.The music is fake.Good Girl Gone Bad Live is one heck of a boring set of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This is one of the best books in economic development ever published.

Oh, the hilarity!","review":"The beauty of this book is it lets you witness the insanity of the rock star lifestyle without having to pay to consequences. I laughed out loud the whole way through.Some of the low-rated remarks state that it is poorly researched. Even if some of the stories have been exagerated over the years, who cares? Some things become legendary for the better. They make for better tales. Would you rather the authors go on a mission to debunk any possibilities of embellishment? What a great book that would make.In closing, if you like the wildness of Rock & Roll, you will love this book. Otherwise, I banish you to the land of John Tesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Authors Do the Dumbest Things!","review":"Margaret Moser and Bill Crawford live in fantasy land? What a waste of money. Obviously these two clowns have not done any proper research and have filled the book with lots of myths and wildly exaggerated stories. I'm particularly peeved with the Keith Moon stuff, complete rubbish. Keith's antics have been well researched by other people and what these two have used are stories that are well known to be grossly exaggerated. They have basicly taken the most stupid myths and exaggerated stories from other peoples work, put in no research, and expect people to buy it. I wish I hadn't!! Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All","review":"I was happy to see some of my past and current favorite bands listed in this book. There are no secrets in this book. If it's embarassing or stupid.. it's listed. We all have our musical heroes and heroines that we look up too, but sometimes the things they do are so awful you just have to cringe! With chapters on everyone from Motely Crue to Trent Reznor, it appears that the authors have spared no musician or band's pride. For example, did you know that Elton John had a pair of wooden pants made for him? If that doesn't seem funny enough, how about John Lennon sticking a Kotex on his head while arrogantly walking around the Troubador Club? In addition to stories like these, each chapter contains a \\"Quickie Bio\\" and a \\"Dumbest Quotes\\" section. Let's just say that it's nearly 300 pages of the most hilarious, yet well-researched brain candy I've seen in a long time. Read this book before your next party"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Study","review":"Nancy K. Miller is best known for The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722-1782, which is clearly not a book that passes unperceived (to paraphrase Peter Brooks of Yale). Here Miller takes on the role of women with her trademark unsentimental criticism. Her style is terse, often funny, and readable. After a thorough linear analysis of a narrative sequence, she discusses the ideological consequence of the novel. Because she doesn't have an axe to grind, her critiques cannot be dismissed as \\"feminist\\" but rather bring added depth to the study of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool for new user","review":"I bought this after buying a Canon a570is camera and I'm glad I did. Some cameras and owner's manuals are more intuitive than others. This is a great tool to teach you \\"how to use the camera\\" as well as some pointers on how to take good pictures. It goes step by step through each function and every button and combinations of buttons as well as creative alternatives. More importantly it tells how they work. Taking pictures with the camera set on \\"auto\\" is fine, but this DVD also tells you how to use the manual controls to your best advantage. I highly recommend this DVD to the casual user as well as those who want to expand there photographic horizons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just what, but why and how","review":"The DVD effectively explains how to use the camera. The narrator's analogy to the manual found in the glove compartment of a car is true. You can't learn how to drive from that car manual -- and you can't learn how to use the camera from the manual that comes with it. The DVD explains how, why, when, and where to use the difernet features of the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful book I think.","review":"This is a good book to have, but the narrator talks so fast I have a hard time keeping up.Maybe it's because I am 87 years old.

I purchased it with the purpose of using it without boxes, by placing mattress directly on the slats. The support is constructed very poorly. The one middle support beam has same thickness as the rest of the slats and is not attached neither to headboard nor foot-board of the frame. It is attached to few slats by bolts, and is supported by two legs. It gets easily bend on the edges, and bed is making a lot of creaking noises. I tried reassembling the bed few times, even tried to use beeswax to prevent the noise, but nothing helps.For this money I would expect sturdier construction, with heavier beam attached to the bed frame itself, with more support legs.Amazon return service was good though, but beware of the shipping charge. There's $90 shipping charge that you end up paying, even if you are Prime customer, to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful wood platform bed","review":"This is a very simple and elegantly designed platform bed. The wood is actually a much richer and slightly redder color than I thought based on the picture. It is closer to cherry than mahogany.

I had hoped the author would have applied a consistent format in terms of depth coloring, lat/lon demarcation and Loran lines. All are variable from page to page. Compass roses are not consistently avaialable. The large scale chart showing the location of the individual pages is not clear and does not even show the first few pages at all. The volume I bought had 8 pages inverted, further adding to the difficulty. My advice is pass on this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of limited value","review":"While useful for armchair sailing, it is no substitute for the appropriate charts.

Hildegarde was the leading first lady or queen or Dame of the Cabaret circuit. Anybody else who followed her had a tough act to follow. The voice is stunning, smooth as silk, and it would be wonderful to see her in a recorded video or film of her singing voice with gloves and fantastical outfits with long gowns, hats, gloves, etc. We don't have anybody close to match Hildegarde's power as a leading cabaret singer. When you listen to her, you just feel like dancing or in a better place. I just can't believe that I never heard of Hildegarde until now. I wished that I knew her then. This compilation is her original mono recordings from 1935 to 1944 with big bands like BBC Dance ORchestra, Carroll Gibbons and his Boy Friends, Mantovani, etc. Hildegarde will always be remembered because of her contributions to the art of cabaret singing where it's intimate atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"now i know","review":"As a man, I found this book very helpful. Pat even has a section that mentions how men should learn breast self-examination to help their partners.

I never put it down from when I first started reading it until I had it finished. The author was very knowledgeable, but knew how to take her knowledge and make it understandable to the average lay person. This book can definitly make a difference in how many women will be helped in advance of having breast cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! I Hate It!!","review":"It's buy far the worst show with Mickey Mouse! It's very disgraceful to the mouse we all know and love! Mickey and his friends acts more like Dora (which I hate that show to), the plots are lasy written, and there's no good humor for adults on this show! It also lacks creativity on the learning part and it's very bad! Why did they ruin the mouse and his friends?! Why?!?! These are my favorite characters from my childhood and it wasn't a good idea to make a show where Mickey just talks to you on the camera oftenly! There's nothing new to the show, It's a rip-off of other shows that we've already seen before, like Dora the Exploror and the Elmo's World segments at the end of each Sesame Street episode!

Moriah Rhame Brock sees dead people and has a great time while doing it. It doesn't really matter if you believe anyone has this ability... you'll enjoy this book no matter what you see or believe. (Just for the record: I haven't seen any dead people yet. I'm working on it.) Moriah's sense of humor/sarcastic wit/engaging voice makes her book a pleasure to read. If you ever get the chance, meet this lady in person--she's a hoot AND a gifted medium.

When compared to the previous 41 presidents, it's no wonder we were/are so supportive of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will they learn?","review":"The things that Dwayne points out as things in common with Clinton are things to be avoided. That Clinton was elected twice was not due to black support, it was due to Ross Perot.

This bed has also held up very well. we never have had any problems with it. i would recommend it to you if your daughter loves dora. Otherwise, i would go with a step 2 bed or somthing else just because those do generally hold up longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Transitional Bed","review":"This worked great to get my daughter out of her crib and into a toddler bed. She now even takes our hand and leads us to her bed, gives us a kiss and says night night and crawls in.However, for some reason I thought it looked bigger than it was, it truly is just a little larger than the crib mattress (it fits a crib mattress which was nice b/c we didn't have to buy another mattress) and it works well with the pink dora table and chair set and the toy bin set also.It holds myself (and I'm not a little woman) and my daughter for as long as it takes for us to read a book.Overall great product and great transitional bed.

The song structers were predictable, the lyrics were annoying and hypocritical and I just didn't care for the overused cliche concept of the devolution of mankind. If Britney Spears played prog metal with lyrics written by Al Gore, it would sound like this. There are plenty of better prog metal concept albums out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the typical Lee Smith humor and voice you expect","review":"For those familiar with Lee Smith's work, some of these stories seem very familiar, like rehashes of themes and ideas from some of her previous works. The mood of this collection is darker than her other collections and the stories seem disconnected. They do not engage the reader as so many of her works do. As a huge fan of Ms. Smith's, (I have read all her work), I was a little disappointed and left a little flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Bottomless is my favorite","review":"I enjoyed all of these stories, but Live Bottomless was my favorite. Lee Smith writes with such ease and it is effortless to read. She completes her short stories so you feel satisfied before going on to the next. In \\"Live Bottomless\\" Sarah is a \\"student of the human soul\\" - which is how I feel about Lee Smith and how she wrote these short stories, as a student of the human soul. In \\"Live Bottomless\\" Sarah has been emotionally and physically abandoned by her parents and went to live with her Aunt in South Carolina, whom she did not know. Her parents eventually came and got her, but by then she had become attached to her new life in South Carolina and the structure this new home had given her.I recommend this book even if you don't like short stories. All the stories are worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of words, no meaning","review":"Reading the stories in this volume is entertaining, like watching TV. I don't have a TV. I read because I don't like TV. I read short stories because I often find sharp snapshots of crucial life moments.Not in News of the Spirit. I found elaborate images and scenarios that, having been created, are left to whither with no sense of life force.

I used it as recommended on my 4 cats and 2 dogs. None of them showed any ill effects from taking it, and there is still plenty left over.Pro - A lot of med that will treat a lot of pets. No signs of illness or distress with use.Con ? I don't know - since none of my pets showed signs of worms after using it I can't know for sure if it worked.

The soothing menthol, moisturizers and antiseptic properties made it an ideal aftershave. It was light enough (almost pourable) that it didn't go on heavy or leave a greasy shine. Unfortunately, they have reformulated and repackaged the product. The new product contains less per unit, costs more, and does not have the same properties. Per the ingredients listing, they have added gums to the formula, which makes it go on like a thick white cream. I'm not sure what the application for this product is now, but it definitely isn't as an aftershave balm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by my vet","review":"I purchased Pretty Pets Aquatic Turtle Food for my yellow bellied slider at our Vet's suggestion.

They were harassed and force to disband because of Nazi disapproval of their semitic origins as well as their avant-guarde, jazz-oriented material. They sing here in German and English doing everything from folk songs to Tea for Two with clarity, musical grace and lightness. Their comic songs are very deft and witty. If you enjoy close harmonics, you will find this recording a revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet.","review":"This was an excellent Anime series. It isn't very long, but it tells a complete story in the time it is given. It is also good for people who don't want to have to remember a lot from story to story, as most of it can be viewed without knowledge of other episodes. I highly recommend this, as the artwork is fantastic, and I enjoyed the dubbing. The voice actors worked very well with the story.

That said, it looks decent and if you layer other shirts under it, you won't notice the wind coming through.I have received compliments about how it looks and so forth, but I do not wear the shirts often (I bought the grey and the blue ones).

For example, shooting trap really boils down to stance, mount, balance, and see bird - shoot bird. Complicated angle diagrams and field layouts are not helpful in the least.

It has quite a few small compartments for its size, including 2 zippered compartments for coins, etc., 2 compartments for phone/MP3/other devices, and room for notebooks or other not-too-bulky items besides the laptop.

The strap is sturdy and comfortable with my lap top and accessories in tow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $13 bag I can imagine","review":"OK, the bag does have some issues, but for $13 it's tough to beat. It's very light, the laptop padding is adequate, and the pockets are well-placed and good size. My main problem is with the strap. I like to use the bag a bit as a messenger bag, strapped to my back. Unfortunately, the strap is too long, and it's also stitched to the bag so it's not easy to swap out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great messenger bag!","review":"This is my first messenger bag, and I am very happy with my purchase.

Also quite a few small accessory pockets to store keys, note-cards, etc. Great Lowepro quality for an unbelievable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price.","review":"I bought it a month ago. Works pretty well for me. I can put my 15\\" notebook without a problem. There is another pocket to put your AC power adapter, a mouse and some small items like cell phone, pens, notepads etc. It feels quite comfortable on my shoulder when loaded.The materials seem like in a good quality except the two plastic locking devices that keep the cover close. They are a little flimsy and seem that can break easily. If they break you cannot close the bag anymore because there is no zipper to close the inside pockets.

It also hits kinda close to home because I have talked to kids at school that brag about steeling sighs, and then after this book was writen it realy happing in Texas is sorta wierd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live and Learn.","review":"I thought that this book was great. If you were to take two normal teenagers and put them into this situation, like anyone, they would be completly shocked. Remy and Morgan did have many real life-related obstacles, and that's where every other teenager in the world and I come in. We can relate to this sort of thing. This book teaches you about love and friendship. And how two lovers mascarade can lead to others' loss. I think the punishments could've been harsher on Remy and Morgan, but more importantly, the book teaches teenagers all over the world how stupidness can always lead into something tradgic. This just goes to say that we can all make mistakes, but some mistakes come when they are least expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot but the book was to short.","review":"This book was at first somewhat interesting but soon became a stickin nightmare. I felt like I was going out of my mind. I only finished the book because it is a project for driver's education class. The plot is okay but lacking in some areas. The detail of the book could have been better. I preferred Tolstoy's War and Peace over this book. It had some interesting similarities with a real life accident. It also shows in a dfine detail the emotional highs and lows of the teenage years. After the first chapter I didn't feel like reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was at a lower reading level then I am at.","review":"This book was average. If it is meant for people who are in Driver's Ed now then it should be more approiate for our reading level. When I read this book in sixth grade it was good, now it is boring.

I thought this book was average and would not suggest it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"DE Review","review":"Driver's Ed is about some teenagers that steal a stop sign and someone dies in a car crash as a result. The teens are guilt-ridden and ask of each other whether or not to confess.This book was very hard to get into. What little action there was was at the end of the book. There were many unneeded characters at the beginning, too. I really didn't enjoy reading about someone's guilt trip because they did something stupid like steal a sign. If this book was written to teach a lesson, it was one I already learned, so I didn't need to read this.I wouldn't recommend this book. If you're looking for a suspensful book about peer pressure and teens doing morally incorrect things, I would suggest Breaking Point by Alex Flinn over this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life in Progress","review":"This was a very good book and it teaches you how responsibility can be trusted and dropped really quickly.

It did have a slow start but as the story went along, I went along with it. As a beginning driver, it really clarified the dangers of being on the road and all the stupid stunts that people do and what to look out for. It was just so great that this book was so realistic and that it relates to teenagers' lives in many ways. I would reccomend this book to anyone learning to drive or even thinking about doing a stupid stunt like taking away a stop sign or any road sign...even though you might not be hurt in an accident, it will hurt you worse to know that you caused it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once the action started, I couldn't put it down!","review":"When Remy and Morgan went joyriding one night with a friend, they stole a stop sign from an intersection.

Cooney started out as a fairly boring book. Remy is a high school student starting driver's education class. She is very eager to get her license and always wants to drive. Later on in the story, Remy, Morgan (Remy's dream boyfriend), Lark (Remy's best friend), and Nickie (the only one of the four with a license) all play a \\"game\\" where each one of them steals a street sign. On the night it all happens, Lark backs out because her mother becomes sick. They go on with it anyway and steal two road signs and a stop sign. Soon after, a horrible accident happens in the same place that the stop sign was stolen. Now Remy and Morgan either confess to the crime they committed or live with the horrible guilt of someone dying because of them.I enjoyed this book because it was very suspenseful and the words that Cooney used made me want to keep reading. On a scale of one to ten, I would rate this book a solid eight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drivers Ed in a twisted way","review":"Three teens Remy, Nicky, and Morgan are your average teens. Grow up around wealthy high class parents who would never think their son or daughter is ever bad. Well this time they all are going to be surpirzed when their children tell them they are partially guilty in the death of a woman. Denise Thompson who was in her twenties with a husband and baby boy was killed from crossing a road and a truck t-boned her. The cause of the accident was from a stop sign being cut down. Remy, Nicky and Morgan are the theives of a the stop sign. Not in their wildest dreams did they ever expect to see on the news that someone died from their actions.I give this book a 4 because it was a good suspensionful book but the ending was not all that and a bag of chips if you know what I mean. The climax and plot are wonderful and can make anyone relate to a scary memory from the past where you tried to keep a secret and couldn't sleep, because you always thought about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Book By a Good Author","review":"As soon as I saw this book in the book store, I grabbed it. Caroline B. Cooney usually writes exciting, suspenseful books that you are hard-pressed to put down. However, I felt this book was written simply as a money-maker. After quickly skimming through it, I saw that it was a piece of fluff with none of the suspense or good writing that I expect from Caroline Cooney. The characters were shallow, unrealistic, and unlikable, and you never really found out much about what they were like. I hope that Caroline will return to her former writing style in her future books. This book was a prime candidate for a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomten Gnome","review":"I ordered this after reading a list of books for family reading.

They have a bond that is not to be broken, but here is a huge problem, and it happens to be what the MOB can't stand the most. A Rat. Will a friendship be ruined by a fatal error and can this prove to claim the lives of the other friend as well.This book is solid, but to me lacks the action especially for a group of friends who used to be stick up kids. However, it will definitely jeep you interest and enough solidarity to make you want to read the sequel. I'm working on the 2nd one now, and it looks as if it's not going to disapoint either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the Game Fair?","review":"From start to finish this books captures your attention and draws you into the story.

Robb's \\"In Death\\" series is one of the best that I have read and listened to. Susan Ericksen is fantastic as the narrator. Her individual characterizations for Eve, Roarke, Peabody, Finney, etc., makes the audio rendition of this series a must-buy and a collection keeper. Though the audio series started midway through the book series, having Susan Ericksen as the narrator throughout the audio editions means that there is very little deviation in the individual characterizations. Instead, the character consistencies make for a more enjoyable \\"listen\\" especially if done consecutively. I have all of the unabridged audios and listen to them often! (jsiobhanlei - 1/5/07)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday Surprise","review":"This book on tape is a refreshing story of suspense to listen to. The narator of the story is Susan Ecicksen and her reading adds the necessary flavor to this story. The story will grab you all at once and not let you go until you get to the end of this \\"who done it\\" holiday surprise. As soon as you think that you know who did it, up pops another suspect to consider. Just who is this person in the Santa costume ringing the doorbell with a surprise package just for his true love? Don't open the door or this gift will be something to die for. Lieutenant Eve Dallas will not stop searching for the killer who is leaving clues which represent the twelve days of christmas song as well as bringing up distrubing recollections of Eve's own past of victim outrage. This book will not let you down as the next in line to this \\"...death in\\" series. Don't miss out on this holiday story, it is a must have for your cozy fireside read this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the Holiday Season attracts Killers....","review":"Holiday In Death is another great addition to this thrilling series. Not only is it Eve and Roake's first Christmas together but there is a serial killer running around. A serial killer who dresses up like Santa Clause, is very neat and tidy and uses \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas \\" as his theme. The suspense in this series just keeps getting better. I never know the \\"who done it \\" until the very end. This is an excellent installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the story, hate the book","review":"My husband ordered this for me as a Christmas gift.

Okay, this series of books is absolute fun. Though I've definitely crossed the gap into middleagedom, I want to be Eve Dallas when I grow up ...even more I want to have Rourke when I grow up. I've devoured each book in this series in one-sitting reads and Holiday in Death was no disappointment. The characters are full-bodied, but still growing, the mysteries riveting, and the romance sizzling. Eve is the perfect heroine, and Rourke her perfect mate. Keep writing, Nora!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another terrific read from Nora Roberts writing as J.D. Robb","review":"I love the deepening relationship between Eve and Roarke as these J.D.

Looking forward to the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gone Crazy","review":"I must admit, although this book is very desturbing and some of the characters rather creepy, I liked the plot. On a \\"ick\\" factor, I'd give it an 8 out of 10. But Hey, for a novel, that's a good thing in my book. At least the characters are believable, if not Icky.

For those looking to read an orginal and clever book this wouldn't be the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that thrilling","review":"I don't know why this book keeps getting positive review, maybe they're all loyal fans of J.D Robb.

Not very orginal and clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively Garbage!","review":"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this one stinks!It is set in the future: what a great opportunity for adding an interesting element and yet nothing is made of it! The characters are flat: the protagonist is not the least bit likeable. Her husband seems to function merely as her sex toy as their relationship seems to consist of nothing but panting at the sight of him. Otherwise, she is driven, mean, abrasive--not the kind of person you would want to meet.The mystery itself lacks any kind of suspense and is utterly predictable.Take it from an avid mystery reader: you'll be hard pressed to find anything more ridiculous, predictable and trashy anywhere. Strictly bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent \\"In Death\\" book","review":"J.D. Robb has written another excellent \\"In Death\\" book. What I love about these books is that with each one we learn more about each character. I especially love the fact that these books show how a relationship can be just as exciting after the marriage as it was before. With each book Eve and Roarke become closer and more attached to each other. Their partnership never gets stale or old. The mystery in this story is also fast paced and satisfying. I would highly recommend all books in the \\"In Death\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average thriller/Below average science fiction","review":"I seem to be one of the few reviewers who occasionally writes a lukewarm to bad review-Somebodys gotta do it! This book is a hybrid consisting of science fiction and mystery and both genres suffer. Science fiction readers will find it pedestrian and trite. It will appeal to some mystery readers, however, I am not one of them. The characters were pretty much \\"stock\\" and the writing pretty much bestseller-ish. No surprises here and not much depth or wit either. I prefer Deaver or Daheim, and Kress and Gibson."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEVEN DOWN, CAN'T WAIT FOR NUMBER EIGHT!","review":"As always, J.D. (alias Nora Roberts) Robb continues to entertain and surprise with this latest in her \\"Death\\" series. Watching Eve's emotional growth catch up with her laser edged, cop brain has been a lot of the fun in this series. I hope the author continues allowing Eve and Rourke to deepen their marriage relationship beyond their current sexual frenzy. Not that getting steamy with them hasn't been a kick. It's just time to add a new ingredient to the marital cocktail that Ms. Robb has already shaken and stirred. Peabody is a delight, and I'd like to see her develop a little more too. Of course, none of us can ever get enough of Rourke. These two characters who couldn't possibly be right for each other, have turned out to be absolute perfection together. Since life rarely works out this way, isn't it fun to read a little futuristic, romantic mystery and discover how much fun it is to escape reality. Thanks for another fun read, J.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story","review":"This is not a full length book.

This is the third time I've read HOLIDAY and I still love it. The relationships that form and are beginning to bloom are truly touching.As with other J.D. Robb books, the crimes are horrific. Eve's drive to stop this killer is compelling, as is the conflict she goes through due to the nature of the crimes and how close to home they hit.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and enjoyment. Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order so you meet the main characters as they come into play and develop into first-rate characters. Don't miss the short stories threaded into this series either.

The songs are not bad. I've heard more silly goth romantic material out of bands that chart. \\"Along The Edge Of Time\\" has a catchy melody. However, you really need a full orchestra and a voice with enough gravitas to pull it off. What you have here is what sounds like a 15 year old singing music scored for drum machine and cell phone - who apparently think's he's Lestat.No doubt this impresses the baby goth set, but it has a different effect on an older crowd. It's just a little too precious.Listen before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining Spoof","review":"This 2 DVD set consists of 7 episodes per DVD, and was produced by Yorkshire Television in 1990 and 1991. Based on Michael Green's book, Squire Haggard's Journal, it is a spoof of the British country aristocracy during the colonial period. As I have not read the book, I am unable to comment on how closely this series resembles the book.The story concerns the misadventures of monetarily-challenged and frequently inebriated Squire Amos Haggard and his randy son Roderick. Squire Haggard perpetrates varied ill-conceived \\"stratagems\\" designed to part his aristocratic peers from some of their monies. The Squire is assisted by his often reluctant manservant, Nathaniel Grunge, who wittily comments on the plight of the lower classes. Meanwhile, the fickle Roderick woos several heiresses in futile attempts to secure a wife.For those who enjoy historic comedies such as Black Adder and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, I highly recommend Haggard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading picture","review":"I bought this with the peridot earrings from the same seller, so if you see a repetition of the points i make its because the seller is the same,firstly the picture makes it look a lot better than it is,its a very pale green, at more than [...] including shipping it looks more like a [...] piece of costume jewelry,i am really surprised some reviewers claim to have worn this as wedding jewelry,this mainly was what made me buy it, goes to show caveat emptor, its now to late to get anything else so i really can't return it,would not recommend it to anyone else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Anybody Out There???","review":"I ordered a picnic basket as a gift from my step-dad to my mom a week ago.

Well, after getting it home, and unwrapping it, I found, also cellophane wrapped inside, two disc-packages, with information on what shows were on each disc. It did not give specifics about the shows.I opened the first and played it, but there was a gentleman giving a long narrative before each show, which I found very disconcerting and off-putting.
