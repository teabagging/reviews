I found the book to be well written and the narrative voice held my interest in a rubber-necker sort of way. I kept wondering what absurdity might appear on the next page. The story is more about the vacuous boredom some people experience when \\"success\\" means they don't really need anybody or anything. Gilbert lamented her own emotional woes without acknowledging the trail of destruction she left in her wake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was amazed with how boring and terrible this book really is - even with all of the buzz around it. My biggest problem with the book is that the author feels like she has to over describe things by using four descriptors for the same exact thing. Just make up your mind and stop using \\"or\\" so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get into this book.","review":"I purchased the audio version and really wanted to like it with all the hoopla...I can't waste my time any more trying to get into this book. I tried, just not interested. I found my mind wandering and just wasn't keeping my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick this up every couple of days and you won't be disappointed","review":"There are so many wonderful reviews on the contents of this book already. I can understand the spectrum of opinions as I share some of them. What I find is this book is, if you will forgive me, like box of chocolates: you wouldn't want to eat them all in one sitting or you would tire of the taste of chocolate. I found that, as I read this book over a period of two months, it felt more genuine as real time had passed - and Gilbert's journey had also passed. She is a talented writer, no doubt about it. But the subject matter demands objectivity gleaned through time. Keep it on your nightstand and pick it up the way you might a book about practical encouragement or support. Then, you will not be disappointed, but rather feel you are catching up with an old friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read, Revile, Discard","review":"After hearing 'the buzz' on this book, it sounded right up my alley - my favorite genre of writing is food, with travel a close second, and the idea of reading of a personal journey toward spiritual growth seemed a great way to begin the new year. Well, it is a great way to start the new year - just not with this book.Right from the get-go, I was struck with Ms. Gilbert's selfishness and self-absorption, glaringly evident in the handling of her marriage and life, in her 'me, me me, poor little me' tone. In her writing, this quality does not diminish throughout her journey; conversely, it gets stronger with every page, ad nauseum.If your stomach is strong enough for a dose of flagrant self-aggrandizement, buy this book and a roll of Tums. If not - don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia","review":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This book is not worth buying. It's a story of self loathing. The book is stuffed full of self pity. The author writes page after page about how depressed she is and how bad her life is. She is shallow, and I got tired of the book after only a few pages. The author spends the whole book feeling sorry for herself for NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN SHE GOT A DIVORCE AND SPLIT WITH HER BOYSFRIEND. The author is PETTY AND SHALLOW and has no clue about what a really bad life is like. I feel like I got burned for my money with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying read","review":"The author doesn't venture beyond her own world and perceived woes, despite her travels. Comes off as self-absorbed and shallow. A disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"This is a book that I enjoyed very much reading. It also came in a timely manner and in the condition that i expected since i bought it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not written in a Godly way","review":"Well,,this is not what I think God had intended for us Christ Followers to read. It's about love more than a godly woman,,I feel. I Would not recommend to a Christan woman of faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been really good without all the cliches","review":"I saw the film before reading the book so I had very low expectations as I thought the film was mindless rubbish and still I was disappointed. I cannot believe this was on the New York Times bestseller list for 199 weeks! The book has more substance than the film (which isn't saying much) but unfortunately the author seems to get bogged down in cliches. Having travelled to all three countries, the author presents them in the most stereotypical, cookie-cutter way which is a shame because I suspect there is real depth in there somewhere but it doesn't come through in this book. Some of the parts about meditation in India are interesting but the characters are cardboard cut-outs and the author seems constantly self-conscious about the image she is projecting. Cultural stereotypes never make good reading. I wanted to find a moment of depth or revelation but it's about as deep as a mills and boon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty average...","review":"Story was kinda slow. Don't see what all the hype is about. Even watched the movie and found that quite a drag. Won't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book was quite a bit more boring than I expected. I began reading it a few days before I left for my trip to Italy, hoping to get a surge of energy for the trip ahead. I attempted to read it on the plane but was so uninterested that I could not finish the book. It lacked substance. There was no exciting, high point of the story. I felt that I was being dragged along through this boring trip. A trip to these places is something that many people will never do in their lifetime. I think that is why this book drew the attention of so many people. Books are supposed to be exciting and take you to places you'll never see. But after reading it, I was not impressed. I was hoping for a wild journey of a woman finding herself. I did not expect it to be so shallow and uninteresting. It did not give me the inspiration I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"This book was okay. Kinda slow at parts, and I got irritated with her because I felt like she was constantly having to justify everything she did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for everyone!","review":"Eat, Pray, Love is an amazing experience! Following Elizabeth through her experiences was wonderful and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The revelations that she uncovers are things that most people learn in the first grades of Sunday School. The punishing rituals and silly disciplines are ridiculous.This was hard reading, her writing seems hysterical like every thought that ever ran through her head ended up on paper and in this book. It was exhausting."},{"rating":"1","title":"get it from the library","review":"A friend recommended this book to me. I looked forward to reading it but it took me WEEKS to read this book. And I MADE myself finish it. When a writer engages me I can read quickly. I wasn't crazy about her style or narrative. She seemed a bit self aborbed and superficial. Yes, I get that its her own observations and experiences but most of the time, I felt like 'get over yourself already'. People deal with broken hearts every day and don't have this much drama. Its as much the time that heals as anything that you 'do'. It was a pass to me - I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book started off great and the first section of the book definitely delivers. It's a blast to live vicariously through her as she enjoys the pleasures (minus one significant one) of Italy. The second section really gets bogged down in an uninteresting and even a bit hokey trip to an ashram. The third section picks up a bit but the book starts to feel too much like a personal diary and has nothing profound to say. My interest and the strong writing both seem to peter out as the book goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-absorbed!","review":"I really did not understand what all they hype was about this book. I found her to be very self-oriented and unrealistic about life. I just did not care what happened to this woman and could not believe her choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fraud","review":"I want to express my thanks to the reviewers here who managed to soothe my Gilbert battered soul. This woman conveys about as much spirituality as the weeds in my garden. Somehow I did manage not to contribute one cent to her pocket, got it from the library, and then insisted I see it through to give the presumed knowledgeable reviewers a chance. I have generally viewed them with some skepticism, much preferring reader reviews to the \\"experts.\\" I think I'm vindicated.By the time this con artist wants us to believe that she finds \\"love\\" between the sheets and commonplace lust and sex, I was ready to pay my own price on the bathroom floor. Now she is apparently writing a book about marriage. Will the public wake up to this cheat posing as a writer only to end up demeaning the written word and our intelligence?The good that can come of this is that we may just turn into our own reviewers and learn to see through the deception, hype, and hoopla."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that WOULD NOT end - hated the political comments","review":"I agree with some others - I thought it was a self indulgent trip with lots of money for a book that was to be written ( and a movie somewhere in the works). I did not like her political \\"anti-president\\" comments - very obvious she was a far left liberal. I have a friend that always asks - \\"what book are you reading now?\\" and i say - still, the book that wouldn't end. I wanted to get through it - thinking that there must be something wonderful in it - I\\"m just not there yet. Well, I'm done with the book and it never happened. The book was just OK for me - I'm glad I can finally move on to something new!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"I really enjoyed the book . I recommend to to all women of any age, it really opens your eyes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to its hype","review":"after hearing so much about this book as the best thing written in years, i was somewhat disappointed. it's a good travel story and a nice read about one woman's journey into and then out of herself, but i'd prefer anne lamott anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"self-indulgent read","review":"Although the author is quite self-indulgent, you can't help but love her. I would guess that women everywhere (and some men) will envy the total abandonment of responsibility and the submergence into the soul. Every other paragraph made me laugh out loud. I would recommend this book to anyone over 25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I only was able to read half of this book, before I moved on to another book. This book was soooooo self absorbed that it was irritating. I can not understand all of the hype that Oprah gave this book. Usually the books she recommends are a lot better than this. By the time I read half way through her trip in India, I could not stand another minute of her egotistical chatter. Do yourself a favor, skip this book all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read","review":"I was truly disappointed at the book. I was most upset that this book was on the best seller's list for so long. The author was self-absorbed, pretentious, insincere, childish...shall I go on? The writing style was annoying. Don't waste your money buying the book and support bad literature by giving her any loyalty fee. Check it out from the library if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Absorption in three different time-zones","review":"I couldn't even make it to Indonesia. I had become too bored with the authors so called \\"insights\\" on life. I am wondering if the author's friends are as bored by snapshots of her trips as I was by her writing. Typical New York liberal crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't relate","review":"I'm sorry but I couldn't even get half way through this book. I couldn't relate to the main character finding her selfish and spoiled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying trip","review":"Interesting, insightful and honest. Easy to read. Women are often accused of being self-absorbed when they simply are living for themselves. Who else should she live for? Self-centered is not a bad thing, if the self is striving for truth and happiness. And look what she achieved in the process: a home for her Balinese friend, a book enjoyed and loved by many (even if reviled by some), enriching experiences for herself and many of the people with whom she formed bounds on her journey. Would her time have been better spent working for a corporation, having and caring for a baby she didn't want? Being true to yourself seems a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so popular...?","review":"As I read this book, I could not figure out why it was so popular among the masses, and why it has spent so much time on the bestseller list.But upon a quick internet search, I learned the reason why...it's been blessed by the hands of the almighty Oprah.The book is o.k., but definitely nothing spectacular. People, wake up...think for yourself, make your own decisions. Oprah could recommend Webster's Dictionary and it would land on the bestseller's list tomorrow. Sad. This says so much about the state of society today.Also sad is how many people apparently connect with this very needy writer. Strong women can live without a man (and I'm a man)...but this author can't get them off her mind. Be an individual for godsakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I'm sorry I wasted money and time reading any of this book. Luckily I only read half of it before I decided that I could not spend any more time on the thoughts or words of a self-absorbed, spoiled brat. I'm truly in shock that this is selling so well. It is drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, self absorbed...","review":"She really has a cushy life - how many people could take a year off to 'find themselves', especially in their middle thirties? She eats her way through Italy and gains weight - but hey, she NEEDED to gain as her terrible ex-husband had made a real stink about the property division, and she had lost weight worrying about this. No one else has ever had divorce problems. Well, not like hers as she is so special. She then goes to India to live in an ashram - a Special ashram where only a few people are allowed, by appointment - to 'find God', who is actually revealed to her... (did I mention she is special?) I think she was going on to the gorgeous island of Bali, where she was to find True Love, but I got so bored at this point I took it back to the library. She complains and complains about how bad her life has been. Well, everything is relative but to most people, her life is cushy."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG! 100 pages to say she is depressed","review":"I do not know what book everyone who is praising it is reading. Her ego wrote 80% of the book as I find the autobiography to be VERY wordy about her own emotions & lacks depth not to mention information on her lessons from mentors. If you are looking to read about an emotionally immature person in her later thirties, this book is for you. I have seen better insight from persons in their teens & twenties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointed!","review":"I was so excited to read this book after hearing good things and then seeing the author on Oprah. HOWEVER, shortly into the book I noticed a political reference that had no relevance to the particular point the author was making. It was a let down, but I moved on. Several pages later yet another political reference...this time much more critical and again totally lacking importance to the topic at hand. I couldn't help but drop the book to my lap, taking several minutes to decide whether I even wanted to continue reading. This is an excellent writer, she had me salivating at her brilliant style...till she had to infuse her political barbs (which I found insulting!). I don't care what her personal political beliefs are, just wish she would have kept them to herself! I read for PLEASURE...if I want to read about politics, I'll choose a book on that subject!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Selection for Stinker of the Year","review":"I completely agree with the other reviewers who found this woman's self-indulgent drivel unbearable. I made it halfway through the book before giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond self-indulgent!","review":"...Well, I was advised to read Eat, Pray and Love over the Holidays. I was thrilled to hear it was a national best seller...that is, until I reached a third of the book. I couldn't understand what the \\"all consuming crying\\" was all about. While living a life most people dream of, traveling to exotic lands, eating foods unknown to 99% of the world's population, and about as care free as you can imagine, what's the problem? No responsibilities beyond which musuem she's going to and how many hours she can pray, her incessant self-absorbtion was unbearable!My way of learning is to gain great knowledge and wisdom from the greatest teachers, of which she is not. I place her on the very bottom of the list of people I'd like to learn from. Not recommended at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed, Save the Politics","review":"I was turned off by her politics, spilling into many areas of her book about HERSELF. I agree with the person who advised to check it out from the library and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"me, Me, ME!","review":"Which was the \\"me decade\\"? Was it the '70s or '80s? For Gilbert it's apparently never ended. Even when she is being altruistic. Did anyone ever experience a bad divorce before, or have a relationship end badly? Poor, poor me. The solution: get a book contract and spend a year in exotic places finding yourself and a new husband. Not a bad gig if you can get it. But I did like the descriptions of Bali."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"with the intriguing title and description of this book, i felt the actual prose fell short of delivery. annoying rhetoric kept me skipping through the book hoping to get to the better part."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pass along book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It isn't a fast read, but still very enjoyable. It is written in three sections, and after each section I was sure I wouldn't enjoy her next location as much as the last. But each time I was glad to be wrong. Each location and focus for that visit was refreshing and educational. I learned so much from this book, and was eager to pass it along to my mother. I told her I thought she would love it and was eager to hear if my guess was correct. Within a day or so of her starting the book, she called me to say she was enjoying it as much as I had. Multiple times during her read she called to thank me for recommending the book. She then passed the book to one of her sisters!The only problem I have with the book is that after reading it, I crave world travel! I am very envious of her journey. But am happy I could at least experience through her words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed","review":"I found this book well-written but completely self-absorbed. Having traveled extensively myself, I found her writings about other culturesto be naive and patronizing at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This book has a few positive momemnts where you revel in the brilliance of the author's unhinged approach to food. Other than that I absolutely hated it the story of her life communicates another bored rich woman who shys away from family life to focus on herself and her 'self discovery'. Not in the least bit interesting..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray, No Love For This Book","review":"The whole idea of the book is how unhappy the author was in her dream job with a successful husband and large country home, so she abandoned it all to spend a year traveling to exotic places and not working. Basically a testimony to elitist upper class problems and in trying to be self depracating and relatable, she just created a larger void between herself and the readers she was trying to appeal to. Plus, the ending was stupid. Her message was basically that she opposed marriage, but couldn't be happy without a man.If you're going to write a book about not being able to handle your upper-class problems, so you combat them with an upperclass solution that a 17-year-old with a trust fund would come up with, you sure the heck shouldn't try to get a bunch of housewives living on 35K a year to read it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, pray, and self indulge","review":"Honestly with so many books, and so little time, I couldnt truly receommend anyone waste time on this drivel, albeit well written. It is trite, self indulgent and neither provocative nor engaging. GReat work if you can get it though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Reading","review":"I enjoyed the experiences in the book but I kind of just felt like I had been invited to the author's pity party. Good light read over summer though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introspection; good read.","review":"I felt like I was sitting down with Liss. She was open, honest, and very spiritual. I learned from it, and will reread it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of depth","review":"The stories of the travels and the description of those met along the way are entertaining, but I had a difficult time relating to the author. I think this is best shown when the Ashram staff chooses her for a hostess duty referred to as \\"Little Suzy Creamcheese\\". On a spiritual journey it is best to leave the sorority rush personality behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"EAT PRAY AND LOVE","review":"I AM SAVING THIS BOOK FOR MY TRIP TO OHIO.

Never heard someone complain SO VERY MUCH!","review":"Bought this book, as heard it was good, well about 50 of the 334 pages are actually good. Who does the author think she is, a Saint? Hint if all you want to read is someone endlessly complain about everything under the sun, then you will LOVE this book. Actually this is so hard to read, bores you to tears and HINT here Saints DID NOT complain. Not only complaining, who told this writer she could even write? Her grammar is poor, the metaphores make no sense, the descriptions leave you lacking that the entire Italian trip had me hating Italy...and I used to love the place. The movie on imdb does not sound like this book and let's hope they are throwing million of dollars away on a better story, this is just HORRIBLE. A very, very, very poorly, badly written book. I really want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Wouldn't recommend this book to any friends. Too many uses of the word \\"I\\" coming from a mentally challenged woman, extremely selfish in nature. Boring. Also, having been in 2 of the countries she spoke of, I do not agree with her opinion on life there.Yes, I too am a female."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got life experience?","review":"There are so many reviews and so much buzz here and elsewhere about this book. If you are considering whether to read this book or not, all I can say is that if you have lived a considered life, have travelled, maybe lived in another country or culture for awhile, read widely, and questioned yourself and/or your motives occasionally, you will probably not enjoy this book.In my view, Eat, Pray, Love appeals to the kind of woman who wishes she had time, freedom, and/or income to do the things Elizabeth Gilbert writes about. Reading the book is a way for ordinary women to live vicariously through someone else's travels and search for self. If you have already done any of this kind of inner work for yourself, in your own country or elsewhere, you will likely come away disappointed with the lack of depth in the book.If, however, you are looking for inspiration or courage to begin your own spiritual or physical travels, you might find this book worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair at best","review":"This is a readable book and I don't want to give the impression that it isn't. However, it is one of those non-stories we run into too often. Written from the author's point of view, she is not a likable character. She is a frustrating, confused person which, if she did not take herself so seriously and spend her life looking for easy spiritual solutions, she might seem sympathetic. The only parts of the book I liked, thus two stars instead of one, were her rants on the horrors of divorce and what it means to loose everything when you are the one who created everything. If you are female, you might like it more. If you have an over-eating disorder, consider reading it. If you feel running from your problems is a solution, you will love it. The last few chapters are actually pretty good, if you make it that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat, Pray & Love - save your money","review":"Wow, what a total disappointment. What else does this author write because there must be some reason this was so popular? Oprah maybe? Boring, self-serving, another poor me story. Its rare I want to throw a book at a wall. You have to be pretty bored to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must read it, borrow, don't buy","review":"Many book groups are reading this book, which is how I encountered it. It was a trial to get through. While I expected a book about a personal spiritual journey, I thought it would have relevance to most readers. This seemed instead to be a narcissistic exploration of the author's own emotional life. I wonder what a word count of the pronoun \\"I\\" would reveal? Her simplistic descriptions of the residents of India and Bali smacked of condescension. Read Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea if you would like to read an inspiring encounter with another culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore","review":"I was dying to read this after all the hype and had to special order it because my bookstore deemed it too hedonistic. That just increased the hype. Well, I was so bored. Poor lady rambled on endlessly and I took ages to finish it only because I was determined to get to Bali. I had to cheat and skim a lot while in India. Bali was much better but overall very disappointed. Year of Pleasures was a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that enthused","review":"I purchased this because it was the required text book for a class.

The first is simply as an exciting story, with star-crossed lovers, scheming rulers, and vast wars. Animation and artwork are quite good - it's twenty years old, as of this writing, but has lost nothing with age. At the next level it's a Romeo and Juliet story, but with startling differences in its denouement. Behind all that lies a thoughtful ecofable, all the more realistic as we put increasing demands on our water supplies.It's not a must-have for the anime fan, but very appealing anyway. You'll see some bloodless violence and romance that keeps its clothes on, but no truly disturbing themes. Enjoy!//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have book","review":"This book doesn't tell you everything that you need to know about the subject but it gives you a whole lot of information and sets you on your way.

That probably won't be happening here, though, because these have little jacks at the bottom of each phone, and they disconnect rather than breaking. They sound about the same as the 202s did, they weigh a little more, but they're comfortable and a good buy at $40."},{"rating":"2","title":"dj headphones","review":"These are awesome headphones!

I should have thrown more, I guess. The overall sound is OK, if I don't move at all, and if I can get them settled right. They're made of the kind of plastic that makes it sound like you have a couple of stryofoam cups over your ears. The headband was designed for something not human; it sits all wrong. The pad is comfy, though. The earholes are too small for my ears, and I'm no Prince Charles, either. Again, though, the pads are comfy. The replaceable wires seemed like a great idea at first, but the way they poke straight down out of the bottom of the cup, they rub my clothing and make a scraping noise in the aforementioned styrofoam cups. I think I bought Sennheiser because of some vague idea that Germans are good at this stuff, but I think I'll try some other nationality next time.

Her tips are factual and helpful, and this book is clearly not designed to give anyone an inferiority complex but instead, to help build self-esteem while teaching to enhance your natural assets.The information in this book could not possibly be outdated because DeMann's core philosophy is that the person and not the makeup should be the focus. Therefore, most of the tips in the book are aimed at the natural look, which can never be outdated.Bottom line: useful book written in an engaging style with many attractive photos.

A lot of them don't take more than 2 lines to explain in the book.There are a few good coin tricks, but they aren't 'self working' and involve palming. Some of the tricks aren't even coin tricks, they use bills.

I've never heard of a band mixing all the categories( that seemed to me to only work by themselves for the most part) and bring them together like this...and do it well! It's rare that you find music like this plus enjoy the voice that sings the lyrics. Sometimes you find a good 'band' but the lead singers tone disrupts the flow of the music.

Ambrose demonstrates that great people in History have overcome great obstacles, bolstered sometimes only by the loyalty of close friends. His chapter on Veterans was particularly inspiring, especially in his description of how two former Allied Soldiers -- one of whom was Richard Winters of Easy Company -- verbally defended a lecturing former German World War II officer from the ignorant accusations of a self-righteous student years after the war. Also inspiring was the chapter on the friendship of Lewis and Clark, as well as that of the lasting effects of the bonding of the men of Easy Company.

Never do any of these scenes have the missionary position. Basically the actors are never face to face. Is there a new union guideline forbidding to look one another in the face? Well anyhow they are all long boring so much so that the only way to stay awake is to fast forward them. And finally, if you want a plot forget it.

The Television title match between Johnny B. Badd & Arn Anderson was a solid bout even with the predictable ending. The Harlem Heat-Nasty Boys tag team match was a 15 minute non-ending psychologically mind-boggle. The Kevin Sullivan-Mr.T match was AWFUL!

Not really sure he chose \\"now\\" to act though as that's never really explained other than a tacked on last few chapters. I think some editor read the book and told the author that he never really explained why the first person was killed so go back and fix that...and he did...with some way out there explanation. I really wanted to like this book as I love spy/thriller types of books, but this one was a \\"C\\" as best.

The main character is a drunk and a parinoid one at that. Not worth picking up much less reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too snarky and exaggerated for my taste","review":"I picked up this novel expecting a fluid, suspenseful spy thriller. Unfortunately, it reads like a first attempt at a pulp novel. The protagonist (Micah Dalton) is not believable as a \\"real\\" human being, much less like a veteran intelligence officer and professional \\"cleaner.\\" I had to put the book down after a scene in which he kills two muggers in front of a small crowd of street urchins, only to burst into show tunes, a series of elaborate bows, and then shouting Shakespeare in the middle of the city streets at night - not exactly what you'd expect from someone whose job is to remove all traces that anything covert is under foot. Attempts at wit and cynicism by the author just come off as snarky and hyperbolic and story development is obscured behind spy/action film cliches. If you like your espionage cold, crisp, and intelligent, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good one","review":"Though hefty, do not be discouraged by the size of this one. Wordy, but once the hook is set you won't put this down. Strong descriptive language takes us to various locales and shows some familarity with the world's different places. Tough action, tho some of it occurs off stage. A sharp eye, educated commentary and a wicked wit, help the reader along. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I bought both this book and his latest book,The Orpheus Deception, based on the written synopsis on line. The were both a waste of time reading. First a great deal of the dialog was in Italian. If you don't speak Italian its very confusing. Also the main character, Dalton, spends most of his time having halucinations. Stories that have the villian appearing at will and knowing everything about the main character while the main character is in a constant fog when it comes to the villian are not at all interesting!I threw away both books only half read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus H. Christ This Writer Is Damn Good!","review":"Stieg Larrson might be number one on the BestSellers List withhis \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest,\\" but David Stoneoutshines him in every way.Reading David Stone's novels is a multi-sensory charge! Hestimulates all your senses: smell, touch, sight, hearing andsounds! What a marvel of writing!In the midst of a tight psychological spy thriller he displaysam amzing ability to write the crispest dialogues of humor.You have only to read the latest of Clancy, Thor, Flynnand de Carre to know they are going downhill....peaked.Stale.Not David Stone! His work, like Brian Haig, just keepsgetting better and better.What a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"want to forget it","review":"Echelon makes one think of security, government, encryption, eavesdropping. In this book there is some government.OK, so, onto the story... which I can not make out.I'm as much a fan of Carlos Castaneda (yes, same guy) as the next person, but this is not Castaneda-ish, or spy-ish or much of anything.Good luck to the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"This seemed like an author who watched every spy film ever made and decided to incorporate them into a novel. At first our hero is angry, solid, a spy, then he is hilucinating on peyote and doesn't know it. Would this happen to James Bond? I don't think so. At one point he is celibate for 10 years and the next he is lusting after an Italian woman whom he just met. I must admit that I only got about half-way through the book and decided that I couldn't handle anymore. If you can, good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters not very Culpable","review":"It's very distracting & not feasible for a character to have visions and plot leads on peyote/mescaline incorporated in the main storyline. I was dissappointed & am sorry I used my rewards card for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent spy thriller","review":"This was a very well written book that was exciting, intense, and hard to put down. The main character of Dalton, a CIA \\"cleaner\\", was very well developed, and even the minor characters were vividly brought to life as Dalton goes from Italy to London and all over the western US in pursuit of a mysterious, sadistic killer that uses hallucinogens to subdue his victims and brutally torture them. The climax provided a burst of excitement, though I was hoping for maybe a bit more of a sustained thrill, and after that the author took awhile to tie up loose ends and end the book, but overall it was very well done and I look forward to reading the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"This is a fantastic DVD! The video is clear and well directed, the sound is crisp, the whole groups' voices come through beautifully. Never having had the chance to see Harry Chapin live, or even on TV, this DVD fills a void in my enjoyment of his music.My only negative comment is that the family commentaries sometimes \\"walk over\\" the music. That being said, the commentaries are otherwise delightful- entertaining, educational, and a wonderful tribute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Collection...","review":"This is a nice collection of footage - some never compiled to dvd, and some taken from other dvds.

At the time of this writing, Amazon has priced that dvd at about $10 cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"too little for the price","review":"This book was purchased for non-credit class on the subject of cancer. I feel it is written for an introduction to the subject but does not give the class much to discuss. I would have preferred a text with much more content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andybody Who Cares Should Read This","review":"An excellent, excellent book in several ways. Anybody who cares - about society - conservative, moderate, or liberal should read this. All economists, political scientists, politicians, and students of these fields should read this book carefully. The Economist's Tale is a true morality play. It looks at the way economics plays out in real-life using the framework of food policy in Sierra Leone. The author is not against market forces - but as economic theory has recognized in the last few decades - markets work (or don't work) with many attendant frictions and imperfections. Unfortunately, in the tale told within this book, people die because of these frictions.The Economist's Tale is also quite interesting and riveting as a read. It is also a quick read. One learns much about Sierra Leone among other non-economic subjects. It appears nobody else has rated this book yet - which tends to indicate that few people have read it - a sad state of affairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read ... just not for fanboys","review":"A delightfully sarcastic guide to Herr Shatner's life and career. As a Star Trek fan who finds most \\"Trekkies\\" humorless and scary, I would advise them to stay away. This book is way too irreverent for fanboy tastes, but a lot of fun for those who don't take Shatner too seriously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and readable","review":"I couldn't disagree more with anim8r's assessment. Only the most rabid fanboy could find more than a few errors in this very exhaustive volume. I've been a Shatner/Trek fan for 25 years and I found it very well-researched. OK, the quizzes are lame, but where else can you find out where Shatner's dog is buried?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I was very disappointed. This COULD have been a fun book if the author had bothered to try, but he apparently couldn't be bothered, and just ended up putting out a waste of time.

I originally picked up the book out of curiosity, but now I feel sorry for Mr. Shatner for having to endure idiots such as this author. I also feel a bit sorry for the author considering he actually thinks this passes as humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The main problem with this book is....","review":"That it takes 90 percent of its information (pretty much word for word) from a horribly inaccurate unauthorized boiography called \\"Captain Quirk.\\" It almost seems as if Author Robert Schnakenberg merely bought a copy of \\"Captain Quirk\\" and copied down all the information for the \\"Shatnerica.\\" And as I said, it's WORD FOR WORD! \\"Captain Quirk\\" used trashy tabloids like \\"Star\\" and \\"Enquirer\\" for its information, and also printed second hand rumors as fact. So, the \\"Shatnerica\\" is loaded with false information, and more screw ups than I can count (not just about Star Trek, but easily found facts on Shatner's life as well).So what is good about this book? Pretty much nothing, although it does have some cool rare photos.

It's these memories that I fondly think of whenever I throw \\"Punk In Drublic\\" in the cd player, and after 6 years, it's still my favourite punk rock record ever. The first time I heard it I didn't know what to think. It was the first time I'd ever been displayed to this fast, crazy type of rock music and I was confused.. but boy did I love it. Linoleum is easily the best song on the album but this doesn't mean the others lack intensity, as any die-hard NOFX fan will agree that they clearly don't. I don't know, I love this album with all my heart, it's their best to date and they will not top it no matter what. Whatever, don't be influenced by what I've said, go out and buy it if you already haven't and experience it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably one of the best punk rock albums","review":"This is probably one of the best punk rock albums in history. It captures the fully integration of El Hefe to the band and it's at its apex from beginning to end. It includes great tracks as The Cause, Linoleum, The Brews among many others wonderful songs.Historically it precedes the whole punk-wave that would end up so badly.Lyrically it's flawless, not as funny as later albums but still very strong and aggressive.Musically it just does not let you rest.Production-wise, it's very well done.

This is the NOFX that I loved; they kept things simple, and the lyrics were more personal than the dragging \\"political\\" lyrics of NOFX today (which aren't \\"political\\" so much as they are \\"fat mike trying to be as punk rock as possible no matter how hypocritical it'll make him).I think the songs here are consistently good, and their very fun too; you get none of the emotional baggage of later NOFX releases, and they can sometimes make a point without trying to lecture you (though most of the time they're just having fun).best tracks: Linoleum, Leave it Alone, Jeff Wears Birkenstocks?, Fleas, Lori Myers(even for the subject matter alone), and The Cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Many people think this album was the last of Nofx's ability to label themselves as punk rock and retain a sense of dignity. I happen to disagree with these people. Anyhoo, this album is a real classic. It's when Nofx really got there s..tuff together. Fat Mikes story telling seems much more fine tuned in Punk in Drublic than in more recent things. Contains tons of energy and clever lyrics. Anyways, to summurize:This is one of the best punk albums ever and if you don't like this...you probably don't like punk. But don't feel bad....punk doesn't like you either."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOWZA! NOFX IS GOD","review":"When someone utters the word punk a collection of bands loom in mind, but of all the minstrels, NOFX reigns champion on punk's throne. The fact that their quality is packaged with extraordinary brilliance builds their own wall to halt other punk bands from ever engaging or defeating NOFX in their own musical genre. From So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes to the highly embraced, The Decline, NOFX incessantly offers something new to rejoice about. And Punk in Drublic is one of punk's finest hours. With the classic and my all-time favorite NOFX song, Linoleum, and other amazing tracks, Punk in Drublic is one album that should not be taken for granted. The entire achievement hosts catchy and insightful lyrics, speedy guitar riffs, along with superb guitar solos (The Happy Guy). Punk in Drublic is arguably NOFX's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Wait A Second","review":"When people are saying this is the best punk album ever, that's quite ridiculous. I know there are at least two NoFX albums that are much better than this. \\"Ribbed\\" and the album everyone hates because it's raw \\"Liberal Animation\\". I read a review for this album that said My Hear Is Yearning an opera was 10/10 because of diversity! WTF! I didn't pick this cd up for an opera song, or a folk song. It's called diversity in a PUNK song. Diversity doesn't always meen a different genre, it can also meen a different style of punk. I also disagree when people say that this album get's five stars because sometimes you can't understand what the lead singer is saying.Well this cd really is good, but I'm sick of people saying this is the best cd because there is one diverse opera song.Best songs- Linoleum/Jeff Wears Birkenstocks/ Punk Guy"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love it if you love a laugh or punk","review":"This cd is great from Linoleum to Scavenger Type, it will keep you laughing while rocking the whole thing through Mike, Hefe, Melvin and Smelly know how to do it...

This album is second to only \\"So Long...\\" if that. It's a tough call. All I can say is the songs I listed above are six reasons you should buy this album.I just can't believe that this album is almost ten years old. It doesn't seem like it.Anyway, if you have two NOFX albums, this should be one of them. If you don't own any, this would be an excellent introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"This album is definitely one of my favorite albums ever.

I understand the drills are intended to enhance your vocabulary, but you have no idea what you're saying in Spanish.

On the other hand, if you are expecting a healthy discussion of the basis of, rationale for, and definitions of feminist theories, look elsewhere. The book is rife with shakey feminist theories which serve as premises to even still more outrageous conclusions, without any attempt to justify the premises themselves. As a result, it ends up a house of cards, without a strong foundation, puffed up far more than it ever should.

Price's set of provocative ideas on the origins of Christianity Deconstructing Jesus (1-57392-758-9, $31.95) provides a focus on the historical Jesus, examining the meaning of contrasts between the religious figure and historical facts and offering new textual insights for Christian origins and interpretations. The works of other scholars are incorporated into an absorbing survey of Jesus' life and times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will make you think","review":"Robert M. Price has a knack for coming up with intriguing hypotheses when it comes to Biblical criticism. He makes no claims to have all the answers, and presents a whole load of interesting material from the ancient world that will at the very least throw some much needed doubt onto the field of historical Jesus research. I wouldn't say that this book is aimed at the average layman, but rather at those who have done a fair amount of reading on this topic already. There are a few long portions of the book that present the traditions of Jesus from non-biblical sources and I could imagine that the average reader would become disinterested.

In a word, \\"Aaaargh!\\" What a painful experience that was. This CD is total derivative rock/metal crap.

EXCELLENT BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE BOOK,Author a treasure for the culinary world","review":"At 24.50 dollars this book is the bargain of the century. And that is not an exaggeration. Almost a thousand pages filled with meticulously researched information. For example Boullaiblaise is not an easy dish to make away from the Mediterranean sea. The author makes sure you will choose suitable substitutions to create this aromatic and beautiful dish in your American kitchen while giving you detailed history and background on the recipe. Perfect!I have the highest praises for Mr. Wright's work. There are many \\"Mediterranean\\" cookbooks written by those who have a very superficial understanding of the region. One monumental example to this would be Joanne Weir's 1994 \\"From Tapas to Meze\\" book which was just filled with errors. Another lightweight book on Mediterranean cooking was Renee Salaman's cookbook. If you've tired of these poor quality books on the region, please go buy Clifford's book. I promise you'll thank me. A++++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediterranean Feast","review":"A pretentious and extremely poorly organized book which purports to be both history and a cook book. The history sections are, in many instances, superficial and/or pure speculation and the recipes are mostly regurgitations of recipes in other (and better cook books). The recipes that are not regurgitations are rather arcane and, in my view, there is good reason for them to remain that way. Thus there is a recipe which calls for lima beans in a micro-wavable package. As to organization, at pp 32-33 there is a recipe for pasta with tomato sauce which precedes a section entitled Money and Capitalism. It is impossible to find any rational organization that is remotely useful to a cook. An article on artichokes explains that they are labor intensive to prepare, but like lobster worth the effort. There are simply too many good cook books oj the market to buy this overpriced one.

He is an Arab-studies scholar before this, and so it seems he finds time and again places where he can make digs on Christians of the past. I had a hard time getting past his little remarks to get to the real meat of his history.As far as the recipes...they are a bit disappointing. Like the other reviewer, they are scattered throughout the book, seemingly without organization. While trying to write about true historical Mediterranean cuisine, he throws in modern recipes from friends at various spots....almost like an afterthought. There isn't much rhyme or reason to where or why recipes are in a certain section or chapter.And it is very longwinded..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenox Butterfly Meadow China","review":"Love the Lenox butterfly meadow collection!

I had no idea from the cover or liner notes that this book was going to mention God and Christianity in every paragraph, along with the implication that if you're not \\"in\\" on both, you're just a bad person.Don't get me wrong... I have no issue with Christians, but I do have issues with self-obsessed, self-righteous characters thinking God has absolutely nothing better to do than answer their inane prayers about nothing. There is no message in this book apart from God seems to sit around all day, letting the third world starve, while He grants the wishes of girls pining over boys. Ridiculous. Badly written, whiny and plain stupid. Some Christians need to re-prioritize, and this author definitely needs to have a good think about what life is really all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"she's THAT girl","review":"I recently discovered Christian chick-lit. I was psyched to find fiction that was witty, funny, and contemporary; however, when I encountered this book, I was severely disappointed.Ashley is THAT girl - the one so obsessed with finding Mr. Right that she doesn't know which way is up. I've met plenty of them throughout my life and they're generally the girls I try to avoid. All I wanted to do was smack Ashley and scream \\"Grow up!\\" She's immature and shallow and definitely someone I would never want to meet. If we were at a party, she would be the girl I tried to avoid at all costs. And it's incredibly draining to read a book about a person like that.Overall, there's nothing unique or surprising about this book. It's just another girl freaking out about being single and hunting men like they're rabbits. To be honest, I think it does a disservice to women who recognize that there's more to life. As a woman, I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste...","review":"I commented on the first book of this series.

Way to feed the \\"Stereotypical\\" Christian woman in her early 30's dying to get married even though the reader feels no connection with either of the men she's dating. The main character Ashley is self-centered and materialistic yet Christian???? The book itself was horrific and I'm shocked Kristin Billerbeck has a publisher.

Almost every song's good, especially \\"Self Esteem\\" and \\"So Alone\\".The only problem with this album is that it suffers from what many punk rock albums do; tiredness. When you get over 40 minutes of the same sound, you sometimes get tired of it. I always find that it's more fun listening to individual songs than the whole album.

Even though The Offspring have driven down a more poppy road in recent years, one cannot dispute the greatness of this album. I'll admit, it took a while to really get into this album (as well as other Offspring albums) but when it all finally clicked, it was well worth it, and the true worth of this album revealed itself. The in-your-face songs flow very well, with Dexter Holland's incredible vocals leading the charge for Noodles' guitar work combined with great bass lines and drumwork.

Bad Habit is road rage at its best. What Happened to You? is a fun, upbeat song. Nitro and Genocide deliver aggressive instrumentals. Besides being good songs, Something to Believe In, It'll Be a Long Time, and Not the One also have deeper meanings in the lyrics, which has become a hallmark of the Offspring's music.

I still had some of these on VHS tape but once I started watching these in order I realized I had only seen about half of the episodes that had actually aired. WOTW was one of many first-run syndicated programs that was on in 1989 and 1990 mostly shown at odd hours. The second season took a drastic turn from the first season that you either like or you hate. I found the intensity and the pace to be quite hectic at times and literally would be on the edge of the couch so to speak.What's great today watching these is seeing the old computers, the BIG car phone, and the clothes and haircuts of the time! What is more prominent in the second season is the battle between the aliens and the Humans, and there are many close shaves and our heroes wind up in several tight spots that they always seem to just get out of. The last episode does wrap things up nicely albeit a pity I would have enjoyed a third season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool series, but bad \\"the complete series collection\\"","review":"Great set, except... I thought this was gonna be a nice complete edition boxed set, or something similar. Instead it is just season one (nicely slipcased) and season two (plain dvd case) bound together with plastic wrap. Not so cool in my opinion. They should have made the extra effort to make a nice (fold out?)box. This way it only looks cheap. But for the contents, great to be able to watch the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"no ironhorse","review":"one of the best characters in season 1 was paul ironhorse played by richard chavez. in season 2 the actor was killed off in the premiere episode. i like adrian paul but they should have kept richard chavez. another character that was killed off needlessly was norton drake."},{"rating":"2","title":"War of the Worlds review","review":"The wait for this to be released was well worth it.

As much as I enjoyed the first season of this show, the second season was so much better. This season is darker and serious than the first, and far more exciting. Unlike the first season, which started out good but fell off the tracks about halfway through, this entire season is solid. The only complaint I have with the storyline is the inconsistent continuity, especially with the ( obviously rushed) final episode. However, that is a small price to pay. The copies look great, especially when compared to the old ones I recorded from the tv in 1989. I could not be happier that they've finally released this."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Of The Worlds Season 2 - 1989 flashback!","review":"Finally, season 2 comes to dvd. I am so happy to get this finally. The only way I have seen this since 1989 was on bootleg dvd, which is pretty bad compared to the video quality of this new set. The picture is almost perfect, 9/10. The audio is pretty much perfect, 10/10. Too bad there's no extras though. One episode, one of my favorites, Time to Reap, is what I watched first. I noticed on this one there is a lot of dark scenes, which on the bootleg dvd was very hard to see what you're looking at. On this studio-released set, it is so much better, super clear, and no \\"blockiness\\", or \\"pixelation\\", if you know what I mean. If you're a die hard fan of War of the Worlds, get it.

Paramount is the only study that does not add to their shows these options, I remind you gentlemen, that in the United States, the second most spoken language is Spanish, followed by French, Thai, Korean, Portuguese and so on. So, what is your excuse?. In an increasingly globalized world Paramount shows an incredible xenophobia, and definitely disturbing.

Mary Pickford was an actress of amazing charm and subtlety, very different from the image most of us have of her today, and even without a copy of one of her films nearby(you're going to want to seek them out), the photographs show it, and the wonderful text by Kevin Brownlow supports it.

The first mix is the M*A*S*H Classic Mix (7:41) and is American house in its feel. The mix is slower in beats than the Almighty mix and is very well concieved. But for me the best mix is the Almighty Mix(7:44) and is one of their best. To me it is a harder and more agressive sound than what they normally mix. The keyboards swirl more harder and there is a great almost acappella part near the middle to showcase her voice to nice effect.

This type of music was boring when the Clash did it back in the Seventies, why rehash it now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY SUCK","review":"What a terrible band. They try way to hard in their videos. They act like they are punk but they are not. They wear the spikey hair, I would compare them to Good Charlotte (wannabe Punkers). First of all the songs on this cd were pretty terrible. They try to hard in their songs. They should focus on being a real band instead of fake so they could have time to write actual good songs. What a terrible band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS HORRIBLE!","review":"All the songs sound the same.The singer can't sing.Some of the songs are only a minute long.It sounds like a dog went through the slaughterhouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET!!!","review":"This is by far my fav Rancid CD since I heard it back in '94...I wasnt able to take it out of my cd player for weeks. And now 9 years later I still listen to it. Its catchy as hell...I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, not yet great","review":"The one that brought punk into the mainstream, this is almost as good as out come the wolves. a lot better than life won't wait, and is definately worth buying. Salvation, Radio, you need this album. I say not yet great because i think that out come the wolves is incredible, and this is almost as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiration to my heart!!","review":"Great video. The Bishop has always been on the right track in his speaking. This video is a nice one to add to your collection. It's one to pick up when you've been to church but didn't get enough church for that day. If you need uplifting at anytime of the day or night. This is worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I thought it was going to be him talking but It was just like attending his church. Not worth the money. I probibly could have just watched it on YouTube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous live recording w/Vickers & Freni (Karajan cond.)","review":"It's difficult to imagine getting more for your opera dollar than with this 2 disc set. A 1971 live recording with the great Jon Vickers, a sumptuous Mirella Freni in fine voice, Peter Glossop as a convincing Iago and von Karajan at the helm conducting the Vienna Philharmonic & the Vienna State State Opera Chorus. I was hesitant to purchase this, thinking the sound quality would be third-rate. Well, surprise, surprise, the sonics are quite good and the performances of the highest quality! If you have the 1960 studio recording w/Vickers et al., you will be thrilled to hear how Jon Vickers's understanding of the role has grown. For the Verdi lover, this is a must-have addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable Recording Quality","review":"After listening to this set I was able see why Jon Vickers is considered the greatest Otello ever. This could have been the Otello to live with if it had not been presented in recording that sounds like being captured by a personal recording device (possibly portable). Voices come across as tolerable but orchestra and chorus sound unbearably dry and distorted all over.The only credit I can give to this set is that it led me to look for another set with Karajan, Vickers, and Freni in it, and I found one. It's from EMI. Now you have the recording of a deeply moving psychological drama completed with professinal engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable effort","review":"This book covers not only a large amount of time, but also a great deal of topics that are of significance to anyone interested in all things social, musical, journalistic, and even ecumenical in America from 1856-1929. Though there is a much heavier concentration of articles from the 1920s, this only seems natural as the first generally acknowledged recording for jazz was ODJB's 1917 effort.This is a brilliant resource for any library or researcher and well worth its cost. It is an exhaustive collection that would take countless hours of work to track down individually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmatched","review":"Martin Cruz Smith never lets me down!!!! I would not call it one of his best, however very satisfied and enjoyed the read very very much!!! Have recommended this book to many MCS's fans, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for one of the best, exciting reads!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolves Eat Dogs","review":"I received this book ahead of schedule and it was everything I expected. The book was well written, overall, and has a unique storyline. I recommend Martin Cruz Smith books because I was first amazed by Gorky Park, then Polar Star, and then Red Square (I consider them to be a unique trilogy). Wolves Eat Dogs is just as good as any of the other books. The main character, Arkady Renko, is just as Russian as ever. His determination to find the answers to the mysteries that surround him is very fulfilling, if you like detective stories. Everything he touches is radioactive, either realistically or euphemistically. I love to root for him as a detective and as a human being. Do yourself a favor, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolves Eat Dogs","review":"Searching for the reason behind a mysterious suicide, Arkady Renko ends up in the radioactive zone around Chernobyl.Like the author's earlier works, this novel transcends its mystery-thriller genre in its quality. Smith has a perfect eye for the telling detail, the understated comment. The novel's dark, ironic, threatening mood, with its flashes of light in which human interaction defies death, never falters.At times, the plot meanders, and here and there it drops a beat. However, the story's other good qualities make up for that. In particular, the \\"villain\\", despite committing the heinous crime of a long dialogue infodump explaining what he did and how and why, after which he of course intends to shoot the progagonist, is interesting because to many readers, including myself, his motivations won't seem villainous at all. For the most part, this novel avoids the obvious and demonstrates a mastery of brutally effective understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing and disjointed","review":"Wolves Eat Dogs, my first book by Martin Cruz Smith seemed poorly written, confusing, and the kind of book where you should have already read all the author's previous works in order to figure out what is going on. I was lost trying to discern who was who amidst the myriad of potentially important secondary characters. I was disappointed in the character development of most of the people in the book. I had high expectations for this author and was disappointed because it seemed like some of the verbiage was a direct translation from Russian to English; it was disjointed and didn't make sense sometimes. The setting in the ruins of Chernobyl were extremely intriguing and the plot was wrapped up in the end, however it was confusing along the way. Don't waste your time unless you are a fan of this guy's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleak as always","review":"Martin Cruz Smith is one of the few crime and spy writers who can actually write. I never find myself scanning pages with him and that is really all that needs to be said, isn't it? The story is interesting, the fates of the characters bleak, and yet, human warmth and spirit is present, making this, as the other Renko novels, a great read. For new readers, this is a good place to start, although I would savor the whole series from the start with Gorky Park...If you want a non-Arkady Renkoo novel of Smith's, I suggest November 6th, a really great read. Anyway, the point remains: Smith is a rare literary talent on the \\"crime scene\\". I recommend this or any of his Renko novels heartily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly mediocre","review":"This novel seems so rushed and half-hearted. It doesn't come close to the early Trilogy of Renko novels. Character relationships seem undefined and unbelievable; the use of a mute child for Renko to talk to as a source of exposition seems amateurish; Renko initiates another sexual encounter but this time there's no connection or passion; the plot and climax aren't nearly as powerful as they should be, it left me with one of those \\"THAT was it?\\" feelings. Renko's antagonists clearly state their intentions to slow him down over and over again and in ways that are far too obvious; where did the subtlety go in Cruz Smith's writing? Maybe Renko should have been left alone after Red Square."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mystery in the wasteland","review":"I have really liked all of Smith's Renko novels, but this one was not as good as the others. Too bleak a landscape perhaps. Still worth reading, especially for those who liked Gorky Park, Polar Star, Havana Bay and Red Square. But, raad those first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruz has made me a patriot","review":"Hapless, dour Arkady views his surroundings with a critical eye, as we might should we be unlucky enough to find ourselves in present day Cuba, Russia, or Chernobyl. Though I've never been to any of these places, through Cruz's apt descriptions I've experienced them all right along side Arkday; at once appalled, wary, depressed, and wanting justice. Chernobyl is brought to life from the still smoldering ashes, and like Arkady, Cruz wastes few words in developing the story and characters. If you enjoyed Gorky Park you won't be disappointed in Wolves Eat Dogs. Cruz's books would give spark to a social studies curriculum for listless students."},{"rating":"2","title":"chernobyl travalogue","review":"I think this is the best work that Smith has done. It is difficult to classify. The first 1/3 is a very good thriller. Then we get to the aftermath of Chernobyl and everything changes. The characters, landscape, and reflections on the Chernobyl disaster dominate the book, take it above the whodunit level in my view. The whodunit drives the plot, the attempts on Renko's life etc. but after a while who cares who killed Ivanov? At the end Smith cleans up the loose ends in a workmanlike fashion but Chernobyl is what stays long after the book is closed.As usual the quality of Smith's writing is very good, \\"Bobby Hoffman was a mollusk without its shell, a tender American morsel on the Russian ocean floor.\\", \\"To vodka, the first line of radiation defense.\\" \\"...the pickles crisp and sour, with perhaps a hint of strontium.\\" and so on.I can see where some readers, expecting a thriller, were dissapointed, I was not. 4 stars rather than 5 because it is difficult to classify by genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God I'm not Russian","review":"If any book brings out the bleakness of Russia, then this is it. Frankly, I thought it was a great thriller and an incisive commentary on modern Russia. Again thank god, I'm not a Russian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a better editor","review":"This is the most disjointed story I have ever read by Martin Cruz Smith. Was his editor on vacation or just asleep? What's with the telephone call to Eva and the taped soccer match? Give me a break. When I read the sample on my kindle it sounded like a great intrigue. Once I had paid and downloaded the total book I realized the story was going absolutely nowhere.I am chagrined to think I suggested this to a friend, who downloaded it but decided not to finish it.I feel cheated. Not out of money but out of a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"At most, a travel guide to Chernobyl.","review":"Smith's Arkady Renko series has run out of gas with this book.A non existent plot, devoted to the merits of our hero's tripto Chernobyl, populated by a bizarre cast of wooden characters invites the question: \\"Honey, do I really need to finish this 335 page piece of excess, or, can I go to sleep now?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough air suction","review":"Don't cook even one cheeseburger. The smoke will fill your house and set off your alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a love story","review":"Crossing over cultural barriers a young woman does what she feels is right and finds a way to help wartime efforts in a foreign country by pushing social status and norms of women at the time.So much more than a love story or a war story, this contains vivid pictures of life in many stages and contrasts of socio-economic status all intertwined with a love story and war. Simple writing that highlights historical times and changes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on The Authority of the Believer","review":"This book by the great Dr. Sumrall, following in John Macmillan's wonderful teaching footsteps, is the best book I have read on the subject of the Authority of the Believer in Christ Jesus. Concise, precise, practical and tactical spiritual insight from a man of God who knew, and who dealt with difficult issues concerning the overcoming power needed for the Christian and the power daily available to all who will come to Christ by faith, stand on His Word and take the position offered to us in Him. Seated in Christ as taught in the book of Ephesians, and knowledge of that position, is overcoming power. I highly recommend this book to all who love to maintain daily victory and joy in Christ, and to all who seek it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I too have been using the Aerobic Yoga-The Flow Series video produced over a decade ago by Tracey and Ganga, and it is one of my favorites. I had anticipated an expansion upon the series, not a complete replication with a slicker production. I skipped Earth, and bought Water and Fire expecting to build upon my practice. I was extremely disappointed to see that Water was almost the same as the older video - minus a few postures, and that Fire is almost an exact duplication. I feel I just wasted thirty bucks. Do yourself a favor - buy Aerobic Yoga-The Flow Series and skip these. My low rating is due to feeling I was mislead - even the pose on the cover of Fire isn't used in the tape. Stick with the original and you won't be disappointed - slicker does not mean better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Serious Mid to Advanced- Level Practitioners","review":"Yikers! This tape is scarey good. Be prepared to work for an hour and a half solid. Very balanced. Good emphasis on breathwork. I'm only giving it four stars because I like pretty cinematography and music, and this tape has neither. But you will feel like a million bucks when you finish--partly because you'll be so proud of yourself for making it to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"AOK","review":"The only gripe I have about this product is the hand-hold bar continuing to spin (maybe it needs to be tightened?) making it difficult to grip and continue hand motion.

Universal should be ashamed to call this a blu ray and claim it is \\"digitally remastered\\". The picture quality is terrible! Blurry and grainy. Dinosaurs should not come across as grainy! If I had bought this for myself I'd have returned it after viewing the first DVD. My non-blu ray DVD's of this set look much better than this and I couldn't be more disappointed.

Overall, I have to say I am impressed and especially with the audio. I watched all three movies over two nights and some of the jungle noises popping out the 7.1 sounded totally realistic. Picture quality is good, but not fantastic and the bonus is you get legitimate digital copies and not the Ultra-Violet ones that Warner Bros are trying to impose on the unwilling masses.Slight difference between the US and European version is that you get hard digital copies across the pond, where the US versions are direct downloads to iTunes or Windows.

The solution seems to be finding the PS3 video option \\"1080P 24Hz Output (HDMI)\\" and setting it to Off. When I did that, the grain problem went away.As for the movie itself, it's amazing how real and scary the dinosaurs look. Hard to believe it's almost twenty years old.One big flaw is the overuse of the theme song, especially during the helicopter ride to the landing pad. A soaring, catchy piece of brassy music played over and over becomes sheer torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not biting.","review":"Hi Def digest says picture quality is 3.5 out of 5 stars for 1, 3 for #2 and 4 for # 3.

Now they seem to have found a way to make them good enough and we suckers seem to be ok with that. Today I stop being okay with that and will not be purchasing these discs.

I have movies older than Jurassic Park and I am fully satisfied with their picture quality. I must admit that this one is the worst blu ray disc I ever purchased. It's very grainy, pictures are not sharp in 90% of the frames. Believe me the bad picture quality has got nothing to do with my TV. Other movies are crisp on my TV. It's hard to believe that they did a blu ray conversion for this collection. Looks like they copied a VCD or VHS into blu ray. Will not recommend to own as a collection. Rent a DVD from some place if you have not seen this before.

Steven Spielberg took filmmaking to a completely different level with this masterpiece. In compilation with the outstanding work of Stan Winston, and the wonderful music of John Williams, you can't take your eyes off of the screen. Although Jurassic Park II and III aren't up to par of the first film, they provide good, edge-of-your-seat entertainment that will keep you watching them again and again. It is good to see all three of these films put together in such a nice package. My opinion as a DVD collector is that this is worth the upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as most say, pick it up if it's on sale","review":"First of all, could the picture be better?

Extras in each dvd movie disc are very good, especially the \\"Making of\\". This brings me to the fourth disc, I agree, it is a nice feature to include a fourth disc with extras to accompany the movies, but I was expecting more. The fourth disc seems to include all the extras that were not included in the movie discs because they are not quality material. The fourth disc is a collection of failed extras excluded from the standard movie discs. This fact alone forces me to take of one star, of this 5 star movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"The whole trilogy for such an amazing price, can't beat it.

Of course, it was best when I first saw it in the theater as a teenager and almost climbed into the lap of the person next to me out of fear; not quite as scary when I'm sitting in bed watching it on the big-screen in my room. ;) Glad to have the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift for Christmas","review":"Loved shopping on line for my Christmas gifts; had everything I needed; for a pleasant experiencing for my specialty things."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst blu-ray transfer ever, incredibly grainy!","review":"As a Jurassic Park fan, I couldn't wait for the blu-ray release of these films. What a disappointment! I have over 200 blu-rays, and this is the worst transfer I have ever seen. The picture is incredibly grainy, worse than my old DVD's of the films. Universal should be ashamed at the lack of effort that went into this blu-ray release.

And not selling Jurassic Park individually is not right!","review":"Quite honestly, this isn't a Trilogy. There is no reason they should even dare call this as such. Pretty much what happened here is that there is one gem in this bunch; it's called Jurassic Park - the rest are b rated movies flicks. None of the sequels would I ever care to own!! However, for some weird reason they want to force someone to buy all three - and at a whopping price of nearly 50 dollars!!! It's priced likewise everywhere (Walmart, Target, etc.) not just here on amazon. It's the distributors who are trying to pawn it off as a trilogy. There is no continuity of a story at all, it's just 3 different movies. Frankly it's 3 movies about dinosaurs!!!Watch in about one year after they force this on people, they will come out with the 20th anniversary special edition.

I have been consistently disappointed by the lack of information it has and is even completely missing common and well-known restaurants and hotels.

Howard here concentrates most of his scrutiny on the dearth of fairness and common sense in education and civil service.

A must-read for anyone who feels like life is swirling down the drain in a morass of lawsuits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact vs. Fiction","review":"Being a big fan of both the Rurouni Kenshin manga and anime I had to get this book. Not only is it full of pictures from the manga but also character profiles, files on history of the Meiji Restoration and the real people the characters are based on.

While it is a story of strength and courage, it isn't as focused on bulimia as it leads itself to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I've read","review":"I've read a lot of books on eating disorders and this one is by far the worst one I've read.

If you are well read in this area, I don't think that the book is for you (especially if you are a vitriolic Howard Zhin fan or an American patriot who thinks we can do no wrong.) It is rather a general overview of the topic and ment for history students although clearly accesible to laymen. What I liked about the book is that Levering does not throw mind numbing statistics, but simply presents the phases of the cold war. There was a heavier emphasis on the beginning phases, and I would have like to have seen more written on the latter stages. Good intro though"},{"rating":"1","title":"So freaking boring!","review":"Im a freshman student and I had to read this book for a history class.

It makes a good coaster tho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pass this one over","review":"This feels more like a sort of random collection of songs than a full, polished album, so I can understand some of the other reviewers' criticisms. This isn't Alice's best, but it's unique and there are some totally breathtaking, amazing moments. The chants that comprise the first half of the album are incredible. Yeah, it's clear that the singers aren't professionals, but the performances still overflow with humanity and warmth. These songs are intensely spiritual and uplifting, but without a shred of pretension or artificiality. As for the organ-drum jam that rounds out the album, Alice's playing is fantastic, but the drumming by her son is pretty by-the-book. Not really surprising, since I think he was something like 13 at the time. If you don't like the last song, just pretend it isn't there, but don't ignore this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After being blown away by Monastic Trio and Journey in Satchidananda I bought up Alice Coltrane's entire back catalogue. The CDs are variable to say the least. This has got to be the worst of the lot. Three of the pieces are Hare Krishna chants by her students from the Vedantic Centre. They obviously arent musicians as the rhythm is quite often suspect. The final 19 minute track features some fine organ work but is totally ruined by the atrocious drumming of her son John Jr.The only reason I gave it two stars is because of the track Ganesha, which is a beautifully played harp piece. All in all though this CD is best avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"NASCAR 3 Rocks!","review":"Your spouse and children will hate N3 because you can't stop playing. It's that good.

From what I understand he worked from the original master tapes, and used modern digital audio software to clean things up, re-balance the mix and make things sonically tidy.The results on tracks of Disc 2 and 3 are worth the price.

This book is worthless and DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh.................these books actually sell?!?","review":"I've always heard of Danielle Steel but never read any of her work. Then a box of books was given to me by a neighbor and in it was Malice, so I started to read. I was honestly stunned - the writing was absolutely the worst I've ever seen! I wanted to get out my editing pencil and correct the horrible grammar, the fragmented and poorly-worded sentences, and cross out the numerous repeat sentences. The story-line was nauseating and the ending completely predictable. It was like a glorified Harlequin romance, but not as well written as a Harlequin. I've seen better writing from middle school students, and I'm not even exaggerating. It's baffling that Danielle Steel makes money on her books. But as a friend in my book club said, \\"there's a lot of simple-minded people in this world and there's got to be books out there for them too.\\" I guess that's as good an explanation as any for how Danielle Steel books actually sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of a True Survivor","review":"Danielle Steel's sparse style of writing serves her well, pulling the reader in to a spell-binding tale of incest, murder, prison and deception. She gives an especially chilling and graphic account of women's prison and the brutality that inmates visit upon newcomers.The book traces the uphill battle of a teenager.... .... As the book unfolds, Grace, the heroine grows in inner strength as she enters each new chapter of her life. How she survives attacks, both physical and emotional, is at the core of the plot and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Readers will find themselves caring very much for this courageous heroine who often must face her battles alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH! Hated it!","review":"This was the first Danielle Steel novel I read and it will be the last. While reading this I feld like she wrote this book in a day. There was no thought process whatsoever involved in this book. Bad grammer also! An example: \\"And, afterwards, they and Paul....\\" huh? This was really really bad. I guess that explains how she can pump so many books out. No thought goes into them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book deserves more stars","review":"This book deserves more then 5 stars I was so engrossed in this novel it was the second novel I had read by Danielle Steel the first being Secrets and I thought all of her novels were going to be light-hearted and beautiful people falling in love with equally beautiful people this book changed that image for me. Grace Adams had real problems she was in prison and was sexually abused for many years and despite of that she still found love and happiness with her husband Charles but then a series of scandalous events from her past resurface and Grace's happiness is almost shattered by those who want to destory what she has built for herself and the family she created with her husband. Danielle Steel outdid herself with this novel and because of this I have been a fan of hers for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I don't see what's a big deal. This is first D.

It was a very powerful book, that brings to the forefront problems of everyday living.

I will continue to read and collect her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I am a Danielle Steele's fan and I think this book is the best one I've read as of yet.

When I first heard PW it was About Time and I liked them but when I got Unknown Road they became my favorite band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginning of the Unknown Road","review":"This album is spectacular in all aspects of the word. This album is the launch of what would be a multitude of excellent albums which include \\"About Time\\", \\"Full Circle\\", and \\"Straight Ahead\\". Jason really shows his talent for song writing in this album with the title track \\"Unknown Road\\". The song is amazing both musically and lyrically. The sound on this album is unlike any other Pennywise release which is why I think this album is their best. Not saying the other CDs are bad, just saying they showed a lot of diversity and talent in this album. They are more metal sounding in this album and the lyrics are more thought provoking. \\"Nothing\\" and \\"Dying to Know\\" are probably my favorite two tracks on this record. Although they are typical Pennywise songs about God, religion, and faith, the lyrics and sound are far from typical. Overall, an untouchable CD. Pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Amazing","review":"Im not gonna lie to you, i was expecting more going in to this. It is not bad and if it was any band besides Pennywise it would be outstanding... but for a Pennywise album it is average. It does have some GREAT songs which are Unknown Road, Homesick, Time To Burn, Nothing, Dying To Know & Slowdown. The rest could have been B-sides to any cd and they all sound alike... which is usual but in this case not very good. Most of the other songs are at least enjoyable and overall the cd is pretty good but i would reccommend only getting it after you have become a big fan and have most of their other work... it is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring & a great gift for the women in your life!","review":"Angie Trelstad's courage and grace are overwhelming in this book. She not only sets an example of how to get through the worst of situations, she does this by revealing the most personal facts in her life. If you are a victim, this book lets you know that you will never be alone unless you choose to be, and that fighting back truly begins when the attack ends. This is a great inspirational book to share with the women in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the tradition.","review":"Big Bill's third release is chock full of guest artists including several that performed with his father, Muddy Waters, band. Guests include, Taj Mahal, Bob Margolin, Pinetop Perkins, Willie Smith, Paul Oscher and Bill Lupkin to name a few.Despite the guests, Big Bill's performance seems a little lack luster and slightly below his two earlier releases, the overlooked and underrated \\"Nineteen Years Old\\"--available through Taxim.com and, the award winning \\"Rising Son\\"--available here on Amazon.com. The two strongest cuts are those featuring the vocals of Taj Mahal, \\"Strong Man Holler\\" and \\"You're Gonna Miss Me.\\" While nothing ground breaking on this CD, Bill certainly carries on the fine tradition of the Delta blues. Worth the purchase, but don't overlook the previous two releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLUES TIME","review":"When it comes to great music nothing says it better than the blues and no one plays it better than a Morganfield."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Depth Needed","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the premise of \\"The Gift of Shyness\\" -shyness is a positive not a negative condition and shy people everywhere have something to offer the world -- sensitivy and intelligence.

It repesents the pinnacle achievement by bands in the 90's punk revival genre. Ask anyone who is serious about punk music, TFP rev is probably many people's pick for greatest punk ablum of an entire genre -- it certainly is my favorite. Every song on this CD is excellent, fast, straight ahead punchy punk-rock the way it was meant to be played. Scott Radinsky is easily the most talented singer in punk music today. Unfortunately (for TFP) if you want to check him out now, you need to listen to Pulley. After this album, Scott left the band, and eveyone is now annoyed by Dennis' nasaly voice.

Unfortunately instead of really covering all the detail of a very complex framework, the book stops halfway both figuratively and literally. Of the 806 pages, only 356 are really any use. The last half of the book is composed of poorly presented synopses of the packages. These 450 pages (except for a workable index) are a waste and should have been used to convey the detail missing in the first half.

There is everything from the standard songs about love lost (\\"My World\\" and \\"Hello Hello\\") to songs that carry social weight (\\"Truth\\", which is about Sept. 11).What I love most about this album is that all 11 of the songs could easily be singles.

Any person who likes rock will love this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"I fell in love with the song \\"tomarrow\\" when i first heard it on mtv a few days ago. i ran out to the store and got it and played it. i expected \\"tomarrow\\" to b the best song on the cd, but id have to say \\"they all fall down\\" was my favorite. after number 8 they started sounding the same though."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst follow-up CDs ever","review":"I don't know what happened to SR-71. Their first album was surprisingly good, with fun, catchy, and often intelligent lyrics. I guess SR-71 thought they weren't \\"hard\\" enough, or \\"bad\\" enough. Their new songs are boring; music and lyrics. Nothing what made the first album great exists here. The only decent and funny song is \\"She was Dead\\", which sounds similar to \\"Fame\\" from the first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have these guys been hiding?","review":"This album blew me away! There's a song called My World that actually made me cry from the emotion, I loved it! The album is great, I was surprised that SR-71 wasn't heard from for awhile, but they're back with a vengence and a great album. I read on Mitch Allan's personal website that he wrote most of the songs and coproduced the album. He is really a talented guy. Be sure to listen to song no. 11, it sounds like something right out of the Beatles songbook. Buy this album, it's really worth having!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't need to be a weatherman to know this CD blows","review":"Because their first CD was pretty good, I listened to \\"Tomorrow\\" several times to give it a chance. But it never got better - \\"Tomorrow\\" seems to drag on and on, with meandering, pointless melodies and whining vocals. My advice? Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, get now you see inside instead","review":"i'm more of a fan of the sugarcult, good charlotte, and sum 41 older stuff sound. if you are too, get now you see inside. that is a better overall album. this cd is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sophomore Album","review":"Like most people, the first SR-71 song I ever heard was \\"Right Now,\\" their only mainstream radio. I remember that I dismissed them as another punk band trying to go mainstream at the time. However, that cd had a nearly unprecedented depth, matching something near a Goo Goo Dolls release. The Heavy songs were offset by softer songs like \\"Alive.\\" Tomorrow, however, is a totally different style. While it can drag a bit, the guitars remain in amazing synchrony, and the vocals rise even further in songs like \\"truth\\" and \\"she was dead.\\" Probably the best songs on the album and the genre they best fit are: 5. Tomorrow--pretty deep industrial rock- 8/10 (4)She was Dead-- Punk with a bit of rock undertone- 8/10 (3)They all fall down-- Hard rock with rather grating vocals- 9/10 (2) Hello-- Rather repetive, like \\"Paul McCartney\\" in NOw you see inside- 9/10 (1) Truth-- Hard Rock with deceptively smooth lyrics.Alright!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away!","review":"I've been of fan of SR-71 ever since I heard an advertisement for \\"Now You See Inside\\" on TV. A week later, I bought the CD and fell in love with them. I was blown away with \\"Politically Correct,\\" \\"Alive,\\" and \\"Non-Toxic.\\" And now, the boys have done it again. \\"Tomorrow\\" is of a different style, but it still holds as much meaning as the first CD. I immediatly fell in love with their music, all over again. With great songs (such as \\"In My Mind,\\" \\"Lucky,\\" \\"They All Fall Down,\\" and \\"Truth,\\"), moving lyrics, and awsome overall preformance I couldn't have enjoyed it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic and bland","review":"Generic and bland album by Kotzen.

Likewise, even after we got a dryer, most times she would still hang the laundry out. My Dad also had a little ritual of detailing his car on Saturday mornings, hand washing, whisking out the carpets, cleaning the windows.When I first ordered this book, I thought..\\"Oh, it's a cutesy book.\\" I tossed it on the console table and there is sat for some time. On a whim, I tucked it in my carry on bag for a trip to Florida. Lying on the beach, I pulled it out and started reading it. It is a little jewel of a book. I came away feeling a new respect for doing things manually when we have machines to do the same job.You will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another inspiring Fernando Ortega CD","review":"Fernando Ortega is a multi-talented musician. In this CD he arranges some of the songs, writes the words to others, and writes both words and music for yet some others. His songs are often contemplative such as \\"Chimayo\\" where he considers the seasons of life and \\"Till I Reach My Home\\" where he celebrates God's presence and support in the trials of his life. Other especially memorable and touching songs include \\"Through the Fire\\", \\"Father of My Heart\\", and \\"Into the Morning\\". I took away one star because of the somewhat discordant \\"Walking on the Water\\", but all in all, this is an excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoy","review":"I got this CD for my son - one day in a store parking lot he started singing one song 'Lord, I want to be [a Christian] in my heart...'

I was at the hop addition stage and after snipping open the hop bag I was greeted with some old, not very fragrant hops. Turned out they were 2006 and not well stored. At that stage of the brew you have no choice but to use them if you don't happen to have a back up supply.Sadly I have 5 gallons of drinkable but bland beer. The response of Seven Bridges - sorry someone should have pulled the old hops from the kits! I am going to toss some leftover hops from a different batch into the keg and see if I can perk it up a tad.Moral here is to buy from suppliers that have higher turnover of the ingredients and check your ingredients carefully before the brew day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. It has very clear instructions and troubleshooting tips. It also has a great resource list of suppliers including internet addresses. The book also focuses on techniques and encourages the reader to create their own recipes. Another plus: recipes are rated by difficultly. My only complaint was that several recipes call for small amounts of hard to find and/or expensive ingredients. I recommend the book to anyone new to soapmaking who is unwilling to work with lye"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"The photographs and instructions in this book are very inspiring, and overall mostly everything you need to know about melt and pour soap crafting is covered. This book will inspire you to create some beautiful soaps.

For those of you who picked this particular product (the digital cell phone) because of its compact size would not like this clip. I purchased it a bit ago and never use it. It takes too much room in my purse and cannot be clipped on the outside of my purse because it protrudes entirely too far out and gets caught on everything. When I use it as a clip on my clothing there is little stablity and the swivel action makes the phone move around too much for comfort...not to mention sticking out an extra few inches just reaching to get caught on your briefcase, a wall, the elevator door....Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this product like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Few, The Proud, The Marines","review":"\\"The Marines\\" is a well-produced piece that gives a great overview of the process of making a Marine, both enlisted and officer level.

This CD contains it as I remember it in 1987."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Experience","review":"David Davidson's work is truly inspirational. His music lifts up my soul whenever I'm in a foul mood. His songs vary from slow and romantic to energetic and upbeat. His arrangements include other various instruments such as the drums and the guitar. My favorite piece of his album is the Doxology, which praises God in a whole different way. He has changed regular boring hymns into something much more creative and exciting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and too predictable","review":"I was thrilled with Lofts' book \\"A Wayside Tavern\\" and I opened this book expecting more great story telling. Instead, I found at best a cheesy romance loaded with predictability and about 100 pages more than it really took to tell this sad little story. I found the characters rather unlikeable and many of the twists that could have made the tale interesting were never explored. The author took the easy road to the climax of the book and personally, I could care less what happens to any of the characters in the sequels. The \\"other woman\\" is a tramp predictably written as wild and unpredictable. The long suffering loyal wife continues to suffer and the wandering knight who wanders in the worst of ways seems to be an immature, unreliable, weak-willed twit who pretty much deserves what is coming to him - though his family certainly deserved better than he ever provided. Turn on Jerry Springer and save your reading time for something of more merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main scene cut","review":"Might be a bit sexist but I bought this mainly for the scene that shows Merediths breasts.IF this is why you want this DON'T BUY IT.

When the actual dancing part happened, Paige showed us about 7 dance moves then said do it. Of course, my daughter couldn't keep up. Then she showed us a whole new set of steps then said do it. After my daughter attempted to keep up on the second part, Paige told us to put it all together and do both parts. And yet again, my daughter couldn't keep up. It was when my daughter was watching Paige \\"demonstrate\\" the moves before doing them that I realized that my daughter isn't getting much excersize out of the DVD. I WOULD NOT recommend this DVD to anyone, especially to little kids, who would definetly not keep up to Paige's high memory rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids can't follow this!","review":"I Bought this DVD for my two girls (7 & 10yrs) thinking it would be great exercise for them.I was badly disappointed. Paige introduces 6-7 new moves at once and then expects the kids to do them - after 5 min my kids sit down and just watch Paige move rather than moving themselves! It is simply too difficult and kids give up trying. There is too much emphasis on choreography rather than just exercising....So if you are looking for an exercise DVD for kids - this is not it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like reading oracle on line help pages","review":"Lacks conceptual explanation of portals in detail.

The human body is 98.6 and human skin is over 90 degrees. Therefore, it felt cold. We refunded ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought it","review":"The seat is nicely designed, but has one HUGE design flaw. The seat and lid together are thicker than most toilet seats/lids so when lifted together and leaned against the tank lid, it is not exactly vertical and the seat will not stay up. The toilet lid does. If all your users are female, this is not a problem. But my husband finds it particularly annoying and I don't blame him. This may not be a problem if the lid on the tank does not overlap the tank, but our lid projects out over the tank about an inch. I don't know what to do about this. I will call Kohler and see if they have a solution but I doubt it. Also, the heating element is advertised as heating to 20-30 deg. F above room temperature, but our bathroom is about 55 deg F in the early morning and a 75 deg F seat is not all that warm. I was disappointed that there is no way to increase the temperature. There are many heated toilet seats on the market.

Pennywise has created what I view as the greateset album ever. The entire band plays as one coherent steamroller that hits you with one anthemic song after another. \\"Freebase\\",\\"Waste of Time\\", and \\"Every Single Day\\" are all standouts, but \\"Perfect People\\" is easily the album's best track. In fact, \\"Perfect People\\" is the best song Pennywise has ever recorded, and that is saying a lot. I recommend this album to everyone, especially fans of fast, loud punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk, how it should be done","review":"This album is punk through and through, I don't think many people would disagree with me on that. Even though it came out in 1995, I have yet to find a punk fan that dislikes it over all these years.

It's always the most talented that pass.Anyway, i love this cd the most of all the Pennywise cds, which is a very bold statement. (Though I still don't have Straight Ahead and the Word To The Wise EP)This is the album where Pennywise really defined their sound. Songs like \\"Freebase\\", \\"Killing Time\\", \\"Same Old Story\\", \\"Try\\", \\"It's What You Do With It\\" and the classic \\"Perfect People\\" make this a MUST OWN cd.I'm serious, just get this cd, it's absolutely great, you will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk for the perfect people","review":"Anyone that thinks Blink 182 is punk should check out Pennywise, as it'll definately change their mind. The nice thing is, Pennywise has, in its 12 years of existance, stuck to the one thing they do best - pure punk. Are you sick of boy bands and Britney clones? Give Perfect People a listen. It's the, um, perfect song for you. This is probably Pennywise's most accessible album (and my favorite after the live one), even more so than Straight Ahead or Full Circle. It's got some good stuff on it, like Perfect People, Same Old Story, Homesick, Peaceful Day, and I Wont Have It. If you're getting into Pennywise with Straight Ahead or the live one, and wondering what to purchase next, you should get this first, then Full Circle, then Unknown Raod, and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation","review":"This compilation rocks.

You owe it to your self to try something new, and listen to something differet. You never know, your new favorite band could be on this CD. Just pick it up.

There is some good information here but it's hard to know which information you can trust. The problem is, that unless you are personally familiar with a particular area the information here can be sketchy at best and woefully out-of-date or misleading at worst. I think this book was \\"slapped together\\" with more thought given to selling books than to careful research.

Besides, the back doesn't even fit in correctly and slides around, the part that is supposed to be used for standing it up doesn't work, at all, and the cheap plastic used for the picture cover is scratched up and dirty.

It is a very useful introduction to the use of semiotics in theatre, and is presented in a simple manner that isn't patronising: nor does it make it any the less suitable for higher academic purposes. It allows one to understand some theory of post-modern theatre, using examples from contempoary practioners, while gradually (through each new chapter) building upon the intricate workings of theatre's most pioneering medium.

Usually you can feel yourself being led in one direction or another, hints are given so obviously that you have to suspend your disblief AND ignore the hints to stay with the story.The techno-speak and detailed insurance information was a tad on the tiring side, but not too bad.I really enjoyed the read and will certainly look for more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dud","review":"I liked the two other Dooling books I read, but this one is a dud. The characters are repellent, the plot boring, and the \\"mystery\\" uninteresting. The scenes stretch on seemingly forever. There is an excessive and tiresome amount of insurance-industry and computer-programming detail. Forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a dud","review":"Yeah, it's hard to get really wrapped up in insurance fraud, despite the pretty decent writing... the religious stuff is interesting, and there's a couple of REALLY killer scenes at the end of the book (the one with Don, the contract and the cell phone is awesome!)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and convoluted","review":"Granted, making insurance seem interesting or even exciting takes special skills but this book makes you force yourself to pay attention. Not a good thing. There is nothing particularly interesting about the protagonist Carver Hartnett who pines after his co-worker Miranda for too many pages.When Lenny, a co-worker of Carver and Miranda who has some risky personal habits, dies under mysterious circumstances, Carver sets to find out what happened. Despite's Dooling's attempts to create witty banter among the friends, I just didn't care enough to know what happened to Lenny who had no apparent traits to justify Carver and Miranda's loyalty to him. In addition, Carver doesn't come off as very bright in many of his actions. It's hard to sympathize with such a character.Plodding dialogue with occasional religious references also slow the story down. I can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps the worst novel by one of today's best writers","review":"Many of the people purchasing this book at this stage in its cycle are fans of Dooling's previous novels, and like myself, would probably buy the book regardless of what reviews they might read. Until Bet Your Life, I couldn't imagine myself being disappointed by a Richard Dooling book.Dooling's carefully-calibrated nastiness is there (albeit all too infrequently), but the plot limps along, and the characters - with one notable exception that I pray points to a spin-off - tend to merge into one not particularly interesting entity. There just don't seem to be enough ideas to sustain the book as a novel of this length.For anyone not already acquainted with Dooling: \\"Critical Care\\" and \\"White Man's Grave\\" are two books that are difficult to top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull... Stephen King and NYT are wrong","review":"Stephen King loved this book. I didn't.While he tries to imbue the insurance and viatical industries with intrigue and give Omaha Nebraska a noir-ish danger, they just don't fit. Add to that flying sledgehammer tech talk and oenophilist rants. The result is a lot of puffed-up scenes in a book that doesn't really satisfy. There's too much pulp and not enough brain, too much expected or at least predictable plotting, and the industry and city that provide the background for the book just refuse to play ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reader","review":"I could not put this book down. I never thought the insurance industry was fodder for a page-turner crime novel, but I really enjoyed it. The plot charges along and as always, Dooling's characterizations & asides are hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"This book was a very interesting story, although it was short and not very in-depth. The photos were a good addition, and it was different from the Jews' perspectives. Instead of being sent to concentration camps during the war, she secretly fought for the Jews, leading them to the countryside to escape Nazi persecution. This different angle (coming from a resistance worker) made this story a good change from other WWII books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travel has nothing to do with it","review":"I bought this because I am interested in the problem of travel before the days of the highway patrol. When leaving the safety of a walled city and its environs a person took their life into their hands - and often lost it.This book should be titled \\"Everyday life of Medieval People\\". Travel has VERY little to do with the book and certainly didn't address any of my interests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wedding peach?

It was a simple order: a SiiG 3.3 ft eSATA cable (CB-SA0111-S1). This particular cable was ordered because Seagate certified it as one tested in-house for use with my FreeAgent drive. The cable I received was a generic one made by Keen Top, with no mention of the substitution. Everything would have been fine if it had worked, but it didn't. (Confirmed by testing it vs another eSATA cable that I had.)

Many of them have a permanent place in my Christmas cookie rotation, and I get a lot of requests for recipes, which is my hallmark of a good cookie. And I'll never forget how quickly the peanut butter and jelly pillows, a sublime recipe, disappeared at my high school bake sales.This cookbook is far better than Maida Heatter's cookie cookbook.

Gifted of notable talent and distinguished refinement, he has conferred these symphonic works of renovated splendor and austere elegance, according the historical tradition.When we think in Walton, immediately evoke Barbirolli, Boult, Previn and in lesser degree in Solti. But this recording will reward you due the artistic honesty and devoted commitment it was performed.A real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read, but shallow","review":"Strathern's summary of the life of Issac Newton is less than 90 pages of unusually large print -- a very quick read indeed. At best, it is a superficial glance that provides little insight into the life or work of Newton.In many ways, the book is a contradiction. Strathern's approach is more suited to a children's book, but his writing style is intended for an educated adult. For me, the result was fast-paced boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love the Book","review":"This book told me several significant points about Issac that I (and most other people) are not aware of. It also inspired me to learn more. It requires a small amount of time to read. For me that is an advantage.This is a great book for people that avoid fat books which are padded with trivial details that can't be remembered anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things are best left forgotten","review":"The review title says it all.

Nearly throughout this whole book Mr. Johnson uses examples from his life to explain how the philosophy of the martial arts can help people get through life in general. However, the book can be very hard to read, not because it is written like Shakespeare, but because it contains many grammatical errors that can confuse the reader of what Mr. Johnson's point is. In addition, some of the ideas Mr. Johnson tries to profess are not explained at all. Don't get me wrong the book is good but it has many errors in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definate must read","review":"This book has changed my life and helped me to become a better person.

If you feel like you are stuck in your life and feel like you have little motivation and determination, this book will be a breath of fresh air in your life. Even if you feel like you are a motivated person, this book will take you to a whole new level. Just keep and open mind as you read and be like a sponge, soaking up all of the useful information that you can and it will help you tremendously. You can get what you choose to from this book.

The first reason being it does not play in all dvd capable players. I had trouble playing it in the ps2 but it worked fine in the dvd player and the mini dvd player. The second reason I gave the video only 4 stars was because the title was a little bit misleading. I thought that Diego had an actual \\"Sing Along\\" video but it was like the regular Diego shows.The sing along part of the title comes from the iguanas that are preparing to do a song, which is about 8 lines long but they have to find Iggy first before their official \\"sing along\\" can commence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these glasses!!","review":"You know how most smaller glasses you leave in the cabinet because they don't hold much?

It seems to be that those don't exist though, \\"brownish\\" colored glass really only comes in amber. I didn't want amber....Further, the glasses are oddly shaped. They are the shape of the picture, but the rims of each glass are cockeyed; they are not symmetrical.

The performance is stunning. Flagstad was entering the final phase of her career, but the voice is magnificent: warm and wonderfully powerful. The rest of the cast is absolutely first rate, with Schwarzkopf an unmatchable Marzellina. Furtwangler is at his legendary finest.

Its got good jokes, the starting when Goku first meets Bulma is really quite packed with mildly dirty jokes. One scene Goku \\"explores\\" Bulma when she is asleep, definanty not for younger kids!Dragon Ball is great fun with some laided back but still intense action, not overly dramatic stuff you might find in DBZ.

I have lost all of my baby weight (36 pounds) in 3 months! Her food plan is the best. I bought this book in hopes that I could bring sweets back into my diet without cheating on my diet.The recipes are \\"ok\\"- which this pains me to say as all of her other recipes are out of this world delicious! The Somersweet product doesn't compare to sugar. I recommend passing on this cookbook. Once you lose the weight, you can incorporate small amounts of sweets into your diet.

The only thing I hated to give up was desserts. Having a sweet tooth makes you long for a little something sweet after a meal. Her previous book was a start with some good dessert ideas. Now with this new book dealing only with desserts it has filled this void.The photography by Jeff Katz were excellent, makes you want to try each and every one included. My only complaint was not to include more baking projects like cookies, there were only 32 recipes included but of the ones I have tried were delicious.Suzanne also is promoting her new sweetener called SomerSweet, which may soon be available in many grocery stores. It is available on her Web site. These desserts sound heavy in fats but if you follow her diet plan it all works and you feel great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not grand.","review":"First off, if you use Somersweet in any of the frozen desserts, you get a rock hard, nasty tasting concotion.

If you have given up sugar and are no longer craving the sickening sweet things you previously ate, then these recipes are perfect. The creme brulee is rich and creamy and just sweet enough. After all, aren't we supposed to be adjusting to a healthier lifestyle? If what you want is a rich ice cream sundae that makes your teeth ache, then this book isn't for you. But if you have given up sweets, and find the sweetness of natural fruit to be sweet enough and have a love of baking and cooking, then these recipes will do the trick.

May have been a good workout back in 1990 on VCR, but it's 2002. Buyer beware of DVD's that are just copies of VCR tapes...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right amount of pregnancy workout","review":"I like Kathy Smith. I own a couple DVDs exercise she made. As soon as I learned that I'm pregnant, I looked for a prenatal workout DVD. I'm glad she produced one. The DVD provides low impact arobics. It splits in several sessions like warm-up, arobics sessions, arms, legs, and relaxation. Also, it has a postnatal exercise session that you can follow after you give birth. Additionally, there is a section for tips & tricks for pragnancy. The DVD was adapted from VCR. It looks like she made this exercise 10-20 years ago, but you can still use it today. A lot of expecting moms might prefer prenatal yoga, but not me. That's not my style. In summary, I think this DVD offers the best value for its price.~Jane"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once I was side stepping and clapping, I knew it was over!!","review":"This was the most cheesy workout DVD I have ever encountered! Unless you are a die hard 80's fan that still wears leg warmers and camel toe leotards, don't get this DVD! I was clapping and side stepping, trying to keep up with the work out. The music was terrible and to be honest, I didn't even break a sweat for the ten minutes that I worked out to it--that's how long I gave it a chance before I turned it off and never returned to it EVER again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated!","review":"I knew this was an 80's video when I bought it but did not predict how dumb I would feel dancing to the music and watching the cheesy, fakeness of the ladies in it. There is even a rap song they do together that they want you to sing a long with them in order to evaluate whether or not you are too out of breath or not! The whole thing is just so dorky.Also, the music is far too loud in comparison to the instructors voice. At times it is worse than others, almost like her microphone gets obstructed temporarily and you just can't hear her instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD, worth doing","review":"I like this work out. I'm 5 months pregnant and this is one of the 2 I use. I had bought some other pregnancy exercise DVDs and found that not all are that great. This one and Lisa Hart together are the best two I have bought and the only ones I use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible","review":"It is soo outdated. The moves are old. The outfits are even worse. Notably, only Kathy wears a decent outfit, the others are clothed in telly-tubbie style garb. Watch out for the horrible attempt at rap &quot;do the preggo dance&quot; (intended as a comic relief during the workout). Just awful!It was initially a VHS so it doesnt have the functionality of the dvd.Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"80's aerobic workout","review":"I bought this dvd, along with Jennifer Gianni's pilates fusion for pregnancy and what a difference! The Kathy Smith program takes you right back in time to the 80's. The background music has a definite \\"Miami Vice/Casio tone\\" feel to it, as do the outfits, and the set. The aerobic excerises do get your heartrate up, but this is not a very intense workout, at least not for someone who is already is pretty good shape. I found the rap sing-along portion of the tape to be really annoying, and the teddy bear icons which occasionally pop up are cheesy too. Overall, I would recommend this tape if you live in an area where you can't go for a brisk walk or swim or do some other aerobic workout to get your heart pumping. I will occasionally follow the workout during my pregancy, but I much prefer the Gianni pilates workout to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"old, and not worth it","review":"kathy smith is a classic, but this prego video is overly annoying, almost as bad as a denise austin video, the outfits are hideous and the workout seems rather off the beatne path for a pregnant woman, i did not feel like my body was getting what it needed, i do not recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program!!!","review":"This work-out is excellent! The prenatal work-out itself is just under one hour, but on the DVD there is other footage where she offers excellent advice for technique and things like that, and there is also comentary from three OBs about exercise and pregnancy. Kathy does such a great job of explaining moves and gives great caution where it is needed. What people need to understand is that this work out is made to concentarte more on the heart and circulation rather than a high impact work-out. I like to do it in the morning and it gives me just the \\"pick-me-up\\" that my body needs. A good friend of mine is trying to get pregnant and when she does I am going to buy this for her!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll find yourself reaching for this workout over and over","review":"This is an awesome excercise video. Prior to pregancy I exercised to videos regulary, often getting bored before it was done. The music, the choice of fun dancy like moves, and the variety of moves keep you motivated. I especially liked how the video was sectioned off for energizer, aerobics 1, 2 etc. so that if you are a beginner or lacking time you could select some or all of the aerobics and toning to do. There were also great pregancy and post-pregnancy tips from Kathy and doctors. This is the best video I own, and I wouldn't be surprised if I excercise to it long after pregnancy is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy Smith - Pregnancy Workout","review":"I am a big fan of Kathy Smith but this video is quite outdated -- I don't know the date but guessing late '80s. The workout is fine but wish I bought something more up to date since so much about pregnancy fitness has changed in the last 10 years. In the middle of the workout, there is an unnecessary pause where Kathy and the others in the video stop to perform a rap song...awfully silly and waste of precious time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy - that's the word I was looking for!","review":"I bought this & the Buns of Steel tape at the same time when I was 4 months & I rarely watch this one - I'm now 7 months & I think I've done the aerobic part of this tape twice. The moves are not as crisp or something - a little too pop music dance-y for me - made me want to put on my lace gloves with the fingers missing, lots of bangles & a big lace bow in my hair, like Madonna a la Lucky Star. There's a lot going on in the background & there are a lot of women doing the work out too, some a little annoying & distracting. I do like the specific toning areas of the tape - I often do the Buns of Steel workout & follow up with some of the workouts from the toning section of this tape. And the little bubbles that have Kathy giving info about the purpose of the moves or how to perform them correctly is helpful, but not enough to make me want to do this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring and Cheesy","review":"This is my first Kathy Smith Video and I was sorely disappointed. I tried the video two times and I got so bored I stopped using it.It did get my heart rate up a little which was good.In the middle of the video, the pregnant moms start \\"rapping\\" about baby stuff, with Kathy Smith wearing a cap and sunglasses, I thought it was so cheesy.I recommend Sheva Rose's Prenatal Yoga, which kept me fit and prevented me from gaining ANY extra weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"This is 1980's basic aerobics at it's cheesiest. I understand the need to take things easier when pregnant and modify your workout moves for safety, but for someone who is used to fast-paced, exciting workouts like Tae-Bo, this was just way too \\"Jazzercise\\" for me. Not only was it too slow, but the moves and music were just really boring. I did the workout once and haven't put it back in. A brisk walk through the neighborhood does more for me, both aerobically and mood-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...no.","review":"What is up with that ridicuolous \\"prego rap\\"?! And the 5 mintues of silent time where all we see is kathy & the others laying on the floor for 5 WHOLE MINUTES! There are parts where the voice is dubbed over, the exercises were not effective AT ALL & the arm moves get a bit confusing at times. I just didn't find myself sweating or even feeling somewhat energized after this routine...I felt cheated. Like I needed more. It is way too outdated too. I almost wanna call it lame. I DO NOT recommend at all. Obviously I wasn't impressed & will be selling my copy on ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout with lots of information & helpful tips","review":"This was recommended to me and I'm glad I invested in it. Kathy is not at all irritating and even though it was made years ago - the video is timeless. She provide doctor information, helpful tips, and a energizer that you can do alone without the full workout. The only part I smirked at was the cheesey rap in the middle of the tape - but she explains why she did it. She even provides a helpful chart on checking your breathing! I am not much into aerobics so I loved she put in an arms, legs, and abdominal routines in. There is even a great cool down/relaxation time. I found that this tape can be used at any stage, she even provided routines for after birth for both you and baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this unless you are an exercise neophyte.","review":"This was so utterly disappointing. I was afraid of this, being made in the 80's and all. It lived up to all my low expectations. The exercises are like something uncoordinated 1st graders would do. Not to mention these ladies look like a bunch of untalented 6 year olds doing this dorky routine. If you are trying to maintain muscle tone with this you can forget it. Now if you have never exercised, this is probably ok to start with.I had been doing Tae Bo previous to becoming pregnant and am naturally comparing this video to it. I realize a pregnancy workout should be low impact, but this is ridiculous. I guess it's back to modified Tae Bo without the kicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"So sorry folks but I have to disagree with the majority here. I found this tape to be low energy, non-motivating and plain boring! Perhaps it was because all I really wanted to do when I was pregnant was eat and sleep.... but this is how I felt about this tape.Guess I needed more inspiring music (Rocky theme would have worked), high-energy, fun and funky moves to make me forget how tired and sick I felt! This tape just didn't do that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a few laughs","review":"First of all this video is so basic you would get a better workout just going for a walk. And the 1980's unitards are not really what i want to see pregnant women or any women for that matter wearing. It is good for a few laughs but that is about it. Why aren't there any good pregnancy workout videos? I gave this a 2 star just because at least they tried to make a pregnancy workout video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny!","review":"This video is so corny and obviously made in the 80's. The audio quality is horrible, and it is difficult to hear Kathy Smith's voice over the loud, outdated music. There is a portion in this tape when all the women get together with sunglasses and backward hats and sing the most ridiculous song. That's when you have to fast forward the tape, especially, if you are in the throws of morning sickness. Just skip this one altogether. I did not even feel it gave me a good workout. I consider myself in pretty good shape, jogging, doing pilates and yoga pre-pregnancy. Go for Shiva Rea's tape or the Crunch Yoga Mama."},{"rating":"1","title":"DORKY/WHITE WOMEN CAN'T DANCE VIDEO!","review":"I MUST SAY I WAS REALLY DISAPOINTED.

I like Kathy, but I do not like the old clothing, overly dancy moves that are so bouncy, and I can't stand the atmosphere of this workout.

A newer video would do you much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hokey","review":"This workout was way too old and hokey for me. It needs to be updated quite a bit to be more current."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Workout","review":"I only use this video once every couple of weeks so it never really gets old. The 80's outfits and definitely different, but overall it is a great workout. It's pretty easy so I am never sore the next day. I like that it incorporates both cardio and weights unlike several pregnancy workouts that I have tried. I am 31 weeks along and don't have any problems performing any of the moves in this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout but...","review":"A little too 1980's cheesy for me! If you can get past the high cut leotards, spandex, leg warmers & \\"rap\\" by hitting fast forward on your DVD then you will be ok. There are several different segments to the DVD so you can customize the workouts each time you want to use this DVD. I do think that the stretching & the workout is a good one but it may not be for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy Smith fan...","review":"I have several Kathy Smith videos & never minded the outdated clothes, hair, or music because of the quality of the workout. I've tried newer more popular videos every year & found the instructors prissy and their routines contrived. I'm a big fan of Kathy's style and she never failed to deliver a truly effective workout that left me soaked w/sweat & ready to do it again the next day. Having said that, this video SUCKED!! When I got pregnant I immediately sought out Kathy's video among all the other pregnancy fitness choices and was sorely disappointed. I think my grandmother could handle this routine on fast-forward!! I get more worked up doing my dishes than this video!! I've resorted to just doing my favorite Kathy Smith step video without the step instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated, not as safe as you need it","review":"I love Kathy Smith, but this DVD should be off the market. i cannot see how a 15 year video is still safe for prego women, so many things have changed with doctors that i do not feel comfortabel doing this retro video. The outfits made me laugh, and the cheesy moves were a hoot, but i didnt buy this for a laugh, so its not worth it to try it again and again, Fitmama is so much better. Sorry, but Kathy is not my prego teacher of choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"I bought this video after reading tons of rave reviews not only from this site but in several pregnancy magazines. After purchasing the video and trying the workout, I have to wonder, what is all the fuss about? 10 years ago this video may have been \\"it\\", but if you ask me it's completely outdated. The music and Jazzercise-atmosphere is barely tolerable. Don't get me wrong it's not the worst workout video I've ever used, but I definitely don't understand all of the high recommendations. If you want an up to date pregnancy workout that WORKS, try Fit Mama, which is available here at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Love it! Love it!","review":"This DVD is great for the expectant mother who wants a little more cardio in her workout. Plus there are sections that focus on muscle strengthing which I love. I also have Prenatal Yoga and Fit Momma, but this is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and informative","review":"I used this tape 2-3 times a week from my 3rd month of pregnancy until a week before I delivered. I'm convinced that the workout helped me not only to sleep better and have more energy while I was pregnant, but also to push more effectively during labor and bounce back more easily afterwards. The choreography is basic, so it's easy to follow even if you're not an aerobics nut. It's also very varied, so you won't get bored. The women in the tape are all in various stages of pregnancy, and Kathy Smith uses them to demonstrate modifications to the exercises. The only part of this tape that I didn't care for was the relaxation at the end. I found Kathy Smith's voice too perky for zoning out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around workout for maintaining fitness level.","review":"I was in excellent shape before I got pregnant and continued my regular workouts for several months into my pregnancy. I bought this video tape to help keep me excerising as my belly got bigger and I became more clumsy! I think it a pretty good tape - a bit easy for my fitness level, but it gets my heart rate up and all-in-all, is a well-rounded, safe workout for pregnant women. I do supplement this with a step workout and some additional power-walking. I'm not sure it would provide me with enough of a workout on its own. However, I can reccommend it, especially for those with a mid-lower level of fitness."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"works as specified, will drain a 9v battery in a matter of hours though, but thats expected because the camera consumes a lot of power; also the camera becomes quite hot after continuous operation, but does not seem to pose a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Day Time, with a good price","review":"I needed something easy to install and wireless so I purchased the WSE201 and connected it to my 4 channel dvr in minutes. The product works fairly well during the day time for the price you pay for. The night vision works well only when the subject is close to the camera.Also keep in mind if you want to connect multiple cameras to a DVR and want to record simultaneously you will need to have a receiver per camera. And if you don't want to spend that money you can have the receiver scan the cameras one at a time, making recording possible, but not simultaneously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap = Low Quality","review":"These cameras work but are very low quality. The picture is fuzzy but you are able to see for the most part during the daytime.

The item has very good \\"night vision\\" attributes. Beyond that I would not recommend it if you plan on placing the camera more than a few feet from the receiver. Yes, that's correct; no more than a few feet (less than 10 ft). I've tried it in more than one location and had the same results. Unless the camera and receiver have direct line of site and are no more than several feet apart, the picture suffers from a great deal of static and flicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't use with my wireless network","review":"Crashed my wireless router, turns out most of these systems use the same 2.4 Ghz band as most wireless routers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This camera does not deserve a single star,","review":"This camera does not deserve a single star, toys may work better than this.

Richard Simmons never appears on this video, in spite of his name being on the listing. Instead, the stars' parents do it all themselves in what is billed as a \\"non-aerobic, full-body conditioning and stretching program.\\" The exercises, such as they are, might be useful for older people who have never done any exercise and need just to get moving; however, the production is disorganized and amateurish. Golf clubs and tennis rackets are used as props for some exercises, which I suppose is to make us think the exercises have something to do with those sports--but in reality, they don't. The beginning and end contain advertising for a food supplement and other products that one suspects is the real reason this tape was produced.

I purchase a majority of my products after reading reviews and I have to say this was the worse purchase ever.

However, this one tasted horrible no matter what I did to it. It says that it's a pea protein, but you can really taste it in powder form and it's gross. I've used SuperFoods Supreme, Natural Berry and found that to be easier on my taste buds.

The vanilla soy protein version is not bad at all - in fact, I like it more than many of the other brands for the texture and flavor.But the apple cinnamon pea protein is completely unpalatable.

I really liked this book. As long as you don't expect to get a history lesson here (I spotted a few historical errors), aren't put off by editing goof-ups (seems like the editor fell asleep at the switch the last third of the book), and don't expect to learn technical information for a trans-continental trip of your own, you should like this book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Warm Performance","review":"While definately not Horne, Callas or Bumbry, this is a warm and enchanting take on a sometimes overly familier opera. Between a Veridan Carmen (Stignani) and Puccinian Don Jose (Gigli) not to mention that the whole thing is sung in Italian, we have something here that is probably very very different from what Bizet envisioned, but the sense of pure enjoyment in the performances jumps right out of the speakers.

The game when it came out had everything and was a start of a brand new kind of game play. Now with THIS edition though you can play on the internet, which was something many people wanted for some time. The races of 2 arn't nearly as strategic as StarCraft, its following great achiever, due to the facts that the Orcs and Humans in the game play are almost identical. The only real difference is the spells, and the way the units look.There is 2 reasons that I think you should buy this over StarCraft... One is that it has two GREAT previews of the upcoming game WarCraft 3 and the game Diablo 2. The other reason is that not everyone can afford computers that are incredibly fast. So if you can not play StarCraft very quickly and it goes slow on b.net for you, then WarCraft2 is something you must buy because it will work much more effectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"If people weren't so rude I'd give it a 5","review":"I loved Warcraft when I was a kid.

There are many places the author seems to run out of gas in his explanation of new ideas or else a computer is going to figure it out so not go into more detail. He does not follow through on problems and does not explain where he got an answer until a page or 2 later...leaving one frustrated as one tries to understand. I could go on and on, but this is NOT a very good book.

One poem in the voice of the non-existent black man whom Susan Smith said took her sons, okay, maybe. A whole cycle? Ugh. Are blacks are oppressed; is racism insidious? Yes, of course, duh. But Eady has nothing to say except to repeat and repeat the sequence's only idea--\\"isn't it rotten that the bogeyman is imagined as black in this racist world\\"--(to which I answer, \\"yeah, sure, and?\\") in uninspired language. The Running Man sequence unfortunately isn't much better. But I saw the musical that was made out of this sequence and at least on the page we're spared the silly preenings of actors convinced they're doing something revolutionary when in fact they're just rehashing rehashed material.

It seems really hard to find sweatbands that are good quality and inexpensive. Most sports brands make them but they are thin, the elastic doesn't last long, and they are usually $6-12. These were so affordable that I bought 10 and I was floored by the quality. They are thick and soft. I don't know yet how long they will hold up, but at this price it would be worth it even if they wear out quickly (for me, that means the elastic wears out or gets crunchy). I really couldn't be happier with these and I've been looking for good quality, cheap sweatbands for years.As an aside, these are also wide. They are thick, as in the cotton is tightly woven. But they are also wide across the band. Most sweatbands are about two fingers wide and this is more like three.

I prefer them to my costlier Under Armor sweat bands in that they're wider, more comfortable, and do a better job of absorbing sweat. Also, I like the extended color choices, being one partial to vivid color and not your basic black. Haven't noticed any color fade after several washings.

The bands are of high quality. Very thick. And they don't lose elasticity. In other words, unlike other bands, these will not become too big. The problem is, these bands are TOO SMALL. I'm only 5 ft tall. I don't have a gigantic head. But these bands are awfully tight for me. Due to their short length, the bottom of them rests about half way on the back of my head, and pulls my hair very high. So I look awful from the side. If the bands were longer, they would not pull my hair that high, yet they would still pull away my hair to allow my neck to cool off. That would be perfect.I have tried everything to stretch the bands, e.g., put them in the drier, wrap them around a drawer, So far I have only been able to stretch an inch.Maybe they are supposed to be wore around the head like a ring. But that does not allow ventilation on the neck. How much I wish they could be two inches longer.

Other people wrote the same thing, but I ignored it and now I have 5 headbands I will probably never use. To be fair the are very inexpensive, but I would have paid another ten cents to make them a little bigger.

To top things off they have this strong odor of gun oil, which might not be a complaint for some of us ;)I've washed them, stretched them, and done everything but beat them with a hammer and just can't use them as headbands.

You probably won't see much from the first 9 chapters on the Windows 2003 Server exam. Chapter 11 starts getting more technical and explains Active Directory fairly well, but this chapter also says that many topics are \\"beyond the scope of this book\\". This book is geared more towards a novice who has never setup a server before. I still think it's better than most of Microsoft's MOC books though.

However, this stove is one of the areas where I splurge. It is slightly heavier than a simple ultra light stove, but the weight is definitely worth it. Amazing simmer control, very sturdy pot arms (I can put cast iron frying pans on it no problem), and talk about POWER! It boils water in 3-4 minutes and is VERY fuel efficient. A 22oz MSR bottle of white gas will last me a week if I cook two twice a day. Some people say that noise is an issue, but you are only cooking for less than twenty minutes, so, who cares?

I never used the included wind screens with it (while light and packable, I don't feel they are particularly sturdy and believe they would have cracked and fallen apart from metal fatigue if I folded and unfolded them every time I've used the stove).

This was a great stove to use with a group of boy scouts (or kids for that matter). Its easy to light and even large pots sit securely on top. For anyone reading this that is going to Philmont, they have you cook for the entire crew with one stove so having a stove with some power saves a lot of time. It was painful to watch other crews try to boil water in an 8 quart pot with a whisperlite.

It is very well-made and is quite versatile.Thanks to having real tires it is particularly easy to push through grass, sand or whatever else you may encounter. We've been using it for about a year now and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"(Ostre sledovan�� vlaky)","review":"The misadventures of a fledgling male, confronting the adult world for the first time, become a dark comedy about lost innocence and transitory accomplishments. The young hero, Milos, assumes the responsibility of his first job as a stationmaster's assistant in a village outside Prague. He is a frightened faun of a youth, all eyes and knobby knees, settling into the routines of a railway employee's life, and seldom removing his cherished cap, even in bed. The comic balance between Milos's shyness in both love and business matters, and the satirical look at small-town ribaldry, hypocrisy, and isolationism is overshadowed by the presence of the Germans. (It is the 1940s.) Menzel's film is a second look, filled with wit and pathos, at a particular Czech Everyman, catching every nuance of Milos's bright, often painful revelations, and leaving the spectator stunned by the inevitability of an unexpected fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Picture Show Meets Von Ryan's Express","review":"Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one. Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone. The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is just one of the many jems from USA","review":"Basically, it's HOUSE, only the exact opposite. By that I mean that the format is still the same: character driven, medical mystery, but with the roles reversed. Now the doctor is nice and compassionate as opposed to rude and detached. Like HOUSE, its the character interactions that drive the show, rather than the solutions to the medical mysteries. While not as good as BURN NOTICE, or, in my opinion, PSYCH, ROYAL PAINS is nonetheless a great show in an ever growing list of great original shows put out by USA Networks."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"What do we have?

I personally think this show is different from your typical doctor shows on tv right now. Hank is a doctor that was let go from the hospital were he was currently worked, feeling depress his brother Evan who is funny in the show take him to the Hamptons where everything change for them.

His albums are full of variety, he sings ballads, Rocks, digital tunes in one album. And he wraps them up with his own voice. This album is not the exception. Kuroda's voice is gentle and high-tone, yet powerful. What he sings in this album is not only love, but sorrow, joy of life. He writes most of the lyrics, and they sounds convincing, even touching. His lyrics are always complicated or full of metaphor, but I think Kuroda made them more clearer and simplified this time. What attract the listners the most is his affection for life. This album makes listners feel like going forward or not to give up no matter how the situation seems bad, or no matter how pathetic you are thinking of yourself. This album is almost all about Kuroda Michihiro, so it may be a good start to listen to his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insights","review":"This book is helpful to those of us in similar estranged family situations, especially since it's a topic most are reluctant to talk about. Knowing others are dealing with the same issues was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and easy to read","review":"The book is great if your focus is on acceptance and moving on. I found the sections on learning from successful families and the Injustice Collector to be very helpful. It gave some understanding of the family dynamics that could lead to estrangement. My biggest complaint is that most of the focus was on children who were estranged by their parents for various reasons. I would have appreciated a bit more focus on adult children who choose to estrange themselves and their children from good loving parents for no logical reason and the hurt and devastation that it causes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book has helped me tremendously to come to terms with my family pain. I recommend reading this book along with seeking therapy. Some families just cant be put back together, and sometimes you just have to walk away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful book","review":"This book helped from the first page, practically. It is simply helpful to know that I'm not the only one to suffer the pain of rejection by family members, and that there is life without the encumbrance of toxic family. I'm working on creating my second chance family and learning how to be a friend and wife, lessons that I never learned as a child. It's never too late to start over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suture for the Soul","review":"This book was just what I needed. After my brother and I went through a painful fight, he vowed never to speak to me again. My whole being had been shattered. Days would go by where I would barely eat and just lie in bed for hours and hours. Looking online for some help, I discovered this book and it changed my outlook. Reading the stories of those who've gone through trials like my own helped heal my wounds. With each step, I found the courage to move on with my life and continue living. Finally, I regained the strength to let the pain wash away. If you've been cutoff or disowned by your family and feel yourself shaken to the core, this book will be your map to finding happiness again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and liberating","review":"I was impressed by how the author outlined the effects and underlying trauma that accompany a family rift.

I have gotten copies for family members and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"Until about 1/3 of the way into this book, I wasn't sure I would like it. Della began as a rather weak woman who was looking for a man - any man. Fortunately, I stuck with the book and as the plot thickened, Della changed. She used her brain and, with hard work, achieved what most wouldn't be willing to work so hard to achieve. There were a couple of interesting plot twists, and one major twist that was predictable. I liked Della and how she learned to handle herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Della","review":"Awesome book! I could not put it down. Great book to read on a cold weekend bundled up.

Poor Della, Rich Steven, a buch of back room shady dealings. It was a definate hoot. Julie Michele Gettys did a very fine job of creating a hell of a story and keeping you on the edge of your seat until the very last page. And she really made you feel what the characters were feeling. A very good read, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"We miss this great game","review":"We had this game in DOS on our old computer. We have been trying for over a year to replace it. It is hard to find. I placed an order in November and was promised 1-2 week delivery. Now cannot track it and it is listed unavailable. This was a great game for the kids and their grandma(me) with bonus rounds and levels that even I could manage. Never mind the higher levels. Too challenging for an old lady. That is ok.

The solo guitar is in the old style, ie. George Van Eps. Mr Sveglini, in spite of some rough moments, delivers the tunes with tenderness and delicacy. His vocal work, which is interlaced with the guitar pieces, at times sounds like church music, and perhaps this is because of his job as a Director of Chapel Music at Burlingame, California's United Methodist Church. His voice is pleasant and even though at times it sounds a bit uptight and a touch out of tune, Bill Sveglini offers an easy and enjoyable CD that trully comes From the Heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Expression","review":"Mr. Sveglini chose a very appropriate title for his album,...his talent comes from his love of music, --his excellent work with the blending of both the guitar & the piano is evidence to that. I found his guitar playing beautiful & lush with emotion. His voice can be peaceful without being weak or ineffectual, & it can be equally powerful without being harsh or over-bearing.The purity & sentiment he offers in \\"Peace I Leave With You.\\" is like a warm & comforting embrace when you need it most,...he gives \\"Yesterday.\\" the passionate lull that it deserves,...& his rendition of \\"Greensleeves.\\", --a favorite tune of mine for many years, expresses all the joy & tenderness of romance.

Don't buy!","review":"I am making this review for the sake of bringing down the rating. To reiterate what other reviewers have already made clear, this atlas has a serious binding problem. If a location is at the center of a two-page map, its difficult, if not impossible, to see the location. This is because the tight binding forces the two pages too close together.On the spur of the moment, without access to amazon.com reviews, I bought this atlas at a bargain price at a new/used bookshop. It had a glossy attractive cover, and I had been wanting a more manageable atlas than my bulky \\"Times Atlas of the World.\\" The \\"Times Desktop Atlas of the World\\" is much more mangeable than its big brother, but it has only 25,000 place names. The \\"National Geographic Collegiate Atlas of the World\\" has about 55,000 place names, but it has its binding problem.I give this a one-star review, because I believe this atlas is something you should not buy.

We installed the film and patiently used the squeegee to push as many bubbles as possible. The finished product just looks cheap.

You will totally need to unload the suspension when doing this install. You will need to be very careful doing this! Also make sure you use safety stands and chock the wheels. If you are running a 3 in catback exhaust you will need to drop that down too. I also had to place a jack between the frame and the axle to install these. The ride is very stiff to you load them down for the first time(ie a trailer). After that,they work great! Very smooth ride for a extra spring on the suspension. *Notice* You will gain an inch or two higher ride height on the rear of you truck so be prepared to get you headlights adjusted so you can see at night.(this was on a half ton truck).

But when it does work, it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This wine opener is NOT easy to use. You have to press hard to insert the needle into the cork, especially the plastic corks. If the opener/needle slips while you're attempting to push it in, you risk injury.

I've always struggled with corkscrews, but I was nervous that using the needle type would take too much strength for my weak little hands. But on the first use, it could not have been easier. It was simple to slide the needle into the cork, and the only surprise was how quickly it popped out. It was actually a little startling, like popping a champagne cork. The instructions note the opener cannot be used on 1.5 liter bottles or carbonated wines, but neither of those is an issue. I was always so disappointed and embarrassed that I couldn't enjoy wine at home, because I always needed help with a corkscrew- but those days are over as I sit here enjoying my first glass of Shiraz. I highly recommend this opener to anyone who is tired of tearing up corks or hurting their wrists with a conventional corkscrew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best stocking stuffer","review":"I bought this for my folks for Christmas.

First roll of film and it is already struggling mightily to work. The teeth slip off the roll because the flimsy gears are not strong enough to even pull the roll. I finally figured out after wasting a few frames a way to carefully advance the film without the gears letting go. This product is made at a level of a claw-machine toy. There is flat out no excuse for the Lomo company to charge $40 for this item. I totally respect what they have done for the Lomo movement and everything but this is not the way to do it. This product will alienate people from the movement; it is that bad. Go ahead and buy it and you will see what I am talking about.

I was really excited, I've had experience with toys cameras, like Holga and the Diana F+ Mini and enjoyed their unpredictability and spontaneity. However, the Oktomat never produced a single picture. Out of the box, the gears weren't winding properly and my film wasn't latching onto the gears properly. After about 20 shots of my 36 roll of film, the camera ceased to advanced or set of the shutter when I pressed the shutter release button. Not even one roll of film ended up coming out. A real disappointment. I mean I understand it's a toy, but really lomo? $40 for a toy that simply doesn't function?!?! Save yourself the time, money, and hassle.

While many fine older collectibles are shown from the collections of Michael Conran and George McWhorter, it would appear that the author had very little in his own collection, and seemed to \\"pad\\" the book with pages of common collectibles. There are tons of vintage items that could have been shown that were sacrificied to show multiple pages of new trading cards, new paperbacks & new comic books. Still a nice book for a collection, though.Schiffer produced a book on Oz memorabilia a few years ago, which was written by three major Oz collectors. Because the collectors knew their stuff, it turned out to be a fantastic reference book - very hard to top. Schiffer should have followed this same formula and consulted more long-time collectors to write a book on Tarzan collectibles."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book...","review":"but my critical thinking got the better of me. I agree with Heyward's stance on inclusiveness within the church, and the importance of not letting our concepts of Christ get the better of us, but she seems to have left Christianity entirely behind, or worse, used isolated Christian terms for their cultural weight while reinventing them to suit her own personal agenda. Her Christianity relates not to church or the story of Jesus, even in an allegorical sense, but to the wispy New Age mysticism that reduces religion to nonsensical abstract terms with no reality or practicality to them at all. Her spirit is fluffy and her flesh is entirely absent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christianity unplugged","review":"Christianity is so rethought here that there's nothing left.

Opinionated and has an obvious personal bias (Thank goodness for some honesty !). Some of the stories are hilarious as well as illuminating and insightful.

Furthermore his control on the orchestra is never in doubt.Cleveland plays beautifully: the string session provides audible warmth and depth even in the most powerful tutti.the famous coda of the 4th movement does have that sense of redemption we would expect after the dramatic tension created by the gigantic fugue.A great performance.

I am not particularly a student of Genghis Khan and the Mongal conquests, but do feel reasonably well informed on events up to 1260.

This was not the book. The authors seem to be Gung-Ho anti-hospital with their critiques of the admitting processes of hospitals to the use of intravenous and medicines administered during childbirth. They concentrate on the risk of infection that can be contracted from standard hospital procedures to the point of paranoia. The authors attempt to make the reader more informed but just end up scaring them with all of the obstetrical textbook jargon. In a sense, it reads more like a 'Worst Case Scenario' handbook.Before reading, I was nervous about childbirth, even having heard a few horror stories from family members and friends, since I reading it, I have become absolutely frightened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Childbirth Resource","review":"This is a great book. My son was born overseas in a small town and this book was the only natural childbirth resource I used.

I live in small town and our hospital has not used forceps in delivers for years due to the risks. In addition, the part about giving your baby water the first few days - you should never give your infant water under 6 months of age - ask a pediatrician that's current, not old school.

The Lamaze class could not fit into my schedule so I looked to books. This book was nice for a mom who is just reviewing the techniques. It is VERY outdated and I believe even scary for the first time mom who does not know what to expect.So I think this would be a fine book to review the Lamaze method, but that is about all it is good for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Price fan and cancer survivor","review":"I first read this in 1995, during the long week prior to surgery to remove a growing mass of cancer that, thankfully, has never revisited me.

A battle of wits from 2 people trying to destroy each other with words. Ms. Beverley went deep to come up with such sophisticated insults. She had to have done a lot of research, as well, to find so many perfect literary quotes. Still when the \\"Rogues\\" entered the story the excitement began and at that point I couldn't put the book down. The best is Nicholas' toast to Dare and all on page 327, so perfect too. That is why I gave it a 4 instead of the 3 I started to and because I love Blanche, Nicholas, Hal and all the other \\"Rogues\\" I have read about.(dare I end a sentence with a preposition??) My copy is one of the first printings in 1992, very much read and bought at auction and glad I won the bid. Looking forward to reading the 3 Georges books and finding more of all her \\"Rogue\\" and older Renfrew/Kyle series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The heroine changes midway through the book.","review":"Beth, the headstrong feminist heroine, is incredibly likable in the beginning of this book. She's witty, she's strong, she's unimpressed with Lucien (who is entirely too impressed with himself) and she's independent. After they marry, she becomes co-dependent to the degree that after he hits her, she covers up for him! Lies to his parents, etc. THEN, as if that were not strange enough, she asks him to take her to meet his mistress. Does that seem like it's in character? That Beth would be comforting HIM after he hits her (and taking the blame), and that after a scene like that, she'd want anything to do with him? But wait, there's more to stretch your credulity! After that slap, Beth wants to meet Lucien's mistress, and they become friends, of course! Can we have romance heroines who have a little self-respect back? Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitting a woman is NEVER okay!","review":"What appalled me more than Lucien's backhand was Beth's reaction to it. Instead of hitting him back (my preferred reaction) or taking him to task, she forgives him and shoulders most of the blame. The whole interaction disgusted me. I don't mind that the man had a temper. In fact, I think an angry man can be a sexy man. But he should have hit the wall or thrown a priceless vase. He shouldn't have hit a defenseless, innocent woman.Lucien is NOT a hero, a man, or anyone I could admire or root for. He is a spineless coward who uses his fists against people who are no match for him physically. And then to say he did it because he loves her so much - UGH! He's a wife beater and I wish instead of forgiving him, Beth would have kneed him in the balls.I'm not sure I can ever read another Jo Beverly. This was my first and it really turned me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Even leaving aside the revolting manner in which the so-called hero behaves, this book is dull in the extreme. she is a shrew, he is self-centered, and the whole thing comes to a convoluted and crashing halt at the end of the book. the author has totally lost her way on this one. Trying to set up for a new title in the series is never a good idea, and you would reall have had to read other books in the series to understand a lot of what is going on, or even like any of the characters. Her terror of his violence becomes all too real, and making excuses is not acceptable. I agree with the other reviewers that publishing houses and especially the predominantly female editors in these house should never make abuse or forced sexual ecounters the stuff for which they base their entertainment or their profits. And any author who thinks it is amusing for readers should donate her time and at least part of her profits to a women's shelter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!","review":"I have a feeling that I wouldn't have cared for Lucien, Marquess of Arden, if I hadn't first read about him in the wonderful AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE.

After a promising start that had me very intrigued, the book went incredibly slow and bored me to tears with bits that were as useful as water is to wine. It took ages for something to happen between Lucien and Beth. Okay, I generally don't like sex too early in a book but in this story things are postponed way too much and eventually (my) anticipation turned into a solid \\"who cares?\\". Besides, I never managed to like the heroine: for this that she is described as a bluestocking I found her rather dull and not very intelligent at all.There were other details that annoyed me, such as Lucien being the result of an affair his mother had had when the Duke was away hunting. Pity! I really liked the Duke and I wished he hadn't loved his wife that dearly. She simply was undeserving of his devotion, IMHO. I so believe that both the hero and his \\"father\\" deserved better heroines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Head strong heroine goes nowhere","review":"I did not like it.

They turn in circle until, it seams, the author realised the story's boring, then, she (the author) digs out an old bad guy from previous story to make something happend...

He twists her arm and causes her pain and is constantly threatening to beat her up and it's not in a joking manner (not that it is funny anyway).When I read \\"he backhanded her..\\" I nearly fell out of my chair. THIS is a \\"romance?\\" The heroine very quickly forgives him, he quickly forgets that he's hit her and the whole book made me so ill, I threw it away.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but most assuredly not to anyone seeking to read a romance. This isn't romance. This is domestic violence. The last two chapters made me sick and the character does such an about face about her \\"modesty\\" or whatever that I just couldn't bear to finish this book.The worst \\"romance\\" I have ever read, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"No One Gorgeous Enough For Lucien","review":"It wouldn't have mattered how beautiful a heroine was, she still wouldn't match Lucien, Marquess of Arden, in looks.

Each test series contains a wide cross-section of different types of puzzles so you are tested thoroughly. For example, there are diagrammatic puzzles, probability questions, crosswords, cryptograms, anagrams and other questions that really don't fit neatly into any of these categories.

With the advent of VB.NET, I began searching for a book that could be used to teach it. The requirements are that it be in a laboratory format, start at a low level and be fairly thorough in coverage.Unfortunately, this book is nowhere close to meeting those requirements. While it is structured as a series of exercises, the coverage is far too shallow to be used in anything but the shortest of courses. Very few of the exercises get beyond the simplest of structures and there is very little demonstration of how subroutines interact. The exercises generally consist of a simple program where the user is to insert very small segments to make it functional.We have been using the Shelley and Cashman book for the VB 6.0 course and this book barely covers half of what is covered in the that book.

Along the way they add various passages from the Bible - at least one from every book of the Bible(all 66)and tie them in with their trip in a wonderful way.

It's a very long drawn out process and not very exciting. The book reads more like the romance novel it once was. I can't believe romance readers would be very happy either in this diluted version.

But we learn that Quinn is trying to stop another burglar/murderer from stealing the collection. Lots of twists and turns.Ms Hooper has not fleshed out the other caracters so you may get confused as to relationships, and in this book that is important.I perfered the ending to the original much better because it did end. Ms Hooper left an opening for a sequel with this re write.If you like suspense with weak paranormal, this one is ok. But if you like romanace, stick with the old series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I read Once A Thief, what a disappointment. The first book was just an introduction for the second. The preview of Always A Thief ,located at the back of the first book, is still trying to solve the same crime. The characters are the same, still in the same location and still nothing happening. I really got weary of every person and animal described as having witchy green eyes.

And that is it, folks, that is the book, in less than...50 words. And it doesn't end, either. Nope. Absolutely nothing gets resolved in this book. The mystery falls flat, dropped halfway through in favor of the villain who will supposedly carry the next book. There is no secondary romance. There are no security facts, history of cat burgalars, little info on the jewelry, no high society foibles, no background information whatsoever. It is just Quinn and Morgan for 300 or so pages of mass market paperback. When it ends without even a resolution of the *irritating* romance I've been trying so hard to stay awake through for two books I threw it against the wall in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow mystery novel by Kay Hooper","review":"In Always A Thief, internationally renown jewelry thief Quinn is \\"encouraged\\" by Interpol to catch another thief, Nightshade, who has no qualms about murdering those in his/her way. Museum employee Morgan falls in love with Quinn, but Nightshade knows this as well, and Quinn knows Nightshade has this information. Who will catch who?Author Kay Hooper tries to please readers of two genres with this book: those who read mysteries, and those who read romance novels. Sadly, I think both categories of readers will be disappointed. The mystery is convoluted but shallow, with the \\"who-dunit\\" plot seeming forced. You'll really learn nothing of Nightshade or Quinn, but you will learn about Morgan's flirtation with and romance for Quinn.Shallow characters. Shallow plot. This is a book that I finished because it was easy to follow and I really expected something to happen eventually.It didn't. The end. Whew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thief storyline started in Once is finished in Always","review":"This book can be read independent of Once a Thief; however, if you have read Once a Thief and were left disappointed, you must read Always a Thief. I found Always a Thief has satisfying wrap-up of the storyline started in Once a Thief. There is a bit of a cliffhanger at the end and an amply number of twists and turns throughout the novel. I would definitely enjoy a third Thief book should Ms. Hooper chose to continue this line of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always A Thief","review":"Excellent book, suspenseful, a definite page turner. This book is among the many great books by Tina Wainscott, another of the Thief\\" series. I have read several books by her, and definitely love each one. Tina Wainscott is one of my favorite authors. Her stories deftly envelope you in intrigue, and her descriptions of characters are so well done that you can imagine them in person. Highly recommend all of her books. Received in perfect condition, and quick and easy transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quinn is fabulous!","review":"I love books where the heros are morally ambiguous and maybe while they might have some noble motives, they are also admittedly selfish in their actions. Most authors will shy away from this, giving their hero(ine)s some honorable backstory about why they are stealing. Hooper doesn't do that with Quinn. He likes the challenge and he doesn't feel bad about stealing money from the rich. He's a fabulous character, though the backstory is somewhat convoluted. He charms you into falling in love with him, even when his motives and methods for doing what he does are no longer a mystery.For some reason Morgan just didn't seem to be much of a believable match for him. Hooper kept alluding to her brilliance, but there wasn't much evidence of it. She wasn't stupid by any means, but she didn't seem as smart as Hooper kept giving her credit.I won't ruin the ending, but it left enough loose ends open to leave me wanting more of Quinn. I want a third installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Anything but boring!\\"","review":"As I said before I am a huge fan of Lay Hooper! I love all of her books.

It does wrinkle a little but it hasn't hindered any of my pictures at all.I really like the easy setup and take down of it, it makes a perfect portable chroma key background.I found a lot of instructional video on youtube,but for what it is worth, go here... [...] feature=related and forget the rest of them. This really works and it is so easy once you do it once or twice you will not believe you ever had any trouble with it.

The riffs are good but not always great; the ska theme doesn't always work & it's a bit too blatant; and Lars' voice is way better than Tim's & it still is.

I wonder what Jesse Michaels thinks of it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this PUNK","review":"Well of course it is. Unlike the other titles placed under this unbrella. Hole is not punk- Harvey Danger is not punk. Just because a punk influence in obviously there does not classify it as PUNK.

And is you dont like it- keep it anyway, when PUNK is revived you'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a peice of punk rock history","review":"or so says the management at epitaph, rancids record label. i rather think that this album, while it does have its moments, avenues and allyways, anyone, takes a back seat to the sex pistols, the clash, and even the work of another east bay band, operation ivy, sho at least addressed the issues that are plagueing modern america. in any case, you have to respect them for being one of the only bands still wearing mohawks."},{"rating":"1","title":". . . and out comes the truth","review":"These punks really wear their Clash influence on their sleeves. It's not a bad influence to have; hard-core and ska are worthy genres as well. Rancid do it with conviction and do it well, particularly the bass player.The main problem is I hardly ever make it through this entire CD. There's almost no point because the songs sound so much alike. I can understand people going crazy for this music (at least for a little while), but Rancid's style and songwriting powers, at least on this album, are pretty limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could I have some cliches with my punk, please?","review":"They may have a good message, but they sound just like the Clash. Scratch that: the Clash were innovators, changing their musical style as they grew and developed. Rancid has sounded the same since its inception, deviating little, if at all, from the punk-ska formula. Replete with fake British accents and a cover with a photo of boots on it, it's all a clich��. If you like punk cliches, and you don't mind hearing the same song 19 times, then this is the album for you. If you like cookie-cutter punk that doesn't stray one inch from the formula, then this is for you. If you don't want your musical expectations challenged, it's definitely for you. Yes, it's fun. But that's it: just some fun with a good message and a lot of trappings. If this is the best punk can offer, than it really must be dead. So, rock out with this if you must, but maybe you'd be better off with some AC/DC or something else just as generic and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say???","review":"This CD has some of the greatest work ever done by such a band as Rancid. Not only is there such catchiness to the now more ska-influenced songs here and there, but even the old school punk rockers can love its occasional pounding song! There's something for everyone on this extreme gem of an album! It is their best-seller, anyway. That can only say that Rancid has produced an album that can suffice to a wide variety of tastes and ages. Well, some vulgarity is included, but that's the greatness that is punk rock!!!! Best songs - Too many to list. If there's too many to list, YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Good Punk Rock Music","review":"Rancid is one of the best punk rock bands out there. This CD is an essential for any Rancid fan. \\"Time Bomb\\" is a great ska revival track, and \\"Ruby Soho\\" is also a classic.

IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE IN A GOOD WAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rancid Rules","review":"This album is awesome, very few beat it. As far as punk albums, The Clash's London Calling, Green Day's Nimrod, Operation Ivy's Energy are probably the only ones that beat it. Rancid continues to keep alive the East Bay punk scene of the 80s unlike other bands of the same place and time like Isocracy, Crimpshine and others who have long broken up. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW, AND GET READY TURN IT UP FULL BLAST, CUZ THIS ALBUM IS amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rancid's Best","review":"And Out Come the Wolves is, without a doubt, Rancid's best album.

And im glad i got this albu. just on the first track alone i fell in love with it.. the bass solo on maxwell murder is amazing. its remarkable even to the most skilled bassists. matt freeman by far is the best bassist in punk. the rest of the cd is also very good. with melodic chorus' and catcy tunes but with nice punk riffs and hard raspy vocals on other parts. there are a few tracks i am not a fan of like #2 and the track daly city train."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rancid Album. Period.","review":"This, in my opinion, is the best Rancid album ever made. Every song is catchy, fun to listen to, has great bass and are short and to the point. The album opens up with the virtuoso bass, fast punk song, Maxwell Murder. After it goes into 11th Hour and others that are great to listen to. Then it gets to Ruby Soho, one of the catchiest songs on the album and a big single from the album. After Ruby Soho, the rest of the album is good to listen to. Not a single \\"bad, skip this\\" song. All songs are ska-based and have catchy choruses, which surprises me because I didn't think Tim and the crew would write 19 awesome songs on one cd. Well, they did. If you don't have this album for some reason, get it. Buy it, burn it, something. JUST GET IT!! Also, if you like Operation Ivy, you are most likely going to love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk goes mainstream? Whatever, just buy it.","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the top five albums of the 1990's. The immense number of radio songs notwithstanding, the space between them is filled with phenomenal basslines, passionate (if untalented) vocals, and just the noise made by four guys who really, truly, love music. That's the one thing I respect most about Rancid: From the first selftitled up through Indestructible, you know that they're in a band because they love what they do, not for money or fame. Nowhere is this more clear than on this record.I was going to list the highlights, but then I realized that every one of the 19 tracks is great. Seriously. If we go with the five-star system, I think the only song that gets less than four stars in my book is \\"The Way I Feel\\", and it still gets 3.5. While I'm a Green Day fanatic for life, Rancid is only a half-step behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC!!","review":"This is an absolute classic punk CD.

My favorite songs on here are 'Olympia, WA', 'Old friend', 'Lock, step and gone', and 'Time bomb'. If you like Operatioin Ivy, get this since Rancid has 2 opivy members in it. GET THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You're a better person with it in your life","review":"This is great, it goes beyond their back catalogue and their influences, stop comparing them to the Clash, these guys are better.This album has produced some blistering tunes and some great anthems, I consider it one of the greatest albums I have ever heard in my life and I find it hard to believe that this could change in the near future.Every time I think about doubting the greatness, I play the intro to 'Journey to the end of East Bay' and watch people's faces just turn to shock, they're that good that covers sound great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This has to be one of the most listenable CDs ever produced, assuming you like the genre. Maybe even a little too easy to listen to. This CD has never been very far from my CD player for nearly seven years. I think that is a feat in and of itself, as most of my CDs rarely see the light of day until I get a weird feeling to listen to them again. If you can make out the lyrics, they have some meaning. If you can't, just let the guitars carry you away, and before you notice, an hour has passed and you will be late for work."},{"rating":"2","title":"my personal favorite rancid cd","review":"it is so awsome. just the rancid vocals, along with rancid instruments......making this my favorite cd of all times. it's hard to beat any song by rancid. my personal favorite is Time Bomb. if you like that song, you will absolutely love this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"This is the first and only Rancid CD I have so far, and I love it.

Or both.This album is a classic from a band that was the cornerstone of the 90s punk revival. In an era of punk that was fairly flaky, Rancid still stands out as one of the more genuine acts.Fact is, \\"Out Come The Wolves\\" is an enjoyable album, filled with top-notch punk music. They may not be innovative at what they do, but Rancid does it really really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Rancid is a pretty good punk band.

The moment i put this in, i was amazed. every song on this cd is excelent. the songs arent too long, the longest one being around three minutes. the best thing about rancid is the emotion that they express in their lyrics. do yourself a favor and buy this CD. this is a must have for any punk rocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would've been 3 if it wasn't rancid","review":"I give this CD 3.5 stars. I didn't know whether to put 3 or 4, but seeing as it was my beloved Rancid, I decided on 4. I love Rancid, and I love all of their albums, except this one, which I just LIKE. Don't get me wrong . . . I have played this album repeatedly since I got it, but there are a few songs I always skip (particularly the HORRIBLE Maxwell Murder, which doesn't even sound like Rancid), whereas with the other albums, there is not a single bad track. The album in general though, is good - quite fast paced, REAL punk, with some good ska thrown in too. As Wicked, The War's End, and Roots Radicals are probably the best tracks. I can also appreciate Ruby Soho, although it sounds a little bit more commercial (but not poppy) than the usual Rancid. So, you should buy Out Come The Wolves, but buy Rancid's other albums first."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen to any Oi! album","review":"And you will hear all these songs.

Their still great, and in my eyes, they will never sell out. This cd is proof that punks not dead, and if anyone says it is, point to this album, and you will prove them wrong. This album has more ska elements than any other cd, and is the slowest Rancid cd. Slow or not, \\"Let's Go\\" or \\"Rancid 2000\\" aren't even in the same range of greatness that this cd is in.

However if you like Rancid, or you think you do.... try listening to Operation Ivy, The vocalist and drummer from Rancid are both in this ausom band.

Every song on here is as classic as the album itself. There's far too much praise to give this album that could fit into 1,000 words, so all that can be said is that if you don't own this album definitely get it. These songs are honest, energetic accounts of the world we live in, and if they hit you like they hit me, catchy enough to get stuck in your head for the rest of your life.

It's from a Christian publisher and I'm sure there's a good market for such fiction (you can leave it where the kids might find it), but I'll take a pass in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, youth...","review":"This was the first Bad Religion CD I bought, and I have never regretted buying this before a regular studio CD. A warning: there are several live versions on this, so if you are looking for the slick, produced versions only (why??), this might not be the CD for you. I really appreciated the fact that it had so many of songs from different albums, so I got a broad sampling of their already large repertoire. Now that I own other CDs by this band, I would still recommend this CD to new listeners, or to people who like to listen to live versions and all their energy.Good recording, GREAT band. See them live and buy their CDs. They've been around, and they definitely know how to put out amazing, smart, solid, and highly charged political punk music. Part of the social conscience and forward-thinking backbone of the entire punk scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must - have for any music fan","review":"With Bad Religion,you can never go wrong.Songwriters duo Greg Graffin and Brett Gruewitz easily match the absolute Lennon&McCartney; of punk:Joey and DeeDee Ramone.Greg G and Mr.Brett lyrics actually mean something,and they're not classicpunk lyrics at all.Unlike Dead Kennedys' Jello Biafra,Greg G andMr.Brett's social commentary always has an universal meaning andmessage,and it will never be dated,because it speaks of entirehumanity's life,fate,etc.About the album:a compilation from BR's Epitaph albums(the debut,Suffer,No Control,Against the Grain,Generator)-this is definitelythe album to start with.There is not one bad song on it,seriously!But let me point to the best:I Want to Conquer the World,Modern Man,The Answer,Against the Grain,Generator,oh,darn,they are all the best!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Punk Rock Compilation that ever did/will exist!","review":"Bad Religion is definitely one of the best punk bands ever, ranking up at the top with Dead Kennedys, NOFX, and Subhumans. Greg Graffin is definitely the smartest punk rocker I've ever heard, and his take on modern-day society is worth ever punk's ears. This cd showcases some of BR's best work, and some of the best songs ever written. My favorite songs are: No Control- Great lyrics that every human should listen to carefully, and catchy tunes; Atomic Garden- Just plain good, the musical abilities of the band really shine through here; Faith Alone- Another thoughtful song by Mr. Graffin, very true stuff; Modern Man- another sarcastic take on well, modern man, great stuff; F**k Armageddon, this is Hell- Awesome live track, fitting end to an awesome BR cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"BR is god, the rest can go burn!","review":"This is the definitive BR album, with almost every good song you'd like to listen to. The only things it doesn't have is American Jesus and Along the Way, but the rest of the music more than makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad religon rules!~!!!!","review":"This cd is one of the best compilations around.

I srongly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A FUN GAME!","review":"After spending a few hours trying to decipher the mysteries of Railroad Tycoon II, I finally experienced enlightenment and realized I was NOT having fun. The game has many tempting possibilities of entertainment, but I found the game frustrating to play. The manual does not explain much; building stations and laying track are difficult and unforgiving tasks. I have not played the first version of the game, and this may explain my befuddlement.In short, I would not recommend this game. In fact if you really want this game, my trash pick up is on Thursday and this game will be in the can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont get it","review":"This game is worth about 28 hours of good play than it realy gets boring.

I give this game 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother, can you spare a dime?","review":"I never could get this game chugging on more than one cylinder.

If you are not into the esoterica of steam trains or stupid country music, the computer steals the fun and always has you dead to rights. Historical trade and industrial patterns are treated very lightly indeed.

Iv'e read about it and it sounded really fun. It sounded really fun to build a train company, and to build train stations but when i really tried it, it was so hard, and it wasn't fun. It's hard to understand the investments thing and you are loosing all of your money in 5 minutes. I dont understand why is everybody saying that this game is good, cause this game is bad. VERY BAD! VERY, VERY BAD! Who can prove that i'm wrong? a couple of days after i bought i started to use cheats in the game because it is too hard. This game should get 0 starts, it should get nothing. So... Dont buy it because you'll just be waisting your money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent strategy game that you will find addictive!","review":"What a game.

Each new campaign is progressively more difficult and requires its own strategy to win.

Although, to the credit of some of the other \\"cheap-ass\\" music DVD's I've seen (not GN'R DVD's, but music DVD's in general) at least they've been able to remember and pronounce the f**king band members names for God's sake! This one sounds like a real horror story. I love GN'R, but thanks to the heads up from other Amazon users I will not be wasting my money.

In January I found out this DVD was coming out, and picked it up in April when it was finally released. I was excited because it was the first Guns N' Roses DVD ever.If I knew it was going to be that bad, as avid of a fan as I am, I would have never bought it.

There is no exclusive interviews with any of the band members - just some old footage of Slash, Duff, and Izzy shot years ago on the road. Axl is no where to be found other than the photos. And, there is absolutely no Guns N' Roses music any where on the disc. Ultimately, this documentary does nothing for the avid Gunner and looks like a home made movie. Waste of $20.00 for sure. Hopefully, VH-1's \\"Behind the Music\\" style documentary will be more worthy of our time than this monstrosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This DVD is completely awful. I'm a big Guns fan but I learned nothing new from this DVD. This DVD played like film student's first project before any real education. Most of the people interviewed in the story weren't really important players in GnR history (Axl's tattoo artist? Give me a break) and no real insight was gained.

Quite a fun read in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my taste","review":"About a year ago I read my first Robert Rankin book 'The Witches of Chiswick' after seeing it in the library and just being attracted to the title. I absolutely loved it. I never laughed aloud so much from reading a book. I was surprised because I am not usually into this genre. My husband read it after me and fell in love too. I then decided that I wanted to read every single book by R. Rankin.I bought 'Anti-Pope' and neither me or my husband liked it. He gave up 1/4 through and I had to force myself to finish it.I'm not saying it is bad... it is just not my type of thing. The story was pointless to me and not exciting at all. The writing and posh language of the characters was too surreal and the wit, puns, and silly footnotes from the author that I found in 'Witches of Chiswick' were missing completely.I'm not giving up on R. Rankin all together, but I wouldn't recommend 'The Anti-Pope' at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Total rip off. It advertises itself as something it isn't.

First, you are forced to play the tutorial, before you can start playing the real game. But the tutorial doesn't show you how to play the game. In fact at a couple points they leave you hanging as to how to acomplish certain tasks. The instructions book is no help either. The graphics were fair, nothing to wright home about. I recommend sticking with StarCraft or Sim City 3000. However, if you are really into the whole mob thing you still might want to check out this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do we go from here?","review":"1) Don't buy this game. 2) If you buy this game, be prepared to think you are about to have a blast only to learn that there is no way around a dead end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to be part of Mafia....?","review":"This game is really not worth it!

(of course), except for maybe the part with Bulma, but you'll get to that.

When this product arrived, I noticed that it was thinner than the two I already owned, and therefore had less of a cushion feel. Much worse than that, though, was the terrible odor. The pads have very strong chemical smells. I soaked each one in soapy water, then air dried them, but the smell remains, albeit slightly less potent. Initially, even handling the mousepads would make my hands smell until I washed them. They're unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size is nice but smell is not.","review":"I read the reviews and figured people were over reacting about the smell. They were not!

The enemies adapt to your tactics, so you have to change stratagies fairly often. There are several vehicles to drive, and they respond differently depending on their size. I didn't like the fact that there is no parking brake, so if you stop to use the guns, the vehicle usually rolls so it is hard to target anything. And usually if you spend time trying to crawl through the bushes and sneak up on enemies they see you anyway so it is a waste of time. But those are only a few issues I had with a really outstanding game. It is worth the money, especially now that it is old and cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck with the installation","review":"Note - I am rating the product as a whole, not the gameplay.I bought this as a sealed Jewel Case, the 5CD version. Installing it went allright until the fifth CD, when a file could not be copied. (The CD's were all new and looked to be in great shape).Upon googling the error message, this appears to be a common issue with rewritable drives, but even my ROM drive did not work, nor any of the other 4 I tried on other machines. So alas, while this is evidently a great game judging from other reviews, I did not get past the install screen. From what I could research, this appears to be caused by the rather finicky copy protection (SafeDisc), which in my case twarted my installation as well.

However after playing with it for awhile to our surprise it cleans most anything with stubborn dirt ie: grout,tile backsplash in kithen,windows,soiled door areas. Did not think it would do much on the floors but it works wonderfully. The only thing that I would recommend is to purchase extra pads for the mop feature. Also as previous reviews have mentioned - have a towel or two handy for the extra water clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for mopping tile","review":"Leaves floor rather wet,I would not use on wood.

I have found virtually all the Euro-Pro products to contain more defective pieces than 'hassle-free' ones. If you purchsed this one, and it works, God bless you.

Billy Mahonie combine great songwriting and precise instrumentation with a big fable for noisy jazz ! It's not postrock or emo core, or whatever you like to call it. This is phantastic, essential rock music sans vocals, very entertaining, powerful and intense (with enough magic moments to make even jazz enthusiats (like me) wet their pants !). Every fan of bands like \\"Mogwai\\", \\"Tortoise\\", the late \\"Universal Congress of...\\", and especially \\"Slint\\" should pay attention and at least give it a try. For me, this record is surely one of the best new discoveries and Billy Mahonie is definitely a band to watch !"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious overdescription annoying","review":"Ya know good stories take many forms but bad ones are remarkaly consistent. Bad stories tend to have either weak characters, poor plot, or too much description. Such is the case of this overwrought hambly potboiler. Why use one adjective when 3 or 4 will do? She constantly goes off track with endless exposition,and bores us with details at best trivial. The end result is a story that steams along at a snails pace en I felt never really engages the reader. I see by the bio that hambly once taught high school. I hope never taught english because any english teacher I know worth their salt would have known better than to overwrite every page in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparison with last edition","review":"The book is defficient in core knowledge of cardio as compared to the previous edition.

Elgin totlally engrosed me with her sympathetic approach.The story is of three girls from very different but plausible backgrounds, who by chance, end up meeting on a railway station on their way to their 'ship' in Scotland during World War II. It tells of their exploits and love stories as the war progresses. Whilst this was an era I was not alive in it felt extreamly real and the factual references were so accurate they amased me. Being the daughter of a World War II telegraphist also stationed in Scotland it made real many of the things the girls were involved in. Obviously Elgin was using her first hand knowlede to great effect. These girls became my friends whilst I read andI had to go on to read another of Elgin's masterpieces ."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is heavy duty","review":"heavier than I thought it would be...Its a monster.

And of course they do - it's filled with sugar and all sorts of ingredients that are not good for ferrets. Ferrets are obligate carnivores, meaning they have a difficult time digesting fruit, veggie, and dairy matter. Additionally, the are lactose intolerant, so these yogies really are not good for ferrets at all. Please do your research before feeding these to your ferrets - there are healthier, not to mention safer, treats out there that your ferret will love just as much as these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"People need to research before buying ferret treats. These contain a ton of sugar and yogurt, two things that ferrets cannot digest. They are carnivores and eat meat!

BabyNelly absolutely loved the taste of the peanut butter Yogies -- BUT -- when I gave her 2 in a row (because the package CLAIMS ferrets can have up to 5 per day), she reacted terribly to it!! She started biting me (which she has never done) and biting her hands and feet FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS STRAIGHT!! I thought I was going to have to take her to the vet. Finally the sugar wore off and she fell asleep - phew- that was so scary!! THE INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD SAY TO GIVE FERRETS ONLY ONE PER DAY!! PLEASE BE CAREFUL!! This product has a lot of sugar in it (it's the first ingredient listed!) and ferrets do not react well to that much sugar if more than one a day is given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Item","review":"This item is not as represented.

Again the item came in unusable condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't use!","review":"Ferrets can not digest these properly! If you do your research before you buy you'd learn that ferrets are obligate carnivores which means they don't even have organs to do so. If you want to treat your little fuzzy do so in meat!

I emailed the publisher and was told this is an abridged version of the books.If you are looking for an unabridged version, this is not for you. I checked carefully, and did not find any indication on the book that this is an abridged version of the original novels (which is why I emailed the publisher to ask).To be clear, I think both books are good, and are certainly worth reading at least once.

Myron is joined by his friend Win in the investigation of a murder involving the star player of a new basketball league; Myron and Win are ex-college roommates and ex-government agents. The usual Bolitar cast of characters are also present in the novel, including Esperanza and Jessica, the most important women in Myron's life. Harlan Coben knows how to write snappy, witty dialogue, and adds good local New Jersey color. Several plot points may remind readers of an earlier Bolitar novel, DROP SHOT, but it is the interaction between the characters that makes the book, not the whodunnit aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"One False Move: A Myron Bolitar Novel","review":"I'm a huge fan of Harlan Coben, and I loved this book! Mr. Coben's Myron Bolitar character is immediately likable, and his sense of humor is evident in his writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite of the series so far","review":"I've been listening to the Myron Bolitar series on audiobook in the order they were written. All have been very entertaining but this one stands out from the previous books. For the hell of it, I clicked through the lowest rating reviews to see why people didn't like the book. It's funny that one person's negative review summed up why I liked the book. The reviewer said that Harlan Coben needs to decide whether to be funny or sad and then stick with it. Are you kidding? The emotional ups and downs is exactly what made this book for me. It's the first one where I truly cracked up and had to pause the audiobook and the first that also brought on tears. To me that is the essence of a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One False Move","review":"Great story, great characters -- when you read a Myron Bolitar novel from Harlan Coben, he never lets you down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant read","review":"This was my first exposure to Mr. Coben's Myron Bolitar. I found that I liked the character, and the story stood up well on it's own, despite being another in a series. The writer has a smooth, easy to read, style that retains your attention. The characters contained some stereotypes, but all in all, they were believable. Not having read any previous Bolitar adventures, I was anxious for him to break with the old girlfriend and explore the possibilities of the new. Brenda was a refreshing breath of air, going against the typical racial & sexual stereotypes. I was saddened with the ending. I recommend this book, and I believe I will be reading other Bolitar adventures in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"very intresting book","review":"This is at least my forth book of Harlan Coben. I must say that I enjoy this book. It took me almost a month to finish it (I read it half an hour every day) and the book keepung on the right level of tension. The plot move very nicely, not to complicated, build the events very good. The end is surprising,for me anyway.

Until now I haven't found a writer who could keep me guessing until the very end, turning pages late into the night, yet also making me laugh out loud at Myron's wonderful jokes and self-deprecating humor. Myron is such a unique character -- you can't help but love him. He wears his heart on his sleeve, he makes no apologies for loving his parents and acutally enjoying spending time with them, and he has the most eccentric and loyal two best friends ever created in fiction. This combined with the suspense and humor makes for a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harlan Coben, write faster!","review":"Having read all of the previous books in one week, I anxiously awaited this latest book by Coben. As I read it, I found that I laughed out loud less often (still WAAAAAY more than have ever done with a book before!) but appreciated the characters more. In this latest book, Coben concentrates less on MB's pal Win, and more on his friend/co-worker Esperanza. At first I was disappointed, but as the book evolved I appreciated the exploration of Esperanza and Myron's friendship. A must-read, as with all of Coben's books. I only hope for a hockey book soon! party idea: fun to discuss actor and actress casting of the characters in books."},{"rating":"2","title":"MYRON BOLITAR FIFTH BOOK","review":"This is the fifth book in the very fine Myron Bolitar series.

Can they ever go back to the real world, or are they stuck in Everworld for the rest of their lives?? And what the heck happened with Ka Anor????? Wasn't there supposed to be some type of ENDING??

Applegate pisses me off so much.I absolutely loved her Everworld series, and I finally managed to track down the last few copies after a couple years.And then, I reach the ending of the book. What the hell is that kind of ending? All we learn is that the four decide to stay in Everworld. Nothing about Ka Anor, nothing about the Greeks, nothing about Christopher and Etain, nothing about how Everworld works, not even the Great Scroll. The list goes on and on.After hooking us on a dozen books, don't you think we deserve some sort of conclusion? Not a damn cop out. So thanks Applegate, you got the last laugh again. I could just stand the ending to Animorphs, at least we knew what happened to the Yeerks. But this? God.You write some fantastic novels. Please, just try to end them.

Really disappointing.C'mon, K.A., I'm sure you're busy, but that was absolutely lame. Wrap up the series in a better way or you've wasted a lot of time writing 12 books that aren't worth reading because it's too frustrating to get involved in a storyline that has no satisfying ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not-so-entertaining end to the series.","review":"This book, the final in the EverWorld series, was very dissapointing. If it were not the last book, it would still be poorly written, but it would not have been as bad. This is due to the very open ending. Us, the loyal fans who have followed EverWorld since the beginning, deserve a better ending, one that TRULY tells what will happen to the characters now. If you're a loyal fan, you may as well go ahead and read this, but you won't find the closure you're looking for. You'd almost be better off pretending #11 was the last book.

After forming an alliance with dwarfs and fighting off Hel...April, Christopher, David, and Jailil realize Everworld has the possibility of falling back into the hands of the good forces. But K.A.

First, about the plot. Hey, the story was not bad, it's just they too easily beat Hel. I dont think Hel even tried her best. That got one star off for not being exciting enough. Second and lastly, it's place in the series. This is where matters start to go bad. I think it leaves the same number of questions unanswered in our minds, if not more. Like, what actually happened to David when he was small? How did Senna turn Jalil obsessive compulsive? Who is that stopped Jalil being obsessive compulsive in Everworld? And some new ones, such as how will Christopher and Etain turn out? Will they meet the Greek gods again? And the most important question of all: How will Everworld turn out? This got two stars off. I don't think this is much like an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOO!!!!!","review":"K.A. Applegate was so dissapointing! She is good at writing books but awful at ending them! I am watching and waiting for another everworld book, but I have just about given up hope. It is overall a good book, but not a good ending to the series. To ANY series, for that matter. I hope so badly that it hurts for K.A. Applegate to make a 13th book. I also think something should happen between April and Jalil, so that is another dissapointment. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the End?","review":"I agree with Rebecca's review; this was very disappointing. Other than the interesting situation developing between the kids' Everworld and Earth selves, there isn't much to the book. I found it much weaker than the other books. Worse than that, about halfway through the book I began to realize, \\"Applegate can't wrap up this series with only half a book to go\\". If this were the penultimate book, it wouldn't be so bad; laying the groundwork for the final confrontation. But as a \\"finale\\", it leaves much to be desired.

This book was so cliche.","review":"After having read the \\"Duke and I\\", I searched for some more Julia Quinn novels. I found \\"Splendid\\". There was nothing splendid about it. (Please pardon the cliche!) I think it is very sad when an author attempts to write a story with silly cliches simply to fill the pages. Its also a sad testimony to romance readers when an author thinks we will be happy with just any old story-line. Please we need some better story-lines and authentic characters. I am so upset with this purchase, I also have \\"Dancing at Midnight\\" left to read. I am not looking forward to it, but I don't want to waste my money, I will force myself through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely an Early Effort","review":"Julia Quinn has come a long way as an author.

What is the point of setting a book in London if the dialogue and description are pure American. I love American romantic fiction, I think Jayne Anne Krentz is without equal, so why didn't this Author set her book in America. It is irritating and distracting to have so-called English characters using American English. A little research would cure the problem, witness Amanda Quick, and make the reading far more enjoyable.

Be aware that it's only 48 pages in hardcover! It was originally published by Editions Carabas in Europe, but this particular version was released in the US by Dark Horse Comics (its first English translation). This is a collection of pin-ups and short stories all focusing on vampires. The stories are very much like what you'd find in Heavy Metal: great artwork, with plots ranging from decent to confusing. The lineup includes Bryan Talbot, Philippe Caza, Benot Springer, David Lloyd, Mike Mignola (pin-up), Tommy Lee Edwards, Richard Marazano, Gary Gianni (pin-up), Yoann and Sfar (hilarious Batman parody), and others. The book is topped off by a great cover by Matthieu Lauffray. Basically, the book looks great but is lacking in coherent storylines and content. Still, if you're a comic art afficionado, this is a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than What I Expected!","review":"I just got this cd in the mail yesterday and I LOVED IT. I've been a fan of Erasure since 1987 but I have to admit that I got disconnected from their music when they did the CDs \\"Other People's Songs\\" and \\"Nightbird\\". At that time, I thought their songs started to sound the same. This new CD is such a refreshing change from all that electronic stuff the band is known for. Just imagine classic Erasure songs redone with different arrangements in the context of country music. I know it sounds crazy but the band pulled it off. Go to YouTube and check out some video clips from their acoustic shows. Too bad MTV Unplugged is not around anymore. Erasure could have done that show and blown everybody away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erasure in a whole new light!","review":"I wasn't sure at first if I'd enjoy Erasure live, minus all of their signature synths.... but this works! And it works really well! The songs are given a whole new life with the use of traditionally country music instrumentation. This package is worth its price if only for the amazing new interpretation of Blue Savannah. Breathtaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"It pains me to listen to this","review":"I have to agree with girlpowernazi on this tour completely sucking and the Union Street CD sucking as well, minus a couple of moving tracks that don't remotely translate well live at all. I love all of erasure's music and disagree with their past couple albums being tripe, because I love their electronic music and even love some of their past acoustic renditions but with the fake country twang; it just sounds forced. I lived in the south for eight years and actually enjoy old school country, Tammy Wynette, Weyland Jennings, Conway Twitty, but this actually sounds like an offensive homage to that genre. It takes a true fan to be able to face the truth, and I have seen every tour since they toured with Duran Duran for the Circus Tour, and loved every tour, especially Swan, Tank, and Balloon live at the Beacon theatre....they sold out a good 13 shows in a row while I was going to Pratt back in the early 90's. Road to Nashville bites, it actually pains me to listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LIKE THIS, YOU ARE A DIE-HARD FAN","review":"I enjoy Erasure's music, and I've bought quite a few tripe records of theirs in recent years simply to see what they do next. But c'mon, guys, you've got to draw the line somewhere. Union Street was bad enough, but the live show was just a dreadful embarrassment. I've heard junior high school bands play in better time than this tossed-together touring band that clearly would have rather been elsewhere. And these arrangements . . . ugh.If you must, download a track or two. If you haven't heard enough acoustic versions of Spiraling to last you a life time, the version here is fun. If you buy this album, you are clearly a true-blue, dyed-in-the-wool Erasure fan.

The good ones are definitely Shoot the Moon, Charlie Brown, Drunk Tank, Empty Bottles, El Coo Cooi, Malas Palabras (\\"Bad Words\\" for all you un-spanish speakin folk), Land of Misfit Toys, and of course Fat Randy. The other 8 are mostly punk, with an occasional horn line thrown in, if you're lucky. So I guess you could say that this CD has a little sumthin for everyone. The best part is that it's full of many crazy skankin tunes. If you like ska and punk, I don't see how you could go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"VerY CooL!","review":"These guys rule. The horn section kicks and the vocals are goofy but cool.

What I mean is that this record contains crisp hardcore with strong connecting ska riffs and choruses. This is probably all thanks to producer GGGGGGGarth who has worked with the best of the best and is probably one of the most influential unsung heroes in the music business back in the day of the 90's! Anyways the album never let's down and just like the cover of the CD it sounds like a hot rod on some hopped up fuel. If your into a little different mix than this is something worth checking out. The band contains a guitarist , a bass player, a drummer, and a singer but also with a horn section as well so expect the unexpected when you listen to the VOODOO GLOW SKULLS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad, but should be a lot better as it's their 2nd","review":"This album doesn't really live up to what Who is, This is? had, but there are some pretty kick ass songs.

The rest just don't live up to the standards.

His parents have instilled in him and his sisters their love of travel, the natural environment, and open-mindedness which naturally led him to a career in art, especially painting. This book tells about Sargent and his quest to constantly broaden his outlook on life by traveling and exploring different cultures and lifestyles other than the bourgeois world, which had molded him in his formative years. He had done at least 500 paintings depicting the outdoor life or landscapes/seascapes. Examples are \\"Alligators,\\" \\"Corfu,\\" \\"Fumee d'Ambergris,\\" and the Venetian paintings of the 1880s. I would recommend this book to those with an open mind about this amazingly brilliant artist, whose pictures depicted late 19th century life around the world and whose talent has taken him to the farthest reaches of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of the 1990's","review":"The awaited album by NOFX since Punk in Drublic still keeps these boys leaders of punk rock.

The late Bob Pratt reportedly undertook extensive fieldwork in Brazil between 1978 and 1993, interviewing numerous witnesses and gathering information from other researchers. The encounters he describes often resulted in injury. Indeed, in some cases, there appeared to be a fatal outcome.Assuming that Pratt's reporting was accurate, his research clearly demonstrates that many UFO experiences have a physical component, that close encounters can be dangerous, and that some form of intelligence is often involved.Pratt provides helpful information on how to pronounce many of the personal and place names he mentions. But his book contains no maps, which is unfortunate, since readers may be unfamiliar with many of the places he refers to. Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend this book to readers with a serious interest in UFO phenomena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the source","review":"Bob Pratt has an axe to grind. His sponsor MUFON is no longer an independant organization and like others is controled by the Shadow Government. Interestingly enough, this expensive inquiry by an American Journalist takes place far enough from home for anyone to verify any of the alledged facts. Secret Intelligence is very fond of these weird stories they publish to (officialy) test public's gullibility when in fact they seek to accredit the idea that aliens are dangerous. This is their last ploy following the failed disinformation gambit that aliens do not exist. Until such authors expose themselves to the full scrutiny of the public, it is safe to assume that they are subsidized by self serving interests who need an ennemy to go on preparing for war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job well","review":"I have only used this once so far, but I'm impressed with the construction and large size of the straps and handle.

I found the author's vocabulary awesome but exhausting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but tedious","review":"This is my 3rd PD James book and I have to say I was quite disappointed. (The other 2 were Murder Room and A Certain Justice.)I found most of the characters to be not terribly believable and one dimensional. Even Dalgliesh was not well drawn.And to make it worse, the plot was not believable.I agree with someone else who said borrow this from the library, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agatha is better!","review":"After having read 30 pages of \\"Original Sin\\" I felt a strong desire to stop. I had read \\"Death in Holy Orders\\" before (from beginning to end). However, the derogatory remarks made by the author about my favourite queen of crime, Agatha Christie, caused me to be sceptical. There is a Latin saying: \\"De mortuis nihil nisi bene\\". Mrs James ought to go by that saying.While \\"Holy orders\\" are more or less OK (during the lecture, negative experiences tend to be just barely compensated by positive ones), \\"Original Sin\\" is definitely below the limit.So, conclusion: Agatha is (much) better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedium at its best","review":"The best moments of this novel come in its opening lines. Unfortunately, it appears to stop dead after the first paragraph. James is much too concerned with flaunting her verbosity, and gives little regard to the time and effort the reader must expend in order to get through her book. Lengthy description abutts tediously expository dialogue, taunting the reader to skim through pages at a time, desperately searching for some thread of plot that hasn't been hopelessly knotted about some gargantuan block of sludgy narrative. James must learn the value of economy - there are plenty of other writers in the world, and we simply don't have time for all the words in Original Sin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I usually enjoy P.D. James books and this one has a promising start with the description of Innocent House and the Thames. However, I wish I hadn't persevered to the end. There was zero reward. Narrative only lost momentum. Only interesting note was the aged mystery-writer character, finally let go by her publisher, only to be murdered. Even then, the chance that Dame James was saying something about running out of ideas was painful in a large book which took much more time than warranted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Past Will Haunt You","review":"A publishing house finds itself in the grips of fear after its director is murdered. The murder follows a series of odd pranks and suicides. It is clear that something is not right at the Peverell Press. Inspector Dalgliesh is called in along with two junior detectives. It seems clear that the murderer had to be one of the staff, but how and why remain a mystery.As James always does, she manages to develop numerous complicated characters and a multi-faceted plot. On the side of law and order the two junior inspectors are more important than Dalgliesh to the plot and the investigation. As with the suspects, their own lives and histories will play pivotal roles in the investigation and its resolution. James does not disappoint in this mystery, and the book follows patterns seen in her other Dalgliesh novels. In the end the police discover that an alibi is not quite as unassailable as it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monumental but off target (maybe)","review":"Warning: Handling this book can cause bodily injury. Consult a doctor if you have previously had joint or muscle problems. Part of the size and weight of this book is due to the English/German/French translation, which triples the text area. This is a custom typical of Continental European art&design publications, whose readership usually knows no other language than their native one (note--I'm from Italy and I speak from experience). Personally, I would have preferred a book 30% smaller and lighter, with more actual information inside. Oh, and about the content: the \\"Who's Who\\" section, which represents the bulk of the book, does not mention D. B. Updike or Francis Meynell! Here we have a problem of defining the field.

The examples chosen are excellent and well placed. Many books only have black and white examples with just a few in color. It is hard to visually understand a design without its full dressing. This book shows works in their original glory.c) the price is very modest for what you get in return.You will wear out this book-buy two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown away, this is adventure!","review":"I saw one of the First Ascent climbing series on Versus and knew I had to have the entire 6 part series.

In three years, this Aaron Krueger aka Arson Optics has managed to make a name for himself in the hip hop underground. I thought his debut CD was fresh, but his sophomore release was just off the hook. This \\"Boy Wonder\\" struck back harder then ever, with doper beats and fresher lyrics. He's made a big step up from Life, Rhythm. I'm surprised a professional Record Label hasn't picked up on him yet. That chance only waits to come.

This quartet's sound has as much to do with the crazed, anything-goes novelty of Nuggets-era garage rock from the Sixties as it does with the loud-fast skateboard anthems of the last decade. Half of 1988, this album, salutes mid-Eighties hardcore, and it's a record that any TSOL fan has already heard a million times: pogo-pony polka beats; bass lines that fly on a carpet of eighth notes; zooming, solo-free guitar riffs; and lots of \\"whoah-ohhh!\\" sing-along parts. Frontman Dexter Holland rants on about \\"fragile lives, shattered dreams\\" on \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\" and, on another track, offers this SoCal extreme-sports manifesto: \\"Faster now, you know I got no brakes.\\" There's no sense of risk, though -- even the hyperventilating remake of Morris Albert's ... \\"Feelings\\" is predictably snide."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Offspring Could of Done Better","review":"THIS CD SUCKES.

The next best ssong is Tehran wich is entertaining but somewhat lacking. Then there's elders wich grows old fast. The rest of the record is deviod of merit. Had Jennifer Lost the War been released as a single, it may have achieved the recognition it deserves but as it is, the song is weighed down by the rest of the record.

Oi vay."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Offspring's first ranks up with the best..","review":"The Offspring's first CD, released back in 1989, is a really great CD, and it is somewhat out of character if you want to compare it to their modern work. The lyrics for this CD where written back when the United States was in very, very bad terms with Iraq and it's dictator, Sadamm Hussien, which explains the political edge this album has. I am a fan of The Offspring's later work like Conspiracy of One and Americana, but this disk is definately at a level above that. My favorite song by far is Elders. I also really like Crossroads, It'll be a Long Time, Beheaded, BlackBall, and KTP a whole lot.

It comes with everything so there's no need to buy stands or stools, easy easy to put together and sounds great. She tells me the keys feel great too, plus she loves being able to put it in harpsichord mode while playing some of her Baroque period pieces.

If I didn't know better, I would have thought the actress had gone to the Great Theatre in the Sky the minute the director yelled, \\"Cut! That's a wrap.\\" The only reason I didn't give this movie 4 stars is because it feels dated. Compared to the movies of today, it is paced a little slowly. Even so, I sympathized with both characters. I felt their every frustration and their every fear. I even shed a few tears. If you are a fan of either of these actresses, or if you know someone going through the trials and tribulations of growing old and frail, it is worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great !","review":"I found this book a great read !!

The min and max memory is useful, but they are a little tedious to reset. On the plus side, the auto-off feature is nice since it save batteries.Sept 9, 2011 Update: I've long since thrown away this thermometer. If anyone is looking for a much better instant read thermometer, look at the ThermoWorks Splash-Proof Super-Fast Thermapen - Instant Read Thermometer. It is available on Amazon for $93.

Plastic shelf is @ 1 inch or less from the light. Heat doesn't SEEM to affect / melt the plastic shelf but we only had it on for @ 1 hour or so. We'll see.Main issue is the size. Wish it were wider (and for some books, had more height clearance) as we have many gourmet/coffee table style cook books (french laundry. bouchon, alinea etc - all excellent btw) that will NOT fit on/in the cookbook holder.

It's a little hard to say what exactly Hollywood has to do to make a quality movie, but whatever it is, this one didn't have it. It being unrealistic was just one part of the badness. In one scene, for example, the guys land on the beach--and they're supposed to be the best of the best--and you can see somebody else running up along the beach on the side, but none of them see him...until I guess they got to the cue spot in the sand...\\"Hey!

Some ridiculous errors, like one officer with captain's bars on his lapel but a lieutenant's bar on his hat.

In the first scene, we see a small group of U.S. soldiers, and a \\"Sicilian\\" guide on the beach, led by a captain in the 101st Airborne, who did not see action until Normandy in June, 1944, yet this is supposedly Sicily in July, 1943!Also, the captain was overweight, and appeared to be about 55-60 years old! Some paratrooper!When this old soldier was captured by the Germans, the inevitable heinous, black -uniformed SS officer shows up, to interrogate/torture him.

But to those of us who remember the way they made war movies back in the 50s, Battle Force is a great throwback. Story? Well, during a war the story is kill or get killed. Plot?

Each episode of the first disc you could predict the ending...oh...from about the first 5 minutes in: Reluctant 'loner' has to rescue this person this ep, has to rescue another person(s) the next ep; all the while searching for his true 'enemy'. Some baddie would show up with a mech and the 'reluctant loner' (even though he doesn't want to) would eventually have to fight him (again, even thought it's really not his concern and he really doesn't want to fight). Ho-hum, been there, done that. Listening to the English dub, it also felt like the actors were just going through the motions on this one. Even the usually spectacular Michelle Ruff seemed a little off from her normal performance.

I hate when an opening act takes twice as long as the headliner to set up, then gets onstage and bombs! I admit that their recorded music is mildly interesting... the live show however, one of the worst i've ever seen. A few words of advice to this trainwreck of a band... DON'T SING! The vocals were laughable and ear shatteringly off pitch. Much to my dismay, the dozen or so fans/friends of the Icy Demons didn't seem to notice. I'd compare the vocal performances to an episode of Pop Idols, the one where they highlight the really bad singers. True to form it took these hacks an inordinate amount of time to shamble off the stage and pack up their gear.

You only need to know how to see like an artist and it is extremely simple. I have spent a week reading the book and the improvement is profound. A basic outline of a hand has become a detailed realistic image of my hand. Do I have the new found talent that artists all seem to have? Nope, all I have is this cool book by Betty Edwards that has taught me how to draw like my dad had taught me how to ride my bike. Drawing is a skill that all can learn.

Experienced artists probably don't need it, but anyone who yearns to draw and thinks they can't will be amazed.I was 40 years old when my husband bought me this book and some drawing materials as a birthday gift. All those years, I'd been convinced I couldn't draw a thing. Using the instructions in this book and a beginner's class, I was thrilled to find myself producing some excellent drawings, including very realistic 3-dimensional portraits. Thank you, Betty Edwards, for one of the few books that really did change my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This 4th edition is a disappointment.","review":"The '89 edition is far superior to the 4th. In the 4th, the paper is thin enough to see through. Many of the drawing instructions are reproduced far too light and hard to see, much less to study. The chapter on color is GONE. Most of the interesting and informative margin notes are gone (though the space is still there), and the few that are there are in print so tiny it's not easy to read. In chapter 6, the student is advised to lift lights to create shadows, but this is not really taught until chapter 10 on lights and shadows. Why is this thrust on the student in chapter 6 when they haven't been taught it yet and may end up doing it in an incorrect way? And last, the index is incomplete, and I had to go through many pages in order to find things, since all the pages for a subject were not listed.

Here's what we've learned: All ingredients must be at room temperature. The water and milk should be a bit warmer. Follow the directions carefully. It'll actually smell like you're baking bread in the last hour of the process. On second taste, the bread is pretty good. Most bread depends on what you put on it, and this bread is no different.

My wife and I both took one bite and had to spit it out. Initially, it was tasteless, but after a few seconds there was a horrible, disgusting aftertaste. We quickly toasted some regular bread to rid our mouths of the taste. Even with our regular toast slightly burned, it couldn't clear that disgusting aftertaste.

It was dry, almost tasteless, and had a texture which almost seemed like they had added sawdust. Now I am stuck with three more packages which I will never use.

Perhaps the book would have been more palatable to me if the character of Sinjin had any redeeming qualities, but I couldn't for the life of me believe that anyone as self absorbed and hedonistic as he could possibly love anyone else. Ms. Johnson wrote a sequel to this book, Wicked, about Sinjin's son Beau. He is even more sickening than his father.

Sinjun was a sleazy himbo and the whole harem thing did not work for me. The plot of the book has many faults. For example, Sinjun is captured by her family and escapes, but they never come after him or the daughter. Why? It makes no sense. Another character makes threats on Chealsea, but there is no intense conflict which would have been developed. The book has footnotes in it, which I find annoying. This is not a college project to write a book. Any historical comments need to be in the story and not footnotes. If I want english history, I'll buy english history - not a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinfully bad","review":"I bought this book expecting a great read. The cover at least made it sound good. The first part was promising too! Then it got wierd. Once Sinjun and Chelsea had a falling out, he turned so cold that I stopped liking him at all. I agree with the 1st reviewer too, the bad part went on far too long.Then suddenly there is all of this kidnapping/harem/blind stud/exhibitionsitic/misogynistict stuff that completely disrupts the flow of the book. She begins introducing new characters quickly in the last 50 pages and it becomes some wierd history piece about fueding impotent Arabs etc. As a \\"Regency\\" reader, I totally lost interest at this part as it turned into an action/adventure bodice ripper.The author seems to lose her track somewhere along the way and lost me as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've lost that loving feeling.","review":"This book would be better categorized as erotica rather than romance. The erotic passages are graphic, if unimaginative. The main characters are irritatingly selfish and unsympathetic. Instead of the warm-hearted chase that defines most romance novels, the plot of this story follows two unpleasant characters through the random events that bring them together. You hope for them to end up together, not because it's true love and a happy ending, but because it will keep them from inflecting themselves on others."},{"rating":"1","title":"sinful was awful","review":"i thought this book was boring. i waited all week to get it and was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unintended Consequences","review":"As a person of faith, I had some difficulty reading Acts of Faith. The caracatures were frustrating. Still, the questions were compelling. Caputo's primary concern seems to be that acts performed by people of conviction lead to unintended negative consequences. But what would the author have us do? Should good people do nothing? Caputo doesn't have much of an answer, but I appreciated his giving me the opportunity to wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing...Bad storytelling","review":"After hearing a number of positive critical reviews of this book I brought it to read on vacation. I wasn't expecting great literature, but I'd hoped at least for a compelling beach read. I was greatly disappointed. In my opinion this book offered neither interesting storytelling nor anything close to accomplished writing. The author was constantly \\"telling\\" rather than showing, and his characters were developed in the most pathetic, feeble way. Caputo's attempts at metaphor and lyricism were painfully lame. The dialogue is forced and completely inauthentic, even worse he adds colloquialisms that seem utterly mismatched to the characters.As a woman, I found much of the content sexist...there is nothing quite so annoying as having an inept male author try to portray a woman's voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful dialogue","review":"I made it through half of the novel before the painfully trite and ludicrous dialogue forced me to surrender. The story was the only thing that keep me in the novel, but then that could even no longer sustain me. The characters, espcially the women, are as cliched as the dialogue.Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"for summer reading","review":"Why can't I find a copy of \\"Acts of Faith\\" in Barnes and Noble or Borders? Is the publisher chicken?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting fiction about Sudan","review":"I was a little reluctant to read this book because of its depressing focus on international aid in Sudan. While it certainly wasn't always uplifting, Caputo creates characters so well rounded and portrays Sudan so vividly that I started reading and found I couldn't stop. Some of the characters were frustrating and at some points I easily guessed the plot twists, but it was such an intriguing novel that I really enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Act of Faith to Finish This Book","review":"When I read the glowing reviews of \\"Acts of Faith\\" by Phillip Caputo, I was encouraged. As someone who has lived and worked in Ethiopia and knows something about Sudan, I thought this was our answer to Joseph Conrad. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Mr. Caputo knows what he is talking about. He understands the region and feels the tragedy with compassion. But he is not a novelist. Like Peter Matthiessen, his writing is better suited to other genres. For Matthiessen, it is nature writing. For Caputo, it is journalism. I found this book hard going, with much of the dialogue too painful to even read, it was so amateurish. The characters are strictly cardbord. A really good editor might have saved \\"Acts of Faith,\\" but Caputo had no such luck. Instead, he gives us bad Hemingway and Conrad. If you want to read a great novel about the tragedy of post-colonial Africa, go back to \\"A Bend in the River.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ken's review","review":"Way too much information on Rome. I was looking for more information on the life in Palistine during the time of Christ. This book does go into some aspects of the life in Palistine, but it is heavely weighted with Roman life. Not bad as books during this period go, but not what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the original hits, but well done nonetheless...","review":"These are rerecordings of Janie's greatest hits. Ordinarily, I would roundly pan such a collection, but I have to say, Janie is in fine voice on the album and the musical interpretations are pretty close to the originals. I'm not sure when she recorded these new tracks, but she sounds every bit a strong and fresh as when she sang them originally. For diehard fans and completists, this is a nice collection. But if you're a casual fan looking for a nice overview of Janie's work, seek out the out-of-print Anthology on Renaissance Records, the out-of-print Celebration CD from 1987, or the still-in-print 17 Greatest Hits.

I have a feeling that the author was trying to do just that in this book. The problem is that he does not have the communication skills to do this successfully. What should be a simple explanation is made so convoluted that you have to read it several times to realize that it is a really bad explanation of something very simple. Most of my reading time was spent trying to guess what the author had in mind when he strung these incoherent sentences together. The book never \\"takes off.\\" It just keeps circling in the runway. You'll never see any of the alleged beauty of linear algebra in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed. Through the middle of chapter 3, the text was excellent, than the end of chapter 3 was totally cryptic. Chapter 4 was ok, so was most of chapter 5, but chapter 6 and on was just horrible. I couldn't understand a thing. SVD is not explained in any detail, neither is Jordan form. This book is a waste of money, since only about half of it is good and the rest is useless. I'd recommend Howard Anton's book, it costs less, and there's much more material in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"also see \\"Math Easy as Apples & Bananas\\" by Yasmin Khan","review":"Great book but considering the controversy and pain some people genuinly feel, I recommend the books by Yasmin Khan, \\"Math Easy as Apples and Bananas\\" as a first read, I have not seen anything easier in Applied Linear Algebra, with topic from Fast Fourier Transforms, Sin(x)/x, wavelets. Lets you learn in a few hours not days."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"When I started reading it, the book seemed excellent, but beyond chapter 4, I became extermely bored, and very disappointed towards the end when having paid a rediculous amount for it, I learned absolutely nothing and instead read Strang's incoherent babbling about just how wonderful linear algebra is. I was new to the topic, so I imagine the book must be a complete waste of time for someone who's got a bit of experience. Luckily, I found better linear algebra books. In fact, one of the reviewers has suggested the book by Friedberg, and I would agree that title is 100times better, but it could be a bit abstract.The point is, Strang's book is an expensive flop, with much hype and little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had it cost half as much, I'd give it all 5 stars","review":"This book has some great parts in it, but half of it is extremely difficult to comprehend, and whatever you do get out of it is not worth that much money. The author should update and expand this book already, and give a clearer presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not terribly interesting","review":"Granted, a couple things here are explained really well, but after reading up to beginning of ch.6 (i didn't understand anything afterwards) I don't feel like I've learned anything. Strang seems to spend more time on praising linear algebra than actually teaching it. Definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"strang -- master of gumflapping","review":"More talk than math, coupled with extremely simplified presentation makes for an easy-reading book, which leaves you with a feeling of having learnt nothing.I actually tried \\"Linear Algebra\\" by Friedberg et.al. recommended by an earlier reviewer and it's excellent (and cheaper). Read that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"This book is bad in every way. It neither promotes better understanding of linear algebra, nor does it present a good depth of material. This text isn't worth the money because you learn almost nothing, but you do get to read Strang's mumbo jumbo about how beatiful linear algebra is. I agree with him here, but how about he just sat down and taught me?I had to read other books to learn the material. My two favorites are \\"Elementary Linear algebra\\" by Anton, and \\"Modern algebra\\" by Warner. The second one is a general algebra book, but goes into considerable depth on vector spaces, linear transformations and inner product spaces--the three fundamental concepts which Strang omits for fear that they'll clutter the students' \\"weak minds\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is for a serious student","review":"I am pained at the disappointing reviews submitted. Prof. Strang's work deserves better respect!I have used this book from 2nd edition onwards for students' perusing a course in Power System Analysis and Digital Protection. I recommend Matlab be used along with the course to understand the different processes in linear algebra, its relation with algorithm development in analysing various stability issues and methods that can provide dimensional reduction of the original problem. It takes time to absorb the work. But once completed, it is a poetry that one can never forget!"},{"rating":"1","title":"treats the subject frivolously","review":"I found several serious flaws with the text. It's too easy. There's too much filler. I learned almost nothing from it. To be sure, Strang has some interesting sections here, but he spends roughly half the book on talk, and the other half on linear algebra. Also, the text just seems like it's devoid of any serious material. It's too easy, and I was a complete beginner in linear algebra. Finally, it's completely useless as a reference because a lot of new ideas are presented in the exercises, where they are difficult to find when you are searching for some particular topic.I would recommend \\"Linear Algebra\\" by Friedberg, et.al.(isbn 0132338599) It costs the same, but I became quite an expert after reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"I agree with the others who gave this book low marks.This is NOT a book for \\"introductory\\" algebra courses or for building a strong basic foundation for understanding the properties of matrices. Strang rattles off with obfuscating explanations as if you have already had a previous exposure to linear algebra and matrix theory.For example, just compare Strang's explanation of the least squares method versus the explanation in Harvey Gerber's \\"Elementary Linear Algebra\\", and you will see what I mean. Strang's explanation is hardly adequate, while Gerber's is superior, providing an easy-to-understand motivation for the subject, a well defined proof, and copious examples. (Gerber's isn't the only book out there; there are many, many other books that are far, far better than Strang's. )For best results, if you are required to buy this book for a college course, buy this book \\"used\\" (to save money) or borrow it from sombody else (share with a friend?), and buy another book from which to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"The book isn't all that bad. You can probably have areasonable understanding of linear algebra after readingit, but there is very little coherent material here. Mostof the book are random ramblings and discussions whicharen't really proofs but are passed off as them. In short,the text is very shallow and not rigorous at all. Suffice itto say that there are better books out there--both in termsof the number/variety of topics and in depth/rigor.Stay away from this text...it's a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he writing to his grand kids?","review":"The books tone is so casual it's laughable at times.

It is a totally problematic book, in that, it assumes you know, and this is a book for starters? Actually 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strang is lazy","review":"In the preface, Strang complains that linear algebra has been taught too abstractly. After reading this book, I realize he was just finding excuses to slack off and avoid rigor. This book is written for you average kindergartner. I was shocked by lack of rigor and complete disregard for accepted mathematical methods. Strang treats linear algebra like a literature class, and lazily strolls through it avoiding all difficult proofs, theorems, and concepts. He can probably explain some of the material half-decently so you can understand the basic idea, but this text doesn't deserve to be called a math book--it's disgusting.Buy one of the other textbooks suggested by others, or just about any other linear algebra book. All others I've seen make attempts to be as rigorous as possible. Strang only makes excuses about his lack of teaching talent and complete laziness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible treatment.","review":"Strang tells us in the preface that linear algebra is a beautiful subject, and he is correct. Yet he seems intent on strangling its theoretical beauty with a matrix based approach to vector spaces, and an ugly preoccupation with R^n. It's clear that this book was not written to be either a lucid explanation of how to use linear algebra, nor was it intended to be an aesthetically pleasing exposition of theoretical linear algebra. It was written somewhere in between, and it is an unhappy medium. If you are interested in a theoretical treatment of linear algebra, there are sorrowfully few good texts available. The title of Axler's \\"Linear Algebra Done Right\\" is a result of this fact, and if you are seeking a mathematically pure treatment of the subject, that book is a much better choice. If you're not interested in the theory, but only the applications, you should still be able to find a much better text than Strang's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I'm not really sure why people dislike this book. In general, Strang writes some of the best mathematics texts out there, and this book is no exception. In fact, my only objection to this book is that it is too introductory, as is _Intro to Applied Mathematics_, but they aren't after all intended for graduate courses.The one thing I really enjoy about his texts is that his writing, even on basic material, sometimes contains very deep insights into the underlying structure of the mathematics. Understanding a Strang textbook is the difference between actually _understanding_ mathematics and just being able to do it.So I heartily endorse this book. If you want a higher-level text, I'd suggest Demmel's Applied Numerical Linear Algebra. But reading this book still wouldn't hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"School's out, might as well slag off my textbooks!","review":"Ok. So I bought this book for my class, and it was garbage.

The scene in the kitchen with the guy eating the blueberries isthe scene I laughed the hardest. Some scenes are just plaingruesome. Like That one close up of the guy getting stabbed in the head with a garden hoe and then all the blood and guts spewing out of him. Hard to watch. So, people start getting killed one by one, and the friends try to survive as the town slowly starts turning into zombies. This is where it starts getting stupid. And I mean bad horror. The scenes that cut to the gas station guy singing with guitar get weirder. Expecially the, \\" we're coming to get you,\\" song. The reason behind seeing this is because its so bad. Some of it hillarious.

Nothing in this movie is to be taken seriously. We have a huge amount of people dying gruesome deaths all over the place, with country music playing in the background.

I like a good goofball horror flick as much as the next guy, but this one is just a wannabe. It had potential with the comic book scene transfers and musical undertones - both elements which i liked and thought were quite creative - however, i just couldnt get past the horribly annoying and retarded characters, like the deputy - uggg! That first gore scene where dude's eating the pie in the kitchen did manage to squeeze a giggle or 2 out of me, though. So there are a few laughs and some decent effects, but for the most part the attempted slapstick is just too corny for my tastes. And not that it always matters in the horror genre, but the dialogue and script were just awful and contrived too. I give it a couple stars for the gore but I might suggest you rent this one before purchasing. Who knows, it might grow on me like Cabin Fever did.

The book was disappointingly heavier on menus, recipes and citations than on substance. I did not find this book particularly informative, interesting or compelling. There was about 25 pages of genuine information and explanation. I have found much more compelling explanations about the impact of dietary changes on human health from books on the Paleo Diet. What Galland wrote made sense and he makes a good case for his contentions, but it struck me as largely rehashed and repackaged with nothing terribly novel.

We don't need to know all the details of how the diet works, we just follow it. The recipes are REALLY easy to follow.

Unfortunately it was more of an anti-inflammatory diet. Very little in the way of discussing how to reverse Leptin resistance.

I found it to very infomative and he makes good observations about our American diet and mainstream fades.

Granted the pharm industry has abandoned the hormone for a cure-all for obesity, I still think there is something to the bodies ability to regulate itself depending on what you eat.

Dr. Galland talks of three phases of the diet, but never explains what types of food you may eat on each plan. Nor does he explain each phase of the diet which I find strange. While the recipes look good, a lot of work would go into preparing them on a daily basis. I was surpised and disappointed that Dr. Galland does not explain his three phases of the diet. If you are looking for general infomation and guidlines book may be good. Also okay if you are willing to cook a specific recipe for each day of the diet.

Samantha's family is very similar to Kerry's - especially the domineering father and the passive, pathetic mother. Sam has a sister who sticks by her just like Kerry. The only problem is that Dar and Kerry were around before Alex and Sam. I could go on and on about the similarities and it leaves me wondering if some copying went on. I would not recommend this book - in fact, I left it at the last hotel I stayed in! \\"Tropical Storm\\" is a much better read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You Won't Forget!","review":"Powerful intertwining story of two women from different background, who stumble upon each other at Laguna Beach and soon discover a rich and captivating ancient love exists between them. Carol's excellent writing style has skillfully drawn well developed characters in a romantic tale that is not only touching, but guarantees pure sensuality in every chapter. When it comes to tugging on your heart strings, you'll find this is just the book to do that. It's a story rich in plot and excitement, with characters that will grab your curiosity and keep you with them until the last page. The story line is crisp, filled with varying levels and types of tension, including beautiful love scenes, some jealousy and never eases up on the throttle until the novel is finished. I've now purchased a second copy of this wonderful book as I wore the first one out from reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool entry from the king of space age pop","review":"Never seen Esquivel's Vegas show? This is as close as you can come without video. This is a \\"live\\" rendition of part of his usual show. The fact that the group pulls it all off with no overdubs and supposedly (ala direct disk recordings) in a single take is a true testament to that known fact that Esquivel demanded perfection from his troops. This is a cool slice of entertainment, terrific musicians at the top of their games and unlike any show you are likely to see/hear anytime soon. A must have for the Esquivel fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"While Quinn is one of my favorite historical romance authors, this one had clunky dialogue, plot holes, empty characters, and other missteps. I'm heartened to know that as her second book, this disappointment is in the past and not in our future. I will have to say that the humor in this book was reminiscent of Katie MacAlister's work which is a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Out of all the other JQ books I did not enjoy this book at all. It was painfully boring. Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge Julia Quinn by this book","review":"A regency romance about a girl who comes to stay with her cousins in the country and meets an intriguing, war-damaged man. They face obstacles such as his guilt and an old enemy back for revenge.My first Julia Quinn book was The Duke and I, which is part of the Bridgerton series. It is a wonderful, well-written book and I was expecting this one to be the same. Sadly, it fell decidedly short of my expectations. Grammatically it was fine, but plotwise it was a bit thin and forced. Some of the things the characters do and say are absurd and just silly. Fortunately, this was written years before the Bridgerton series and Julia Quinn's writing has dramatically improved. If you want to read a Quinn book, start with The Duke and I.Still, if you don't expect too much, this is a fairly entertaining book and if you're desperate for something to read, try this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!!","review":"I really loved this book! The sequel to Splendid it really caught my attention and I read it so fast; I was sad when it was over. I really liked and cared for the characters in this book. I LOVED the hero John. He was dark,dangerous, and had a wicked sense of humor. I liked Bella too. I loved her determination to make him her man. I really believed that they loved and liked one another. They don't fight constantly between themselves and have too much conflict between them. They really cared for one another! It was great! Bella took what she wanted, and that is rare in romance novels. It was really great to read about Alex and Emma too! Please read Splendid first before you read this. Although I liked Splendid, I loved Dancing at Midnight! But Splendid introduces you to Bella (She is Emma's English cousin) and gets you prepared for the best book between the two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DUD","review":"This book is an absolute horror! The dialogue is filled with completely anachronistic language and it really bothered me while reading it. I actually stopped reading this book and threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was not one of Julia Quinn��s better stories. I was bored with the story and found myself turning pages just to get done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Win for Julia Quinn, Second Book in the Blydon/Splendid Trilogy","review":"I love Julia Quinn anyways, but I also love a romance novel in which one (or both) of the main characters has a major emotional battle to overcome. The usual obstacles are good for a read too, but the ones with emotional road blocks offer a much greater depth to the characters. All of my favorite romance novels seem to have that as a theme; this is one of those. As always with one of Quinn's novels, I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love.This is the second book in the Blydon series. Although the stories are independent of one another, the order of the books is the order in which events happen for these families and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but...","review":"I love JQ's books. After reading all of the Bridgerton series and the novels that came after that, I figured I'd give her first trilogy a try.The stories is not bad, but you can tell that they were the first few books published by her. Her style was still coming together and ideas where getting polished.One thing I found troubling me throughout this story is that Belle was kidnapped in the previous book, right? And for some reason, this was not mentioned in this book. Even though she went through another kidnapping (failed, but still). It kept coming up and nagging me over and over throughout the story, and I'm afraid I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've. However, I love Persephone. What a lovely lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Julia Quinn's novels. Typically they have strong female characters, dashing rakes/scoundrels that turn good, humorous banter from all characters, and within the plot the leads experience some kind of personal growth. This book started promising since the main female character Arabella was an interesting sub-character in \\"Splendid.\\" However in this book \\"Dancing at Midnight\\" it must have stroked midnight and she just fizzled! Trust me: read \\"Splendid\\" skip this book and go straight ahead to read \\"Minx\\" which follows the other sub-character from \\"Splendid\\" William Dunford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok is all...","review":"This HAS to be one of Quinn's first works because holy moly it shows! I went out and bought a handful of her books after I read \\"When He Was Wicked\\"; now that was soooo good, but I have been severely unimpressed with the couple novels I've read (or tried real hard to read). Here's hoping I didn't waste my money by purchasing more than one of her books wanting at least a descent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Follow Up to \\"Splendid\\"","review":"I would HIGHLY recommend reading \\"Splendid\\" prior to this novel because you will understand the characters a lot better. However, on its own \\"DANCING AT MIDNIGHT\\" is a good novel.Lady Arabella \\"Bella\\" Blydon is searching for a love match. Fed up with London, she visits her cousin, Emma, at her country estate while her parents are touring Italy. During a quite moment, while she is reading, Lord John Blackwood comes upon her. The first meeting is not the best John could do. However, Bella is determined to make a better meeting with Lord John, and thus the romance begins.This book is well done. It is not Julia's best, but it is not bad either. However, like I said before, reading \\"Splendid\\" first will let you understand the characters in this book better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read!","review":"Not my favorite JQ book, but definitely a fun, witty book that held my attention. I liked that the Characters from Spledid were back (and Minx!) The plot was fun, but got a bit hokey at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, disappointing","review":"I read this after Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, which was a mistake, and only highlighted how much better Julia Quinn has become since this early work. I agree with the reviewer who found Lord John boring, and a bit of a whiner. The 'horrors of war' that he experienced didn't seem to warrant the angst he was feeling. And I wasn't much impressed with Arabella's bluestocking-ness. I found myself skimming the book, just to get a sense of the story; this is one for the 'donate to library' pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a huge Quinn fan but.....","review":"This one is really, really bad. Maybe my expectations were too lofty since I loved the Bridgerton series but I did not enjoy much about this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring like its hero!","review":"I read this because it's sequel to Splendid which I enjoyed. What happened to Arabella here I think was she's just simply bored because Emma was busy with Alex(they're having a baby) and the season is over that she pursued her cousin's neighbor who is the most boring and less attractive(also stupid by suggesting to his nemesis they meet on his in-laws townhouse) hero on Julia Quinn books. And I don't see why Arabella is attracted to this John Blackwood (so weak and helpless, he could not even defend her and her mom at the crisis in which he brought, thanks to Persephone,Alex and William who saved the day). They have NO chemistry and the courtship is under develop to get to point that they can't live without the other and it made it so corny. I think it would be more interesting if Ms. Quinn just paired Arabella to Anthony Bridgerton therefore uniting these two series. If you would read Splendid, skip this one(because it's waste of time) and proceed to Minx (more delightful)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Having read and loved all the Bridgerton novels, I decided to go back and read some of Julia Quinn's earlier efforts. This book was a total waste of time. I just kept skipping through it hoping it would get better but it never did. Belle and John were just totally annoying and I found Belle's insistence on \\"helping\\" John with dangerous situations just plain asinine. Also unbelievable was the fact that she was melting down to skin and bones after just 3 days of being ill. Thank goodness, Ms. Quinn's writing improved with age. This book is going in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I can't believe this book was actually published. I don't mean to be unkind, but it may well be the worst book I have ever read. I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better, Julia Quinn","review":"I was really disapointed after reading this book.I really enjoyed Quinns other books and thought this one was just as good.But it was not.Belle is much more fun in SPLENDID and the \\"hero\\" John Blackwood is dull and oh so boring.There is a lot of talk about Shakespear and poets and poetry. Belle even nags the poor boring John about writing her a poetry.The best thing about this book is that it includes the people from SPLENDID. It's always nice \\"meeting\\" them again.I'm so sorry, Julia Quinn, but this time you just lost your magic touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it...","review":"The storyline was very weakly written.

I began reading the Bridgerton series first and have since then decided to read all of Julia Quinn's books. However, this is the first one to really disappoint. I just couldn't see any chemistry or like any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I'm a huge fan of Julia Quinn but this book was a huge disappointment. For one, I was so tired of reading about how the \\"hero\\" was tortured over something that, in my opinion, he had nothing to really do with. I wanted to pull out my hair and scream, \\"Get Over It Already!!!\\" I had struggle to read the last few pages...in fact, I'm not sure I did read the last few pages. The story started out okay but quickly went downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near her best","review":"I read the later Julia Quinn books first and was rather disappointed by this one. I agree with the other reviewer who said \\"get over it\\". The premise behind the hero's issues/guilt are a bit far fetched. If you haven't read any of Quinn's books, don't start with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written fantasy novel!","review":"One of the strongpoints of this series has been the unpredictability of the books - in this novel, the shift of focus changes quite suddenly from Alias to the young nobleman. I won't comment on particular plot points so as not to ruin it, but the surprises are what kept me turning the pages. Novak's writing skill is sufficient to draw me in to the Forgotten Realms, making the characters real and the locations almost palpable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Mediocre cash-in on the success of Azure Bonds (which wasn't originally intended as a trilogy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT sending a good message to our kids","review":"I thought the story of polar bear cubs finding their way would be cute, but I was appalled at this story. When the mother bear says to her cubs about their father, \\"He would probably give you a hit in the head and tell you to get lost\\" - I about fell out of my chair. Then she says, \\"One day, I will give you a hit in the head myself, and send you off to take care of yourselves.\\" What a terrible message to give to our children! Do you want your kids to think this is what is in store for them?!? And later: \\"The day finally came when Larry and Roy's mother called them to her, and hit each of them in the head. 'Get lost,' she said. 'Go and fend for yourselves.'\\" That is terrible! I don't want my kids thinking that is an acceptable way to treat others.

It is a repetitive slog through well-known territory. The problems with the Slingshot Argument against the existence of facts have been known for decades, and despite many pages advocating the importance and impact of this insipid and inconsequential footnote to 20th century philosophy, in the end, the Slingshot Argument is rejected for the reasons we've been familiar with for two decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional quality and sound","review":"I have owned this in the C series since 1978 and this guitar produces a melodic and acute sound that compares to instruments costing twice as much.

This video is a bit to Eastern for my taste with my three year old.However, that's not my biggest complaint. It's stupid. Boring. And doesn't come close to resembling anything similar to yoga. There's far too much \\"junk\\" in between segments, and I understand you have to keep segments short to keep kids interested, but the segments in between poses either get the child totally distracted or totally bored, and she then doesn't want to do the next pose.My daughter hated it.

I will say, though, that Om was the only thing yoga about it. There were very few actual yoga poses. Instead, the leader flopped around like a caterpillar and butterfly.

Not what I was expecting, and very disappointing.

I was surprised that the age recommendation is ages 3 to 6. I don't think she will be too old for this next year, and some of the poses are difficult for a small child (and an out-of-shape adult with low flexibility!) to do. I decided to get this one in the series because it has one pose for each letter of the alphabet, and my daughter likes that. I didn't find the imagery between the poses to be too long or distracting as some found, but maybe that's because my daughter's on the older end of the suggested age range."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice!","review":"It's very nice and I like it but, it does have some cosmetic taste if it gets inside of your lips."},{"rating":"1","title":"so hard to understand","review":"The prose in this book is so choppy that it is incoherent and impossible to follow (case in point: \\"Mariotte was interested in the physics of gases and in the sound of the trumpet; he wrote The Treatise on Percussion\\"). It was nice to see illusions grouped by type but there is not much explicit discussion of how and why each illusion constitutes a member of that class.

Suddenly it turns into some gangster horror flick. Complete with car chases, kidnapping and blood. It's as if this ridiculous ending mocks the entire film. As someone who deeply identified with both Bobby and Mr. Summers it was an outrage that this story would take this sensational, unbelievable turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing adaptation","review":"The film not only didn't do justice to the book but also lost the feel, the atmosphere and the message. Christian Bale, a fine actor, is horribly mis-cast. Some key scenes were lost from the book and I question the choices made by the writer and/or director with regards to this. Obvious commercial decisions caused this film to lack the emotive power that was so evident in the novel. Read the book, forget the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are there others?","review":"I bought my Whisperlite in 1996 and have yet to have a problem with it. (I think I may have cleaned it once) Simmering is a bit of a trick but if you use it several times before taking it into the woods you should be able to cook any food you can take in a back pack. There are stories about these stoves going into \\"meltdown\\" during light up on cold days but it is always because the user either over primed the stove or was using a damaged fuel line. If you accidentally over prime do not add more fuel. Just let what you have burn off.I have never had problems lighting the stove or keeping it going (although I did run out of fuel once). Light and VERY easy to use.Funny thing, it is a bit loud but you never notice until you turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, reliable, and log lasting","review":"Ive had one of these for 10+ years now. There is an art to lighting it, but once you understand it is a snap. This uses a catalytic process, it needs to heat itself up for use. Great heat producer to cook anything you could want. There is a windscreen that came with mine which is invaluable and always used. Has been folded up and unfolded many times still is in perfect shape with no cracks. The base itself is studry enough to put anything you like on top of it. I often find myself preferring to use this over my two burner colman stove. The portability is great. The stand legs swing around, everything is disassembled, and it fits in a small nylon bag maybe 8\\" x 4\\". I have cleaned it once. Used it probably 100 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"MST stove","review":"I purchased the stove based on the positive feedback it received. The stove arrived as promised. When I opened the package I found it contained only the stove. Despite the fact that the item is pictured with the fuel bottle, the bottle IS NOT included in the listed price. It must be purchased separately and costs from $11 to $22 depending on the size you want. The picture is a bit misleading and subsequent purchasers should be advised the fuel bottle is not included in the purchase price. That said, the stove seems to be well made for its stated purpose. I have not been able to actually use it yet because I am waiting for the fuel bottle (purchased separately) to arrive. Then I will have to find an outlet for the Coleman fuel to use with the stove. Stay tuned...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It's just what i wanted, but just a litle problem: I did not know that it doesn't bring the fuel bottle.Inspite of this, I have used the Msr whisperlite several times and is excelent.

The tank pressure and valve control take a little work getting used to. Like anything else it seems getting the proper pressure and flame temp in place simply takes practice rather than being something faulty in the system. I'm very pleased and would recommend this stove to people seeking a light weight stove taking up a relatively small space. If you some off road motorcycle overnights this seems like a great fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on the CZ and Synth Programmming...","review":"Not quite sure what the guy below is talking about here.

I play backgammon with my girlfriend as often as we can make time, and we found it to be ideal in every circumstance.The pieces are a solid and tile-like, the case looks and feels like leather, and the board itself is felt. The only downside is that the 4 outermost lines on the board that you put the pieces on are a bit covered by the tile holders. All the same, while the pieces on those lines may careen over to the adjacent lines, it really has no effect on the game.Great price, great set.

But the crowning jewel of all 80's stupidity, was the condom song.C'mon everybody sing along! \\"He's docta Doogie. doc docta Doogie!\\" Then Harris will look right at the screen with a stern look and preach about the dangers of sex. He then commands the viewer (you) to wear a condom.And every single damn episode he had to write in his computer journal.

Better spend your money on almost any other Francis book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Francis finally lays an egg.","review":"My favorite author has written a boring book. Dick Francis usually writes novels with firm straight forward plots. This book's plot is a swamp in which the reader flounders.

This rapidly gets dangerous as a fire breaks out in the campaign headquarters and the mayhem escalates. Someone is out to make sure George Juliard does not get a seat in Parliament.Usher Rudd, the tabloid reporter, is one of the most unforgettable characters Mr. Francis has ever created, both for humor and devilment. Reviewers don't give him the high marks of his other mysteries, but they have to admit the cleverness of 10LB.

However the assassination attempts, especially the shoot-and-stumble, are less than credible and the final resolution is totally unbelieveable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The always reliable Francis disappoints","review":"As a fan reader of Francis, I must say that this book really disappointed me. As someone already mentioned in his review: a good beggining, then at half the way, the book falls into a self-complacent and too convenient ending. As a portrait of English politics, Jeffrey Archer's \\"First Among Equals\\" is a much better read. From Francis, I will always prefer the elegance of \\"Banker\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Francis doesn't dissappoint","review":"My favorite Christmas gift each year is the latest Dick Francis novel. It is a tradition started by my mother-in-law several years ago, when she would buy the latest, read it first and then give to me as a present. We got on famously. While Mom is gone, Pop continues the tradition and the latest from Mr. Francis, 10 Lb. Penalty, is his usual good mix of story, detail and suspense. The villain may be identified early, but the plot builds nicely to its climax. With Francis, the fun is how--not who. While this book may not have Sid Halley, Ben Juliard is quite competent and enjoyable. Francis rarely dissappoints, and this is no exception. Another good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous British adventure/mystery...regretfully the last!","review":"I believe that I have read all of Dick Francis' works, most of which centered around various horse racing venues in England. Although his central characters in all his works had different names and somewhat different occupations, they were all in someway related to horseracing. And all could seemingly leap tall buildings, etc., and, of course, solve these crimes! This is a great escape for a few hours into a \\"can do\\" world, where the bad guys ultimately get caught, and the good guy in some way, shape, or form, gets the girl. This is Mr Francis' last book, regretfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not the usual quality from Mr. Francis","review":"As someone who has read all of Mr. Francis' books, I truthfully have to say that 10 LB Penalty is not his best work. I enjoyed reading it and like all of his other books left me with a strong desire to visit England and hopefully meet some of the wonderful characters who live in his imagination. As I was reading the other reviews, I also wonder if a \\"ghost writer\\" is being used. The tone of this book is Dick Francis, but it is a little off, not up to his standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 pound snooze","review":"This book was dissappointing. There was very little mystery, and no thrill. The best part was the attempted sabotage of the automobile, but even that was not followed up well. I found it hard to believe that Julliard's rise in British politics went so fast. Dick Francis has a great reputation. Surely his other work is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One Of His Best","review":"The story is a good one until the halfway point and then seems to wander aimlessly. Still, worth reading if only for the likable characters and the message of morality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Francis' best effort.","review":"Over the years, I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Francis' books. 10 lb penalty seemed like two separate books. I very much enjoyed the first half of the book which took place over a period of a few months. However, the second half almost seemed like the outline of a story. Francis has always done a great job of describing the little details of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. In the first half of this book, he again succeeds in this regard. The second half, which takes place over an extended period of time is missing the rich characterization which is the hallmark of a Francis book. The conclusion to the story was far too simple and convenient. In the end, this book was a disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Francis at his worst so far.","review":"Having read this book, I have come to the sad conclusion that perhaps Dick Francis has finally written one book too many. Certainly he is far off the form that produced such winners as the Sid Halley books, Bonecrack, or The Danger, to mention just a few. In this one, the plot is weak and obvious, the characters poorly developed (except for the clothes they wear, their looks, and their inevitable purity or villainy), and the outcome entirely predictable. I felt with some dismay that it's probably time for Francis to retire from his second profession, although I will miss him as will his many other devoted readers. But this would be a far better choice than to watch his high-energy thoroughbred writing style become that of a mere hack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Francis: A stand-up guy hero, wicked foes, horses.","review":"The hero of Dick Francis' new thriller is a bit younger than his usual -- he's just 17 when the novel opens. Otherwise, the author sticks with his winning formula: incorruptible and modest hero, wicked foes trying to smear his reputation, beautiful horses to ride. Like most Francis heroes, Benedict Juliard has had an unusual childhood with an absentee parent. His father George summons Ben shortly before his 18th birthday to help him campaign for a seat in Parliament. But George quickly makes enemies, who become ever more jealous and violent as his political star rises. Benedict, feeling like a true son to his father for the first time, is determined to protect him as he seeks the job of prime minister.The good guys may be a bit too flawless in this book, and if you don't understand the British political system, it could be tough going. Otherwise, dive in and hang on! I read it in five hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.

This book is built from the ground up for artists. By focusing on surface anatomy, showing its relation to underlying muscle and bone structure, and then presenting it all with a multitude of useful and expertly done drawings, Sheppard has produced what may be the finest anatomical artist reference.Most professional artists recommend Bridgeman's works. I don't doubt the usefulness of Bridgeman to a true working professional, but for me, and maybe other amateurs, the concepts in Bridgeman never seem to reveal themselves. Sheppard will be useful the first time you open the book and will certainly clear much of the confusion in figure drawing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love it","review":"As someone else mentioned, this goes in with my George Bridgman books. The terminology is simple, and doesn't get too medical. I really loved the variety of figures used, though I'd love to see more plus sized models in the male side and a more plump female figure.Sheppard lays out key points in observing how muscles and bones affect the surface anatomy of a figure. It shows you how for example the pelvis shows up and how muscle and fat distribution affects the legs, hips etc.Sheppard is rather concise and to the point, where many other anatomy books become too technical and you end up getting lost in the details.The other thing to mention is the price. Bridgman and Sheppard's books are rather inexpensive compared to many other anatomy and figure drawing books out there. This is a definite selling point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tight seal below door","review":"The only hard part was cutting the thing to fit my 30 inch door. It would not have been hard at all if I had a decent hacksaw. A good saw would cut this like butter. Also, the screws were totally unnecessary, as it is a pretty tight fit. One tip for putting it on without removing the door: slide it on from the end of the door, but keep the U channel as low as possible to minimize the friction while sliding it. When you get it to the right location, just push it up and on the door from the bottom. I found the fins to be long enough to easily contact the door threshold, even when fully pushed onto my door.

Worst of all, my first one separated from the plastic back on the 4th use, and the second one separated after the first use.

The main problem is that the whole album has an un-self-conscious campy, melodramatic quality that is downright annoying. The lyrics are self-serious to the point of absurdity, made all the worse by the singer's tendency to pronounce words in a ridiculously exaggerated way (e.g. in the first track \\"Les Innocents\\" he incessantly pronounces \\"passion\\" as though the last syllable rhymes with \\"gone\\") The music is mediocre, not terribly inspired, though well-played. The title suite is not too bad. The last four songs, though, are really bland and drag the album out. 2-3 of them should have been dropped, and this would have been a 3-star effort. Yes, there is some Kansas sound in the music, but the main influence sounds like Jethro Tull, particularly as one song is an actual reel, like something off of the \\"Heavy Horses\\" album.

So I purchased this baritonewhich has the same tuning as the standard guitar minus the 5th and 6th string, so the chording is the same. Thisis a quality instrument with a nice tone.

I'll probably get a tenor in the future and take the time to learn ukulelechords, 'cause it's a fun little instrument and it's cool taking the songs I know and playing them on a uke!A highly recommended instrument.

I am not a musician but I find it just the right size with easy fingering for me as beginner. Well made with a straight neck. We bought extra strings right away and had to use them since my husband broke 2 while tuning it. He found it difficult to change the strings but I did not (I read the directions LOL) All in all a wonderful product and a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never impressed by Glad","review":"Glad gallon storage bags are on sale really cheap.

She loves it and it was great that it was an exercise video that we can do as a family. The video says that the running time is about 40 min, but its actually more like 20-30 doing the actual yoga, which was a perfect amount of time for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"My nephews loved this- it was very entertaining for a few sessions... but as anything it does get tiresome . Ill remind them to take it out again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as YogaKids2","review":"We bought YogaKids2 first and loved it so much that I went back to buy this version. While it is still amusing and fun to do, there are a lot of visual cutaways from the kids which tends to distract from the yoga itself. As another reviewer said, there is a lack of transition from one move to the next. I also thought there could be more of the calming time near the end. Unfortunately, you get through the calming time and then when the credits roll they show the kids being silly again, which kind of defeats the purpose. Generally, though, this is a good introduction to yoga for kids - the kids are cute and entertaining and the poses basic enough to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Video for Little Ones","review":"I bought this for my almost three year old who (I've recently come to terms with) is high energy. I decided to introduce him to yoga in hopes of giving him a great life long tool in managing his excessive energy. The beginning is a bit drawn out for his attention span as well as the in between pose descriptions. I think as he gets older this will be a great dvd for him to follow along. But, for now, I find I'm doing most of it by myself :-). Although, it's great for us moms too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!!!","review":"I am a Health and Physical Education teacher at an elementary school. During the state testing week I show this video to my Pre K-5th grades. At one point I had at least 43 first graders in the gym and had to keep them quiet. I was amazed at how well they payed attention to this video and how quiet it kept them. The last part of the video they were absoutely quiet and laying on their backs. I had one second grader fall asleep. She said, \\"I was so relaxed and comfortable on the mat. I didn't want to get up.\\" Even my \\"cool\\" 5th graders were enjoying it. I had many students ask me, \\"Are we doing Yoga again today?!\\"The beginning of the video gets all of their silly energy out and by the second half they are ready to relax.This is my favorite video to show the students. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it!","review":"My kids love to do this video and I love that it gets them up and moving during the long winter :) My 21 month old even tries to do it with her 4 and 3 year old siblings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and calming...","review":"I bought this for my 3-year-old, and she loves it! She really likes that there are other kids to watch, and she has really started to pick up the yoga poses very well. I bought this for her as an intro to yoga, as well as to help her with her gross motor skills (she's been quite a bit delayed in reaching each of her gross-motor milestones). She also loves saying \\"peace\\" and \\"shanti\\" during other times when she needs a calming moment. My only complaint about this is that Marsha (the instructor) can be a little too wordy during her explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite of Mine for Many Years","review":"I used to own this publication but somehow in moves have misplaced it.

After reading glowing reports for years, I finally purchased season 1. Sorry, but ER beats this by a mile. There were some really stupid scenes, also: the idiot who acts like a bird was absurd, but went on for several episodes.

For me, St. Elsewhere is one of the best television shows ever, and watching it again is a wonderfully nostalgic experience. That said, the technical quality of this DVD set should be a total embarrassment to Fox and the series producers. The picture is washed out and SNOWY like a Vhs taping of a poor quality over-the-air broadcast. Absolutely shameful, especially for a series that was carefully (if I recall) originally produced on photographic filmstock. I cannot understand the overall high rating this DVD set is being given by Amazon reviewers. WE DESERVE BETTER, PEOPLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageously Priced.

In fact the techniques presented in this book are several times more effective in a real situation than a normally applied strike.And also, an angry person who \\"wants to rip your face off,\\" is always easier to defeat than an assailant with a clear mind and excellent coordination.Further more, this is a book pointed towards advanced practices. That means they require practice. No technique will be effective without sufficient practice.In conclusion, this book is an great adjunct to your knowledge if you have a background in wrestling, hapkido, or ju-jitsu."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks nice but..............","review":"Well let me start buy saying that the amount of information in this book could have been printed in half the space. The theory of striking pressure points on the body is nice and when done systematicaly with a cooperative person it looks good to,but I see little real practicle value in this book,the problem for me is Dillman claims that this is real self defence, well if he can hit someones arm or leg in a concise point against an opponent who wants to tear his face off I mean a real fighter then I stand corrected but I\`m yet to see someone use a pressure point strike in a real spontaineous situation. Lastly I would like to address the Kata he attempts to give accurate applications,I think he has created his applications to fit the katas movements roughly,for a real insight into kata I suggest Nathan Johnsons\\"Barefoot Zen\\" for some fascinating insights into classical karate kata.My advice for readers look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mix of British influenced Oi! and 80's American Punk","review":"Definitly an awesome CD.

Johnny's scratchy vocals are pleasing to the ears, Shawn smash has a grinding solo in about every song, and their chick drummer is nothing less than impressive. The only weak point is Joe Bastard's bass, he really sucks! \\"Johnny\\" sounds like a Ramones song (Kick @$$), \\"Voice of the streets\\" is a good song to listen to if you've just been dumped by a girl, \\"Boot Party\\" has loud yelling Oi!, And you heard the kick @$$ song \\"Riot City\\" on Punk -o- Rama 1, and on their debut album, pledge of defience, they do a new version of it that is pretty good.

The main character was uninteresting, which makes for an uninteresting book when written in the first person as this one is.

The book just never got my attention, and I really didn't care what happened to Jenny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A candid look at the real problem.","review":"This is a wonderful, Christo-centric look at the issue of racial issues in the church. By recognizing that reconciliation begins with a personal relationship with Jesus, the authors avoid many of the oft-tried and oft-failed attempts at racial justice. Christ Jesus, who reconciles us to the Father, is the one who reconciles us with each other. It is candid and refreshing, a call to unity in the body challenges the stereotypes of different races. We are forced to look at ourselves as God views us, as people created to reflect his glory in our salvation through Christ. The only concern is some questionable exegesis, in which the authors draw out of the text things which I do not believe are there. But the conclusions they come to are biblical. I would suggest this book to all, and it is suitable for small group discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"10��10��","review":"This is the Definitive recording of these works. J. S.

They have 6.5\\" woofers, providing enough base for a porch environment. The sound feels full, but not extremely bright, possibly because of open air environment. Before I installed them outside, I tested them inside by replacing my comparable 6.5\\" JBL speakers in the bedroom. I could not detect any difference in sound quality. Enclosures and brackets seem to be high quality. They are almost perfect for my patio.Time will tell if they're going to hold up in Florida humidity, but at this price it cannot go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought these about 2 months ago after reading the reviews on Amazon.

The other however has black scuff marks all around the edges and the numbers '190' written in black marker about 3\\" high on the grill. It seems they sent used speakers or factory seconds. Unfortunately I cannot return them since it's been over 30 days.

Mounted them directly on the fascia board, under gutter. Mounting was very easy. Just be careful to properly secure them as they weigh 7.5 lbs each.

At this point, I would highly recommend these units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speaker - compares favorably to high-end","review":"I do not consider myself an audiophile, but I think these speakers are great..we installed them on the back of our house for music in the backyard and connected them to a Sonos player... they do NOT disappoint and our guests have even asked what kind of speakers they are. No, they don't have that distinct \\"Bose\\" sound, but the sound is very \\"clean\\" and there's good bass response, especially considering they are playing outside without walls to bounce off of.They were easy to install, sound great, and are a good value.

Very elegant and funky, she is sure to please.The mixing of the audio on the first portion of the disk is as some have pointed out, kind of weak and uneven.

I've got it on my personal favorite list, right up there with Peter Mathieson's \\"Snow Lepoard\\" and Pirsig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book - but no photos!","review":"A truly great cruising/life/adventure story, well reviewed by the folks below. The Martins have long been a source of inspiration, cruising/life information, and humor.But too bad the publishers didn't think to put a few pages of photos in their unique book about their unique trip to the beautiful far north. And why no real specs on their boat/rig, cruising gear they used, etc.? Cruising sailor-readers would like to know about such things. Was a bit disappointed to find neither of these --especially photos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stowaway gets adventure without leaving home","review":"For me \\"Into The Light\\" had it all, adventure, humor, love and exciting locations. I've read it several times and continue to find it fun and entertaining. I really enjoyed the Martin's close and unique relationship with each other and with their children. I felt like a welcome stowaway aboard their boat, getting to enjoy the trip without having to man the lines or suffer the sea sickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting new classic","review":"This book is a must-read for all dreamers, and for those who have lost the trail of their dreams. It's a classic. I feel lucky to have discovered this special book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I really enjoyed the book. Would have liked to learn more about how they set up their boat and their reason's. Given that they have chosen to be a off the mainstream of boating, I can understand that doing so would have attracted criticism of their choices so I am really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiesta en la casita!","review":"This is a delightful book about an abuela's preparations for her granddaughter's birthday. She is diligently making her preparations during the week, but she keeps encountering setbacks, like a missing napkin, missing candles, and most of all, missing mousetraps. \\"No importa,\\" she says, it's not important, she always manages a solution. What is important is having her family and celebration, not the individual trappings.I love the way Ryan sprinkles Spanish words in her text, in a way that is comfortable for english speakers but will also bring the story home for spanish speakers. I admire the grandmother's easy, low key reaction to each setback, and her clever problem solving - arranging 6 candles in the shape of a 7, and I talked about that with my daughter, about how she didn't have to be upset even though things weren't perfect.We loved the book: the funny mice, the wonderful illustrations, and the sweet story. We read it three times in a row because it was so much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little known jewel","review":"My children, now 6.5 years, have loved this book since they were 4. It's simply and wonderfully written, has a number of great messages between the lines, introduces non-Latino kids to a bit of language and culture, and the illustrations are delightful as well as quite brilliant. We notice new things in the pictures every time we read it, which adds a treasure-hunt aspect to our readings. This is one of my daughter's all time favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"We actually got these speakers free after rebate from circuit city last year. We bought 2 sets, one for my parents house and one for mine. At my parents house in the middle of the night a loud hissing sound was coming from the speakers. We figured out that if you leave them on for more the 20 minutes, they just start making noises.The set we have at my house is not much better. At least we dont have that loud noise, but we did have to tape the 'on' button down on the remote.Personally, I think these are junk. don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still need to see more...","review":"Here we still have the characters developing as in volume 1, so I need to see the rest of the series to make heads and tails out of this story, but since the distributor seems adamant on keeping us in the dark, it seems I will have to wait another two years for the next volume. I've heard it said that this is an excellent series once you get to the middle of it, when the story comes together and all the whimsical stuff takes some meaning (!?). I just hope I can see it complete before I die!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off with something else","review":"The title Eclipse for JAva Developers is misleading.

I thought perhaps English was not his first language. But a Ph.D? And a name like Dennis Stevens? Well, in any case, there were so many completely unbelievable spelling, grammar, and syntax errors that unfortunately these over-shadowed what may have been a good book. Also, be forewarned: If you CAN get past the errors, this author loves statistics, he does his studies by interviewing actual inmates or felons/criminals themselves, then goes on to say less about the mind of the criminal than the statistics of the crimes they are likely to commit. I usually pass on my books. This one is trash. I gave it two stars because there actually was a paragraph or two that made sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"My goodness, I wish I'd read the previous reviews before I purchased this book. I assume it is self-published (Authors Choice Press?) because no reputable publisher would have allowed it to get through the editing process. But did the author not even read his own draft? I'd like to say I was able to get past the numerous typos and grammatical errors because the substance of the material was so gripping, but it was just impossible. You can barely make it through a paragraph without some glaring error in syntax jumping out at you, and often the mistakes change the entire context of what I THINK the author is trying to communicate. Shame, shame, shame! What a shoddy piece of work from a supposedly well-educated author. P. Hartman delineates some of the more humorous errors in his review, but I don't give the author near the credit or number of stars.

It goes in to some detail.It is some what of a mystrey book but a also a suspence novel. It has a good amount of characters and enemies in it.It is about a familie over in the midle east i think Egland, and his familey the yewbeans have a special thing. They all have like a differnt thing they can do in example his uncle has this talent of making lights britter and busting them. Then his ants come and he has to do this test to see if he has any sorta powers and he does they found out that he can listen to pictures. so his ant sends him to this school then after that he gets quat in every thing.

A Great Book!","review":"Midnight for Charlie Bone is about a seemly ordinary boy, until one day he finds out that he is one of the endowed, meaning he has unique magical powers. The endowed are descendants from the great Red King, and all have different powers. Charlie can hear voices in photographs, while some of his friends at the school for the endowed, Bloor's Academy, can feel emotions through pieces of clothing, talk to and understand animals, and even hypnotize others. Yes, there are some aspects of this book that resemble Harry Potter (three main characters; two boys and a girl, an ancient school, humans that can turn into animals, and some others), there are also unique parts of this series (such as Uncle Paton, who can make lights brighter, students in the school who are not magical but who have great talents, and more). I suggest reading this is you've already read Harry Potter, or if you're just looking for a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Midnight for an ailing author","review":"Amongst others, fantasy is a genre I love. I read much of the literature, but this book left me cold. It was so bad, I felt compelled to read it all, in the vain hope that it would improve. The narrative is sloppy, the premise mediocre; quite honestly, unless you are very young indeed, this book should be kept on the shelf. I found the plot to be overly simple, and, if you intend to read this to a child over the age of 12, don't expect it to strech their imagination. The only thing it streched was my patience..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"I enjoyed Midnight for Charlie Bone more than I expected to. I couldn't help but compare this book to the Harry Potter series, as it has many of the same elements like children with supernatural abilities going to a special private school. You can see the beginnings of the children (as well as others) taking sides, good vs. evil style. This is the comparison ends. It's written in a language that that would be easy for young children to understand. There isn't anything too scary about the story and I think it would be a very good introduction to basic fantasy stories. The story is entertaining and well thought out, including important interactions with parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. which I think are usually lacking in stories like this. There is an light focus on history and genealogy that sounds interesting and looks as though it may become more important as the series progresses. Midnight for Charlie Bone is a promising start to the Children of the Red King series."},{"rating":"2","title":"SFC 4 star review","review":"If you are in search of a book to read while waiting for the next Harry Potter book or movie, this is it. I like the book, don't get me wrong, but it is hard to get pass the very similar story plots. The main character is a boy with no dad. At least he hasn't lost his mom, yet. He is going to a different school than everyone else he knows. He has special powers. Oh and don't forget the school has different colored capes based on your subject of study. He has only one friend outside the school and starts to make lots of friends while away at school.I know it sounds so much like our favorite character Harry Potter, but this story has different twists and plot elements. So don't run away. You may like to have a different hero to cheer on while Harry is resting up for his big fight with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.VS Grenier, Stories for Children Editor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash can for Charlie Bone","review":"I'm a 43 year old mom who just recently read and LOVED the entire Harry Potter series. Based on other reviews here, I ordered both \\"Bone\\" books to read while waiting on the 6th HP book. I should have heeded the warning of a few not to waste my time. I was extrememly disappointed almost immediately with 'Midnight' but kept reading to give it a chance. I must say that was one chance too many. The character development is almost nill...I only read to page 173 and don't care enough to finish the book...also, I must agree with another review that the writing style DOES seem to be that of a young child, without a sense of rhythm or pace. I am astounded and annoyed as to how anybody could find this book worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Harry Potter Rip-Off Seemingly Written By Grade-Schoole","review":"I rarely have such poor things to say about a book, especially a children's book, but I must make an exception in this case. Do not invest your time and energy in this book. I've read the entire Harry Potter series twice with my eight year-old and the first book in the Charlie Bone series does not hold a candle to it. The character development is almost non-existent, giving the reader little concern as to whether the characters live or die. The writing style seems to be that of a young child, without a sense of rhythm or pace. I am perplexed as to how anybody could find this book worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard to stop reading Book","review":"Midnight for Charlie Bone is the best book ever read. It is so exciting I could not stop reading the book. The book is about a child who has a gift that he can here peop talking in photographs.

The writing is only average, at best, and the plot left a lot to be desired. There are big holes in the plot that aren't explained. Too many characters are introduced too quickly at the school, so I was confused. I big final climax in the old ruin was not very exciting. Big disappointment. I won't read the rest of the books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"all the negative reviews are true","review":"After seeing the high rating of this book I had to join the comments. This book was easily one of the most boring books I've ever read. In the first few chapters we get the promise that Charlie will soon go to an awesome magical boarding school, so i read on hoping the book would get more interesting. It didn't. In fact Charlie didn't go to the boarding school until late in the novel, by which point I'd lost interest, and the school turned out to be a unimaginative knock-off of Hogwarts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable use of a disabled person as a villain","review":"Jenny Nimmo uses an albino character in her book obviously without ever having met a real person with albinism, therefore she doesn't realize that there is a difference between albino rodents and albino people. Human irises are not red; without any pigment at all they are white, and with even less than 1% of pigment they are blue, a very beautiful blue I might add. I think people would be repulsed if Nimmo had used a deaf person, or someone with MS, or any other kind of disability as her bad guy. I think her contribution to the store of general ignorance and prejudice in the world is the last thing that preteen readers need."},{"rating":"2","title":"midnight for charlie bone","review":"i really enjoyed this book. i am an elementary school teacher and love read alouds. i'm always looking for new books that both the students and i can get excited about. i went home and started reading charlie bone and couldn't put it down. it's very easy and smooth to read. it's imaginative, descriptive, and fun too. i am really enjoying it and intend to read the rest of the series and other jenny nemmo books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and Delightful","review":"Forget about the inevitable \\"Harry Potter comparisons. MIDNIGHT FOR CHARLIE BONE is closer to Roald Dahl than J.K. Rowling. Certain characters-- Charlie, Uncle Paton-- are well developed, while others are basically two-dimensional. This does not take away from the book's charm. Indeed, as the start of a series, it is to be expected. There are disjointed moments and loose ends aplenty, but they leave you yearning for more, and hopefully vthe author will resolve them (and lay out some others) in future books.The story is definitely different: darker than most, but not toofrightening. Certainly it is age-appropriate (and even adults might get a kick out of it), although there are not many likeable characters to start out.There is something delightfully engrossing about the saga of Charlie Bone, and kids will be drawn to it.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim","review":"I have tried to read this book twice now and get stuck a third of the way in, mostly because of the unrelenting grimness. All the adults are evil or off somehow, or ditsy (the mother) and it leaves me feeling like I have fallen in tar. No rhythm, such as found in Harry Potter for instance, jusst constant darkness. It overwelmed the actual story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to much like Harry Potter","review":"While waiting for the incredible Harry Potter books to come out I have read a few other good books. This is not one of them.This book is so much like Harry Potter (in a bad way). Don't listen to other reviewers saying its not. He can hear people in photographs (talking paintings in HP) goes to a boarding school for it and becomes friends with a boy and girl. And by the way, his parents are dead and he lives with weirdos, must I say more.But unfortunately the only thing not like Harry Potter is the poor quality of the plot. The descriptions and conversation make it Boring with a capital B.Do yourself a favor. Read Cornelia Funke, Eoin Colfer, and Lemony Snicket while your waiting for J.K.'s masterpiece, not some junked up version by Jenny Nimmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Knock Off and Waste of Time.... Skip It!","review":"For those seeking something while waiting for the next Harry Potter, BEWARE! This book is an obvious knock-off of the popular Rowling books and is so pooly written I found myself groaning during each chapter. A boy, who has lost a parent, goes to a special school because he is magically gifted where he becomes friends with another boy and girl. Sound familiar? I could have forgiven the transparency of this tale had the writing in any way made up for it. Poor description and even poorer conversational writing make this book a bore. Even its cover art is an attempt to cash in on Harry's popularity. Do yourself a favour and read The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper instead of this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE HARRY POTTER KNOCK OFF!","review":"This book is so much like Harry Potter that it is sickening! I love fantasy (especially Harry Potter) and this is such a disgrace that it leaves me lost for words. Charlie discovers he has a magical talent. He goes to Bloor's Acadamy (knock off of Hogwarts.) He meets a boy with a large comical family (sounds like Ron to me...) and a bold girl and together they have adventures. Think you've heard this before? The cool thing about this particular series is the idea that the endowed have different and interesting powers that are just their own. However, if you're waiting for a new Harry Potter, choose another book. If you're as big as a Potter fan as me, you'll be disgusted by this author trying to recreate her version of Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like Harry Potter","review":"I picked up this book expecting to find something...original. But no, I was wrong. This is WAY too much like Harry Potter but it cannot surpass the details, plot, and overall storyline of Harry Potter.

A little bit of advice, conserve your money and buy something that actually is original not a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Harry Potter","review":"I'm surprised at the high ratings this book has received from other reviewers. I thought it was a sad imitation of Harry Potter and I only got finished it because I try to finish every book I start. I didn't mind the lack of originality so much as the lack of a coherent plot. I honestly couldn't follow what happens in some of the chapters--and I don't care enough to go back and try to figure it out. I will not be reading the sequel or recommending it to my students.

I had to FORCE myself to complete this book because I could only read about 10 pages at a time before being utterly bored.I believe the book started with a good premise: a boy who can \\"read\\" photographs. If the author had just stuck with that idea and developed it a bit more, the book could have been decent. However, the author introduced all sorts of lame plot elements and characters, all the way to the end. It was as if she didn't plan the story and just sort of made it up as she went along. In addition, the character development was shallow. I really could have cared less if any of them died. The only remotely interesting character for me was Uncle Paton.Please avoid this book.

It didn't make sense why Charlie had to go to a boarding school or how that would benefit him. I also didn't see why he was hailed as this great hero at the end because I couldn't determine anything that he had specifically done that was so great. Overall, not a great read.

The characters were flat, the plot was uninteresting, and Charlie was one of the dullest heros I've ever had the displeasure to encounter. Reading these books was like walking down a street in the suburbs and looking in the windows - sometimes boring, sometimes a bit more interesting, but you can't hear what's going on and don't know enough to care.One other thing - I've read all the reviews (20 pages!) and I've seen people state that this would be appropriate for younger ages. Almost as if they're trying to say that a book for younger readers is allowed to be written poorly. This seems so wrong to me.

This dreadfully unfunny flick convolutes and beats to death a rather lame idea until nothing remains but the pulpy husk of an unrecognizable cinematic carcass that is unknowingly scraped up as road kill by duped consumers.

In all of the previous books, there was at least a thread of the detective in the book.The percentage of the books dedicated to the old Anita Blake has steadily declined since Obsidian Butterfly. This book is 5% sex with a new guy, 5% sex with a stranger, 5% do I have a new power or not, and 85% sex with everyone else.After the last book, I commited myself to stop buying this series if the next book did not contain any of the old Anita. I will re-read the books up to Obsidian Butterfly if I need an Anita Blake fix and re-read everything after that if I need an Anita Blake gets sex fix.My only consolation is that I have spent more money on the good Anita Blake books than the bad.

The last three books have taken this series down a road that leads towards what she's doing with her Merry Gentry series - a road that pretty much leads to (not always) softcore porn! The plot of the last few books....and I'm not sure there was a plot line to this one!...have lead no where at all. I keep reading in the hopes that the author will bring back what lured me into the first books in the series: the humor and the attitude her character displayed in the first four books was perfection. Now it's non existant.All I can say is bring back Edward and let him clean up the mess that Anita has gotten herself into!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much sex, not enough action","review":"I discovered this series years ago, back when Anita spent most of her time fighting vampires and other bad guys, and when Richard and Jean Claude were just interesting characters. I have been increasingly disappointed with the previous books because of the amount of sex, and talking about sex and the loss of any kind of action, you know, like hunting vampires? This one is the worst yet. Save your money! You can find better, less predictable sex between multiple partners on the internet...for free. When this book started to get interesting at the ballet with some new characters and the potential for some action, Hamilton's solution was to send Anita to the limo for more sex. There is really no point in calling this paranormal--- the only unbelieveable things about these books are how beautiful every single guy is and how extremely well endowed they are. This was the last $20.00 bucks I'm giving Hamilton!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"Incubus Dreams, Micah and now Danse Macabre three books that Anita's main focus has been feeding the Arduer. I miss the Anita that did anything to get the job done or even did something interesting. No cases, no zombies, no execution. The strengths and foibles of Anita's men get repeated enough that you can skip pages and not miss a thing. The sex is also repetative and not that terribly well written. Anita now relates to all the other characters new or old only through sex. Predictably she runs the hot and cold with everyone. We get it no man will run her, she'll not give an inch to anyone please give us something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"LKH newest installment was to me very predictable and not enough substance. I think Anita Blake is one of the best female characters I have ever read and lkh imagination is awesome but the last two books just did not have LKH energy. If you must read it you may want to borrow it. I know I won't be buying anymore from this series unless someone reputable tells me it has changed. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought the book at a used bookstore and it still wasn't worth the money I paid for it. There is no plot, there is no ending, there is nothing but poorly written sex scene after sex scene. It's not even good enough to be bad porn. There are numerous typos, words used incorrectly (the most glaring is effected in place of affected), words spelled wrongly, and grammatical errors. Considering the quality of the first 6 books and the lack in the books since, its almost as if she's not writing them anymore. I was so disappointed. I want the time and money that I spent on the book back. At least my buying it used won't up her sales numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Come. We are ready for the floor show.\\"","review":"Honestly, after reading this I don't know why Anita bothers to wear clothes anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I, like many other LKH fans, couldn't wait for this book to finally be released. And like many sat down and read it as fast as I could. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Where did Anita go? Throughout the series she has evolved to a stronger character, both in her police/fed marshall side and the metaphysical side. But in this book the 'cop' diappeared... Where was her gun? The entire book is held in Jean-Claude's space under the circus and was based on her developing 'abilities'. As I was reading I felt like the 'real' Anita would show herself soon, but at the end I thought Anita was portrayed as a whiny child who couldn't do anything for herself... And the sex - I felt like 3/4 of the book was sex -with new people she just met or a group.... Definitely not Anita's style unless in an immergency, not because she was pissed. But to end this review, I feel like if you have kept with the series you have to read this book so you aren't lost on the next, but don't expect much... Sorry LKH."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a guys point of view","review":"I and my wife usually don't agree on books but the Anita Blake series was one that we fought over when we first started reading them. However, the last few books seem like trashy Harlaquin romances rather than the good writing I remember. Did someone come up to Hamilton a few years back and say \\"hey, you need to add more sex to get the females to read this\\".

The last couple books were dissapointing, but I went ahead and bought this one in the hopes things would have improved. They have not.

I'm sad to say that I'm now giving up on this series. This will be the last Anita book I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely and utterly terrible","review":"Yes, it WAS actually possible, Anita Blake gets even more prostitued by LKH for money. This book was absolutely horrid. The plot was beyond weak and a rehashing of her last two-ish books, it has gone from a dark fantasy genre to vampire erotica and any remote basis for the original Anita so long ago is utterly destroyed.Anita is no longer likable, Jean-Claude in this book is a far cry from Master of St Louis and is boring, Richard is predictably cry babyish and all the new introductions just MUST sleep with Anita. BORING.I was VERY lucky to be able to resell this book. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. LKH just end it. Please. Go write a Merry Gentry book or something you haven't made into a mockery yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I waited a year for this???","review":"I cannot believe after waiting for one year for this book how disappointed I was when I read it. Yes, some of the character development or lack thereof was interesting and the pregnancy scare was a nice plot point the rest of it just didn't seem to go anywhere.

Sorry Laurell but you've lost another long time fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, tedious, plotless, and annoying.","review":"I think the title of my review says it all.

The previous short book (Micah) seemed to get back somewhat torwards the kind of plots that attracted me to this series to begin with.This book has NO PLOT, or at best a very small and weak one. It seemed to start ok, but by chapter six, it was back to \\"have sex with this guy, have sex with that guy, have sex with this guy again, Richard is upset, have some more sex...\\"This is the last LKH book I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"This book did not have enough progression of the plot. There was too much sex thrown in at every opportunity. This, like the last few Anita Blake books, was a disappointment for me. I loved the series for a long time, but I am so disappointed at the lack of character development and plot. And no, I don't count getting tons of new powers as character development. This series used to have great supernatural politics, some romance, detective stuff, etc. Now it's just sex, sex, sex. I can't continue to read this series until there is a balance. It's ok to have sex, if it furthers the plot. It can't be the only plot. There needs to be more to the books than just sex. I'd have given this book 0 stars, but there was not that option, so it received 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!!!!","review":"Ok, this may sound silly-But I don't like the boy on boy stuff!!! Plus, Anita acts a little stupid; she acts like she is dumb as h@#%#. She's always asking questions after questions, it's a little too much for me. In addition to that, the story line could be better. I mean I love her other books, but this is just too much. It is overly sex driven!!! I hope the series turns to a brighter side and stop going down the ugly, dark, sex-driven & worshipping of Anita way!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Merry Gentry series by LKH and I'm still waiting for the 9th book. In the mean time I'm reading Anita Blake (amongst many other books) and i love it. Maybe it's because there's constantly a d**k in her mouth but she's not as annoying as usual.

And the sex scenes were still hot in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless drivel","review":"...Reading through a few of the previous negative reviews of this latest Anita Blake installment, \\"Danse Macabre,\\" an interesting \\"humanism\\" kept jumping out at me (i.e. \\" I'm no prude, but the sex in 'Danse' was a little over the top,\\" \\" I like good erotica, this is just boring,\\" \\"I enjoy good sex scenes in novels, this just feels mechanical\\")---in other words, \\"I am not PRUDISH, (heaven forbid), it's just the sex in THIS book is poorly written\\"....Well, I guess I AM prudish---I don't NEED LESSONS on sex, and Hamilton's focus on mechanics at the expense of plot and characterization have crucified what was once an imaginative, original creation: part Rambo/Buffy/Elizabeth Bennet--in other words, Anita Blake herself...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danse Macabre","review":"Much better than the last one (Micah), which was a total waste of time. And I like Micah. Richard on the other hand, should die or disappear ASAP.

Still, not a bad installment, so I will keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's freak out about BABIES!","review":"In this book, Anita Blake has a long, drawn-out pregnancy scare. The most likely father is not terribly qualified as a provider, but Anita's many partners offer support in various ways. Except Richard. Richard only makes stupid decisions. Anita contemplates abortion, and the many medical issues she is likely to face if she carries the child to term- preliminary tests suggest she has every pregnancy-related condition ever.Oh, and I guess there are some vampires or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars WORST book I have ever read!","review":"Words cannot describe what a mess this book is. Therefore, I will just keep it short and sweet. It was so horrible that at one point, I threw the book across the room.

Read at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita is becoming the most annoying heroine ever","review":"Can Anita be any more annoying?? I couldn't finish the book. I tried twice, I just can't get past Anita's character. She is annoying, selfish, self-righteous, needy and the biggest whore who ever whored. I'm so done with the whole ardeur thing. It's the stupidest way to introduce sex in a book. OH and another thing, is LKH trying to outdo herself with her sex scene. I mean with Merry, she had sex with 2 men at the same time. With Danse, Anita and Jean-Claude had sex with the same guy at the same time. I mean ok i'm not a prude or anything but come on. Stop trying to shock your readers and start writing quality books again. Don't even get me started with the back and forth with Richard. It's like 10 pages of arguing. It's beyond dreck. I couldn't finish this book, I gave up. I re-read Guilty Pleasures again to get my fix. It reminded me why I fell in love with the series in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want erotica...","review":"head on over to the erotica section of your bookstore and buy some \\"real\\" well-written erotica. Seriously, this book reads like a stale instruction manual for sex addicts. Nowhere in this book is there a plot, mystery, suspense, humor...well maybe some bad humor...There are much better paranormal/romance authors out there that deserve your dollars. This is a pathetic attempt of LKH to jump ship on the horror genre and slip into erotica. Unfortunately, the sex is poorly written and, usually erotica does have some plot involved.For those that think Anita will come back from \\"whoredom\\" please think again. This is the 4th book like this...she ain't comin back, folks! This series needs to die...quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, no.........","review":"i kept reading just to see if something would eventially happen that had anything to do with somthing besides sex and anita's powers. i don't really have a problem with sex nor anita's powers, but, really, do we have to have a book that is nothing but those 2 things? i'm afraid to buy another book that might be just the same, but i'm afraid that if i don't buy another book, i might miss anita's come back. decisions, decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing wrong with sex","review":"Yes, there is alot of sex scenes in this book. There is also alot of character development. I started out from the beginning of this series and if you enjoy adventure, mystery, and romance(sex)then these are the books for you. I thought that in her early books when anita is always rushing from one crisis to another that they often had alot of gore and blood and violence.

As the series has continued I've had to drop the detective part, and the horror....so all you are left with is kinky vampire & furry werecritter sex and romance. Plot gets skimpier and skimpier. Mystery is a thing of the past.Vote with your wallet - don't buy this and maybe we'll get some quality again.Go read Charlene Harris' Southern vampire series for something more like what the Anita series used to be.

After \\"Narcissus in Chains\\", I stopped buying them. After \\"Danse Macabre\\", I might even stop reading library copies. Laurell Hamilton is free to write whatever she wants, but her temper tantrums at readers who don't like the direction she's taken have just become childish and ridiculous. I had to laugh out loud at the scene with Ronnie at the beginning of the book. It was an obvious slap at readers who don't care for the direction the series has taken. Everyone who doesn't like it is just jealous that Anita has turned into a whiney, promiscuous little slut. The promiscuity isn't the problem as much as the whining, lack of plot, and plain old boring writing.As other reviewers have commented: No plot, boring sex. If you must read it, get a copy from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampire Hunter - Where??","review":"As so many reviews have stated..bad bad bad. I have bought all of the books, have been a fan until the end but this one put me over the edge. I sat there screaming I paid how much for this?? The plot - sex, the mystery - none, the errors - many, and if I read \\" I opened my mouth to say\\" one more time I think I would have chucked the book at the wall. Save your money, if you must wait for the paperback or go to the library. Maybe if sales start to decline that would be a wake up call, or maybe she just wants to be a porn writer? But my biggest question is do you think we could sue for false advertising, I mean on the spine of the book it states \\"Anita Blake Vampire Hunter\\" not Anita Blake Beefcake Hunter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"If you were a previous fan of Anita's don't buy this book! There is absolutely no story to be found. A more accurate title would be Anita Does St. Louis. I'm not sure what happened with this series, its gone from great stories to unimaginative sex scenes and nothing more. Truly a disappointment.This \\"book\\" can pretty much be read in any chapter order you choose. It won't affect the story since there isn't one.This is also the last time I buy one of Laurell Hamilton's books in hard cover. Not even sure if I'll buy the paperback ones after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"review Danse Macabre","review":"I've alway been a fan of Hamilton's books. I liked the characters and didn't mind the sex in fact it was good reading. However, the last two books have become frustrating to read.It's not so much the lack of plot or circular narrative. Or the characters, I adore them. I love the new vampires, especially Wicked and Truth. But the last two books lack fluency. One is stuck in a scene that becomes extended untill the extended part is extended and often touches on matters that are already discussed in earlier books. Especially scenes with Richard have become frustrating to read.There is way too much explantions and not enough fluency.I think it's time the Anita Blake series come to an end, because there cannot be more. Each book there is more powers more sex. And all options are explored, and it would be bad to make Anita all powerful. There's just nothing left to explore with this series.Maybe it's time to focuss on a new series. 13 books are definitely not bad for a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that ????","review":"I am sorry to say I no longer look forward to the next LKH book. I thought the first three chapters had potential but soon after that it was bad porn all the way to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with a lot of the fans of this series who say it has gone downhill with these later books. Now, I don't mind all the sex stuff that has made it's way into the series, but I do mind that it has completely taken over the story with this latest book, Danse Macabre. With previous books there was at least some semblance of an actual detective-ish story (even if it was somewhat weak in a couple of these later ones). With Danse Macabre there just really wasn't much of anything but a party, a ballet, and a lot of sex. It was very disappointing. When I finally hit the end of the book my first thoughts were, \\"That's it? Did anything even happen?\\" This addition to the series left me very unsatisified.Though I have to admit, I will probably keep reading this series as bad as it is getting. I guess I just hope the tough gun-toting girl who raised zombies for a living and solved supernatural crime in her free time will reappear in the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have to agree with so many of the other reviews of this book. If you go back to the beginning of the Anita Blake series, when the world was being created, there were interesting plotlines, interesting foils, interesting characters. Danse Macabre, along with Cerulean Sins and Incubus Dreams, leaves all of that behind so that the main character can \\"struggle\\" with the \\"relationships\\" in her life (under the influence of the new \\"monster\\" the ardeur). There is no struggle here except for the one where the author is attempting to keep Anita \\"tough\\" and failing to realize that over the time period of the series, she should have grown up a lot more than she has. Just as Anita is \\"tired\\" of having the same old arguments, the readers are tired of the same old problem - a writer can't seem to figure out what she wants to do with her character, but in order to continue to make more money is unwilling to make a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Dreadful","review":"I have stuck by this series through even the worst books, but this is absolutely horrible. It's a plot that's recycled and thinly disguised as a new storyline, and despite my continued hopes that Ms. Hamilton might return to the writing that made this series great, it is yet another disappointment. The difference is that I couldn't even finish reading Danse Macabre but had to put it down after only fifty or so pages. I think I've finally given up hope that I might enjoy an Anite Blake novel again.If you like horrible sex scenes that aren't the least bit erotic taking place in a plot that's utterly stupid and almost nonexistant, this book is for you. Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could rate it higher","review":"I'm sorry to say Ms. Hamilton just doesn't have it anymore. What began as a great series has become an uninspiring and confusing mess. The characters spend the entire book discussing their supernatural powers, interrupted only by incredibly uninteresting sex scenes. Although I simply don't find Anita Blake interesting anymore, my completist personality will of course compel me to suffer through her next book anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vintage Anita fan","review":"When I first discovered Anita Blake 2 years ago I was at the book store like a pregnant woman looking for pickles. Well, those days are over. I am sadly disappointed with this latest incarnation of Anita Blake. I have no problem with a tantalizing sex scene. But, these scenes have gone from tantalizing to repetitive to downright boring.Where are the bad guys? Where are the cops? Where is Anita's job? Where are the zombies? Where is the story? Where is the mystery? The vampire ballet, which seemed to be the point of the whole story, didn't appear until well into the third and final act. There was ample opportunity for the visiting vamps to have brought mayhem with them as was seen in Burnt Offerings. But, no dice.This is the last Anita Blake story I'll ever buy. I'm sorry to say that unless Laurell K. Hamilton can take the time to develop a real story, I'll also have to abstain from her Meredith Gentry series as well. It's also gone the way of the thin and plotless."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Anita died a book ago","review":"Like most of you, hope upon hope of finding the inside of Anita-that wasn't eaten away by some new disease upon disease -left in this book, it's become clear to me, yes she is indeed gone. I for one love change, luv luv luv it, but it seems to me the only character who has kept hit wit and stayed interesting here is richard. funny that, i never liked him much to begin with. Anita has zero personality, no more quotes from these books will be put on coffee mugs. I cant even remember what the plot was- i read it twice. As for the politics? What was political about it?? Does she even work at all now?(anita).The sex isnt ranchy, alluring, deep, or dark- its a space filler. And my cats ( i have quite a few) dont even have that much sex, so it isnt an animal similarity thing coming through, so come on...all i can say is what a waste of a tree....\\"if i let you die, the other bodyguards will make fun of me..\\" the all are."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I was looking forward to this book and couldn't beleive how bad it was. If you compare it to the earlier books written it sounds like it is from a totally different writter. All the suspense and action from the previous books is gone. The book is one large thing about sex. I just hope the next ones get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THANK GOD!!","review":"I was so relieved to read the other reviews...I thought I had turned into a prude. I am so tired of a book of sex. I started reading Anita Blake when it first came out. I LOVED the storylines and the plots and the twists and the characters. I devoured every book and couldn't wait for the next and could read the old ones over and over.There are no storylines anymore just Anita sleeping with whomever happens to be around.My teen-ager started reading Anita when she was 15 and loved them and got several of her friends hooked as well. I was shocked when they were over at my house and all informed me that her books are \\"boring and not worth the effort to turn the pages to read\\". This from a bunch of hormonal teen-agers.I am happy that Ms Hamilton's personal life is going so well and she is happy but please, please, please!!! keep it out of Anita (and the Meridith Gentry books as well) write a biography if she MUST gush. Bring back the zombies and the ghouls and the PLOTS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this one might be better","review":"I was really disappointed on this latest book in the Anita Blake series. I thought maybe she is having a rough spot with Incubus Dreams but after a year of waiting for something with a better exciting plot like the first 8 books of the Anita Blake series I believe that it has died out. I am not mindful of sex scenes if they have the anticipation and care in the writting but it seems now that they are just placed anywhere at any time with no real meaning for them in the plot. I really like LKH as a writter and will support her next book, but if you want to read this one I suggest borrowing it from the library or from a friend. It really isn't worth the twenty bucks. Sorry LKH but this one really stinks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"am I missing something....say a plot?","review":"I've been a fan of LKH for many years, I faithfully buy her books and eagerly read them all. This is the first book, in her Anita Blake series, that I was really disappointed in. It wasn't all the sex, even though it is a lot like reading a very bad porn story, it's the lack of any plot. I think the plot is suppose to be Jean-Claude invites all these Master of various Cities to enjoy the ballet. Along the way Anita sleeps with more men than I can remember, thinks she's pregnant, almost shapeshifts...oh and almost dies AGAIN!! What makes this most unbelievable is, that it all happens in less than a 24 hour time period. I miss the Anita Blake of old, I miss LKH's wonderful stories and fantastic adventures, but most of all I just miss this series. I think Anita is done, and that LKH should put her to rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help her!","review":"Ms. Hamilton - PLEASE either stop writing Anita Blake novels or find something interesting to do with this character. Go back and read the first several novels and re-discover why everyone was so into these books to begin with.If you must write erotica, please do it in another series. I love a great sex scene, but not hundreds of pages worth of it, with nothing else going on. Even an erotic short story has more plot.I really fear that you have effectively killed a great character and shoved aside many other characters that could have evolved into something interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danse Macabre","review":"I've been an Anita Blake fan from the first book. I find that now there is hardley any story but sex. I don't mind some sex but Anita has alot. I also liked that Anita was a strong female that had morales. She has lost her charm. I always loved to read these books, but I miss the crime and her working with the police. All she does now is have sex and a few fights with bad guys. The fights could fit into two chapters and the rest is all sex or talking about sex or finding someone else for Anita to have sex with."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"I started reading these books when I was 13. while the books were kinda sexy sexy at times, they provided a strong female role model.

And no, I'm not a \\"prude\\" who just wants to \\"attack Ms. Hamilton personally.\\"I'm the Constant Reader who is Constant no longer.What happened to the strong female character in the first five books?

I am now done even trying with these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn for the worst","review":"The book is just sex. There was little conflict in the book. I loved her earlier books and I'm saddened that she had to turn the series this way. I always stood by her books before this saying that the sex in the books made it better because she had such issues with sex itself, but it went to far. There has to be a plot for a book to be any good. Still, I didn't hate the book. It was nicely written and it had it's moments. Granted, there weren't many moments, but there were some. I did finish it, and I still continue to read the series because I have hope that it'll get better. It's not aweful. It just wasn't something that I would have bought in hardcover. I could have waited for the paperback to come out on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Laurell Hamilton?","review":"I have read this series from its inception, and found it to be dark and interesting. Slowly the series has started falling apart and this book is the death knell of it all. Laughable attempts at plot, endless pointless dialogue, the same inane conversations. Save yourself the trouble and dont read this book. I hate to see an author I once loved loose her gift, but this is the last Laurell Hamilton book I will read. Im glad I checked it out of the library, and didnt pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weekend in the life of Anita Blake: Vampire Humper","review":"In a period of 48 hours, Anita Blake, partakes in a string of multi-partner sex sessions with hand-wringing, gripe sessions spaced just long enough in between for everyone to recover.I got sooooo tired of the sniveling, crying, whining, tirades of ... well almost everyone in the book. Sex - whine - sex - whine -This is the first book I have read by this author and I have come to understand that this series has taken a turn for what most fans agree to be the worse.Anita's bizzare sense of morality was annoying too as she kept 6 or 7 lovers and used them in various combinations, but was bothered by her non-human master's male-male relationships.I don't usually write negative reviews - as I try to only read books I think I'll like - but in this case, I am afraid the shoe fits."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 months and still haven't finished it yet...","review":"Heh it's been like six months since this book has come out, and I have yet to finish it. In fact I just picked it up the other day again, since the release of the new Merry Gentry book came out. I don't know what has happened to LKH, but it isn't good. I mean if I wanted to read about sex, I would go and read an erotica book. But when one goes to read a paranormal book you expect paranormal like fangs, fur and living forever etc. But not sex this, sex with that one. Blah, I hope she takes this into consideration when she writes the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Horrible Betrayal of Her Anita Blake Fans","review":"LKH has done it again. This book is the second horrible betrayal of her long-time Anita Blake fans. LKH is completely stabbing her fans in the back for a second time. If this system would allow it this would rate a 0. She can be such a great writer and used to make us care about the characters in Anita's world. Why would an author of a long-running series thumb her nose at her fans like this and trash her characters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton is trying to kill off her own creation","review":"This series has just about run its course. No longer satisfied with the rich fantasy world she has created over this long series, she now seems completely intent on writing porn. Plot and action sequences are pushed into smaller and smaller importance as she writes double the sex scenes. So if you're looking for that kind of thing, this one is right up your alley. But if you're looking for a vampire hunter novel, you might want to start further back in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"You shouldn't feel this gross after READING...","review":"Pretty much, after I finished reading Danse Macabre, I rather felt like I'd been crapped on personally by LKH.This is not a good thing.Sex is one thing. Ardeur induced sex is a whole 'nuther ballpark, and it kind of made me feel achy and sad. I'm so completely done with Anita Blake. So completely done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio version(MP3)","review":"The reader, Cynthia Holloway, made an attempt to give each character a different voice, but what ended up happening was fake irritating sounding voices that took away from the story, and made it a lot less enjoyable. Also, the MP3 format did not complete certain chapters and you lost as many as nine pages. I have enjoyed many audio versions of Laurell K. Hamilton's books, but this one has been the most unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cape Cod","review":"Line of dialogue from Hamilton's new opus Danse Macabre:'Welcome, Samuel, Master of the City of Cape Cod.'Cape Cod is a Peninsula in Massachusetts comprised of many towns, No cities.

Instead I found another book of badly written, repetitive sex and a heroine who I have grown to really dislike. I couldn't even finish this book. I will be returning it today. Farewell, Anita Blake. Farewell, Laurell K. Hamilton. You have both seen the last of me and my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to the best Anita Blake","review":"So, the major problem with this book is not the sex. As someone else mentioned, it's entertaining and important to the story line. The problem with this book is that nothing else besides sex happens! We need more plot, period. I am actually looking forward to the Anita book that deals more with mummy dearest (as Anita calls her) waking up and what happens then. Also...why hasn't Belle come to visit yet? Or why doesn't Jean-Claude and company go to Europe? These are all interesting story lines that LKH could explore...What's the deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Hamilton forgot that this is a vampire hunter series?","review":"It seems as though she has forgot the basic element of her book which is vampire hunter series.This book was so disappointing. Nothing was resolved and basically no plot. Well maybe there is the plot of sex and pillow talk but other than that I really can't see it.I loved her books where Anita is actually hunts vampires, solves cases and has sometype of personal life. Now its all sex and personal life how boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"fave author","review":"i love love love this book i have it in print and no joke have reread it countless times i love all the anita blake books and merry gentry books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last time I'm suckered in","review":"Others have expressed it very well...there's no humor, there's no plot and the sex is redundant...my life isn't long enough to read another like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Thrown together and poorly edited (I counted 29 typos b4 I became too disgusted to count!) this book is an embarrassment. The writing is so poor that I seriously doubt Hamilton is still the one writing the series. Does she have a teenage son with dyslexia and a thing for group sex?? Yuck on so many levels. Cleaning your teeth is a better way to spend your time--no, cleaning your DOG'S teeth is a better way to spend your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother!","review":"I have been a fan of Hamilton for years. I have rushed to get the latest Anita Blake book and paid hardcover prices since Blue Moon (which I personally think is her best Anita Blake story). Well no more!!! I still have an interest in the characters but I need to make a stand. I will no longer pay the price for directionless story telling and self-indulgent writing. Reading this book was a big let down (okay that can be said of her last 2 Anita Blake stories) but I was one of those fans that thought this was just a bridge period. Well how many novels does it take to work this bridge. Ms. Hamilton is now just milking the money train and as long as this lackluster writing still gets her on bestsellers lists, then she has no need to put forth any more effort. Ms. Hamilton please get back to writing stories that are worth reading! Until you do, this is one fan that you have lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more hardbacks for me","review":"It's taken several books, but I'm now to the point where I'm not in a rush to find out the latest happenings with Anita and friends: from here on out, I'm waiting for the paperback. The relationships dominate the book more than ever, leaving little room for anything else. Which is fine, if you're looking for a romance novel--I want something a little meatier. No Animators, Inc, no RPIT, no mystery--just more reasons for Anita to have sex, or to be angsty, or for others to be angsty. And things are starting to repeat. She and Richard fight--again--and Richard comes to terms with things--again. The whole thing takes place in about a day, despite the number of pages, the bulk of which are taken up with introspection and relationship talk disguised as politics. I just...want more. Maybe it's a guy thing--but as a guy, I remember caring about the characters a lot more not so long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"when will she learn","review":"lord have mercy , jesus christ this book was so fu*ked up ..... i cant even explain"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to literature","review":"This book is an absolute failure.

Everybody knows not to go near it, as it's so beloved my me. I didn't like Incubus Dreams, but at least I finished it. Not only did nothing happen in this book, I just can't stand Anita's pitty party anymore, and all of the men that follow her around like she's the second coming. What is happening here? Where is our Anita and the great plots? And YES I like sex in a book. But this is pointless and boarding on gross. She used to write such great sex! Sexual tension that would bulid and build. There is no sexual tension in this book with any of the characters because there isn't enough time in between the romps to build any. I miss my old Anita and the gang. Please bring some of her back. I know Anita has changed, and I welcome change. But the last two books have been really bad in every way that counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing","review":"I used to eagerly anticipate each new Laurell K Hamilton book, running out to buy it the very day it came out. I once called LKH my favorite author. I even flew to St. Louis from Michigan for the release of Narcissus in Chains to attend her book talk in her hometown.No more.Since Obsidian Butterfly, the series has gone steadily downhill. Any notions of plot have been replaced with pages and pages of sex with an endless stream of characters. Danse Macabre is the worst yet in the series.The entire story takes place over the course of less than 2 days, making any meaningful plot nearly impossible. Starting on page 86, the reader is \\"treated\\" to nearly 500 pages of endless, repetitive, sex. It's not even well-written. For each scene, she uses the same phrases and descriptions over and over again, until you wonder if you have already read this page before.I used to love her, but truly, don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Story all Sex","review":"I used to like her books because Anita was always working on a case and there was a point to the book. This book is just about sex and possible pregnancy. I kept waiting for some kind of plot to develop or for them to take a break from the sex and actually do something but it just kept going until the book ended. Someone needs to make Hamilton sit down and reread her first 4 or 5 Anita Blake novels so she can remember what it was like when should could actually write a story. It is sad to say but I think this book has killed this series for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex, Sex, and oh please","review":"I am a Huge fan of earlier LKH. All her books had great plots and even better characters. But now I don't even know what to say about all of the sex in this last book. She has the potential to write great sex scenes, if she feels that the book and the story needs them. But sometimes 200 pages of nothing but sex can get a bit boring. And the thing with Richard is getting old. Could he be more of a baby? All the new characters had potential but their stories felt a bit rushed. I guess Anita needed to be pimped out a bit more. All in all I was bummed how this book turned out. I am hoping by the next book LKH will let Anita have a story with a plot. I miss Dolph and the rest of the humans she worked with on a daily basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I found Micha a disappointment and this one, is one also. The book was he said, she said, and how do you feel about that, instead of any action.

That was a bit weird, but nice. I don't read these books in public anyway. What was this book about? There're too many personal problems. The characters in this book have had over 100 years to mature. Why do they whine about everything? I find it hard to believe a vampire is a scary and powerful character, when he's complaining about not getting enough attention. Everytime there's a sex scene, I yawne and wondered what everyone else was doing behind the scenes. GEES! Boring! Anita is growing in magical power but her character is weak? I wondered for the first time since I've been a fan of this series, why the bad people didn't get a bullet between the eyes. They wouldn't have been missed.This is a very disappointing read, but I'm sure you'll buy it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Once again I am disappointed with the latest Anita Blake book.

Instead I will no longer read anymore of these series, even for free. Love Triagles (Octogon's, whatever) are alway interesting but at this point I wouldn't be suprised if Anita had a threesome with her stuffed penquin (and it might not be so over done). Sex is fine and dandy, but I would apprieciate a plot with it. At least with her Merry series the sex is important to the story and moves it along, in this book it's yawn inducing. If Mrs. Hamilton has nothing left for Anita to do maybe she should let her rest in peace instead of making her act like a spoiled brat with a boring (but active) sex drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad porn book","review":"Completely lost the story line.....everyone likes a little trash to read, but come on!!!

I loved all of the Anita book in the past except the last couple. There is no story line and nothing ever gets done. There used to at least be a plot and some little personal drama in the back ground, and can anyone even remember that last time she raised a corpse? She never goes to work and even interacts with other humans anymore it is just all about the sex and how many new men she adding to her very fast growing list. She used to be a hard butt and I really miss that. I am glad that is has softened up but I think it has gone to far and could Richard be any more of a baby. I want him to grow a set and stop crying all the time. When we first met him he was awsome so what happened? I would not tell any of my friends to read this one. I would have them just stop at Narcissus in Chains. I Hope in the future things will change and Anita might go back to being the strong women that we all know an love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the author realy witing this book ?","review":"The book is auful. There is just no other way to say it. It has no plot, it has no ending, and, frankly I am just a litter tired of how many times Anita Blake has to relearn to breath, and all the metaphisical sex. It is not the I mind the sex, it just does not make any sense. Anita Blake started as one of the most imaginative vampire book series in the market up until Obsidian Butterfly, then it turned into, What? I do not even know what the books are about any more. It is a shame, althou I still think that the series can be save. Call me a positive, call me a masoquist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot less sex and more plot","review":"LKHs books use to span several weeks, but lately they are one or two days of endless sex. Her one chance to make a great new story line last about 12 hrs in the book. Her pregnancy makes you think you are in for a real story but you still end up with 2 new sex partners. I loved it when LKH would describe Anitas dates and her innocence the first 6 books. Now you truely need a score card to keep track of her men I am very glad I didn't spend money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always hoping...","review":"After reading this book I will stop hoping for the plot to improve. When I started reading this series I could not wait to read the next book. When the sex became the plot, I thought this would be a phase or bridge to something more meaty. I think I may be wrong about that. It is hard to critize someone for a talent that I don't possess but possibly her publisher should take note. I have always rushed out to buy the hard cover version, this time I asked the library to borrow it for me. I can only hope that declining sales will prompt Ms. Hamilton to re-discover the strong, interesting and mystery driven plots of her early books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish","review":"I have tried to ignore the grumblings about previous Anita books and too much sex. After reading Danse, I just can't anymore. I couldn't get past page 200. NO PLOT, NO ACTION. What happened to the Executioner? The book is one sex scene from page 1 until 200. And it is not even written very well. If you want great sex scenes, get some other books from Elloras Cave, don't get this one. I read Anita for action. That doesn't exist any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I read this in spite of the tide of the reviews and am disappointed I wasted the time. It is the book for you if you are fascinated by the ardure or vampire politics, but not otherwise.

Skip this one and probably its successors as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheres the plot?","review":"The plot in this book was very thin and i really dont think the price of the book was worth the reading experiance I got, this is the first book in LKH series i have not enjoyed so maybe the next one will be better....

It was charming when she was trying to choose between her boyfriends--a vampire and a werewolf, but now there are more werecreatures than you can imagine, and the sex is there just for the sake of selling the book. This is becoming a \\"read one, read them all\\" series with very little action or plotting, and that's too bad. I hope Ms. Hamilton reads these reviews and tries harder, but I'm about to give up on Anita Blake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fagheddaboudit","review":"Based on the consumer ratings, and my increasing boredom and disappointment in this series, I am boycotting the rest of the Anita Blake series. There is an interesting series written by Kim Harrison along some of the same lines as Anita Blake, without all the trash. Title of the first of three is \\"Dead Witch Walking. Like almost everyone else here, I miss the old Anita, and am finding her a distressing mess, with the storylines beginning to blur between her and the Merry Gentry character Ms. Hamilton writes about in another series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long past time to drop vampire hunter title","review":"I was first introduced to the Anita Blake character when I read \\"Blue Moon\\" in 2000. I enjoyed it so much that I nearly inhaled the previous books, and then began waiting for new titles. The quality of the series has dropped since Obsidian Butterfly, and this book is easily the worst yet. I don't mind sex scenes in a book, but I'd like some plot or story to go with it. While the pregnancy scare was somewhat interesting, most of the book seemed to be Anita whining about the ardeur. A book that long should cover more than 48 hours of Anita's life. I miss her working to solve crimes, and am a bit tired of the avalanche of new characters introduced. I'd like to see some characters from previous books return, particularily Edward.I had to concentrate to read this book because I kept getting bored. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET DOWN AGAIN","review":"When will I learn. I had high hopes after the first half of the book, not a lot of gratuitous sex, however after introducing a slew of new characters----NOTHING---instead of an ending we get one last sex scene. what little plot that had developed was left hanging. Please, someone tell me how can any author have a 2 page conclusion that reads like a fifth grade book report..Ms Hamilton you may be the most frustrating author I have ever read!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop teasing us!","review":"Spend an hour in the bookstore with this book but don't buy it. Read the 1st 4 chapters and the last 4 chapters. The rest is bodice-ripper gothic romance. The entire book takes place in 24 hours. SYNOPSIS: Anita and Jean-Claude have ardeur sex with Augustine, Master of Chicago, and Anita *might* be pregnant by...? Everyone's powers are enhanced - some are clarified, most are not. There are a LOT of storylines left open at the end of almost 500 pages of sex: Samuel & Anita; Anita & the sirens; Marmee Noir; Jean-Claude's new powers, if any; Anita's new pomme de sang; merpeople; why the Masters came for this last performance, Belle Norte's rising power; Adonis & Merlin; Anita's 4th lyncathrope, etc. Richard is STILL a pain in *&^%. Anita has *some* character growth and Asher now has an animal to call but that could have been told in a short story.In Short: lots of sex and here's-what's-going-on-dialogue, not much story and certainly not like we got in the 1st 6 Anita books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can Handle Any Kink, It's Bad Writing That I Can't Stand","review":"I usually measure the quality of the book by the amount of times I throw it across the yard. In the case of this train-wreck-of-a-book I threw it once every half page or so. The decline of the series is laughable. Had I wanted to read lots of sex this badly written I would have looked on the internet and saved myself the cost and hassle of reading Danse Macabre. The series has declined into nothing more than the author's feeble and laughable attempts to tell her critics, \\"ZOMG! You're just jealous of Me!/Anita!\\" (or, the equally sad, \\"You're just frigid and don't like sex!\\"). Well-written sex can exist (and enhance) both plot and character development but this is a skill that the author lacks. Avoid this rancid little \\"treat\\" at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give Ms. Hamilton negative numbers if I could...","review":"Why? Because she used to write edgy, scary mysteries with good plots, sexual tension, interesting characters and non-stop action. Now it's degenerated into a soft porn, angst-ridden soap opera!! I will vote with my money, just as I have with the last several novels she's written and leave this one on the shelf. Get a library copy if you must. There are just too many good authors out there to keep financially supporting one that continues to put out junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does it have a plot?","review":"I have been reading the Anita Blake serries for years. I keep awaiting the next books, hoping that the next book will somehow magicly be better. This book was a complete disappointment. I don't mind maybe one or two sexual encounters in books, but for gods sakes hamilton you lost the plot! I officially will never read another Anita Blake book. This book should be moved to the erotic section and quit disgracing the genre of horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vampire Soap Opera","review":"This was my first Laurell K. Hamilton novel. I picked it up in a bookstore at the airport hoping that it was similar to my ultimate favorite paranormal books by Kelley Armstrong. What I found instead was that while Hamilton has a very imaginative sexual mind, I found most of the ideas rather disturbing (sex with a leopard, anyone?) and felt like I was reading a screen play for a bad vampire soap opera. Who suspected vampires and various were-animals were so dang emotionally delicate? Through all the psycho-babble dialouge I just never bought off on what Hamilton was trying to sell. Lots of pages dedicated to some very thoughtful sex scenes, but the entire story for me was anti-climactic. Too bad for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED LAURELL?!","review":"I know I must be crazy in saying this but this novel has too much sex!!! Now don't ge me wrong I like the sex scenes in her books but what happened to the plot?! Where is it? I loved when Anita would go on a case, deal with her boss, the chief and her beloved stuff penguin is gone!? Of course there was amazing sex scenes but not the entire book. I hate to say this but this is the worst Anita Blake book I read so far, I'm afraid to go on to the next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I am very much an Anita Blake fan, despite her nerve-wracking immaturity. I agree with some of the reviewers here that this book was pretty boring. I didn't feel the plot was great and WHEN is the ardeur going to calm down? Has Laurell decided that she's going to write sex scenes without a good story? I am so happy that I stopped buying these books and now get them from the library because I would consider this a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series getting worse","review":"I loved the beginning books in this series, but they are getting lamer and lamer the longer the series goes on. Nothing happens in this book, except a whole lot of sex and even more discussion about having sex. I like sex in my novels, but there should be more to it. How often and for how long do we have to deal with Anita having problems with the idea of having sex with yet another man? Get over it and get on with it. How many times and at what length does Richard have to agonize over being a monster? It's getting old.I thought the book was going to introduce a new twist with Anita being pregnant. It seemed like a development that had a lot of potential for bringing something new and interesting to the series, but guess what? She isn't really pregnant. Just has something weird, and impossible, going on.Either do something different with the series, or do something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Danse","review":"In the last book, \\"Micah\\", Hamilton returned to the format that made Anita Blake so enjoyable. Danse Macabre starts off great but quickly declines into one sex scene after another. So many original characters are absent it is like a different series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loss of a Heroine.","review":"I am coming to terms with the fact that the Anita I knew and loved is dead. (Especially after reading the author's response to the complaints on the series. She is taking the complaints as personal attacks and states that the objections just make her want to continue further into the direction that she is going. - Not very professional, but she is human and I feel for her.) I have to say that although I may read further Anita Blake books, I will not be purchasing them anymore. Instead I eagerly await the next Jim Butcher book - an author who shows how plot development should be done throughout a series. For anyone who loved Anita in the beginning of the series will love Harry Dresden and his adventures as a Wizard PI. (It has all the great cop drama, vampire action, and dark subplots that the old Anita embraced.) I mourn Anita, but am just happy that I have found the same pleasure I found early in the series within another talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last book...","review":"I've tried to hang in there with her last 3-4 books of the Anita Blake series but this is the last I will buy. Once the \\"Ardeur\\" starts I start skipping pages, which is most of this book. Glad to see I'm not the only one so dissappointed, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to the series I got hooked on?","review":"I agree with most of the low rated reviews of this book. The sex stuff doesn't bother me like some people, but that seemed to be all there was to this book. Plus the whole book takes place in really a few days with mention that 2 weeks or so goes by in between one thing and another. The storyline did progress a little bit, but the series really hasn't been awesome in my opinion since Obsidian Butterfly. What has happened with Edward and his possible \\"family\\"? The new characters seen in Danse Macabre are all and well and interesting, but there are still many loose ends in Anita's life and it seems that she is losing her active role as the Executioner. Overall I will still buy Anita Blake starring books, but in the case of this book, I wished I waited for the paperback or to borrow it from someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remind me why I'm still buying these?","review":"I have loved this series since I started reading it 7 years ago, but it's taken a severe turn for the worst in the last couple years. I'm sick to death of the ardeur! Whatever happened to the original Anita who was smart, tough and a bit sarcastic? This one bores me to tears. I'm only about 1/3 of the way through the book, but I had to put it down. I will finish it eventually, but I had to take a break because there is NO PLOT beyond having Anita find new volunteers to feed the ardeur. Just when something starts to happen, the action is interrupted by another orgy scene.The negative reviews have nothing to do with people being averse to sex. It's that this series is nothing like it was meant to be. Someone mentioned Edward - one of the best characters in the series who should never have been married off. I think that was the \\"shark jumping\\" moment in the series. It has never recovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"would be better with a real plot","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews - this series started out with good ideas and interesting mystery-type plots. It has dissolved into gratuitous sex and no mystery at all. Yes, yes, I know that the relationships are based on sex and power, but by now we all know that, so can't we move past it? If the Mother of all Darkness is going to make an appearance, let's get to it already. Let's have a plot with all this emotional/growth/sex baggage. All the 'development' can be interwoven with a real, honest-to-goodness story (preferably one that contains Edward). I will not purchase another LKH book until there is actual story to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I used to love this series. I was really sad when it died... I used to wait on them to come out. I only read this book because I got it for free, and I don't think I'll read any further in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"This series started out great. Now it's just the tiniest of plots to hold together a ton of porn. No thanks. This was my last Anita Blake."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the old Anita Blake???","review":"I agree with the rest of the reviews. I've read this series since its' inception, and enjoyed almost all of the books. The sex has gotten stanger and more prevelant, but even through the last book it was still an adjunct to the plot. This one however has nothing BUT sex. No plot, no action. If you took out all pages which contain sex you wouldn't have 5% of the book left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity the trees that died for this book!","review":"No plot, no character development or growth, just nasty, lurid, yet strangely boring sex scene after sex scene. Anita does not go to work, does not raise any zombies, does not do any police work, pretty much doesn't do anything except have unprotected sex with 7 or 8 new guys despite having a pregnancy scare. Anita, get your tubes tied if you're that careless and really don't want a kid.Richard whines through the entire book, except when he's pretending to be a mature adult and trying to be supportive. (He's not, of course.) Micah, Jean-Claude, Damian, and a couple other men get walk-on bit parts so they can be used in some way by Anita. Nathanial is becoming more assertive and even less interesting, if that is possible. Vampires 2000 years old fall at Anita's feet for want of a good shag. Please!This series is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead End","review":"This will be the last Anita Blake book I will read. If you enjoy reading about LOTS of drama and LOTS of bad sex keep on reading by all means. I miss the kick-ass vampire killer and zombie raiser we all know and love. These books don't go anywhere anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does she bother?","review":"Ok, see if you can guess what book this is from:\\"You have to pick a lover, Anita.\\" \\"No.\\" \\"But you must.\\" \\"Ummmm, ok.\\" OR \\"I hate you Anita. I want the picket fence.\\" \\"Sorry, I don't.\\" OR \\"My beast was seeking his beast.\\" I could go on and on, but why bother? Hamilton does it for us.I found this to be the worst book of hers so far. Anita must have had sex 20 times in 24 hours. The next book should be called: Ho Lotta Sex!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone stole the plot from my book.................","review":"I have been a long time fan of the Anita Blake series and have been holding out for a miracle since the debaucle that was Narcissus in Chains....but alas I was disappointed AGAIN...I bought what looked like a book, but the pages contained no plot, plenty of unsubstatiated sex, more whining, more Anita the spoiled brat that everyone wants and for the life of me I cannot understand why....The Anita Blake that I love is gone...the rich tapestry that was Jean-Claude and Richard have been reduced from strong characters to Anita lap dogs...Jean-Claude is a master vampire for goodness sakes and Richard a powerful Ulfric....Ms. Hamilton wake up, what have you done. Your wonderful world of mystery, angst, and the supernatural have become an empty sexapalooza....I'm sorry but I'm done...and Danse Macabre could have been titled...1000+ ways to bash Richard from the first line to literally the last...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they used to be","review":"I picked up this book hoping that it would make me excited about the Anita Blake books again. After reading it, I feel like I've wasted some time in my life.When I closed the book, I realized that I was still waiting for it to get better. I was still waiting for the plot. I was still waiting for Anita to act like Anita in other ways that didn't include her getting squeemish about all the sex that she has to have.This book is all vampire politics, new powers, and sex. There is no federal marshal, there is no take no prisioners Anita. I'm beginning to wonder if Anita ended a few books ago and we just didn't realize it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am done","review":"I hoped after the last few books that the books would return to mistery and police work. They have not. Only badly written porn left. No plot at all, I dont think that more than 15 pages are dedicated to the plotline. The book looks at roughly 24hours. Within these 24 hours Anita Blake is engaded at least 6-8 steaming sex or a erotic encounters with changing partners. Every sex scene goes over 20-30 pages (At least I had the impression they were s ooo long because they are repetetive and boring)Sorry Anita you are now a person you would have shot on sight in the first few books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame.","review":"Seriously?My friend and I used to be avid readers of Laurell's vampire hunter. We both read all of the novels and both were left with the same impression towards the latter novels: Ew. I think I could deal with the endless sex scenes if there was a plot, or maybe even some sort of action. But there isn't. The Anita Blake we knew and loved is long dead, replaced by Buffy the vampire layer. What happened to Zerbroski? Dolph? Edward? Burt?? What happened to Anita's job?? It seems that all her life is now is one sexcapade after another, and it gets tiresome. I was hoping with Danse Macabre LKH would snap to her senses. I was wrong obviously. My friend didn't even buy the book. She's given up on the books. Sadly, I think I'm finding myself leaning in the same direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?????","review":"This series used to be AMAZING!!! I even loved all the sex that everyone complained about all the way through Narcissus in Chains. Then it just got boring. No plot, the same sex scenes, too much emotional whining, and horrific editing. I'm done with Anita Blake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness","review":"I am very disappointed in the story line and the authors inability to see that while she can write what she wants, her readers can have their opinions as well. After all we're the ones wasting our money on what used to be a sure fire good read and has turned into something Penthouse might publish with a supernatural element. This will be the last of her books I'll purchase in this storyline until something improves. And I am very sad about this since I used to look forward to LKH books and recomend them to friends. Now I'm embarrased for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Blake cause of death - BAD WRITING!","review":"I'm no prude but bad writing and weak plot lines do not drive repeat sales.I've never been more disappointed with a book, make that last four in the series. When I first got introduced to this series the characters were so vivid and neatly drawn that each additional titile revealed more but still left substancial mystery to the on-going story. But these last few titles have dropped to bad porn writing, the sex is too techinical and the characters are now bad reflections of what they were in the begining. I mean Ms, H really needs to read Anne Rampling's aka Anne Rice's Beauty Series to learn how to write erotica or pick up a copy of Dave Benbow's Hunk House for some real fun and quick sex scenes. I can honestly say that I intend to drop Ms. H from my must read list, talk about good money thrown away on empty words."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beauty of the Beasts","review":"The only problem with this bookis that it could have had another hundred pages or so. The scenes immurse you with thier usual vividry and spontinaity. It all went by too fast for you to really sink your teeth into it until it was over. The finish was heart warming, but still left you a little confused. The story is expanding so well on Mother Darkness, but it could use a little more of a good side to her. Someone that makes the vampire council quake in thier boots can't be all bad. I liked the addition of Merlin, but I wanted to hear more about him. And most of all, Where is EDWARD!? There are so many new charachters that the books should be getting longer and longer. I for one wouldn't mind. A long book that keeps you interested and that slowed down a little bit would be nice, but I truly believe that Ms. Hamilton just keeps getting better and better. Read the book and decide for yourself, but I warn you, Your gonna love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King meets Candace Bushnell","review":"Our heroine Anita Blake daydreams about men, sex, werewolves and vampires until she realizes she is pregnant.

It was just boring! The sex were blah and if I read \\"bad animator, no cookie.\\" one more time I was going to scream. By the way, where was the animating part of this book? Has Anita just gone to have around the clock sex and quit her job that she has to do, or risk accidently raising the dead? I really hate that I bought this book in hard bound. What a waste of money.

I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"*YAWN*","review":"I never thought I'd hear myself say that sex is boring, but LJH has managed to make it so. Was there a plot?

I'm not buying anymore of LKH's books. The sex scenes were boring, and they only occured after excessivly long angst sessions that totally destroyed any mood set. The climax was wrapped up so quickly at the end, it was as if she just got tired of writing and decided to end the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...this book was crap!","review":"I've loved Anita Blake for years and have read and re-read her books four and five times each. I even liked Narcissus in Chains because all the sex and ardeur were new and different, but then Cerulean Sins started to get a bit much. But I still held out hope because there was still some decent plot. Incubus Dreams was total crap, however and I had to struggle to finish it. I was hoping that Ms. Hamilton would find her writing strengths and roots again and that Danse Macabre would be better, but alas it was the worst of the bunch. I could not even finish it! Which I still can't believe.I've decided not to waste my money on her crap anymore.

Personaly I will take 5 years off from reading anything my Ms. Hamiliton"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously??","review":"Wow... I was such an Anita Blake fan when this serious bagan...WAS a fan. I cannot even put into words how ridiculously horrible this books was. Basically this is hundreds of pages on who to have sex with to feed the aurduer. This issue has gone from ridiculous to pathetic. Ms. Hamilton has turned Anita into a whore, plain and simple and her feeble attempts to protest about taking yet ANOTHER lover is beyond annoying... I can honesly say that I will NEVER again read another Anita Blake book. I went from disappointed at the last four books to disgusted with this one. You can cross me off the fan list.I wouldn't even have given this book the one \\"I hate it\\" star if that were an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAH!","review":"I am about half way through this book and I don't know if I'm going to finish it or not. All I can say is that I am really bored with it. Nothing is happening but talk and sex a lot of sex, boring sex at that. What happened LKH? Your books used to be fun, entertaining, and full of adventure with a plot now it only has a bed a big bed at that. I think the only thing that can save this series is that Anita dies during childbirth and 17 years later her child takes over and becomes a true \\"Vampire Hunter\\" instead of a \\"Vampire Humper\\". Thank god for real writers like Jim Butcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly... done with this series","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed this series in the beginning, it is no longer worth the purchase price or my time. Since NIC, there has been very little plot beyond Anita sleeping with everyone in sight. I miss her job, her toughness, and I really miss Edward! The stories have degenerated into nothing more than multi-species porn. They have little point and virtually no plot. When I compare the Anita of the last few books to the Anita we met in the first book, I doubt she would recognize (or even like) herself. I will not buy the next book, and I regret spending hard-earned money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough sex already -- get on with the story!","review":"I loved the Anita Blake series when it first started out. But I have a sneaking suspicion that somewhere along the line Hamilton's publisher/editor has said something like, \\"You know, Laurel, your stories are great, but you really gotta put more sex into them if you want them to sell...\\" Danse Macabre is nothing more than a compilation of Anita's sexual logistics -- who, when, where and how to have sex, and let's just kick up the kinky scale a few more notches while we're at it. All of the fun characters and intriguing parts of her story line (Animators Inc., vampire executions and her federal marshall-hood) have fallen along the wayside as Anita is consumed with the task of feeding her ardeur and dealing with Richar's understandable jealousy.In a nutshell, if you've been buying this series for the kinky sex, you'll love this book. If you started reading it because of the vampires, lycanthropes and other supernatural \\"stuff\\", you'll be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"please enough of the sex already!!!!","review":"like many have said, I too am a big fan, but the last three books have all been horrible. I keep hoping that Laurell will respect her many fan's wishes and get back to what made the series so well loved. The strong female lead, the mystery, romantic struggles the fantasy all wonderful things you don't find packed in one book. Lately though it is just about sex and it is just getting way to boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fair","review":"I felt the need to respond to some people, including Laurell herself, who have stated \\"If you don't like the books, just don't read them\\". That is just not fair. Do you think that we are purposely buying a book that we won't like? We got hooked on a great series. I think alot of us still have hope. She did write the first books, she can do it. In the beginning, I felt like she had a definite idea of where the series was going to go. Now I feel like she is just making it up as she goes along. Maybe she's just gotten lazy. We fell in love with the first books, so does she think that we will follow the series to any end? Personally, I didn't even finish the book. Chapter 30 is as far as I got. Isn't it sad when you don't even care how it ends? So, for those who say \\"Just don't read it!\\", I say fine, there's no hope after all. I'll save my money for the next Kim Harrison book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not good","review":"This book just wasn't good. At all. It seems to be lacking in an actual plot. There are way to many characters spinning around and I think that I've lost track of how many characters Anita has had sex with. There seemed to be many points that would've made good books on their own but were all crammed into this one. In short... this book just wasnt good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happening?","review":"I've been avidly reading the Anita Blake series for about 4 years now, and all I can say is that the books have gone downhill. I recently finished Danse Macabre, and I was more disappointed than ever. In the majority of the books before this, there was something going on other than just Anita's life with her boyfriends (i.e. police work, zombie raisings, ect.), but I found the plot to hold very little in this part of the series. I felt that reading this book seemed more like a very small chapter in another, rather than the near 500 page book it is.In some of the older books(Killing Dance and Blue Moon), the sex scenes were a bit meaningful, and not so abundant. It feels now that in every chapter someone has to take their clothes off, or the word 'orgasm' has to be mentioned at least twice. I hope the next book in the series is a large step up than Danse Macabre, or I might lose hope in the series all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Anita Blake?","review":"The Anita Blake series has long been a favorite of mine. It saddens me that it has degenerated to the point where I no longer enjoy the books. Anita has changed and not for the better.I recommend Jim Butcher, Kim Harrison, Laura Anne Gilman, Carrie Vaugn, Rachel Caine and Patricia Briggs for better works of urban fantasy that Laurell K. Hamilton made so popular. Her successors are far exceeding her current efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just One Itty Bitty Problem","review":"There's only one really big problem with Danse Macabre. No, it's not the sex, although I imagine it's a contributing factor, and it's not the twisting of various personalities so that Anita is always cast in what I imagine is supposed to be the most sympathetic light. Nope, it's something much more simple.There's no plot. Not really. There are ghosts of plot bunnies, from Anita's possible pregnancy and the influx of Master vampires into the city to Anita's knack for picking up were packs without even trying, not to mention the Mother of All Darkness stopping by to remind us she's still out there, sorta, maybe, but not today. These could have been developed into something interesting, however they seem to do very little other than remind you that the Anita-verse didn't always look this way.Everything else is a wash of repetitive sex scenes and emotional angst that ceased to be interesting three books back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danse Macabre","review":"I have read all of LKH books and I find a trend in them. Each gets worse than the one before. This one though it seemed to have a plot had not ending all it was about was the sex. The plot got lost somewhere. As for the novella Micha same there, the book was large type and double spaced a waste of money. I wont be buying any more LKH books. Methinks she puts herself in her character and wants to be Anita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Boring","review":"It happened so slowly that I don't know quite when it happened, but somewhere the Anita Blake books have just become plain boring. I had become disenchanted a few books ago, but held out hope the writing and plot line would get back to where it once has been. Danse Macabre is just boring -- there is no serious attempt at plot and the sex scenes are mechanical and totally lacking in any eroticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to this book alot as I thought with the ardeur under control (Anita did go away for the weekend with just Micah and everything was OK) and her relationships had all been figured out (was even on friendly (and sex) terms with Richard) and with a couple of teasers out there about coming stories, the vampires Vittorio and Gwen and Mummy Dearest, so I thought that Dance Macabre would be great. Your've got the makings of a Big bad in there and in the end it was a weekend, that's pretty well how long the story lasted. You didn't really find out anything and there wasn't even a build up to a real comfrontation, all that happened over this weekend was that everything that had been fixed (ardeur, relationships & sex) was broken, so now its back to the waiting for the real story AGAIN.Plus, I like sex but I also want a story, after all Anita is a Federal Marshall and she is meant to be out there helping to catch the supernatural bad guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This book can be explained in one word \\"painful\\". If there was a lower rating than 1 star I would have picked that. The only reason why I finished the book was because I wanted to see how bad it truly could be and it was way beyond what I expected (It made Micah look like a good read).Hamilton used to be one of my favorite authors but now has become the author that I recommend only the first 8 in the series; unless you are interested in reading porn, because that is what her books have become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a perfectly good forest","review":"This book pretty much seals the fate of the series as far as I am concerned. It is nothing like the first 10 books; no plot, little character development and a lot of sex. Basically the whole book is a series of (1) Anita and others talk about having sex, (2) Anita has sex, and (3) Anita and others talk about why the sex occurred. Repeat until you are ready to throw up! The book brings nothing new to the series at all. I really have to wonder at the people who would murder a perfectly good forest to print this rubbish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done with LKH","review":"Simply awful. I can't believe I've bought the last - - what - - 2, 3 LKH books. I don't care what's on her blog or what she says. The book had no plot and no end and I couldn't keep up with all the sex partners (and I love good sex scenes). Try \\"The Vampire's Seduction\\" by (psuedonym) Raven Hart. It was a cheap paperback that had some interesting new twists on vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love erotica, but I need some plot movement as well.....","review":"First, let me assure others that I love sex scenes - from romantic to erotic. I simply need some plot to hang it all on as well--- oh, yeah! And some character development would be nice too. This book is only slightly better than the last hardcover offering of Anita Blake. We simply have 450+ pages of Anita having sex to feed her magics. Sigh. It gets boring. The only really interesting sex scene is with Asher - but its too little too late. I've begun getting Ms. Hamilton's books via the library so I'm not out any $ while waiting for her to write a novel that moves forward the plot more than 1 day at a time. The ballet scene was well thought out and should have been more than an afterthought. The hints we get of big bad Mother Of All Darkness are great, but simply there to ensure the publisher keeps funding this tripe. For better reading try the Sookie Stackhouse series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More, Please...EVER","review":"This is the end of the road for me. I will NEVER, EVER purchase another Anita Blake book again. I'm similarly fearful of the next Merry Gentry book. This was the last nail in the coffin to me. There was absolutely NO PLOT and so very much sex that you'd have thought that Ron Jeremy wrote Danse Macabre instead of LKH. If word ever reaches my ears that Micah and Richard have been killed off, I might (might being a strong word) glance at it via the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Hamilton?","review":"I have been an avid fan and reader of Laurell K. Hamilton for 7yrs or so, and I hate to say this but Dance Macabre is a huge disapointment. Hamilton seems to have lost her flare for character development and plot driven stories. Though the sex scenes are steamy, they can no longer make-up for the lack of content. I would reccommend this book if you are looking for erotica because it doesn't have enough story to be anymore than that.Anita's possible pregnancy could have been a great exploration of Anita's character, but it was brushed aside much to soon.Hopefully Hamilton will come out with a story that can impact me as much as Obsidian Butterfly did."},{"rating":"1","title":"At last! An Anita book unencumbered by plot","review":"This is the book all truly loyal Anita Blake fans have been waiting for! Where previous books wasted precious ink on plot, and other distractions, \\"Danse Macabre\\" bravely dispenses with unnecessary literary pretensions of this kind and gets right to the heart of what we really want, almost 500 pages of unerotic sex.At last! An Anita Blake book without gratuitous murder, police activities and suspense.Here's looking for more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Distraught","review":"I have been an Anita Blake fan from the very beginning. Like other rabid fans I waited for Danse Macabre to be released with great anticipation and bought it in the vain hope that Hamilton would provide us with more of a plot than the last few novels. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. I recently re-read the series and was distraught by how the books have - while increasing in page length and price - decreased in plot and character development. We don't even get a glimpse of the RIP team or Dolf and his issues much less get a mystery to solve! If this is the trade for Anita's new powers and attitude, then I want the old Anita back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An improvement BUT.....","review":"..it's still was not worth buying and I didn't (thumbs up). I felt it was better than Incubus because there was less sex scenes. But the book had me wishing for less arguing, power struggles, Anita worshipers and crying men. The story spans about 2 days and the issues never end. One dispute, problem or crisis after another. I don't know who should be more tired, the readers or Anita. She really should take a vacation!But there was some funny stuff! Richard's hissy fits were fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was just horrid","review":"I like sex, I like kinky, multiple partner pain sex. and I like reading about it, if it is accompanied by some sort of story. A plot would be nice, maybe a consistant characture??I am begining to hate Nathaniel he is so in the face like my chocolate lab puppy(cute in a 5 month old dog annoying in an adult human). Richard is useless and Jean Claude has turned into a really lame vampire with no will or characture. I am really let down, I can't believe anyone has given this book a good review are they actually reading it or just skimming the pages trying to find the pictures? I will not purchaes another L.K.H. book. this series is following exactly the down ward road the Merry Gentry books went. It is too bad, I really loved the books at first. I say to the author if you have nothing worth while to write just put the pen down."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This book is a series killer!!!The first several books of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series were fun little supernatural mysteries. Really enjoyable little books.But after a downhill slide in the series, this terrible book has literally no plot, though there were a couple of strands of something that might have become a plot if the author had bothered to develop them.Mostly very boring and badly written sex scenes, very boring and badly written scenes of vampire politics (all revolving around who could enter into sexual service to Anita Blake next), and endless emo angsting about sex. Yuck.And the how the heck can sex be so boring????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Told You So!","review":"Surely having a NEW Hamilton paperback selling for a mere $3.52 gave you a clue here. I said everything I needed to say about her in my review of MICAH. Notice on the tags -- \\"bad porn\\", \\"bad erotica\\", \\"badly written porn\\", and \\"porn\\". This is what Laurell K. Hamilton novels are about now.People! Pay attention! The great Anita Blake is dead. Hamilton killed her and is attempting to take her place in some kind of wierd goth fantasy. If you want some good Hamilton reading, start at LUNATIC CAFE and work your way up to OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY (I really miss Edward) then stop. Just stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah Sex Sex Sex","review":"Man this book sucks. I had a little hope in the beginning - when the first 25 pages weren't hardcore porn. But it quickly devolved to that and stayed there through the entire novel. No character development. No interesting plot. Just an endless stream of sexual escapades with so many men that I can't keep them straight anymore.Like many others, this was my last shot for Hamilton's work. It's just not compelling anymore. If I wanted porn, I'd buy porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last chance","review":"This was the last chance for Anita and Laurell K. Hamilton for me. I miss the old Anita and the books that actually had a plot and characters I cared about. Actually for me the last chance came around chapter 20 when a third of the way into the book, the story hadn't progressed beyond the first day. It became clear that Anita was just going to have sex with numerous people and not engage me with an adventure of old. I returned it to the library - after the last bad book, I didn't even bother buying this new book. There was no story to get engaged with, no suspense and no new characters to like or even dislike - they all left me cold. I miss Dolph and Edward and Anita's other police friends. What about the characters from Animators Inc.? At this point in the series I don't see how Ms. Hamilton can get back to where we, the readers would like these books to be. I'll just hope that a new author will come along and fill the void that the new Anita Blake has left."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm getting the distinct impression that the sex is a filler for a very thin plot line","review":"This is my first review on Amazon, I felt compelled to write one in the hope that Hamilton will read this and \\"regain her senses\\". I refuse to buy any of Hamiltons books any more, the only reason I did this one is because I saw it on a library shelf..The series has become a sad thing to see, the last 4 books in this series have become filled with sex scenes that just don't add anything to the plot lines, just bulk to the book. I'm okay with detailed sex scenes, even enjoy them _as long as they contribute to the story development_ this doesn't..The author is obsessed with sex for sex's sake, much like a hollywood movie that is all special effects and no story. Hamilton has forgot that the story is all-important, which is a damn shame since there are so many threads that could be explored and turn this back into the truly excellent story that it started out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danse Macbre","review":"If you enjoy Anita and her many men having sex, more sex, and then more sex. Then this is the book for you.I felt like there were sex scenes tied together by a few scenes where things started to happen that could have been interesting to read bout, but they fizzled out, like the siren. At the end of the book there was a sentence or two explaining how that was going to work out with a couple of the weak plot points that showed up between orgies.I think Anita spent more time with her clothes off, having sex, talking about sex, or talking about the effects of the sex and ardeur than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"Plausibility was lost for me (within the context of the posited supernatural world) in the first chapter. We're expected to believe that the two men she lives with, and has sex with at least once or twice a day, haven't noticed a missed menstrual period? To say nothing of olfactory cues-- I could smell the difference in my wife's body scent when she got pregnant, and I don't have a werewolf's much-vaunted supernatural sense of smell. Feh. Hamilton seems to be overlooking obvious plot holes because they get in the way of the angst.I never thought so much sex could be so boring. Buffy the Vampire Layer-- er, I mean, Anita-- is just tedious. If I read one more line about Micah's Magnificent Member, and the joys of deep throat, I'll scream. So I won't-- read another line, I mean. This is my last Hamilton book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I got about halfway through this book and realized I didn't know why I was still reading this series. The plots have disappeared, the sex scenes are boring, and the characters are all so angst-ridden I can't bring myself to care anymore. That doesn't even count Anita. She's whiney, and constantly fighting about things that are stupid (while she and Jean-Claude are in the middle of diplomatic talks, no less), and she keeps picking up powers that are ridiculous. But they do cause her to have to have more sex, which has to be skipped in order to see if something interesting will happen.Sadly, it never does. It's sex, argue with Richard, sex, argue with someone else, sex, etc. I think all the intelligent people stopped reading when she picked up the arduer.Do yourself a favor: read Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Series or Carrie Vaughn's Kitty series instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danse Macabre","review":"This book was excellent to read. Laurell Hamilton wrote another great book. I can't wait until the next installment for the Anita Blake series. I couldn't put the book down, I have read the book twice since I received it in the mail. She leaves you hanging at the end. She can either write another book or just let the series end. I hope she continues to write more Anita Blake stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the reviews","review":"The sex in this book is ridiculous. I would have a hard time believing it if I was watching it as a cartoon. Besides that, the whole 400-page book moves at an unnaturally slow pace for no apparent reason. Around page three hundred twenty-fours hours actually pass. The characters remain distinct, with the exception of Anita who is being transformed into...I have no idea. Ninety percent of this book was badly masked porn with the remaining ten percent dedicated to plot. Also, the book ends oddly. It's like the author decided that Anita, as per some contract with her publisher, must have her life placed in serious jeopardy at least once. Voila! Ten pages before the book ends, she nearly dies. But just as neatly, she's fine. By far the worst book of the bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera Grandstanding","review":"Another muddled mess of badly written non-stop sex set in a transparent \\"Mary Sue\\" wish-fulfillment environment that should appeal to only the most \\"desperate\\" of one-handed readers. This series bottomed out log ago and should have retired before embarrassing itself. The concept of plot and story was abandoned by the author and replaced with a poor substitute of soap opera grandstanding promoting alternate-sex lifestyles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I agree with so many of the reviews before mine regarding the overabundance of badly written porn scenes and the lack of a plot making this book a disaster. Once again more \\"facts\\" are introduced which make events in the early novels seem completely implausible which, to me, is a betrayal to all her early fans. I'm thankful I took the advice of other reviewers and borrowed the book from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"I am over this series. Really, enough already. Based on the very strong plots of the first 6 books in the Anita Blake series, I have kept reading each new book hoping for more of the same. Instead we, the loyal readers, are treated to ridiculous amounts of sex with thinner and thinner plots holding it together. Truly, if you took the sex out of this last installment, there might be a good 50 pages of plot going on here.I'm no prude, sex can add a lot to developing characters and relationships in a series. But if Laurell K. Hamilton wanted to write a soft-porn series, why did she get us hooked on a good story line of regular fiction first? Seriously, she should just start writing another line under a pen name (a la Anne Rice) to indulge her fantasies. This would leave her free to reinstate the strong story lines that were a hallmark of the original Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series....a hallmark which is sadly lacking from Danse Macabre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita.. Anita","review":"I've read a lot of vampire novels, romance, suspense and horror. Anita still surpasses them as the Deva.Laurell K. Hamilton makes the character engaging. I happen to enjoy her books, sex scene's and all.People flock to the gory descriptions of blood loss and murder as a way of feeding some vampires, if you put sex in place of blood, what is the difference? It's still a compulsion the characters are bound to fulfill which fuels a story.Hearing about innards and organs is better than graphic sex?Thank you Laurell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh grow up","review":"I will not simply stand by and see my favorite author disparaged. I enjoy every AB installment and await them with baited breath. I \\"read\\" them in audio form mostly and treasure each. You simply have to allow LKH to develop these characters as she sees fit. If its too hot or too nontraditional stop reading her. If you can stand being challenged or stand for your IMAGINATION to be stretched, then stay tuned. We're working up to a knockdown dragout with the Mother of All Darkness and Jean Claude's sire. How can you stand to miss that?DM was thoroughly entertaining, intriguing, and noncompromising. I hope LKH never changes her original vision to accomodate any lightweights who maybe should stick to lighter faire.It's so hard to find an author like her. I wish she was as prolofic as Nora and could write a different book every 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up!","review":"I keep reading . . . and reading . . . but I now officially give up. The past, what, 5-6 books have been almost indistuishable. It's like a three-page story filled with hundreds of pages of the exact same sex-internal magical crisis-sex-internal magical crises related to sex - on and on and on and on. I like the first three, especially, because they were interesting stories. I just can no longer read another page of what is essentially the same plot repeated over and over with so little variation. It's sad when even the hot sex scenes do little because we have read it all before."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Sex, No Plot","review":"I'm glad I didnt buy it, I only borrowed it from a friend. There used to be more to Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter than sex. There isnt any more. Dont bother to buy it unless you want plotless sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's breaking my heart","review":"After reading the first couple of chapters online, I had hope for this book. I knew there would be lots of soap opera drama but the begining was something that I had hoped meant Anita was going to get dog smacked into her previous reality.The plot had awesome potential! Anita possibly preggers, a converging of several Masters of the City upon St. Louis, the awakening of new powers and the restless dreaming of the Mother of Darkness were all plots that could have made this book into something worth reading. But all these things were like background candy instead of the true plot. If we could get Anita less focused on the male buffet that she seems to have to gorge on every twenty seconds then there would be hope for the series.This book was another disappointment. I can't quit reading them simply because I will see it to the finish but I have definitely quit running to the bookstore the day they come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty Pleasures indeed!","review":"I have to accept the truth. I am a vampire. Not the kind who drinks blood, but the kind who sucks down truly bad novels. I take them to bed with me, sometimes 2 or more at a time. I'm completely ok with a book that introduces a vampire Chicago mob boss, and then does nothing with the character except put him in sex scenes. Sometimes I love a book, sometimes I like it, sometimes it's just because I need to read, sometimes as often as every two hours. I've tried reading in almost every position, standing, sitting, on my side. Lately I feel that certain books and I are drawn to each other, but I'm not sure our relationship is good for either one of us. I feel that I should send Danse Macabre far away from me, but I don't want to. I'm going to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it was bad..","review":"I'm going to be honest here. I did not like Hamilton's latest efforts. But a friend bought this and since I am a fast reader she offered me to read it before she did. I couldn't resist this offer.Nothing unexpected in this one though. Bad sex, character asassinations and endless angsting by Anita. But the editing was better than I dared to hope for though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad.","review":"Another series killer, though at least (unlike Goodkind) the first several books of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series were fun little supernatural mysteries.Literally no plot, though there were a couple of strands of something that might have become a plot if the author had bothered to develop them.Mostly very boring and badly written sex scenes, very boring and badly written scenes of vampire politics (all revolving around whose servants could enter into sexual service to Anita Blake next), and endless emo yammering about sex. Yuck. This is what happens when writers go bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed in this one. Weak story line outside of her relationship issues. Graphic sex and relationship issues seemed to account for about 80% of the book - not the reasons I read the other 13 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and Pornographic.","review":"This book has no plot at all. It is just one graphic sex scene after another. Ms. Hamilton has completely lost her way with this series. I never read a book that was as disgusting as this one. I was embarrassed by all the graphic sex. Don't waste your time or $ on this one. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually it should be no stars","review":"I have only written reviews for books I have genuinely liked. This is the first time I have written a \\"Don't buy this book\\" warning. Buy it used or get it from the library if you must read it. But it is a plotless waste of time and I am more sorry about that than I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where's Anita Blake?\\"","review":"Well, this book should top the charts in the porn industry. Hundreds of pages of this book showed our heroine in three different venues doing the same thing over and over, and it isn't hunting vampires. Anita, as we knew her, isn't picking up her gun or her badge as a federal marshall. No, she can't get out of the bed she shares with the 7 or 8 guys she has sex with to do anything else. Anita has gotten so into the philosophical problems her men have about having sex with her we never get to the story at all. Laurell,get the salt,this zombie of a book should be laid to rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am done.","review":"I was a huge fan of this series, but I just can't take it anymore. . I feel like Laurell K Hamilton has lost the voice of Anita Blake entirely. I don't even think she's writing this series to continue the story anymore; I feel that she is sacrificing this series for some sort of personal agenda or something. It is silly to force yourself to read something because you are a fan of the author's earlier works, so this is my last attempt to read Anita Blake. I couldn't even get interested enough to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Such a dreadful betrayal of Hamilton's loyal readers! Her last couple of books were slowly slipping in quality, but I keep reading them, hoping against hope that she'll return to the stellar writing of her early work. I know sex sells, but this is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bedroom Boredom","review":"I love Anita Blake novels. I even enjoy the later ones w/the sex. But this book, just didn't do it for me. Chapter one was promising and then nothing. She goes into the bedroom and never comes out until the last few chapters. I was wanting for so much more regarding the visiting Master's and the Ballet. But by the time Anita gets to the ballet, it almost felt like the ballet was an after thought. Will I keep reading this series? Absolutely. One book does not make or break a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time","review":"I can't believe I actually took the time to read this book. Of course, I've read them all up until now and apparently I don't know when to quit. This book had no plot, other than Anita sleeping with or talking about sleeping with anyone that she came in contact with. Bad porn doesn't even begin to describe the sex scenes. What happened to the adventure and the mystery of this series? If something doesn't improve soon, I'm going to start cheering for the enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"please, can you refund my life?","review":"After the start of a mad love affair, I have now come to the sad and heart breaking conclusion that this goose is well and truly cooked. No longer can I put up with badly written so called 'love' scenes, that I am contemplating having a backyard bon fire with my collection of LKH's work, but knowing my luck and with all that ardeur written about, it would turn into a bush fire and burn down my whole neighbourhood! What started out as a great and exciting series with interesting story lines, lots of gore and good characters, has now turned into something better suited to a 10 Easy Steps to Fall Asleep Guild. I feel ripped off, hoping that with each book I buy, the characters and plot would be better, (and maybe Richard might eat a bullet...a girl could hope) I'm sorry Anita, I thought we could have been great together, but I want a refund of the last four months of my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lackluster....","review":"This is the best that I can even come close to describing this book as. As other reviewers have noted there is no plot and when one seems to pop up there is another sex scene to discourage it. The dialogue was another problem the conversations went on forever! If they were not talking, they were having another orgy.I miss the old Anita that was tough as nails yet had a soft spot for penguins and fewer men in her life. Which brings me to the characters in the book, there are simply too many to keep up with in many cases you have to keep a list of who is sleeping with who, or in this case who is not sleeping with Anita, it would be shorter.Honestly, I bought this book to complete the series, although I should have sat in the bookstore to read the last chapter, I don't think that I would have missed much.So save your money, go to the library or borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same, not more of what made the series great..","review":"Let me start off by saying, if you did not care for the last few books and felt starved for content that was other than sexual, Danse Macabre is not for you. The wit, humor, muder mystery plot - concise enough to stand alone in each book - interesting and well developed characters, and above all, the one liners Anita Blake is famous for, is missing. I had hopes that LKH would return to the tried and true theory of those combinations that made the first 5 books so good, but she did not. Instead we have about 120 pages of content and 340ish of sexual scenes , or prequels to them.Danse Macabre starts off with a new interesting plot, forgetting that so many loose ends were left in Incubus Dreams, then quickly moves on to sex, and then another brief bit of plot, then bam, its over.Simply put, it reads more like a poorly written Penthouse Letters, than an Anita Blake book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"In addition to a sterilizing bath.What happened to Anita? What is this thing that is being passed off as her? WHY?I have told myself repeatedly to just stop buying these things, yet, keep subjecting myself to them, hoping that somehow it will go back to some semblence of the series. When it was fun, interesting, had actual charactors instead of sexual organs that walk and talk.I am deeply disappointed in this book, and revolted. Not because of the sex but because it wasn't sex. It was as though she thought of the most offensive, unlikable sexual situations gaurenteed to offend, and wrote those down.I'm ashamed I even read the whole thing. That I wasted that time and effort. I'm shocked anyone can make themselves write that they liked it.It was better edited than the last though. I guess that's something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh.....","review":"I have every single Anita Blake book. I am actually rereading the series for the 3rd or 4th time now but......she slipping. I like sex as much as the next person, but C'MON!!!!Possible good story lines which would have made the book SO much better if she had followed through:1) Supposedly there is a serial killer on the loose.2)Is Anita pregnant?3) Mother of All Darkness4) The Merpeople5) Her relationship with Ronnie could have been a nice subplot as well.So much to offer and yet all I got out of it was that there was a lot of sex. Where did the zombie raising go? How about Edward? The police work? I would like to think that this is an intermediary book that helps flesh some characters so the next book is focused on a plot, but I am afraid I am going to be disappointed. Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a Plot.....","review":"I reread the books Guilty Pleasures through Obsidian Butterfly. But this book as with the last I doubt I will reread. This one didn't even have a plot and the plot in the last was thin. Each time I hang on to see if the wonderful rich characters of the beginning books in the series show back up. If the tough compassionate Anita will be present. But it isn't there. I used to read her books in one evening...not able to put them down. And now this book took me 3 months to get through as it just didn't grab me because I couldn't figure out when the plot would kick in. Even the last chapter I kept hoping that something would come tying it all together to make sense but it didn't happen.If you enjoy stories about Vampires and werewolves please pick up the the early books and you enjoy the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"THRILLED and Yet Sad......","review":"I Love Anita! It's been thrilling to watch the growth in her from book 1 to now and Once again I wasn't let down. Although I wonder with so much metaphysical stuff going on and so many characters bringing baggage If a first time reader might not have alot of questions. GO BACK..Start from the beginning it is soo worth it and you'll appreciate it so much more. I eagerly anticipate each book and I'm always sad when i finish them. I have yet to find another heroine i like as much as Anita......"},{"rating":"2","title":"packs a punch","review":"As usual laurell k hamilton produces a riveting piece of work that sucks the reader in from the first page.the graphic style of this brilliant writer takes you to her world and holds you captive there till the very last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"What? I liked it.","review":"I'm a \\"new\\" fan to the series. I read the very first book and most of the latest ones. I like it. Yes, it's all sex, but still fun! We are still learning more about Anita's powers, about other vampires, and the Anitaverse. I'd gladly read 4-5 more books like this. Entertaining, keeps me reading. Hey, bring it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the old Anita better","review":"I bought this book hoping that Ms Hamilton would go back to writing actual plots and interesting cases for Anita, but alas I was sadly disappointed. All we get to hear about are Anita's romps in bed, and that she gets more power and has to have everyone possible explain it to her, over and over. Is there a plot to this? I am not sure. Not much happens until the very end of the book. I have been a fan of Ms Hamilton for many years, but her writing over the past few years has too much sex and not enough plot. I am sorry to say I have finally given up on a good book from her and won't be reading any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine whine whine","review":"There is a reason that psychologists and therapists are paid good money to listen to people self-analyze, obssess, and complain as Laurell K. Hamilton's characters do.The reason being that nobody else wants to hear it.I think the only people who enjoy the conversations in this book will be those who bore and frustrate those around them with the same unwanted drivel.P.S. - It is not my intention to insult psychologists and therapists. I'm simply pointing out that they would be out of work if other people actually had the time and inclination to listen to this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry Springer, with Vampires","review":"We can't expect an author to write the same book over and over; but to take a character 180 degrees the way LKH has with Anita Blake is a bit much. There wasn't sex in the first four books and now that seems to be all there is. There is no plot, no storyline and you can't keep track of the sex partners without a spreadsheet.Danse Macabre is boring and repetitious. How many different ways can her characters do it? In the later books sex powers the magic; lots of cults propound that theory in real life but its an invalid theory. If there is only gray, instead of black and white (good vs. evil) where is the conflict? Anita has become what she used to call \\"coffin bait.\\" Is this character development or merely a history of the corruption of Anita Blake? Someone has to be the bad guy. Is it going to be Anita?This book was unpleasant, juvenile and endless, I thought it would never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"very,very sad","review":"I tried.I really tried to give this author another chance.I loved Anita Blake.I could not wait for a new story but, I can not handle soft porn being the substitute for her great adventures.I could not finish this book.It was boring and I do not recommend this or the series until there is actually a story to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Disappointed","review":"I used to be a huge Anita Blake fan...then her character just seemed to disappear. I agree with most of the other posters here, she started out as a strong woman who knew who she was and what she wanted in life, and now she is drowned in a pool of men none of who she seems to have real affection for. All sex all the time...does anyone remember the sweet anticipation of that first kiss with Jean Claude in the hotel room? Now you just have to wait for page 3, and 10, and 25...etc...to get meaningless contact between 2 or 3 or 4 bodies. And poor Edward...turned from a magnificent killing machine, to a family guy. I'm afraid I'm done with the Anita Blake series.I do enjoy the Meredith Gentry series, where the sex at least has a purpose. For those of you missing vampires and werewolves, may I suggest the author Kim Harrison and her Rachel Morgan series...absolutely fabulous writing, and she has stayed true to her main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written porn","review":"Ok, I admit it.

Honestly, I'm Not squeamish about the sex, just longing for the charachter, personalities and yes, a cohearant plot. I was hoping that Anita was pregnant in this book--- just to reduce the constant, no longer arousing simply because of the back-to-back redundancy- sex scenes.They don't add to the story or to the figures in the book.So I returned this copy and occasionally pick up some of the good ol' Anita of yore that seemingly ended with Obsidian Butterfly. Come back Ms. Hamilton! Come back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I never thought I'd say this about an Anita Blake story, but this book is boring beyond belief. It's also pure porn, and porn of the worst kind -- it's not particularly erotic, just monotonous. It feels like Hamilton is kitchen sinking Anita, too, with the packing in one preternatural attribute on top of another. The series started off promising, but has gone steadily downhill as the pseudo-smut has pushed out the thriller and/or mystery aspects of the books. I gave up halfway through. It wasn't worth the effort involved in turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reviews for this book are correct!","review":"I have been a fan of the Anita Blake series for 4 - 5 years, and am eager to read each new book. But, I have to agree with most of the reviews written about Danse Macabre. Anita's job, personality, and interaction with her friends were the things that made these books so engaging. The passion and sex in the earlier books were part of the overall plot, and gave insights into Anita, her partner(s), and their relationship. Danse Macabre, however, is a number of sex scenes poorly held together with a very thin plot.If you are a big Anita Blade fan, you will still probably want to read Danse Macabre, but borrow it or wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I used to really look forward to the next installment.. at present, all I can say is that we're still dealing with angst from books ago.Oh, there are still threads of the old Laura K.. just enough to tantalize. Overall, though, the tale is simply an orgy without a storyline. And more than a couple of stars is a stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to do... Anything","review":"This book was a major disappointment. The book had no action what so ever and no plot. I don't mind the \\"love\\" scenes, but this series is just no what it used to be. I started reading the series with Narcissus in Chains, and the action and murder investigations are what caught my eye and made the book a worthwhile and interesting read. I have bought all of the books in the series, and I expected more from Ms. Hamilton. I can only hope that the next book has some action or I fear that this novel will be the mark of a failure in Laurell K Hamilton's career as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"All wangst and no action","review":"The series has gone down hill for awhile, but this one is the final nail in the coffin (pun intended). It's not so much the sex, or the poorly written sex, it's the fact that nothing interesting happens.With every book Anita grows more powerful, nothing can stop her. Where is the fun in reading a book where you know that the heroine is always going to win with a little slap and tickle? I prefer her old way - shooting in out, or knifing it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Anita, sorry everybody who loves this series","review":"If you took the sex out of this(not that I have anything against sex, but this is just obsessive and endless to the point of boring.) it would be about a 100 page terribly disjointed novella with an absolutely awful ending: It just kind of falls away with no resolution at all.Dang Laurell what happened to you.

Once he was introduced, I pretty much stopped reading. There are too many other good books out there to waste any more time on this travesty.I am so done with Laurell. It's her perogative to write erotica, but please don't market it to fans of the Vampire Hunter series. It's has nothing to do with hunting anymore, and the sex is not sexy at all, IMO. I'd put my foolishly purchased copy on e-Bay, but I can't list it with a clear conscious.I can't explain how disappointed I am in this book and the turn that LKH's writing has clearly taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sex, no plot.","review":"I just finished reading Laurel K. Hamiliton's latest, \`Danse Macabre'. I was very disappointed. The novel gave a good sense of her true strengths and weaknesses as a writer. She is good at talk, bad at plot; good at sex, bad at action; good at erotica, bad at depth and breadth of character. The \`story', such as it is, goes: talk about relationships, fight with Richard, have sex, move to another room, talk about relationships, fight with someone else, have sex, move to nearby corridor, fight with Richard, have group sex...repeat, etc. One novel like that could be an accident or bad editing, two or three is a weakness in the writer. I admire her for starting a genre but she now just writes women's porn, and the problem with women's porn is that we're not really into it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth one star, maybe half a star if that","review":"Its been a long time since I read a book that made me repeat, oh brother, in disgust and disbelief. How sad to see this series so far down in the dumps. Its been going downhill for awhile, Micah was a waste of paper, and this is just barely better. I stopped reading LK for awhile, then came across Micah for .25 cents, sad to say that was a total waste of a quarter.

Sad sad sad, I loved the first books. oh well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"I wasn't going to waste my time leaving a review but I figured anyone bored enough to pick up this book should be warned. It was the biggest waste of my time this entire summer, which is an accomplishment, let me assure you. I won't rant and rave, others have pointed out everything I hated plus more and have done so more eloquently than I could hope of doing myself. Just avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down. WAY DOWN.","review":"This book was what made me stop reading Hamilton's work. It features horribly written sex scenes, characters with stupid names, and a plot so devoid of intellect I can't even remember what the book was supposed to be about.Anita has decided to let her freak flag fly, and while this could have led to some interesting character development, Hamilton lets it slide in favor of tacky clothing descriptions.What was once a witty series featuring a character who knew her flaws has de-evolved into another masturbatory ego-stroke for Hamilton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geography 101","review":"This book doesn't have a plot. It has lots of boring sex and supernatural stuff, though. That said, there's no need for a synopsis!There is this, though. Just because no one's mentioned it, Cape Cod is not a city. So Samuel cannot be Master of the City.. of Cape Cod. America's little colonial ancestors sailed there to found a little thing called Plymouth Rock. Which is around Provincetown. Which is technically in (but more like connected to) Mass.

I forced my way through the ponderously long Incubus Dreams (#12), thinking that the reviews couldn't be right but they were accurate. I forged ahead through the meaningless Micah (#13).Now that I wasted more time reading Danse Macabre, I can say definitively that LKH, LOST \\"IT\\".The plot goes nowhere, the ending is the most forced, abrupt, unsatisfying bit of tripe that I've ever read in my life!Synopsis: Everyone wants Anita, Anita screws almost every one, Anita is too powerful, Anita is too weak, there is no resolution to what little plot there is. This book is hardly even a book, and certainly not worth anyone's valuable time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad...","review":"This book was the ending for me. I couldn't even finish it, and I've finished some pretty awful books. I started the series and immediately fell in love with it. After the first 2 books I was singing the praises and recommending the books to everyone! I love a good smut novel from time to time... but somewhere along the line Laurell Hamilton has gone way off base and started writing straight up porn. This book got to the point where there wasn't even a worthy story line to read in between the gratuitous sex scenes, and the sex scenes werent even written very well.Thank you LH for writing this piece of garbage and for ruining the story, I'm embarrassed that I even suggested the series to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last book of the series for me","review":"The series has become boring and little more than badly written porn.

I'd love to just slap the p*** out of him and tell him to get a grip!As for Anita, \\"Oh, I haven't had sex in twelve hours and none of the five men with whom I am in a committed relationship is around, Oh! a random vampire, You will do me now, please.\\"I will not read anymore of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"This is no longer a vampire hunter series. Anita is whiny and self-indulgent. The only character that is even worse is Richard. LKH's writing seems repetitive, not \\"pushing the envelope.\\" This book seems to be more about Anita's hang-ups and circles 'round and 'round and 'round until you just want to skip to the last chapter, just to find out who lives and who dies. No mystery to solve. Just sex (metaphysical and otherwises) and Anita's endless (read: repetitive and boring) struggle with herself. This is probably going to be the last book in this series that I read.

Like the old Wendy's commercial looking for the beef, I'm looking for the plot. I've been an avid reader of LKH's Anita Blake series since the very beginning and I have to say that I am so disappointed. Anita Blake was once a character with substance, now she is only one dimensional. Anita would fly off the page at you now she is just as flat as the paper she is written on. In this book you don't see any of the old Anita Blake, after I read about 300 pages I was at a loss for what the story was about. I hope that LKH can find that old spark she had in the beginning or she is looking at losing a lot of her most loyal readers.

She whines and gripes her way through this book and has to have even the simplest concepts explained to her repeatedly by the \\"big strong men\\" who wait on her hand and foot. Anita cried and moaned over EVERYTHING in this book. There was no plot whatsoever until you had read almost 300 pages and that was wrapped up in less than 100 pages. The dialogue read like something overheard at a junior high dance it was so filled with angst. I have loved Anita and reread all her books over and over until the last four. This series is becoming a huge diappointment. I'm not sure what has happened to Anita Blake, but please Laurell, bring her back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum...","review":"I LOVED the Anita Blake series when it first started.

There's no chemistry between the characters. Reading this book I couldn't help feeling that the writer has come to hate what she does and it shows. There are so many other great alpha female supernatural books out there now that are far better written and much cheaper.

Wow. What a letdown. Sorry, Laurel, it's not about the sex scenes, I'm also a big fan of Angela Knight, and her sex scenes are blowtorch hot! I used to love Anita and her magick, where the hell is it? No more kicking butt with newly discovered powers, no new anything, although I love that Asher now has an animal to call. I never thought I'd be disapointed in an Anita book, but, I'm still hoping the next one with Edward will be back to the real Laurel Hamilton standard for Anita. Not giving up yet.

Once I was done, I found myself thinking about the plot, and realized that there isn't one. Anita does not raise any zombies, execute any vampires, solve any mysteries for the police. The entire book is Anita having sex in different ways, with different men, and either gaining new powers or a deeper understanding of the ones she already has. While the \\"is she or isn't she pregnant?\\" drama was an excellent way to further the relationships she's already in, watching the various men in Anita's life react to her possible pregnancy and her sexcapades does not equal a storyline.The earliest Anita Blake novels had plenty of plot but no emotional depth or interaction; the most recent ones are nothing but finding new men for Anita to sleep with and new ways for her to do it. Did this series peak somewhere around \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\"??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex and Violence","review":"While I still enjoy the Anita Blake series, Hamiltons sellout to the \\"paranormal romance\\" market has only accelreated; as the timelines in her books have become compressed.The total story arc of this novel covers I believe three days, and doesnt do very much to advance the general storyline, or Anitas life. The sex scenes are both excessive and repetitive. Lets face it, theres only so many words to come up with for the same act, adn when you write a new three page sex scene every thid page (seriously, I dont think the book goes for more than about three pages without a sex scene)...I don't mind sex, I rather enjoy it in fact; even in fiction if well done and appropriate to the story; but when the sex becomes the entire book, that's no longer any kind of story it's jsut porn for people who are too repressed to buy it at an adult shop.The characters are still great, but when will she DO SOMETHING with them again, other than kinky sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the cops or zombies?","review":"Oh man I was so excited another Anita Blake book finally comes out and then you start reading and its just sex.

Anita gains more powers....and she can't control them....hrm...yeah.....maybe that was the plot.I'm ok with sex in a book....but usually there's a point to it. Some reason or something that gives a basis for the sex. not to be found here.I'm giving it 1 star because I can't seem to give it less.

Yes, there was always a sexual factor, but it was just one part of the story. Now it has become the entire story and frankly, it's just boring, mechanical sex. Insert tab A in hole B, now it's your turn.A female character who has sex with multiple partners, some of whom she barely knows, one right after the other and sometimes all at once ... that is not a strong, female character. That's a woman who is desperate to be loved and mistakes sex for affection. This is not a role model. This is someone to be pitied. I didn't buy this book.

Each chapter segues into more group sex and more sex some with a little violence or confusion. Don't look for sharp banter or deep meaning subplots between Jean Claude, Anita or Richard ( or any other character for that matter). This book is trite and played out in the sex department -no two ways about it.I'm just going to have to go back and read the beginning of the series again in order to enjoy an Anita Blake book with a plot.Don't waste your money on this one!!

(a fantasy of yours perhaps, certainly a porno movie, but not really a STORY.)Couple of suggestions - cull the men. Kill off a dozen or so, its too cluttered. Less is more.Next get Anita back to her JOB. Remember that piece of business? Interacting with the police now and then? Making money, fighting the Bad Things (I refrain from adding \\"not screwing them\\".)

I am glad Amazon carries this type of DVD, since many of the shows from even the 1950's, have episodes I have not viewed.The I Love Lucy was a \\"lost\\" episode, and was really cute, with some flashbacks to iconic episodes.

I was so excited when my library called to say the book was available for me to pick up. Was I ever sorry! I had read 2 books previously about Madam, and was excited to find that her own family member had written what should be the \\"authoritative\\" biography of her. Since I frequent the library every week with my son, I looked for it there. My review in a nutshell is that the author spent WAY too much time explaining the intricacies of the clubs and \\"movements\\" of the period and not enough time on Ms. Walker's actual life. There are glimpses into her relationships, but I felt Ms. Bundles kept holding back details - maybe because they could be embarassing to the family . . .? At any rate, I was not able to finish. Just got too bored. It read like a college research paper or something. But I guess everyone must make their own decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Inspiring!","review":"On Her Own Ground is not simply a biography, it's a history.

I have always had a thing for sword fights. Then, I loaded the game. Imagine my disappointment when I realised that most of the fighting would be done with wooden swords! I also thought that the movement was slow, and was constantly getting thrashed by every dojo master.After a while, though, I began to adapt to the realistic pace and movements of this game. I have since won the tournaments, own every sword, and yet I still play this game from time to time. It's intersting to me that the first time I play after a long while away from the game, I must again re-adjust to this game.The two main areas that I feel could use improvement are the background sounds(way too repetitve), and the mini-games that boost your attributes(again far too repetitive).Over all, though, this is a deep, realistic fighter that is worth getting to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"bushido your a$$ off!","review":"This game rocks! you like fighten' swords, poke him in the gut and watch him bleed out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"(looks like it cool)","review":"kengo looks like it cool.i played the game and the graphics look like p.s.1.when you fight,your arms are up in the air.if you like games like samurai type games,get onimusha:warlords or tenchu 2 there good games."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I love kengo: master of bushido.

I started out in the thrusting school and grew to love it like it was my home.There are tons of different moves and combos. you can customize your own combos. They are really easy to pull off and you always know it hurt the other guy.Basically the game is fun though. I chose a guy and made up my own story.

I say almost because the guitar player sounds a bit amateurish which is the main reason why I gave this CD a 4 star rating.I could listen to Julia Yates' voice all day long. She has that lilting slightly off key sound in her voice that is innocent and beguiling much in the style of Astrud Gilberto. She makes every one of these songs sound like a gem.Tim Drackert's soloing is quite a bit stiff and unimaginative. He seems to be searching for the notes instead of complementing the melody. Other than that I do have to hand it to his studio recording skills which are top shelf. The audio quality of this CD is near perfect and would be a fine addition to any audiophile's collection.Other than my gripes about Tim's playing, this is a great sounding CD and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Thumbs on a Keyboard","review":"Roger Ladd Memmott is a master of words... he understands the art in writing. He understands the complexity of the many levels of impact every word, every turn of a phrase can provide when the stroke is as masterly as his. Again and again, I caught my breath with wonder. If there was any slight inclusion anywhere in this gem, it was perhaps an occasional overuse of a strong word/image, e.g. \\"switchfrogs.\\" A word with that kind of uniqueness is not so quickly forgotten; a writer should be careful not to use it too often and thus lose that impact. But that's nitpicking. Memmott's wordplay and word artistry, perhaps at times overshadowing the storyline, excite the serious reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"The End Is Near\\" Nut","review":"Another endtime supposed expert on prophecy. In his earlier works Hal Lindsey was one that decided that when Israel became a nation in 1948, that that was a fulfillment of prophecy and since the Bible considers a generation to be approximately 40 years, if you added 40 plus 1948 then you could see that 1988 would either be the start of the endtimes or the second coming of Christ. Also he said that the alignment of planets back in 1982 would denote some endtime activity. Of course none of these things happened but there is still big money to be made writing of these types of things. Most of these type of authors just make excuses or change their explanations of prophecy but they never admit they were wrong or quit writing new money-making books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A five star book!","review":"I am currently an MBA student at Arizona State University, West Campus.

Even if is not on our job description, we all act, in a higher or lower degree, as consultants in our firms. This book makes so much sense! A true consultant wants to really help his/her client and wants to see results and improvements. Mr. Schaffer offers practical ideas how to avoid failure and achieve success. Unlike the wildly spread \\"Trojan horse\\" approach adopted by a large number of consulting companies, this book is advocating \\"rapid-cycle, results-oriented projects designed for client-learning as well as for achievement\\".Every manager should read this book - the ones that do act as consultants should cherish it, the ones that hire consultants, should use it as a guideline."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I bought this CD because I really like the track: \\"Song Of Jabez\\".

The first half of the book is about choosing a bird, caging and nutritional requirements, and grooming (wing and nail clipping). The remainder of the book is a cursory look at basic taming (of wild-caught birds, which isn't really an issue since importing birds has been outlawed for several years), and a brief explanation of how to train. If you want a good resource for training, you'd be better off with a more current book on behavior modification (try Mattie Sue Athan's books, for example). This book is mis-titled, and should not pretend to be a real \\"training\\" book. On the bright side, it has quite a few wonderful pictures of conures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of The Vision","review":"The Vision by Dean Koontz is a suspense thriller. Those who like Dean Koontz will probably enjoy this book. Although if you haven't read any of Dean Koontz's, like I hadn't, don't make this your first. It's the story of a woman who can see visions of murders before they happen. After help solving a crime she sees, and feels another vision that she knows will change her life. Now it's up to herself and her husband to stop the killer before he finds her. There are rules most authors have to try and throw a reader off from knowing how th book ends. By following these rules Dean Koontz practically gives away the ending. To sum up this book it would be that it's too predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivates you!","review":"Loved this book.

I'm absolutley positive that any young adult would love this book. It has a great plot and the characters are described in fine detial.

If you are looking for a wonderful mystrey please pick up a copy of this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful, ridiculous book","review":"SPOILER ALERT: If you enjoy books about young girls being raped with animals then Dean Koontz has the story for you. This is not about a psychic who predicts her own murder. It is about a perverted horror which took place and a disturbed young woman who has supressed the violent incident. It is disgusting. After listening (I used audible books on my iPod) to Your Heart Belongs to Me, The Vision sounded similiar. Very disappointed and I deleted the material from my player. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable","review":"Features the worst red herring I've ever read. I only finished it because I could not believe that an acclaimed author would write something so painfully predictable. I was wrong--Koontz would and he did. An absolute waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Koontz's best effort","review":"Although it has its good points, \\"The Vision\\" is not Dean Koontz's best effort. The plot is cliched, the characters are flat, and the book is filled with long passages of dialogue by itself, without descriptions of what the characters are doing as they speak. The scene where Alan is torturing Mary as a child is graphic and upsetting. The only good thing about the book are the passages offering psychological insight into Mary's mind. Overall, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a NUTTY Villian!","review":"I just finished The Vision and I will say it is like all Koontz novels. A mystery, killings, repressed memories and a good twisted ending. I enjoyed the Vision, but I didn't feel it was his best effort. I kind of figured out who the killer was, and thier behavior was just way out there. Along with Whispers this has got to be one of the sickest villians Koontz has put together.In this outting a woman sees visions of a killinig and tries to lend her hand to the police. When a set of killings start to get too close to home our hero must use all her powers to solve the crimes. But careful who you look for, they just might be someone close to you or not. Fun story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"The Vision reminded me a lot of my first Koontz read,Whispers. The main character has visions of murdersbefore they happen. She is called on to help the policebut before long the visions take a personal turn. InWhispers, we have the eerie whispers that torment thebad guy. The main character in this story has her owntorment. I won't say anymore and ruin it. Koontz keptthe suspense high and me turning pages to find outwho the murderer was. Though this plot line of psychicshelping the police is done quite a bit now, back whenThe Vision was written I don't think it was. Even if itwas, it wasn't done like Koontz does it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, good read","review":"This book is an old favorite of mine. I was thrilled to find it so i could read it again.

A striking supernatural crime drama evolves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it a Zero","review":"Spoiler alert at the end of reviewdon't waste your time. I can't believe I like Dean Koontz. If this was the first of his books I ever read I'd avoid him like the plague. Too graphic, too disgusting, and quite frankly I'm surprised he hasn't been torn apart by what he wrote here. We do not need such detailed scenes he has written. I enjoy good horror and suspense, but do NOT need to read such disturbing images, regardless if the author thinks it's necessary to paint the evil of this one character, it's absoutely unnecessary and disgusting.I'm reading along, la de da, and then wham! Rape by and with children, and with animals, and scenes involving drinking menstural blood.I wish I could take back the time I spent reading this book. These scenes, very graphic and detailed, come in the last 20 pages. Beware. They are not only disgusting, but very disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine Tingly, heart pounding, Koontz does it again","review":"One of my faviorite books.

Deen Koontz is my all time faviorite author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not really great","review":"This book was indeed one of Koontz's earliest mass published works.Still, it showed a lot of vivid realism and a level of fantasy that few could accurately reach.The main character is both a heroine and a tragic, pitiable figure.This is part of what makes Koontz so dam good, he is able to make you love and pity or love and hate or love and distrust the protagonist.It was a pretty quick read but an entertaining story nevertheless.If you are a big Koontz fan, then this is certainly worth a read.If you are a casual reader who likes crime and mystery then you will likely enjoy this as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was too predictable","review":"I read 2 chapters of this book and knew who committed all the murders. I was so dissapointed that I put the book down and didn't finish it. I am a HUGE Dean Koontz fan and I own almost every one of his books(With the exception of some of the hard to find ones) This is one of only two books that I was dissapointed in by Mr. Koontz.

Afterall, I was financially supporting him on my $15 an hour job. What would happen to him if I wasn't there to support him. I made up excuses as to why he wouldn't work.

If you're going to do it, might as well do it right!I'm actually very surprised. The instructions made it so incredibly easy to install and use the unit and the water that came out didn't have that 'tap water taste' to it.

Also, the filtered water flow seems a little faster than the previous model. We don't really use the flavor feature, so I can't comment on that. I'm hoping that the manufacturer listened to past complaints and tried to address them with this new design.Update: After two weeks of use, it has started falling off the faucet a few times a day, so much for new and improved.

The Owners Manual, which you can see only after opening the package, clearly states \\"The faucet filter is not intended to purify water.

Sadly though these people didnt just receive a bad unit, seems like 90% or more have these leaking problem. I didnt even get to enjoy one cup of water, didnt even get to try the juice. =[ I installed this thing & its like I installed a waterfall, this thing leaked from every possible place, you know what I should have taken a picture. It was serioiusly that ridiculous, like the sprinkler cap they put on fire hydrants.

At first, it worked great. Good tasting water, convenient and easy to use, looked decent on the faucet. All of this changed afer about 2 months when it began to leak. I thought maybe we had over-tightened when we first attached it to the faucet and stripped some threads so I bought a second one and tried again. I will say they are consistent because I got the same results with the second one. Not only did it drip from the back of the unit, it began spraying out of the front. It was no fun getting a shower everytime you wanted a drink of water.Save your money and buy a pitcher or dispenser. I finally bought the PUR DS-1800Z 2-Stage Water Dispenser and have been very satisfied with it.

It is a very cheap looking system and turned me off ever buying a faucet mount system again. It takes a bit of force to use the Flavor Option button that within a few months loosened the seal again and caused it to leak more.If you are fortunate enough not to have a leak, I can see how this can be a good system. The water did taste cleaner and the flavored water also tasted good. The filters last for quite awhile, and switching filters is quite simple.If you are looking for a long term solution, I wouldn't recommend this. It seems cheaper and I would be impressed if it would last more than two years.We are no longer using our system because the entire point of the purchase was to encourage us not to buy bottled water. That is difficult to accomplish when it leaks water every time you use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best faucet water filter","review":"It's super easy to mount to the faucet, and works very well, no spills or leackeage.

The voices and dialogs are still some of the best I've heard in an adventure game.

You should either buy this or TSOL if what you're looking for is 80's music.The best songs are Everything Sux, Sick-O-Me, Thank You, and When I Get Old, but the whole thing is really rad.

This DVD, thanks to the \\"Netrebko\\" phenomenal package and Paterson's intelligent directing, brought opera to the masses who knew nothing about opera. The more I watch it the more I like it for its intended purpose and artistic value. No wonder, in Europe, this DVD outsold Beyonce's and Spears'. Classical music, and especially opera, is going through hard times competing for the entertainment dollar. What Netrebko and Paterson did is unique, they deserve credit, and we need more of the same. This venue is the best marketing tool I've ever seen to generate interest in opera among common folks and especially youth breathing and living through music videos. This DVD of five choreographed-MTV style-popular arias deserves 5 stars. The single star on top was entered accidentally.Constantine A.

The book is brief, reads easy but generally does a good job of telling it like it was back then and in that place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I initially bought this book because my grandmother grew up in that time and place (Pennsylvania, circa 1910). This book offers an incredible glimpse into the lives of the men and boys (and mules) who worked in the coal mines. This book provided a riveting and sobering look at that period in history, and helped me envision the world my grandmother grew up in. Once I started looking at it, I couldn't put it down. It is an informative and moving account and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"It was a good read. Really takes you on a History lesson into the past, on what it was like working in a coal mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car Seat Covers","review":"I had to return this item. I typed in what type of vehicle the seat covers were for and this item came up. It did not fit and in fact it was for a different type of seat all together. It was a Christmas present and that made the situation even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"While the descriptions of quilt making are fascinating, I found myself questioning the characterization. Personalities tend to adapt their outlooks to make a sweet ending without credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun:)))","review":"Oh, when we jump to conclusions and let our emotions rule, we eventually find that we rue the day. Thru quilting, we tend to talk about things we sometimes keep inside. \\"The Quilters's Apprentice\\" The players see their way to carry on with their lives, and forgive those whom they love."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Don't have to be a Quilter","review":"The book is set in a quilting \\"camp\\", and much of the action involves quilting, but it is a book about building and maintaining frienships. The characters are well drawn, each with their own quirks and foibles; some nicer than others. You will learn a lot about quilting, about relationships, and wish it hadn't ended when you reach the last page. Luckily, this is the first of a series, so you can read more about these people in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better...","review":"As a person who someday would like to learn how to quilt, I enjoyed the scenes in which Sarah was being taught. The flashback scenes were also poignant. But, this book truly suffered from a lack of depth. The characters were not well developed enough, and though you desired to know more about them, by the end of the book, you were still left wondering. The ending wrapped up in a neat, yet predicatable package."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Please","review":"I loved the book and have now gone onto the second of her Elm Creek novels. I can see I will read them all. Very engaging and as a quilter it was great to picture the blocks they used as well as enjoy the story. You do not need to be a quilter to get involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't able to finish reading The Quilter's Apprentice","review":"While enjoying the Elm Creek Quilt series overall, I was disappointed with The Quilter's Apprentice. I downloaded it to my Kindle twice and both times was unable to get past page 1551. I returned the first download for a refund and deleted the 2nd after doing everything that Amazon told me to try and still not being able to view the rest of the book on my Kindle. While the book was intriguing up to the point that I could read, I would have to say I was very disappointed in the overall performance of this particular download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mending Fences","review":"I enjoyed the process of story telling as the quilt was assembled and new life returned to the manor.

But disappointing in story line could have been so much more. Sorry to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written \\"can't put down until finished\\" book","review":"This book is not only for the quilting enthusiast but also for anyone who's experienced family conflicts.

What more can I say, except \\"when's the next one coming?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Quilter's Apprentice: A Novel","review":"Although this book was rated well by other readers and quilters, I found it to be only a 'nice story' written at the level of middle-school readers. I kept waiting for the story content to have some depth and hoped that the conversations would be more meaningful, but that didn't happen. Since I was so disappointed with the book, I couldn't recommend it to any of my quilting friends. I donated it to the local library with a note that it was for those who read at the 6th to 8th grade level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awkward but good","review":"This first book in the Elm Creek series is not the best writing I've seen, but the story is fun and it's a pleasurable book. I found it difficult to put it down, and was anxious to read the next book in the series (which is better than the first, in both writing technique and style). I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves quilting and light reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson on life is in there.......","review":"As stated before a slow start with this book but it gets good if you stick with it. A nice warm story that teaches us a life lesson in regards to holding a grudge. Predictable direction for the story? Sometimes, but so what it was a good read. I did not want to put it down! This book made me smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great escape","review":"An enjoyable book - it was an easy read with a delightful story and reminded me of the Mitford series. The characters were interesting (but not too complex) and you were able to relate to their lives. The whole background of quilting was a wonderful touch! A delightful and enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but Sweet","review":"Sarah McClure and her husband Matt move to a small Pennsylvania town for his new landscape architecture job. One of his clients is the prickly Mrs. Compson, who offers the still-jobless Sarah a position cleaning up her mansion for sale. Sarah asks that the old master quilter give her lessons in addition to her compensation. As they work on Sarah's quilt, Mrs. Compson tells her family's history of love, jealousy and betrayal. Sarah comes across as a bit whiny and the ending is very predictable, but still a good read for a rainy afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject, weak plot.","review":"Although I love quilts and quilting, I found this novel to be shallow and predictable. I almost felt like I had picked up something my middle-school daughter might read--flat characters and obvious plot turns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eckkkk. What a waste!","review":"Just wanted to drop a note to let those of us who enjoy reading interesting about our favorite hobby/passion/obsession know that this book is unnaturally boring. I kept reading it, hoping that it would get better, but the dialogue (which comprises about 80% of the book) lacks realism, depth or excitement! The character interaction is stiff and not well done at all. The plot seems to be only half developed, while the points that could have been expanded only glanced in passing. I like to think a good book (dialogue especially) is something that can be read out-loud, and sound natural. But the rigid grammer and the stiff use of the language leads you to the fact that this is an incredibly difficult read...It just keeps going on and on and on and on....without purpose. I will try the next book in the series, but unless you have a few days to kill and are okay with regretting your reading choices, I do not recommend this book - even to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing","review":"Would have been good to have pictures of mentioned quilts. I am not a quilter so Ihad no mental picture to hook to the story"},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad and....","review":"Well, this book is hard to rate. If you are a quilter or want to be a quilter it can be interesting as it introduces the reader to various aspects of quilting albeit a bit too detailed and, at the same time, not detailed enough.The plot, while slow moving, does carry the reader along to the end.The characters, now that is what is suspect. The young married couple, Sarah and Matthew sound like 16 year olds in their dialogue and yet they have been out of college for several years and both have professional degress. In fact, Sarah, is an accountant although she is sophmoric in her speech pattern. Mrs. Compson, starts off curmudgeonly but evolves into a genuinely likeable character. Nevertheless, the dialogue between her and the \\"children\\" are a distraction. Trite, hackneyed.... If the reader has time to overlook the dialogue shortcomings, then the book is interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quilter's Apprentice","review":"I really enjoyed this first installment in the quilter's series. The characters come alive from the first page. It makes me want to go out and learn how to quilt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Satisfying","review":"As a quilter, I loved this book. I was not ready to part with the characters. I especially enjoyed the parallels of the chapters unfolding to the sampler quilt block chosen. My only criticism was that the ending was wrapped up just a little too perfectly for my taste. I hope to be able to visit with the Tangled Web Quilters again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This story is a pleasure trove of tantalizing information.","review":"It brings to the forefront the difficult art of quilting and makes the prices of handmade quilts a bargain. I loved that I've found someone who could write a story without gutter language and vivid sex and or gore scenes. It excited me and with each page I read, brought to mind my good friend, Deena, who is a quilter. I now understand her feelings for quilting even more than I did before. The Quilter's Apprentice teases me into feelings of wanting to make a quilt of my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine first novel about quilting and relationships","review":"Quilting plays a strong role in this novel, and serves also as a metaphor for the human need to build links, to form a community out of mutual concerns and interests. In the end, the book is about friendship and family - the links that tie us together and help us get through life.A very good read, only flawed by being too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pain to clean","review":"We found this to be comfortable for our child as she went from infant to toddler. However, it is a pain to clean. It is very difficult to get in by the armrests and in the seat cushion. Once we removed the cushion it never snapped on correctly. The cushion did not hold up well at all. It ripped in several places, and the replacements are expensive. A higher end cushion is almost half the prce of the chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"Bad points: 1) can't lower/raise your child in relation to the tray b/c the tray is attached to the chair. Only the chair raises and lowers; not the tray. Our 6 mo. old is swallowed up in this chair--and she's big--18 lbs. 26 inch baby. But I can't get her high enuf to where she can put her hands on the tray. She feels swallowed up by it and hates it. 2) difficult to clean--gotta dig down in the nooks and crannies. A pain, and grimy food in there makes the chair smell--gross! 3) big gap between kid and tray only exacerbates food-in-the-cranny problem. It falls on kid and tray doesn't catch it. 4) kind of complicated to fold up. You have to follow a certain order of buttons, and it's just like, when will they come up with a 1 touch system? Good point: it folds up so you can tuck it away in kitchen or behind door. I would NOT RECOMMEND this chair. Stay simple and CHEAP! Buy used! From a parent with two kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrapped Up in this Unusual Story","review":"With beautiful imagry and story telling, Elizabeth Hay narrates a truly divine story about unrequited love and passion in art. I recied this book from ... two days ago and have ripped through it, being truly enveloped in Hay's durt bowl recreation. Norma Jean is one of the most interesting and truly whole characters I have encountered in contemporary fiction. I've been telling everyone I know to buy this book. It's a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfyingly good","review":"Readers looking for a lively heoroine and a romance with a happy ending will be disappointed, but readers willing to let the story unfold will be rewarded. Yes, the man in question is a thorough-going dog, but the real story here is how Norma (the younger, troubled, unbeautiful sister), rescues her life from a disastrous childhood and adolescence. The settings (Depression era Canada, post-war New York) are rich in atmosphere, and Norma's gradual discovery of her artistic abilities held me all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE HAS BEEN A MURDER, AND THE VICTIM IS LITERATURE!!","review":"I listened to this book on CBC radio's, Between The Covers. I followed it for 3 weeks, and it was terrible!! It's about this girl who's obsessed with her sister's beau (it starts in the 1930s). She's a very selfish little girl, she steals her sister's letters from Maurice, her beau and pretends they are hers. The book jumps from one decade to the other way too fast. She's nine at the start, then 17, then 30, 40, 50... it just goes too fast.Listen, Honey, if you want to read a long and boring book about an arrogant and conceited guy who knocked up an odd and naive little girl who spends the rest of her boring and miserable life stalking him, then go for it. But I don't recommend it. Minus 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy is way ahead of the pack","review":"I literally stumbled across this book at a friend's house. When I picked it up I asked if I could read it and am damn glad I did!Robert Cooper has a very nice style and that made for an easy read. From his story of running home from school on the first day to the many stories he imparts about lessons from his grand fathers, it transitions well. I believe that a book is worth its price if you can get one morsel from it, his more than meets that criterion. 4 Stars because I feel that some parts seemed to be oddly random, but that was the exception. And, truthfully, while I never expected any health advice, he details an exercise that simply involves breathing for the abdominals that has produced incredible personal results. Kudos Mr. Cooper!Suffice to say I am now anxiously awaiting his \\"Get Out of Your Own Way\\" in the mail any day now.In a day and age where people are trying to bilk you and jumping on the metaphysics band wagon, this is not just fluff.Again, Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, motivational, but not exactly the tools you need","review":"I think of this book as gas for my inner combustion engine. It's fuel, it turns the ignition key, but until something else starts to push the pedal to the floor, the car only idles forward. And, as we all know, you don't idle forward very fast.My recommendation would be to read this book to inspire you to make a change. It will make you think hard about your life to this point, and what you're going to think about your life when you're coming to the end of it. Then use other, more practical books to achieve the kind of change you want. I recommend \\"How to Be, Do, or Have Anything\\" by Boldt (which is much more practical than the title lets on), \\"Overachievement\\" by Eliot and \\"Getting Things Done\\" by Allen.This book is also good for dipping into from time to time for a little burst of energy. If you want to wring every last drop of life out of your time on earth, I recommend you put this one on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Many Wonderful Tools!","review":"Can you say POWER PACKED? There is so much meat in this title it is best to read slowly so you can truly utilize and practice each technique.I especially appreciated the scientific facts which are integrated in a non-intimidating manner.

No one can argue with trying to get more out of life. But this book suffers from a lack of reasoning.For example, on page 55 the author says that he wished when people said \\"hello\\" they would \\"honor the greatest in each other\\" and that \\"every human being has greatness inside.\\" But just two pages later he admits \\"he who praises everybody praises nobody.\\"Perhaps the author was thinking with his heart or gut, two other organs he believes as capable of thought as the brain.For those who really want to unlock the \\"other 90%\\" in their lives, I'd recommend \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" by Ayn Rand instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, Great Concepts","review":"This was an easy read, with great concepts.

The combine catchy pop-punk melodies, thrashy guitars riffs, and a great punk voice to bring a sound that combines great elements of all punk genres. All the songs are great, and are more meaningful than most punk. The second track \\"John\\" is a great tune, and it's ending is a finale that will bring tears to the eyes of true fans of melodisism, \\"Daddy\\" is another great song that tackles serious subjects, and the end track \\"A.D.D\\" is probably one of the top ten punk songs this reviewer has ever heard (I know my music, and I've heard alot of punk in my days).

What I liked about it was having 4 joints instead of the usual 3. It says it includes a \\"monitor mount\\". What it has is a screw - so you can screw in a camera. I cannot find any adapter - for instance a VESA100 adapter with a screw-in. So how can you actually put a monitor on this???? In the picture it has 2 black rectangles beneath the monitor. I don't know what those are - but they were not included. The one page 'instructions' that come with it point to the last joint with the screw as the monitor mount. Sell it for what it is a camera mount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, Defective edition","review":"This is a very interesting novel, but I gave it one star because I am rating the edition instead. Lindisfarne Books should be razed by fire and the editors suspended over a slow barbecue. They went to great lengths to provide the book with an arresting cover, interesting typeface for the chapter title, and lively (if uninformed) review notices on the back cover, but were so slipshod in their copy editing that they omitted words from the author's text in the first sentence of the first chapter! I kid you not, this book starts with a phrase, not a sentence! Fortunately it is about living your life over again, so the complete sentence reappears correctly on page 162 at the beginning of chapter 26. But such errors are unacceptable and unforgiveable in an editor, and can lead in time to a loss of the complete text itself, as any classical scholar can tell you, if you can find any these days. Don't buy this edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So So...","review":"I was expecting something great from this book - it came up far short. Consistent with the other reviews, there were quite a few editing errors that I found in this book (which does not say much because I am not very big on grammar). While the last few pages were rewarding, overall the book was quite drab. Do yourself a favor however, read the back cover of the book where the guy who directed Groundhog Day comments on the book - it is an amazing commentary and will sum the entire book up in a paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and disappointing","review":"I tried to like this book. Everyone thinks her garden maintenance book is the be-all, end-all.This book is just dull. The designs are very uninspired and many of the photographs were amateurish and poorly lit. I learned more about garden design from Dianne Benson's fabulous book \\"Dirt\\" and she had maybe 5 black and white photographs. The plant lists in Disabato-Aust's book are okay, but any number of books list plants by foliage color, flower color etc. This woman uses way too much rudbeckia. Isn't that considered an invasive weed? It should be banned.Ditch this over-priced, over-promoted beast of a book and check out \\"Shocking Beauty\\" by Thomas Hobbs. This is one of the most beautiful gardening books out there and you'll learn how to use your own eye and instincts to create exquisite and memorable gardens, some of which are simply about foliage and more beautiful than any conventional perennial border."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The author's first book was unique, and provided much needed information unavailable from any other source. It is a much thumbed resource. By contrast, this book is an also-ran in the field of planting design. The photographs are uninspiring, the text too general and vaque, and some of the information in the tables on plant requirements is just plain wrong and contradicts advice from the RHS in Wisley. As a consequence, the authors image is damaged and that is a great shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it.","review":"Some have complained that this is a mirror of what happened in reality when Cortez sailed for the Americas.

A seeker encounters a series of on-purpose people who give him advice and guidance about how to change his life. Essentially he is told to prioritize his \\"wants\\" and decide on a \\"core purpose\\" for his life. The wants are of course subordinate to the core purpose, which is a way of serving others. For example: \\"I serve others by showing them the beauty of nature.\\"Once the seeker has established his wants, put them in order of importance, and decided on his core purpose, which has a religious basis (it is God's purpose for him), he is on his way to becoming an on-purpose person. Throughout the book, the on-purpose persons use the metaphor of tennis - oddly enough.The book has a cultish quality but little substance. It is similar to a typical (but old-fashioned) book on how to organize your life. These books invariably advised the reader to have a goal, prioritize his desires, and so on.I wouldn't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"If you're looking to waste your time reading almost 70% of a book before it makes a hard right turn into Jesusville; then this is the book for you.

Nothing new here, it is a rehash of other authors: Covey, Canfield etc...The \\"tournament\\" idea is something taken directly from \\"The Power of Focus\\" by Jack Canfield. One big difference between the other authors and this book is the \\"parable\\" approach. While it could potentially make for interesting reading (perhaps like the Celestine Prophecy) the author is not a good writer/story teller. So enduring the story makes the message difficult. The final thing is that even if you do like the book and want to use the authors approach, the forms (free and for sale) for creating/discovering your purpose available at his external website are .exe files-not pdf. Sorry mac, kindle, iPad, iPhone, it seems the author's purpose does not include helping you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The number one stressor for people is not having a life purpose.

This book was given to me and I am purchasing one for my best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really helpful","review":"this is more cheesy than \\"who moves my cheese\\". I gave a try because it was free with amazon prime. It is written for kids. It lacks intellectual challenge. Life is not about flowcharts, following scripts. This is totally opposite to following and living in the moment. Planning your day, choosing \\"with your thoughts\\" who you are, and everything else in the book, it sounds to me the best way to actually distance yourself from who you really are.I does not help me at all. Let's stop forcing ourselves to be \\"someone\\" and have a purpose. Life has no meaning, it has no purpose, and that's the beauty of it. Those trying to find its meaning and purpose just don't know how to connect with it.It may help others, those that need a cooking recipe to follow their dreams and make sense of their lives.Sorry not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This book is painful to read to anyone reading above a fourth grade level. I don't know why people seem to love these badly written motivational fables -- if there's a positive message in here, there's no chance I'm going to hear it above the deafening sucking noise of the writing. It reads like Eckhart Tolle fanfiction by a high schooler. If you love this, by all means buy The Energy Bus, another mind-numbingly bad fable presenting life advice in cringe worthy fictional format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Personal Life or Running Your Business","review":"The concepts in this book are presented in such an inspiring way, that you start making little changes in your daily life almost automatically. But, they are also so practical, described so well, and even come with concrete steps to follow, that the suggestions can even be life-changing.

Now that I've started my own law firm, it is helping me to stay calm while being productive and focused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding classic","review":"This book is one of those \\"must-read\\" classics.

Weird. Then Tomoya is in love with Sakura like when Tomoyo's mother was in love with Sakura's mother. Also one of Sakura's friends gets an engagement ring from their teacher!

Pretty good company. His music is every bit as interesting, beautiful & well orchestrated as you might expect from the above associations. His music has been forgotten for a variety of reasons, none of which have anything to do with the quality of his music. First, he moved repeatedly, Germany to Switzerland to Austria & then to Saxony. He was also a difficult personality with few if any friends. He spent his last years in an insane asylum and finally, most of his music, which had never been published, was destroyed in the fire bombing of Dresden during the Second World War. This cd is a real find foir anyone interested in late German Romantic music. He wrote a good deal of music, but apparently little still exists. This cd was recorded in 2002 so I can only hope that if enough copies of this cd sells, more of his music will be recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs caller ID otherwise works great","review":"Got it to do con calls in my home office. works great. wish it had caller id in case a call comes in, now i'm not sure who it is calling. sound quality is excellent. would buy it again.

We always worked at a table no longer than 8 feet, so the furtherest anyone was away from the phone was 4 feet and callers couldn't hear us. We could hear them great at the table, but for over $300, I expect a product that works and lives up to its product description.

But I think that even if I had read this back in the day, it still would have confused me.I liked the characters. The dialogue was good, too. But unfortunately, I had trouble keeping up with all the crazy head hopping that was taking place. We jump from each character's head to the other constantly, and sprinkled within were many little flash backs or allusions to things that happened in the past. (or very, very long explanations of things)I also didn't like how our hero's mistress seemed so nice and fond of him, that I felt sorry for her, knowing that by the end it wouldn't be she who would end up with the man.For an example of an excellently written regency, check out Jenna Jones, Elizabeth Fairchild, or Julia Quinn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marcy Rothman is one of the best Romance authors","review":"I was thoroughly delighted by this book and I have returned to it many times to reread.

The style of music that they chose for this album rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Extra Gravity... It grows on you","review":"The first 4 or 5 times I listened to this album, I was very disappointed. It sounded like it could be Disc 2 to Nina's A Camp solo album. But being the huge Cardigans fan that I am, I stuck with it and eventually, I began to see the tremendous artistry that this band and this album posseses. It seems with each new release, The Cardigans expand and mature. Super Extra Gravity is no different. The sound is a bit more basic than previous albums. Nina's vocals are very powerful and piercing at times (in a good way). Certainly a vast evolution from her vocals on the earlier Cardigans recordings. The melodies at times are very haunting. This album will really force you to listen closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although I am a Cardigan's fan","review":"I was not thrilled with this album.

Not giving up on them, though, just hope that better things are on the horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have listened to and enjoyed the Cardigans since I spent a year in Finland in 98 when Gran Turismo came out and was overplayed like crazy. I was shocked at how good their 2004 album, Long Gone Before Daylight was. And I was equally surprised at how much this album sucked. The annoying thing is that I can't put my finger on why. It is just boring, not well developed and uninteresting. The one exception is the song Good Morning Joan which is excellent and probably belongs on the Long Gone Before Daylight album. I was so excited to buy this album because of how good Long Gone Before Daylight was, damn what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my!","review":"Im a big fan of the band but this cd sucked.

The truth about ninjas has been covered, hidden, and confused for centuries. To make matters worse, pop culture makes them into fireball and lightening throwing, water walking, flying, invisible super spies/assassins. What I like about this book is that Steven Turnbull has been writing about Far Eastern history for 3 decades. Knows his stuff and does his homework. Combine that with the fact that he sticks to historical accounts, quoting authentic Japanese historical documents. The sense I got after finishing this book, is that I now have a clearer picture of where the ninja fit into the greater history of Japan. He's not a ninjutsu expert, so don't expect intimate knowledge or secrets, but he is a historian and portrays the history as accurately as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief, Boring, and Overpriced","review":"While this work is trying to be a historical account of real ninjutsu practitioners, it's ultimately disappointing due to its slim size and extremely dry prose style.

I rented it many years ago on VHS from a library. The life of the twentieth century composer is explored through narrative, old photos, musical exerpts and ravishing scenic segments showing his native Finland. More than a standard documentary, this film really brings to life the man with all his frailties and great achievements. The movie opens with a performance of the Andante Festivo conducted by the composer late in life - that performance sets the tone for the entire film - inspired, troubled, nostalgic and deeply felt. The musical performances by the likes of Vladimir Ashkenazy are superb. All in all, a moving and revealing experience. For those interested in such movie-making, try also \\"Roots\\" on the Hungarian composer Bela Bartok. Both are highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope they take a Second Edition version","review":"It is simply magnificent!I hope that a second edition revision is madeThis HAS to be included in the second edition"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Signifiant Improvement on Music&Arts Remastering","review":"This disc is contains two great performances of Rachmaninoff Piano Concertos #2 and #3.

I read this book in galley and had the same reaction to it that the Booklist reviewer had. That it was a story about the teacher, not the child. Understandable since the author was a teacher and has a very strong perspective of the classroom. I liked elements of the story (such as Sahara's letters), but felt that the children spent more time observing their teacher's actions than much else. Despite the ostensible child point of view this is really a book about a caring and creative teacher (which, judging by her debut book, is true of the author too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"2stars for language","review":"I liked it, but a kids book shouldn't have any of those words in it.

The unconventional Madame Poitier or Ms. Pointy, as the class calls her, is able to reach not only Sahara, but also Darrell, the class troublemaker, several ESL students, Sahara's shy cousin, and practically every character mentioned including Sahara's mother!

I found Seane's tone of voice and manner of speaking to be jarring and abrasive. Even though her lectures emphasize the spiritual elements of yoga, I feel that her practice is extremely focused on the physical. I found that even when I was in a flow of one breath per movement, she was still going too quickly for my taste. I felt like I had to take short, shallow breaths to keep up with her!

Most videos on the market focus soley on the physical aspect of practice, but Seane takes it a step further.

The book covers the basics of a high school chemistry course but unlike most textbooks or internet resources, it tries to break down and simplify chemistry to make it more manageable. For example, I was having a difficult time explaining Lewis Dot structures or even finding a good resource for understanding it on the web. The author did a very good job of simplifying the approach whereby the generation of these structures made sense. The periodic table that is included in the book is detachable and also helpful.

Nevertheless the Jews of North Africa escaped the fate of those in Europe.The most fascinating portion of this book details the homegrown anti-Semitism of the French administration of North Africa, a right wing and socialist phenomenon that began before World War Two and lasted after the liberation by the U.S army. Of interest also is the treatment of Jews in the Italian sector.Seth J.

The profiles alone are enough to keep the reader interested -- and spurred on to further research. But Hower draws out interesting and valuable personal traits from each person -- traits worth applying to your life, whether or not you are a \\"leader\\".While Hower's writing style is not highly polished, his conversational style is engaging. And the content is better treated by his less glossy approach.Reading this book is time well-spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a GREAT tool for all actresses!","review":"As an actress, I've spent many hours thumbing through monologue books that featured what seemed to be exactly three plays, repeated over and over again. These were, in general, The Diary of Anne Frank, The Miss Firecracker Contest, and Agnes of God. Now, all of these are good plays, but trust me, EVERYONE DOES THEM at auditions. That's why this book is so great! First of all, instead of merely giving you excerpts of plays, this book gives you each play in entirety. This is important because good acting requires that one reads the entire play, not merely a few paragraphs. Also, the range of characters is liberating, ranging from very old to pre-teen parts. Anyway, the long and the short of it is that using two monologues from this book got me into a B.F.A. Acting program. Obviously, it's not a magic book that will cause casting directors to gasp with delight and fall into your arms, but it is a useful tool, and far superior to many other books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product, not supported by anyone I can find","review":"I am trying to resolve my issue for this printer with the seller and this is not intended to be feedback for them.

Avoid this Vestale at all costs - it did not convince me as Spontini's masterpiece largely in lieu of the dismal sound quality, appallingly poor orchestral playing (although Leyla Gencer sounded magnificent) and not so much of the lackthereof in its intrinsic music value.

The author uses dialogue between the characters and invents some improbably scenes: Nero poisons Titus' dog out of spite, Titus meets Saints Peter and Paul in Rome )of course, he's sympathetic) and has a romantic trist with Queen Berenice on Capri, where he has gone for a rest.Domitian is portrayed as a spoiled brat, then a senseless monster. The book has little historical value and is sometimes written like a romance story. Almost all of the information included about the \\"good Titus\\" and \\"bad Domitian\\" was been proven false a long time ago.

She is an intelligent girl with lofty dreams and a great personality. The reader is rooting for her from the very first page and feels her sense of confinement when she realizes that her family cannot hold together without her. The book also gives a very positive picture of what it means to be an intelligent woman, and to be proud of that. Even today, teenage girls feel that intelligence is an attribute to be hidden away for fear of offending someone or becoming unpopular.It is difficult to sell a historical to a YA audience, but this title is worth the effort.

It sounds a little like Anne of Green Gables crossed with a real-life murder mystery. What's not to like?The book is very well written. I loved the word duels. But I didn't like the book overall, because I strongly disagree with the theme. It is dark, darker than I would have wanted to read as a young adult. The theme is that marriage and motherhood are soul-killing. This theme is supported by graphic depictions of a difficult birth, a horrible depiction of breastfeeding and postpartum depression, and a dearth of decent gentlemen. Mothers who are happy in motherhood should be forewarned before passing this book to their daughters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but prefer the \\"Roses\\" ....","review":"I discovered Jennifer Connelly's incredible writing talent with \\"The Tea Rose\\" and \\"The Winter Rose;\\" both novels have become favorites of mine which I always recommend to friends/family.

Therefore, I was unprepared for the writing style which was so different from the \\"Rose\\" books, and did find it more gearer to a younger audience than my other two favorites of hers. I'm not saying it wasn't meant for adults as well, just that it didn't compare on a literary level to the two \\"Rose\\" novels.

It's a romance, a mystery, a period piece set in the Adirondack Mountains at the turn of the 20th century. Open-hearted 16-year-old Mattie Gokey is an imaginative, perceptive girl, with a budding talent for writing, who notices things which often escape those around her. When she discovers a bundle of letters, the plot is set in motion, as she strongly identifies with the young woman who wrote the letters and finds parallels in her own life.Donnelly provides the reader with a richly authentic description of the era, with its limited vision of women's roles. Page by page, you will discover with Mattie the fate of the letter writer as you savor this richly satisfying novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible- Worst Book Ever","review":"This is the worst book ever!

I just simply loved this book -- Jennifer Donnelly is amazingly gifted, writes from her heart, yet with total understanding of farming life, the Adirondacks, the coming-of-age of young women in that time and place and the story which inspired her \\"An American Tragedy\\" by Theodore Dreiser.Moreover, she writes with deep feelings and yet is totally literary as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Northern Light was the best book ive EVER READ!","review":"A Northern Light is a magnificant story of a young girl who is faced with many choices in her life.

When A NORTHERN LIGHT falls open, you,the reader, will fall in. Descriptions of this book by previous reviewers, while excellent and accurate, still do not prepare you for the sheer delight and pleasure of reading this story. While it has been classified as a Young Adult novel, as it does contain some language and situations, every word is absolutely true to the character who is speaking or being spoken of. I urge every teenage girl to read this, then pass it on to her mother, all of her girlfriends, aunts, a favorite teacher--in short, anyone who has a love of words, of learning, of mysteries, and a belief in the power of young women.

These two being about the 5th and 6th games made by Her Interactive, the graphics, character voices, story line, and overall script are great improvements over former pc games. I personally have not tried to play this game with my family, but the nature of the game is such that it is very family-friendly.

Communication can be intersepted, but what about the relevance (and timeliness) of the communicated information? What about the developments in analyses and evaluation, about organizing intelligence? Almost nothing.Iff you are interested in intelligence, there are better, more in-depth (and shorter) books available. For \\"firsttimers\\" I can recommend 'Spies and Spymasters' (old, still available?), a clear, concise and sometimes funny explanation of intelligence through the ages.Excuse my English writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems haphazard","review":"Not Keegan's best effort. It felt like I was reading parts and pieces from other works that may or may not be turned into full books. Love his work but this is for completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great author, poorly formed topic","review":"John Keegan's mastery of the material is obvious. However, he picked an amorphous topic: whether Military Intelligence \\"helps\\". Keegan uses historical vignettes through the ages to prove his point, that Military Intelligence is usually not decisive.However, the question seems poorly formed. Military Intelligence means different things in different epochs, and in different situations in the same timeframe. Also, the manner in which it may or may not be decisive is also situation specific. Worse, not all of Keegan's historical vignettes prove his point.The result is a book full of interesting tales, but lacking clear synthesis. This great historian's talent and our time are wasted on a poorly formed topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I saw the author on Cspans booknotes and was enthralled by the discussion. I went out and bought the book immediately. I can't believe the writer of the book and the man on Booknotes was the same person. Without going into specifics as other reviewers have, let me just say that I found this book extremely tedious and repetitive. I thought I would never finish it. (I always finish books I start, I'm a type A personality that way!) I recommend a pass on this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I'm sorry to say this is one boring book. It just seems to go on and on. I couldn't wait until it was done so I could move on to something that wouldn't put me to sleep every time I started to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Interesting Thoughts, Some Errors","review":"John Keegan herein presents six case studies of the effect of intelligence on war, and makes the very good point that intelligence is unable to accomplish anything unless linked to sufficient, well-used force.This is all very good, but I have to caution potential buyers: I know enough to partially evaluate one chapter, number five on Crete and Enigma. In it, Keegan displays such complete misunderstanding of cryptography that literally nothing he says on the subject can be trusted (he thinks the Caesar cipher, the world's simplest substitution system, is a transposition!). This leaves me wondering if the information I can't evaluate is similarly wrong.Worth reading, but probably not worth buying new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice work","review":"The English praise their John Keegan as the world's greatest military historian. This is funny for a mono-lingual people. Two-thirds of all military history books are by \\"foreigners\\" and are not written in English!!!!!! Even despite the English chauvinism I do think that Mr Keegan is an excellent writer. While he does little research in archivs he is good at synthesis; at pulling together good arguments from other writers' books. He has done this here, and very well I must say. His thesis that intelligence determines successes and failures, but has not won wars by itself, is really stating the obvious, but he states it forcefully enough that no military officer reading the book will feel comfortable without developing an obsesion for knowledge. Nice book. Yes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but awful","review":"It's impossible to remove the ice cubes from the tray.

The band's chrisma and showmanship are tight and the on-set production is great. This DVD serves to capture the wonderful moments of their 1999 Paris tour on film. The audience was boisterous and the band rocked hella good.The DVD comes with a lot of features from the good old past and three videos from Htachet, but the frustrating feature is the navigation. Whoever came up with something as confusing and longwinded as this needs to work harder.No worries, come Sep 17 (World)/Sep 24 (North America), the newly authored edition with 2 more videos (presumably from Wake Up...Coffee) plus a simplified and user-freindly navigation menu would be out! It would be much worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is up with the sync","review":"I just bought this DVD and have to agree with most of the reviews about this title. I love the Cranberries and have seen them once in 1995 in Seattle. The sound on this DVD is incredible if you have a dolby digital surround system - it makes you feel like you are in the middle of the arena. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the the editing in the concert in horrid, and the music and the artists are almost always out of sync. The close ups of Deloris are particullary bad. Despite that the DVD is amazing. The unplugged session is beautiful and I wished there was more, and the other live versions I think are fabulous. The only other down side to this disc is that the menus are a little annoying. Overall of this DVD is awesome and a great buy - so why wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific concert DVD","review":"If you LOVE the Cranberries, this is the concert DVD for you. All your favorite songs, plus extras like videos and a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"commercialized","review":"If you love music, and the way it was originally \\"felt\\", I would never suggest this DVD. I am a Cranaberries fan, and to see them commercialize their music like this video has is very disappointing. I bought \\"the cranberries live\\", and this video at the same time. \\"The cranberries live\\", is awesome, and the music is displayed as it was originally written. This video shows the extent that popularity has on a bands originallity. I didn't even watch the video to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"No live back of the stage or crew","review":"We met two lads that travel with the band. There was no mention? Not like most DVDs. That's what we paid for. We saw the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"great for those who like variety and don't have much time to get in a really good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE Keli Roberts","review":"This is my second Keli Roberts DVD (First was Quick Fix Stability Ball) - and I just love her instruction and attitude. This is definitely an intermediate workout, but you can make it more challenging by putting more into it. I love it because I am new to kickboxing and needed a bit of a tutorial. The first segment is great, because it teaches basic moves.. but after you have mastered them, you can amp up the energy by making your movements larger. I use this DVD every week, as I add a different ten minute section to my other 30-40 minute cardio vids, depending on what body part I feel like working out that particular day. I find myself going to the arm/shoulder section the most. Overall - GREAT purchase for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annoying instructor, good cardio","review":"Keli Roberts instruction style annoys me so much, it's hard to put up with this video. Something about her fake motivation and fake forefulness. I do sweat when I play all the routines, but this isn't really a traditional kickboxing routine - more quickly-moving strength. My legs/arms usually ache the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy this workout!","review":"I love the way Keli instructs, and after a couple times I can do the whole 50 minutes workout without straining myself much. I can see the result very soon, within a week, my body became slimmer. It's not enough for cardio though, I still need other means of cardio workout, but the abs and lower body trainings are really good. I enjoy it very much and would like to recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Workout","review":"This workout is not without challenge. So, even though it starts out easy, some of the sections get your heart rate up and and you will work up a sweat. However, the fact that each segment begins with its own warmup makes it too disruptive to do as one complete workout. Also, Keli Roberts is by herself, there are no background exercisers, and she is just no fun at all. I found this workout incredibly boring.I recommend Amy Bento, Cathe Friedrich or Chalene Johnson for fun and challenging kickboxing workouts, but don't waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first venture into kickboxing","review":"i really enjoyed this. the first workout gives you the basics and moves you will need. you proceed from there by choosing what body part you want to work on. even the upper body workout is easy but i suppose you can use heavier weights. i enjoyed this because it adds variety to a weekly routine. i felt it was also fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Kickboxing Video Out There!","review":"I've taken a kickboxing class before and while it was fun it was relatively expensive for a broke college student such as myself. After searching in vain for a decent workout video I stumbled upon this one and had to buy it. The trainer in the video is fantastic and the director did a really excellent job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This workout was very slow and I only got through it twice before I gave up. There is nothing in it to challenge/improve. It may be okay for a beginner who has NEVER done any of these workouts before. It's going in the next garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"i bought this originally because i was looking for a fun kickboxing video that wasnt too complicated. i selected this because i like keli roberts form of teaching. this is an excellent workout for beginners on up. keli does a good job explaining moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workouts","review":"This was a good buy and I'd recommend it to people who are looking to add another quick 10min workout to their normal routine. It's definitely something that I pop in after my normal workout dvds when I feel like I have the energy (or that I've eaten too much lately!). It is just the perfect amount of time too, the 10 min, because it is a hard workout and really gets my heart pumping. My only word of caution is that I feel like about half of these workouts are for people with a pretty high fitness level so I feel relegated to using about 3 of the 5 workouts, but for the price it was still worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"kickbox video","review":"This video is great. It is simple and the instructor is very good at explaining each movement. The neat thing is that there are 5 different 10 minute sections that work on different body parts. So you can pick and choose which ones you want to do and not get bored or tired doing one for ten minutes. It has several good cardio sections and even made me sweat. I would recommend this video to anyone who doesn't want to long of a workout but can pick the ones to do and help build your stamina even for people over 50!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective for whole body and heart...","review":"I really love this DVD, I am abit lazy on doing exercises; but doing it only 10 min a day is really effective, the exercises work on strength, cardio, and calorie burning.. I recommend it for 7 days a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout Video","review":"10 Minute Kickbox Bootcamp is one of my favorite workout videos. You can choose to do just 1 ten minute video, 2, 3, 4 ... whatever you have time for. The instructor slowly goes over the steps and repeats it, making it easy to learn the moves and get your heart rate going.I highly recommend this video, and the Fat Blasting Dance 10 minute video. Make sure you have plenty of room though, because you do some kicking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of kickboxing and I was very excited to try this DVD out. However, it was nothing like what I expected. I do not consider it kickboxing at all. Furthermore, the moves are unnecessarily complicated. Some of them seem a bit dangerous even. It is a moderate workout, but not fun and certainly not kickboxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Challenge...","review":"After reading these reviews, I was anticipating a heart-pounding workout, I was very disappointed! The only section that got my heartrate up was \\"Fat Burning Blast\\". The abs section has some nice, unique moves. If you love Tae Bo (as I do), you will be disapponted. I was hoping for more kicking/punching combos - there was very few. I would not even call this a kickboxing workout, nor was it a typical \\"bootcamp\\" style workout that made me hit \\"pause\\" to catch my breath. I am 34 years old, a runner, and intermediate exerciser and I found this workout to be for beginner/moderate exercisers. No one else mentioned this in their review: she had a very proper Australian accent which didn't motivate me at all - I want someone who forces me to \\"give me one more! push it out!\\". I felt like sitting with a \\"spot of tea\\" afterwards, not running for a towel and water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective!","review":"I like to do this DVD all the way through, which amounts to about 54 minutes, I think. It is a very thorough total body workout, and with its kickboxing theme, is very good for days when you feel stressed. The instructor is great. She is motivating without being overly perky and she doesn't constantly ramble. She explains each move and you start out each routine very slowly, then pick up the pace. The only thing I wasn't sure about was using the handweights while slowly throwing punches. I've always been taught that's a no-no. The cardio movements also use quite a bit of space, so keep that in mind. I found myself having to make smaller movements so as not to run into walls, which I'm sure cut down on the effectiveness. Still overall a very good DVD, a very good purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice DVD, suitable for different level. Easy to learn","review":"I have found this DVD at our local library, and tried it. Since I had not exercised for a while, I had trouble catching up at first, even to the Basic Training. But after a few times, I was able to learn the basic steps and punches, and I could move on to the more advanced workout in the dvd. So I ordered it from Amazon, and use it on a regular basis, especially when weather prevents me going out.The moves she developed are very effective to work out all muscles. 10 minutes is a perfect time if you are not very much in shape yet. Before you feel really tired, the 10-minute period is ending. You can also choose to play All."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pace and instructor","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for in a Kickbox video. The pace she keeps the whole time is quick, but each exercise is well explained. The instructor is very good at calling ahead what is coming next and I loved all the workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not Keep","review":"I purchased this and really enjoyed the first box. However, a few weeks later when I went to cook another box there were bugs, like flour bugs, in the pasta and I had to throw it all away. The box states 100% money back guarantee, however the Hodgson Mill did not send me my money back they sent me coupons for their products; products I am not sure I want to buy in advance of using them. If you purchase more than what you can eat on the day it arrives I would advise storing it in more than just the box it comes in."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Goulash History for the Casual Light Reader Brigade","review":"The author's writes well. However, he is not a second Professor A.J.P. Taylor. He seems not to be a scholar at all. He had collected varied and interesting information from sources which he quotes freely, if indifferently. This book may well be of interest to those who desire only something interesting to read, which leads them down many dissimilar roads with no particular destination in mind. The suppositions the author does make about some aspects of the Crimean War will find detractors among historians of merit who have studied this conflict in its historical context of Europe, Anatolia, and the Levant.It is interesting, but not very informative to serious students of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"charm in small things","review":"I have put away this whole collection for my daughter when she is older.

A good read for any casual or serious churchgoer, this book crosses demoninational boundries. Care and concern are expressed not only to the abused, but to the abuser as well.

He offers a paradigm-shift in grasping the importance Jesus attached to spiritual abuse. Ken explains biblical spiritual authority in a way that empowers church members to identify and submit to true authority while discerning and rejecting false authority. Besides being a PK, over the past 20 years I've worked closely with several pastors whose character needs resulted in them committing regular spiritual abuse ranging from mild to severe. Ken offers genuine hope for true forgiveness, freedom and healing.

After searching through all the items on Amazon, this one had the best price of all the \\"long\\" wrist bands being offered. When they arrived, of course, it was just a standard wrist band (about 3 inches) instead of what's shown on the picture. The thickness was fine, and it would be an OK wrist band if I were looking for just a standard item. Coming back to Amazon, I now see that all the images have been photoshopped to make the wrist band look longer than it actually is. If you look closely, you can see the line where each item is made to look about 50% longer than reality - not even a very good photo manipulation once you look at it. Lesson learned - don't believe your eyes when shopping online (the description never claims to be a long wristband)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent quality","review":"I ordered this item, thinking it was a pair.

It is written for beings who still think they are their bodies. The majority of the book is about Ramana and his life around the ashram with devotees and interactions with visitors and even the local wildlife. Most books about Ramana are question and answer format so this one shows how an enlightened being interacts with life and people in everyday situations.One of the most amazing parts was when Ramana was dying. The doctors knew he would die before the day was done and so did all the devotees. They sang songs outside his room. Even though he said he was not the body but the SELF, the ONE SELF in all of us, the drama was being played out on the physical plane. As the devotees sang, Ramana had tears in his eyes and then he just stopped breathing.

The reader is introduced to the chimps making war upon another group as well as dealing with cannabalism amongst its own members.Her stories are related as if she is talking about real human persons rather than about our closest relative in the animal kingdom. She writes with a compassion that bridges the gap between our species and makes the reader really care about the good and bad things that happens to them.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about how our species are similar and what is happening to these wonderfull creatures.

The cable that runs from the control box to the sub has a loose connection inside the sub because moving it slightly fixed it right up. It also cured the annoying low level rumble that the sub produced when it was idle. This is why I buy most stuff locally, I might have paid $100 more but I hate waiting for returns etc. =PThe feet on the satellite speakers aren't meant to be removed. I tried it to see if I could mount one onto a speaker stand and it's easy enough to remove but there is a nut attached to the other end of the screw that holds the stand in place. Logitech should have secured the screw in place better because it will bounce around inside the enclosure once you remove the screw.Apart from that I love 'em.

I took them over to Best Buy willing to pay whatever it took to get them fixed. They were ready to go until they found out that Logitech would not allow them to fix the problem and since I was now past the warranty period, Logitech wouldn't take the speakers for repair either. I had called many electronic and computer repair places who mentioned they got no support from Logitech so couldn't repair the speakers.

Installation is easy for small areas (10 Ft. x 10 Ft. with no walk-thru) but if you want to go long you will have to improvise with wire routing. My only minor complaint is that they did not design the base of the speakers to mount with three screws or more (mechanical engineering flaw1) and you cannot use a screwdriver easily for the mount because the speaker is in the way (mechanical engineering flaw2). The mount could not be removed from the speaker housing during installation. Once installed, though, I think the product was the right choice.

First, the main controls being on their on stand (volume, input control, etc.) although nice, is fairly large, it's a little wider and taller than one of the speakers, so I had an awkward time trying to find a place for it. So if you don't have much desk space keep that in mind. You could always use the remote or the volume setting on the computer so not a big problem. The second problem is not enough audio settings.

I'm trying to find some bigger screws to get it flush, but the screws attach at the bottom so there's no support for the top of the speaker which hangs.

For PC speakers.","review":"I am going to end up returning these (or selling them), but they arn't bad stricktly as PC speakers. Music is ok, but nothing to write home about. Movies and games are definetly better compared to music. The subwoofer is not as impressive either physically or sonically as most will say. For one thing, a slight tap on the side causes a very obvious RING. Now, maybe its the metal covering over the woofer, but this isn't good, besides that, it is very light, cheaply made, and probably underpowered. And for anyone saying this is as good as a $2000 or whatever component system. Get real!If you value features over pure sound quality, these arn't a bad buy, the \\"console\\" is a pretty cool concept.

I like logitech products (their mice are second to none) and the 5500 is definitely an interesting concept but the execution is poor. Not only is the subwoofer huge and heavy (not necessarily a bad thing) but it sounds boomy and is all over the place - one of the worst subwoofers I've heard. The satellites sound tinny and they do not blend with the subwoofer and there's a huge hole where the midrage should be. I could go on and on, but let me sum it up: If you care about sound quality, save your money and get something else. I gave them two stars because I liked the whole design concept but that's about all I could find positive about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent sound, Bad design","review":"As most anyone will tell you, these speakers do have excellent sound and if you're just going to set them up on your desktop, then I'd give them 5 stars. However, the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can't ceiling-mount them. Logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no \\"universal speaker mounts\\" will work with them. If you want to see how they mount, go to Logitech's website, go to product support and enter wall mounting. Some might argue that they're computer speakers, not home entertainment center speakers, but for $300, I expect a little bit better design."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't hear anything!","review":"This system rocks!

Install a little frustrating.","review":"First of all I have to say this speaker system sounds great. I have them hooked up to my Dell PC and I'm perfectly satisfied with the way they sound and I love the subwoofer. But for some reason the designers decided that the mounts for the satellite speakers only rotate around in one direction, which makes mounting them not only particularly difficult, but it limits where they can be placed if you want them aimed in a specific location. I finally found mounting locations that accommodated this flaw, but this placement was not optimal. Therefore, I deducted one star. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the sound quality and they look good in my office too."},{"rating":"1","title":"High quality, short life","review":"I purchased these speakers just shy of three years ago at their initial MSRP of almost twice their current price. They have been used regularly and always impressed me with their quality and ability to fill a room with rich sound.However, I cannot recommend these speakers. Less than three years of use and the To Rear Right channel terminal has stopped working. This can not be remedied by replacing the speaker or the wire. I spoke with Logitech support who told me the only solution was to purchase an entirely new set at half price, and then mail the broken set back to them at my own expense.Apparently this is a very common problem with this speaker, which commonly progresses into two or three channel terminals ceasing to function before the unit is completely silent.

Thank you Logitech for making a awesome product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great System for a Year or Two","review":"Excellent sound, easy setup, usable as a home theater system with limited inputs. That is all great, but once the system fails, well, time for another. As many one star reviewers mention, the tower will fail at some point. Over a three year period I went thru two of these systems, now I have retired the idea of replacing it and am choosing a home theater system with an av receiver, there are plenty on amazon favorably reviewed.Also, I never paid more than $400 for this system, where they get the $900+ price tag is beyond me.In short, two stars because when it works its great, but don't expect longevity from this system. Now I have two of these speaker systems, the woofer is useless because is integrated with the tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech's Poor Return Policy","review":"Pros: Great speakers, just like everyone else says.Cons: My experience: One of the satellite speakers was constantly buzzing. Logitech only option for me was to return the ENTIRE system. I did that after reluctantly paying the shipping cost. My replacement set was not function normal either. The control center applied a high pitch hum to all audio from digital sources. Again, Logitech only option was to return the ENTIRE system, and have me pay shipping again. I opted for a refund instead of a second replacement because I was already short some $70 for shipping costs!I loved these speakers. They sounded great when I had them. It would be no big deal if they freely replaced them, but making me pay the heavy shipping cost twice is ridiculous. What were the chances of me receiving two defective units in a row? Much greater than me buying another product from Logitech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for DVD Movies, not so much for CD music","review":"Great features and convenience. Too much muddy bass. The subwoofer is not a good match for the rest of the system. I have to keep the subwoofer set at about 1 or 2 on a scale of 10 to achieve a balanced sound. Logitech should do away with the \\"digital equalization\\" (The Z-5500 Digital actively adjusts frequency response in real time for the cleanest, most accurate sound reproduction) as it supresses high frequencies.Sounds great when viewing movies! My guess is, if your media is in Dolby Digital form it will sound great! Otherwise, not so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"good system","review":"I shopped around for a pc speaker system, and I listened to a lot of systems, and this system out performed all of them,even the high quality big name brands.

They sound pretty good. I have been hearing some strange noises on certain songs, almost like there's something wrong with the treble or something. Then again, I still haven't connected them with a digital or optical cable, just the ones they came with. I'm the kind of guy who thinks they should sound good right out of the box. Amazon had the best price, as they do with most stuff. I just wonder if they would have left them on the porch like they did with my logitech freeedom 2.4 joystick the other day. I live in an apartment complex! Good thing I have honest neighbors, although a huge, colored box like this one proabbly would have been gone.

There is only 1 other system in the same quality range and thats the klipsh pro media 5.1 but the logitech z5500 has built in decoders for 5.1 digital playback which makes it the better buy. They also have the highest peak of 1000 watts that Ive ever seen on a pc speaker system and the quality and fidelity of sound that comes out of them stays crisp and dosent distort one bit even on extreme levels of volume.

[Un-equalized] the sound isn't as good, but it's pretty good for the price, and works well for just about everything (TV, Movies, Music, etc). The center channel speaker is definitely a weakness. Midrange gets blasted out of the subwoofer, because the satellites don't go low enough. Other than that, it's solid, and beats the crap out of built in TV speakers.My two biggest critiques are:1) The remote feels very cheap and flimsy (not that big of an issue).2) The inputs are limited to 1 optical, 1 coax, and 1 [6-channel] surround stereo, which means I have to use other equipment to mux inputs (so I can connect my cable box, DVD player, and computer using the optical input)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"Incredible sound system. It was easy to set up, and immediately started producing high quality sound. Even turning the volume all the way up, no sound quality is sacrificed. Produces clean music even while your kitchen is shaking from the bass. Not only that, but I discovered a few weeks after buying it that there is a 'Boost' mode, activated if you keep turning the volume knob past full. It goes up to Boost 11 (or 13, I forget)... it is awesome.The only downside is that now I need better encoded MP3's to take full advantage of this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"control center breaks after two years","review":"If you don't mind having to replace the speakers after 2 years they're good speakers. The control box breaks and it can't be replaced. Even tech support said it's a very common problem. The only thing you can do is buy another set set of speakers. They will offer you 50% off.

The bass is very full and deep which I love and all other frequencies are very clear. I love the design. Perfect for watching TV and DVDs on my iMac too in 5.1 surround.

Gaming and 3D effects are all great. At higher volumes, however, there is noticeable distortion in music. There is ringing, echoing, booming, and instruments don't sound the way they should (harmonics are missing or altered in volume). The speakers are fine for playing songs etc. in the background, but I can't use them for seriously listening and concentrating on any music. I'm sure these speakers create distortion in any kind of sound, but it's only a problem for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Z-5500 -- Simple - Great for Price","review":"I have three of these systems that I've had rangeing from 2 years to 2 months.

One customer service person suggested that for the messages to be recorded louder I should crank up the volume on the answering machine and leave it at maximum. I've owned lots of answering machines.

Hard to say whether Firewall is really better. Here, as in \\"Firewall\\" (and as opposed to \\"Die falsche F?hrte\\") the book takes off and flies from the beginning. The suspense builds enormously but there came a point where I doubted, with all the tangled loose threads, if Mankell could bring it to a decent ending (according to John Berger, and maybe Kafka as well, a writer should never have a specific ending in mind, just let it fall out as the writing progresses).

With the Iraq situation and radical muslims out there as terrorists, a Nazi and neo Nazitheme is over the top especially as the author is so familiar with Africa and clearly people from that part of the world are floating around Sweden up to no good. I hope his next book is more with it as muslim terrorists are busy committing crimes in order to finance their operations including murders which could make for a now police procedural. But Mankell is very good much better than Karin Fossum who needs to go to school on Mankell'sKurt Wallender series. Her detective is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY Outdated - don't buy","review":"The book openly admits that it's from the RC-2 pre-realse version of Windows 2000...there have been too many changes. While it has a 2000 copyright, it was clearly written mid 1999. MS has said that it is no longer official study material for the Upgrading Exam...For example, it refers to W2K running on the Alpha platform thoughout the book - not true for the final release. This book will only confuse new W2K users and is not helpful for any exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but I need more...","review":"This book is an ok overview of the network operating system but I need more. I know some company named Wave Technologies is developing a bigger & better self-study kit with multi-media and stuff but not sure where to find it at Amazon. I think you should buy this book to start and then probably buy Wave's to really cover the important topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"A must see for those interested in learning about thr world of terrorism. Great educational video."},{"rating":"2","title":"ailgating made easy","review":"We have been going to the ny jets football games for over 30 years. The problem since I don\`t care for trucks or suvs is space in my honda accord trunk. Well I don\`t have that problem any more. With the Bayou it folds up and fits easily. But besides that you can use match light charcoal so in a matter of minutes the food is already cooking. No propane to buy and carry around. When we are finished just clean up and put back in the trunk. I would recomend this grill to anyone who has limited trunk space and loves to tailgate. PS it is cheaper then all the other grills at this size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"ist ok for the price but if you are leving it outdoor be careful because it corrodes easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP stuff","review":"Thought this would be a real go getter but when I got it and unfolded it, it was just cheap junk. It might've lasted one season of cooking. If that's all you're looking for for $30.00 there are much cheaper alternatives. Sent it back with no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Grill !!","review":"This grill is the best purchase I made this summer ! Easy to carry, easy to assemble and easy to clean. It has made it possible for my girlfriends and I to have a spur of the moment day in the park without a whole lot of fuss.(And without the guys LOL)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bayou Classic Fold and Go Portable Grill","review":"1) Without a lid it makes it tough to cook food properly; 2) The grill has gaps at the base which allow for heat loss, and trying to seal them with foil is impossible; 3)no lip around the grill to keep hotdogs from sliding off the grate; 4)disposing the coals is a messy hassle. All this means that I wouldn't buy this grill again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap grill","review":"Yes you can cook on it, but it's thin metal and should have spent more and gotten a real portable Bar-B-Que."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent grill for the money!","review":"I purchased this grill for a camping trip that My husband and I had planned. I was very satisfied with both the grill and the size of the cooking area. I've had no problems with the grill warping. Very satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"Typical cheap made in China fair. Had to repair out of the box. One side hinge was separated at spot welfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Actually, The sound is not that great for a modern recording. The Isolde is very disappointing though so many say she is committed the the music. PLease, Shirley Verrett gave a much better performance of the Liebestod withMehta at Avery Fisher Hall around the same time and she was no Wagnerian. The orchestra is wonderful. Can't wait to get rid of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shallow and Poorly Written Copy of Another Battletch Novel","review":"One of the very first Battletch novels written, \\"Decision at Thunder Rift\\", which started the saga of the Grey Death Legion, is also one of the best stories created in the Battletech Universe. A young man is forced into command of a mercenary unit, trains non-Mechwarrior's to join his new unit, and takes on an invading force. Sound familiar?It should, because this is also the basic plot of \\"Ghost of Winter\\", the first in the Mechwarrior series from FASA, and a part of the Battletech Universe.This book is an absolute mess. The characters are shallow, the pacing is absurdly quick, motivations are ridiculous, etc. The Battletch series has produced a number of excellent books; it's a shame that FASA decided to start the Mechwarrior series with such a piece of worthless tripe. The scary part is the ending of this book, which leaves room for a sequel. Perish the thought. Please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and pointless","review":"The above title sums it up. Shallow characters, little or no plot, poor writing and a dull story. I own every Battletech/Mechwarrior book ever written, so believe me when I say; this is one of the worst (on par with Far Country with its giant talking chickens and no battlemechs!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mechwarrior book yet!","review":"I found Ghost of Winter to be the most enjoyable of all the Mech books so far. It was full of action, as most Mech books are, but it also has a few nice twists in it that made you think. The story flows nicely and I found myself spending time reading it long after I should have gone to bed. I have to admit that I buy these books for my sons but I really enjoy them myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"Ghost of Winter is an excellent book. Although the pacing is a little off in the beginning of the book, and a few plot threads never pan out, I would recommend it to anyone who is just getting started with Battletech and Mechwarrior. I hope to see more of Sturm and the Winter Ghosts in the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost of winter Review","review":"At first I thought this was going to be another good guys on planet and evil bad guys come rushing in. Kenson suprised me. After I read through about 40 to 50 pages I couldn't put the book down. It was suspensful while entertaining, with of course a brilliant story line. The ending was also awesome (though I won't spoil it for anyone who hasen't read it yet), though it pretty stereo typical. Anyway, awesome book to start off a new series, if you haven't got. GET IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"BattleTech fans beware!","review":"After slogging through the book with its rather mediocre writing, I perosanlly found the ending both unbelievable and unsatisfying. After walking across the room to pick up the book (where I had hurled it with great force moments before) I reread it hoping I had been wrong. Nope. It was still a poor ending. I had expected some grand battle to finish off the story, but not one in which all major characters (both good guys and bad guys) all walk away. All right, one was horribly burned. But no one paid that ultimate price for freedom (or in payment for some rather terrible crimes talked about (but rarely shown) in the novel). Kenson should stick to ShadowRun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best lub.","review":"Yup.
