Drake writes about a very specific topic, Military SF, and he does an outstanding job. Allthough I might not have his same background in the U.S. Army I am quite familier U.S. Navy (going on 7 years acvite duty), I still find that his charactors portray an accurate picture of the comman war fighter in any nations army. Well maybe except that the officers are usually the hero. If you are a military member looking for a story written close to home or if you are just looking for a book with well thought out charactors and a excellent plot Mr. Drake can take on all challengers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his very best","review":"David Drake writes military science fiction like no one else, and this novel is one of the best examples of why. It has large quantities of intense action, character development under fire, and a mass of memorable characters.In many ways the book is what a Slammers' story would be like if you boiled it down to the essentials and then escalated the action another notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I had difficulty with this at first, I had just read another military science fiction book where a chart in the book helped you keep track of all the characters. So I guess I was spoiled. This book bounced around with so many names and so may perspectives that I almost put it down on the second chapter. I am glad I didn't. This stand alone story really turned around, and finished on a very satisfying note. A mercenary group of soldiers is dropped on a planet for a relatively easy assignment of keeping the miners from leaving. The soldiers lose their Colonel when the local military tries to sell them out to an invading force from another planet. By the end I was hoping for a sequel. Great character development, exciting plot, believable atmosphere of an another world and society, dialogue, fast paced realistic action, I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Book from Drake","review":"I am a big fan of the Hammer's Slammers series and have enjoyed some of Mr. Drake's other books, but this was not his best effort.

I will definitely be purchasing the rest of their albums as well as any future releases. I can't stop listening to it! The music is smart and has just the perfect amount of energy.

The only problem I've noticed is some games (such as Super Mario Bros. and Mega Man 3) don't sound quite the same, but is no major problem... Most people wouldn't notice anyway. Also, when you first get it, the pins are very stiff and it'll take a bit of effort to put in or remove carts until it breaks in a little. Oh yeah and the controllers it comes with are great too, but very lightweight. If your NES pins are worn out or you're tired of cleaning carts all the time, I'd definitley recommend a Yobo.

The plot is sure-fire (kid runs away with the carnival), the characters memorable (sideshow freaks, revealed to be--human beings! theater people, great and small, revealed to be--human beings!), the sins enormous (pederasty, pride, perhaps even murder), the virtues marvelous (love, devotion to love). The theme of this book, as with the other books in the trilogy, is search for self--the main character of this book lives four different lives during his life. This book works on every level; it reads well as a story, gives you something to think about, and stands up to any number of readings you'd care to give it. (I've given it at least five.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book about options and specifically about LEAP puts","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. First, it's very condensed and well structured. The author gives a very good overview of stock options, then he explains his strategy (basically it's selling long term naked puts). Because in general selling naked options is considered to be risky, the author explains in details why his strategy is actually a low risk one. He includes the raw data he used, the programs and formulas and the results and their interpretation. The books is written from an individual investor point of view. What I really like about the book is that the author is not trying to avoid or downplay the areas of concerns. Actually he is doing exactly the opposite. He is trying to find and address the weakest points of his strategy and prove his points. Overall, it's a great book to learn about stock options, especially the LEAP puts strategy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try it at home","review":"This is one of the most misleading books I've come across. The entire approach developed by the author is based on one assumption - the bull market will continue and it will bail you out. To prove the validity of his approach he selected 1987 - 1997, the greatest bull market in history, when DJI increased 300%. This is the only reason why his strategy \\"worked.\\" It's hard to believe that a trained mathematician didn't realize that the data he was using was flowed and didn't include a long enough bear market. If he had used a period from 1964 to 1984 instead, his calculations would have shown him a huge loss and this book would have never be published.For those who are still thinking about trying selling at-the-money LEAPS, I would suggest reading The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very helpful book, unfortunately.","review":"Every time I pick up a new investment book, I hope it will have new ideas and insights.

Although I find the struggles of Conrad somewhat depressing , I find myself glued to the screen almost totally connecting with this boy that I have never met or talked with.

The book opens a few months after he is released from the hospital and it seems to be a story about his recovery, but as you read on, you realize that it is also about his father, Calvin. Cal is struggling with the grief of both his son's death and his other son's suicide attempt. He is also struggling with his diminishing realtionship with his wife, Beth. Beth feels that Cal is dwelling too much on the past and she wants him to stop being so protective of Conrad and move on.

He quits the swim team to take control of his life and things are going good until, his mother finds out he quit and things take a turn for the bad. Conrad's dad, Cal, tries to support his wife and his son but it is very hard to find a balance. Conrad tries making a social life again, then one of his close friends kills herself.

Through all these challenging times can Conrad make it through?"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY HARD TO FOLLOW!!!","review":"This book was very hard to follow. It seemed that one character would be thinking or talking about something, and all of the sudden it would be another character talking. An example of this would be when Connor starts talking about his brother Buck and then it starts saying that his dad wasn't taking it to well. The book didn't seem to have any point. It was about a kid who's brother had died in an accident, and he tries to commit sucicide. I feel bad for Connor, but I just can't relate to it. Also the language was pretty bad. Some of the language just wans't needed. I think some of it was just there to be there, not for any reason. The book also didnt have enough detail. For instance when it says his brother dies it doesnt say where or any detail. It just says he dies from a boating accident. Even that is hard to get out of the book. For me this book it a little to hard to follow, but try it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused!","review":"When I began to read this story I was confused, in the first chapter the narrator swithces all the time and you can't figure out if Mr. Jarrett or Conrad is narrating, then I thought it was just one person. Guest makes it seem that Cal, short for Calvin, is a girl, but then skipping forward I found out that it was a guy. I didn't even bother to read the end because after trying to re-read what you read it's more confusing then the first time. This book is for slow, boring readers, and I bet they won't even understand. There's a part about carbon monixide death, and where Conrad is thinking of something when he try's to sleep but that part does not make any sense, it just wastes time.

It's about grief and death and a family falling apart. I kept my battered copy for years when I lived in the UK and brought it home to Jamaica with me. I really identified with it at the time and felt that it crossed gender, racial, and cultural barriers in dealing with the topics. I am not white, upper middle class American and yet I felt it could be my family or anyone's that this happened to. I can't believe some readers thought this was shallow.

Extraordinary Writing","review":"Few novels dare to break the conventional idea of how life is portrayed in literature acurately. This is one of them. Normally, novels today create a melodramatic plot filled with characters and scenes that are not only not plausible, but are simply created for a tear jerk. Guest stays away from this idea. She simply creates the world of a boy and the trials his family and he goes through. It's not complicated. It's not farfetched. It's not ostentatious. It's simply life. Guest takes the reader on a journey of what an ordinary family experiences. The journey is arduous, depressing, and most importantly, real. Ordinary People stands as a novel of simple beauty with one goal: life is not always the simple realm one witnesses in It's a Wonderful Life, life is not as dramatic as a soap opera, life is just a series of events that are tragic and memorable in which one lives and struggles to get up the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I thought that \\"Ordinary People\\" was phenomenal!

I know I cried a few times, but you might not want to listen to me considering that I'm a pretty sensitive person. I also believe that the emotion of having a family member die and then having another almost kill himself is well presented in this novel. So I don't waste your time going over everything and giving away the ending, Ordinary People is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordinary People was a book I think any teenager relates with","review":"reading Ordinary People, I found myself glued to the book, waiting to reach the end.

The subject matter is morbid, the flashbacks of the boating accident are incomprehensible, the dialogue will put you to sleep, and there's even a pre-marital sex scene between our emo protagonist, Conrad, and that skank, Jeaninne. Conrad's parents have to be the worst in the world. The mother is a recluse who bottles up her feelings around her son and his supportive father is a borderline alcoholic.

The Jarretts, a wealth suburban family, are torn apart when the older son dies in a boating accident. The frigid cow of a wife closes herself off from everyone else, while the son goes to see the 'wacky' psychotherapist Doctor Berger, who is incredibly irritating that I was tempted to skip every chapter he appeared in. Everything else in the book is just boring.The characters are all obnoxious, with the possible exception of the father, and if I had the choice I would drown them all.

I love all the actors, especially Malkovich being one of my favorites. But the camera angles were unnecessary and the editing was confusing. Some parts stood out as beautiful, but most left something to be desired.I think overall the atmosphere of the film does portray qualities of Klimt, the struggles he had, his temper against art critiques, and outright sexuality he possessed in private as well as throughout his work. So in that way, you can take from the movie something that adds to your experience of Klimt the Artist. But otherwise... I hate to put down a film that includes one of my favorite actors and is about one of my favorite artists, but so it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and inaccurate","review":"In a series of more or less disconnected scenes and vignettes which oscillate randomly between reality and the protagonist's hallucinations, the movie depicts the mental deterioration of a character loosely based on the Viennese Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt. According to director Ruiz, this fictionalized Klimt was ravaged by general paresis, that is, syphilitic dementia. The real Klimt died not from syphilis but of complications of a stroke. Largely unexplored by this film are the Vienna Secession, and the development of Klimt's artistic style. Certainly this is not the first fictionalized biography: in contrast to Shaffer's Amadeus, for example, Salieri was not responsible for Mozart's death, but in his fictionalized version of history, Peter Shaffer far more deftly explores the mystery of genius. Some reviewers have commented that one needs to do research to understand the film. I submit that such a requirement is evidence of the film's failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I love Klimt ! He is one of my favorite painters and I've read much about him. When I saw there was a movie coming out , I got excited. But, I was very disappointed with this one.The movie is a series of vignettes that lead nowhere - characters introduced but not developed - stories that start but have no end, ideas that are introduced but not followed through. All in all, its very disjointed and not really even interesting. Even John Malcovich doesn't help this movie. He is decent in the role, but has little to work with in terms of script or story.This is a movie that desperately wants to be an art film, but falls short in every way. It makes me appreciate artist movies like \\"Frida\\" even more. Frida seemed to capture the life, the times, and the soul of the artist - this movie does none of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Not Klimt","review":"This movie is clown-shoes dipped in pudding and presented on the platter of a gilded cow patty. I am not one to ever under any circumstances attack another's opinion but how anyone could gives this movie above two stars befuddles and truthfully scares me a little. Basically, this movie missed... horribly. Movies speak the languages of poetry, art, allegory, and a host of others. The director failed miserably in passing on any understandable message in any language. It was pretty to look at, next to impossible to understand, and total rubbish as a vehicle to speak on who the man was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biography about the famous artist","review":"I must admit that what attracted me to this film is the fact that film is about Klimt -- artist whose work is recognised immediately and the fact that he is portrayed by the actor John Malkovich - great character actor. But I was disapointed by both Malkovich's performance and film direction.Perhaps if I knew about Klimt's life the film would complement that knowledge. As that was not the case, I found film to be too fragmented and confusing. Was Klimt a complicated man, or was he plain crazy? Was he promiscuous, or was it his art that required unlimited supply of women to serve him as models, muses and lovers?No matter what, the remaining stars for the movie are for wonderful costumes, reproductions of some of Klimt's best known work and beautiful actresses on the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a watch","review":"I thought that this was definitely worth a watch. The imagery was very reflective of the era and a real part of enjoying the movie. I must confess that I don't know that much about Klimt's life and no doubt missed some of the nuance of the story because of it. John Malkovich is always worth a watch in my book and I am happy to have the movie in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Collection by a Fabulous Singer","review":"Both the song selection and the arrangements are just beautiful.

I decided however to return the book because I really could no longer bear to read his pompous and self-congratulatory style. Firstly there are almost more contrived and posed pictures of Doug than there are interiors. Lines like \\"the room ...I created was a flat out sensation\\", \\"you agree that I've done it again\\" and \\"I slyly evoked the swinging sixties era\\" are almost too embarrasing to read. Where were his editors?? I not only have hundreds of interior design books on my shelves but I am an author of a design book myself so I believe I speak from experience. His beautiful and clever interiors were sadly overshadowed by his neediness and overbearing focus on himself. Again, I say where were the editors??

Yes, they were supposedly classically trained at a conservatory and are \\"talented\\" (the use of the word is rather subjective), but they obviously do not need any of that training or talent in this cd. It seems like a monkey with some high-tech synthesizers and a recording studio could put out this cd. I'm not saying I don't enjoy techno, but don't fuse classical music and techno. To me this marriage not only sounds really crappy, it's also a travesty of classical music written to have more depth and emotion than Bond remixes it to have, and it is just really bad techno music.

Unfortunately, Eggers' prose is not subtle enough, and makes his vendetta against the Bolivian warlords who extradited him during the \\"Breadfruit Rebellion\\" too apparent. I mean, this was 27 years ago, during Eggers' Daffodil period. It's time for him to put the bulljive aside and let by-gones be by-gones.

Though some of the laster chapters drag a bit on the whole I feel a much better understanding of the man behind Relativity than before.What pleased me most about the book was the fact that at the beginning of each chapter the author tells you what years of Einstein's life he is covering and Einstein's age range over those years. This helped a great deal in putting the events in order in my head - usually I find myself scribbling down dates in biographies to keep from referring back to the beginning of the book to see the subjects age at the time being referred to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious detail","review":"I love biography, and good biography does contain details. But this book's detail is tedious in content as well as tedious in its writing style. There is no attempt at literary art. It's descriptions sound juvenile.

The actors in this show have missed that boat by a mile - seem, often, not even to be trying to communicate the sense of what they have to say, and seem not at all embarrassed to be doing nothing but mouthing lines they don't understand. And so whatever may be the purpose of this extravaganza - spoof, horror, just a bit of fun, or whatever (it certainly can't be to \\"do\\" Shakespeare, either seriously or satirically) - it is doomed to failure because its actors simply fail to tell its story. So the chintzy effects and amateurish \\"music\\" may be a bit of a lark, but the general dishonesty of the production values and the worse than amateurish acting leave this one at a spiritual and aesthetic level somewhere below that of \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish there was a zero stars option!","review":"This video is too bad to even rate a \\"campy\\" label.

I hope all these actors donated their time to this film for there isn't one worthy of a penny in remuneration. Cuts to the text had no justification. And the special effects.

It's not even a \\"good\\" bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"This video is completely laughable. The cheesy sound effects, the horrendous acting (not only can they not speak with any sense of Shakespearean meter, but they pause--I mean, PAUSE--between each other's sentences to wait for the next person to finish--it's just laughable), and the title character does not impress me as the \\"mighty\\" general Titus. Instead, he reminded me of the 7th grade teacher I had for history who everyone used to pick on because of his stature! I'm sorry about this.

Well, here it is: complete with cardboard sets, costumes from Woolworth's Holloween day sale, actors picked at random off the street and special effects that wouldn't scare a four-year old. Don't be fooled by the four-star reviews, written by people who have never seen or read a Shakespeare play in their life. This is NOT Shakespeare. This is NOT scary.

I wish the current release of Titus had been more courageous. On the other hand,pleasurable gore does not replace acting, concept and production values.

The music was badly written and played. The man playing Saturninus looked way too old to be the son of the recently deceased emperor, and the man playing Titus looked like he should have been cast as one of Shakespeare's whiney, annoying, innefectual characters. The violence was so over-the-top and disgusting, it was absolutely ridiculous. The two men doing the killing in that first scene were having far too much fun, and the facial expressions and laughter were totally out of place.

(When they cut off Titus' daughter's hands, they actually use a department store mannequin with little tubes in the middle of the wrists squirting blood.) I can only imagine the \\"cult\\" status is because, like Plan 9 From Outer Space, this movie is so bad its funny. Let me put it this way: if you're looking for a good Shakespeare film, this ain't it. If you're looking for a good horror film, this ain't it either.

Amaia, the lead singer, has a voice exquisitely suited to both harder-edged rock songs and the softer side of pop, and the band manages to blend both sounds perfectly in amazing songs like \\"El 28\\" and \\"La estrella y la luna\\". Their lyrics are both simple and meaningful, definitely not bubble-gum pop by any stretch, and also extremely catchy.

Essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds without substance","review":"After repeated listening to both the concerto and the Autumn Gardens, my personal response is I wish there were more music in the music. In the recorded interview, Ashkenazy sounds like a polite but clearly disappointed buyer trying to glean any bit of insight the composer might give to this empty effort. But, Rautavaara talks around it and attempts to cloak the lack of musical substance in some sort of spiritual argument. Good try at a save, but the sales pitch quickly dissipates when you go back to the music and just listen to what was written. I don't begrudge a composer making a good living, but I hope that Mr. Ashkenazy didn't pay a great deal for this concerto."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novel, a fictional book, not truth at all","review":"All this book is made of lies. There are no \\"navaja fighting\\" schools in Spain. I am from Spain, I have trained for more than 30 years in many martial arts including some western, and I have no information about that. It sounds extrange that Mr. Loriega (not a spanish guy) arrives Spain and finds easily what many martial artists from Spain don't know it exists!If you change the name of the Spanish master by \\"Joda\\" and \\"Navaja\\" by \\"laser sable\\", and \\"Sevilla\\" for \\"Dagobah\\", then you get \\"Mr. Loriega\\" is \\"Luke Skywalker\\". I think he would like to, and that is the reason of the book. Mr. Loriega has fully invented the story, just to pack it together with his Manual del Baratero translation and make himself some kind of Spanish Martial Arts Master.Anyway, the book can be read as a novel, and you can enjoy reading it as if you read a book about Luke Skywalker learning laser sable fighting in his Jedi Academy. Both are fiction in the same level."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sample only","review":"I'm not too sure what the point of this book really was. It is more like a phamphlet than an actual book. It gives a brief introduction to Spanish knife fighting, but it's difficult to tell if it is truly authentic and historically accurate. It brevity certainly meant that it is lacking in information. Even for a casual reader, it is a somewhat unsatisfying book. For those who are trying to find out more about the Spanish use of knives, it is definitely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Ninjitsu","review":"This book is pure fantasy. I've talked to people from Sevillian fencing schools who say it just doesn't exist. The book has many geographic inaccuracies.

Within the Filipino arts there are many terms that come from Spanish, and this book sheds light on the original meaning of these terms. James brings the past up to the present, showing how the blade is woven into the fabric of daily life. This is not a book for those interested in a technical teaching approach, but for those who have some understanding and appreciation for skills for surviving this sort of bloody and dangerous encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just A Good Book","review":"Sevillian Steel is not just a good book, it's a great book.

I like the techniques, I like Loriega's writing style, I like his sense of humor, and I like his attitude toward combat in general.

I must admit that I was thoroughly frightened out of my pants and I slept with the lights on that night.However, if it is true that the filming of the movie was made by the actors themselves believing that it was a real situation, than is the price for this level of realism that filmmmakers are trying to achieve really worth it? What I mean to say is to achieve this level of realism in making the movie, is it justified to frighten the hell out of the actors to get such emotions (fear, frustration, panic attacks and desperation) right? What if the actors had suffered mental trauma as a consequence of making this film? Who will be responsible for causing such deep mental trauma?"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Too Believeable","review":"When I first saw the Blair Witch Project (might I note, in an old local theatre whose gothic atmosphere only contributed that much more to the mood) I could have easily believed that it was true. When I left the movie theatre, my stomach was in a knot from the sheer intensity of the viewing.And to take it one more step and create this 'dossier' only makes the storyline that much more realistic and believeable.

Despite what I have heard many people say about The Project, it and this book are two of the best pieces of fiction I have ever encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Scary As Hell!!","review":"This book is a graet supplement to the movie. The book is made to look like a police record of the investigation surrounding the disapprearance of heather, mike, and josh.

I ordered this book, as well as the book by the witch, called Book of Shadows.

This is all a good idea, and a neat marketing gimmick, but the movie is, even at 80-something minutes, mostly a bore.

Needless to say, the book has discouraged me from seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book deepens the movie's sense of possibility and fear","review":"This book extends and intensifies the spooky credibility that makes The Blair Witch Project so delicious. The author has struck just the right balance between play and terror; the documents that support the investigation are really provocative.

The custard came out voluminous; I used about half of what the recipe called for. Otherwise, it was absolutely delicious. I've started making other recipes and they're turning out just as well.The really impressive thing, though, was the selection of dough recipes in the back. I'm not a baker and the first time I made dough according to her directions it turned out flaky and delicious! She has a rare talent for explaining baking.

I purchased the Italian version to compare it to Rosetta Stone's method. The difference in price will tell you which is the better one. This product has good ideas (dialogs & memory games) but Rosetta Stone's approach is sound and well organized.This product DOES have more resources than Rosetta Stone but they're left to the user to figure out how to utilize them when studying the lessons.

It is a deep, mellow uke. A tone that has caught the attention of others as well. I play blues , yes blues!, with it and it delivers like a pro. The strings that come on it are OK, but I soon changed them out or some Aquilla Nylgut strings from Italy. They cost a little more,but wow, the combination of this uke and those strings will turn heads. The equalizer is very responsive and not just for show. Just small adjustments are very discernable. With better strings I'd give it 5 stars, but it will cost you less than $10.00 to make it a 5 star purchase.

You'd probably be better served getting a Goody brand mirror for far cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made, But Ok for the Price...","review":"I bought this mirror because my old one broke and I was looking for an upgrade. The reason I was really interested by this mirror was its large size. It actually is pretty big for a handheld mirror, its a really great feature. But, I have to stay, I was really disappointed by the quality of the handlebar. It's so flimsy! I swear I'll probably break it by the end of the month, and i just got the mirror today. Normally, you'd expect a handlebar on a mirror to be firm and strong, but this is the opposite! The mirror handle and the back of the mirror are just a cheap piece of plastic that encase the mirror. I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed. I would have much better preferred to have paid a few extra dollars for a better quality handle. I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality Mirror and Overpriced - Breaks Easily!","review":"This Mirror came a bit foggy looking and cheap.

I personally would not buy again, or recommend to any friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably shouldn't order a mirror though the mail","review":"opened the package and cracked -- my fault for thinking I could have a mirror shipped to me.

When I opened the shipping box, the box inside had already been opened. When I opened the already once-opened box. The mirror was in pieces. I had to assemble it, but most of the two sided tape (for the back of the mirror) was missing. Also, the mirror was dirty. I had to clean what was supposed to be a brand new mirror. Also, the plastic on the handle was terribly scuffed.In short, the quality control for this mirror is atrocious and/or I got a mirror that somebody else had already returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flimsy, but works.","review":"The mirror itself is nice and large, but the handle/casing is the problem. It's very flimsy and floppy. It feels like a glass flyswatter. Granted, you're not going to be fighting your way out of a bar with a hand mirror, but it does feel poorly made, so I took off one star....but it's really cheap and does the job. It does have a really cool repeating pattern on the back that's molded into the plastic. If you get one, flip it over and take a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The mirror arrived broken and there was no option for returning or exchanging it (other than paying $4.95 for postage -- hardly worth it), so the brand new mirror, shipping box and all went straight to the trash.

This footage is your standard clips of some dunks or assists with a standard spoken text. But there is not a single minute of the Dream Team playing at the Olympics, so the title is misleading. The two stars are for the individual portraits."},{"rating":"1","title":"No effort!","review":"This film had no effort put into it. With so many great players to talk about, it was a particularily dry film. The selection of clips that were supposed to offer insight into the players greatness were often poorly chosen, while little information was uncovered. This movie only has a purpose if you want to know who was actually on the team, but nothing else will be gained from this film. Noteworthy is the absence of Clyde Drexler and Christian Laettner, because this film was made in 1991---before the two were named to the team and a whole year before the team played their first game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tie clip B30","review":"I received this product in a timely manner and my order was correct.

Colin is terrific in this film and is supported by excellent camera work and other interesting effects which add to the creepiness of the film. This is not a horror film (thank God), but rather a psychological thriller shown thru the eyes of the psychotic person suffering, from what amounts to post-traumatic stress syndrome. If you're looking for Mr. Darcy, you won't find him here - in fact, Colin gets to show us his real \\"acting chops\\" as he digs into the mind of Ben."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRAUMATIZED","review":"Other than Colin Firth's compelling performance, there is little else to recommend TRAUMA. A puzzling mind game passed off as \\"artistic film-making\\", the movie never rewards its audience with the payoff of what was real and what was Firth's fantasies. A movie that fails to accomplish a true resolution is merely an exercise in cinematic self-absorption, which is what TRAUMA achieves. Firth does a good job considering his role is so poorly conceived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding performance!","review":"I have never written a review and suspense/thriller is my least favorite genre. Having said that, I watched this movie because of Colin Firth. I think he has been generally underated for years. What pleased me about this film was his absolutely compelling performance. It is a tour de force. Yes, the sound quality was not great, but that did not detract from the power of the internal journey depicted by Mr. Firth. For anyone who ever enjoyed the dashing Mr. D'Arcy...watch this film and see the diligent and concentrated performance of a truly gifted actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traumatic mess","review":"Trauma is a traumatic mess, where you're unable to hear the speaking parts because it's so low. The DVD itself is bad because unless you can read Spanish subtitles, you're out of luck hearing certain parts. Firth is good, but Suvari is as bland as cardboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring","review":"If you saw the trailer like I did, you expect someting else, the guy who did it should get an award just for that, the movie itself is just plain boring, nothing ever happens, all the time you're trying to figure out just what in the world is really going on, and the ending is about the only good thing about this one,only because you're so tired of all the so called psychologycal drama. What really hurts is all the time they killed to get to the truth behind all this mess, I hit the wall watching this one, expected a whole lot more, and it just didn't deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorta' creepy!","review":"An interesting study of a troubled mind. Not quite sure if all of the lead character's marbles had rolled to one side before the \\"Trauma\\" but it seems he was always a few cards short of the proverbial deck. I wanted to root for him but was increasingly suspicious of his sanity and virtue. A bit confusing as to what was real and unreal even at the end. Interesting to see a darker side in Firth's acting abilities. The fact that you're not sure of his character is a testament to his abilities and his facial expression at the end is creepy and suitably demented."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just watch?","review":"I understand that there are a few movies you have to view more than once to 'get it'.... but... those movies make it enticing. This one didn't. I honestly don't want to go through it again. The only conclusions I can come to is that either the character Colin Firth plays is truly mentally sick and we're just watching his life. Or, the important parts of the film ended up on the cutting room floor. There are themes in the movie, like the dead singer who he was obsessed with, that come to no conclusion or explanation... and how the name 'Charlotte' really does impact him is left pretty much up to anyone's guess. And the ants??? what's with the ants???When I'm watching a movie I want to watch a story. Stories have beginnings, middles and ends. The ending should draw the activity to a conclusion. This doesn't happen here. If you have nothing else to watch... this might fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant","review":"Ben (Colin Firth) was in a bad car accident that killed his wife. As the story opens he's in the hospital, coming out of a coma. He goes back to his creepy apartment building where he is the only resident. He cannot come to terms with his wife's death and hallucinates about her constantly. To make things worse, he finds himself the prime suspect in the brutal murder of a famous rock singer.Yikes. This is a bad movie. It attempts to be an art film delving into the mind of a mentally ill man, but falls completely flat and is just one long, confusing, and very unpleasant movie. We never know if what we are seeing is real or imagined; it's too hard to follow and totally repellent. Firth does the best he can with the terrible script but I didn't like or care about his character at all. If you're afraid of creepy crawly creatures, this is not the movie for you; the same goes if you're looking for Firth to be a debonair heartthrob. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring is too good a word for this.","review":"Watching this makes watching grass grow look good. I cannot believe Colin Firth would make a movie that is beyond amateurish. I've seen bad movies and this is as bad as it can be. It seemed to be about five hours long, 4 hours and 59 seconds too long.If you suffer from insomnia, this would be a great aid to make you sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid","review":"A refreshing break from the paranormal romances that have become commonplace in our world today. The works of Sir Doyle will always be some of my favorites. He creates his characters in a way that makes them believable. From Watson's affections to a beautiful girl too the supreme arrogance and slight drug abuse of Sherlock. I fall in love with these stories the more I read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful re-tellings of important stories","review":"This was our first Jim Weiss tape (CD) and is still, many years later, one of our favorites. As the unhappy critic below notes, these are tellings not readings, but Weiss makes that clear (\\"I imagine him sitting...\\"). Noah and the Arc is our favorite, but Abraham and the Idols is a good one for these times, and our girls loved both Ruth and Naomi and Esther. Highly, highly recommended.

It aint good, it aint bad...it's just nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best","review":"Kory and the Fireflies are simply the best. I have followed these guys from the start and have enjoyed watching them grow. They care about their fans, they also care about the type of lyrics that they write.

I'm proud that they came from my home state."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CD LOADED WITH FEEL-GOOD ROCK!!!","review":"We can't count how many CD's from big name bands we've bought with 2 good songs and a bunch of filler. This is a \\"put it in and let it play\\" disc that is solid from cover to cover. With very good songs like \\"With You\\", \\"Platinum\\", and \\"Lester\\" among others, and gems like \\"Sometimes\\", \\"Virginia\\", \\"Pray Tell\\", and \\"Carousel\\", it's amazing how much this CD delivers. And if you've never seen them LIVE, you're in for a treat. The last time we saw them was here in Marshall,MN, and they ROCKED the joint! They were so awesome our group re-arranged our summer plans to catch them in Mitchell, SD on August 28th. We play this CD all the time, and every party, somebody wants to know who they are, and where they can get the disc. If you like straight-ahead, feel-good, make you move pop/rock, then RADIATE is the disc for you. If talent, quality, and consistency equal success, then \\"RADIATE\\" should be a national platinum hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says rock is dead?","review":"Picked up this album on a whim and am pleasantly surprised.

Kory and the rest of the guys put on great live shows as well. I've seen 4 of them and each one is better and better. They do some pretty catchy covers live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Crichton dull by comparison","review":"I dont know what else Knepp has written, but I absolutely loved reading this book. I must say, I am a fairly slow reader, but breezed through his pages.His ideas and approach are very unique--I mean how many other books have you read with a plot involving evolutionary science, televangelism, archeology, and developing African nations?The bottom line is that its one of the more unique stories I've read this year, and in my opinion would make a great movie--with or without Spielberg's Dr. Jones character.Ill keep searching for other works by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good addition to your arsenal","review":"I like this program. It should not be the only aid used in learning Japanese, though. It DID help my pronounciation a bit. You can hide the translation boxes to see what you do or don't understand while the program plays.This program does NOT use Japanese syllabry; it uses Romaji instead. When playing the games or quizes you have to spell romaji correctly. I wa never good at the type of romaji they use (ie I prefer to use \\"o-\\" rather than \\"oo\\"). It has a characture chart, but there are better ways to learn Hiragana and Katakana.All the dialogs are good, though. They do not teach grammer, or explain verb conjugation. For these reasons, it is best to be studying another way and use this program as a passive review, or practice....AGAIN, use his to supplement your studies only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"I gave this program a fair shake, and overall I'm quite unimpressed. One of the program's key features in my book is the ability to say a word and have it judge you based on sound, pitch, etc. Great in theory, but imagine my surprise when I found out I could say anything at all, such as \\"Cheeto\\" and still get a perfect score so long as I mimicked the speaker even a little. This program also does very little to teach grammar rules.Basically, if you already know some Japanese and you're just looking for a vocab builder, it might be worth getting it cheap. You can cheat the speech system, but if you really do try and read the graphs, you can tell if you're actually getting it right or not. It's a sub par tool, but a tool none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Software","review":"Japanese Now is really good software to learn Japanese with. It is very helpful and I recomend it. This software offers many various ways to learn or practice Japanese and all the features are great.

The program was not helpful for learning how to speak and carry a conversation unless you are already fluent. In which case, why would you need the learning software?

The Power Japanese and Rosette Stone Japanese softwares were much more helpful in furthering my language studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn Japanese? Don't waste your money!","review":"I was looking for a product that would help me learn some basic Japanese - a few words and phrases. Instead, I got the worst interface imaginable... and I get to see a lot of bad interfaces in my job as Information Architect. I've used a couple of different language CD products as primers to upcoming foreign trips and both were wonderful by comparison. The 'Bonus CD' that comes with this package has a grammar checker for every language EXCEPT Japanese... perhaps that makes sense of the editorial review that mentions \\"Learn Japanese Now! also adds online features that create an interesting and authentic atmosphere, making learning ITALIAN fast, fun, and highly effective.\\" Italian? Well, it certainly doesn't make learning Japanese the slightest bit fun or effective.Do yourself a favor, when it comes to \\"Learn Japanese Now! 9.0\\" keep your credit card in your wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless. Absolutely worthless.","review":"Save your money.The interface is god-awful, buggy as hell, and the program clearly was rushed out for production. Little thought has been put into this program.The games are cheesy, stupid and boring.However, one cool feature was a section with extremely short video segments with the corresponding Japanese (in romaji) scrolling on the left side. I would pay good money for a program that did just that in more extensive amounts.Hope this helps prevent people from wasting their $39.99 on this program.-sev"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"This may have been their best album as a duo (after Dan Peek left). They strike the right balance between their own material and that of outside writers.

Challenger and Happy Song are ultimate classics, and you can get this album just to have these two in your collection, if you're into that style of music, of course.I know nothing about the band, sounds like little kids singing, which resembles the style of Video Kids, but the music is pleasing to the ear and sets your feet in motion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal slice of WW2 history","review":"I read the book in the '60's and want to read it again. I knew Lillian in 1963/1964. Already in her 40's or so, she went back to school at San Bernardino Valley College to get her LVN degree. Today we would be called licenced practical nurses. she was a wonderfully warm, intelligent person with a great sense of humor and all came through in the book. She was also a great nurse with empthey and gentleness for her patients.Her book shows a slice of history from her experiences in Iran. There are so many stories of the personal time of people serving inWW2 that are now lost. I am glad we have Lillians.JoAnn"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game is Great!!!!","review":"The Rescue at Hogwarts is one of the best games I've seen! The details of the game board and pieces is awsome. They really look like they are from the movie \\"Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban\\"! It also is one of the only games I've seen that you have to work together with another person against the clock (i.e. The Time Turner)instead of working against the other person in order to win the game. I would recommend this game to all Harry Potter fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Game","review":"I bought this game for a friend's daughter, and I'd say this is better than most other Harry Potter games. (Though that may not be saying much.)

Bego does nothing more than recycle interviews and rip off Rich Wiseman's book. There is no new information about Browne in here--Bego didn't speak to anyone close to Browne for this book and his research is limited to major U.S. publications, and he frequently gets the information wrong.I'm a fan of Browne's, but this book isn't worth reading or buying. Bego is a hack who didn't even bother fact checking his material. I'm just wondering how he has the nerve to call himself a writer and how he got a publisher for this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative","review":"First of all, Jackson Browne hates to have his private life, open to all. Second, as people before me have said, there is nothing new in this book. The worst though is third, the author puts a negative look on almost everything Jackson does, except his really main stream songs, such as Somebodys baby or Running on Empty which ARE great songs but his lesser known political songs/albums get almost trashed in this book, the songs that I believe are some of his best ever. I cannot believe that someone would publish this horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"If you look at the other books the author has written, you'll see that he just spits out these celebrity biographies as quickly as he can to make a buck, without taking the time to do any new research. Like the other reviewers said, this book is a complete waste of time and is so carelessly written, with many errors in songtitles and dates, etc. Mark Bego should be ashamed of himself for producing such a poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing, recycled facts, good bibliography","review":"As others have said, Rich Wiseman's book is much better, and this takes far too much from that book. Bego has far too many outright factual errors, does nothing original, and his writing...well, let's say that the writing is weak, simplistic, lazy, and just bad. Jackson Browne is by far my favorite, but he sure didn't deserve this lousy treatment. The one part I liked was the many footnotes and bibliography, to go back to the original source for most of the information. Calling this regergitative writing is being kind. Enjoy JB, but get your information for better sources, and better writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I couldn't finish the book due to how terribly written it was. And what's the deal with all those shadow boxes throughout the book, those annoying boxes with a repeat sentence in it? What's that all about?

I normally save my books, but this one went into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A patchwork of old articles, interviews and speculation","review":"I thumbed through this at a book store. Trust me, there's nothing new here, and not much that's any of our business. It's a shallow and feeble attempt to create the biography of someone who really only wishes to be understood through his art. I can almost see this \\"author\\" sitting cross-legged on the floor, Scotch-taping his Jackson Browne articles and clippings into a book. The truth is that anyone who's truly paid attention to Jackson's music over the years should understand that it's always had as much (or more) to do with our lives as his...leave the guy alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something totally different for Phil","review":"I was very impressed with Phil's big band sound,for me the jazz version of against all odds was worth the price of the CD alone it gave me chills,and the 12 minute version of \\"Pick up the pieces\\" is AWESOME to crank up and \\"FUNK OUT\\" to,I had bought this CD just because it was Phil and although it sounds nothing like Phil I can still really get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected ...","review":"If you like live \\"big band\\" sound, then this album is for you.

But this true story is a major drag, and you need a great deal of faith to keep going.Hopefully the next book will once again engage an interesting story with the poetics of his use of language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome music, ridiculous pricing","review":"The music is incredible.

Matt was pretty much an arrogant jerk throughout the book and Jessica's integity was lacking. I still don't understand why Jessica liked Matt anyway.I also tend to hate any book that has the \\"hero\\" having sex with other women, especially after he has met the \\"heroine\\". And I do not care to read about anyone else having sex besides the two main characters. In this book there are many such sex scenes written in great detail (yuck). The only redeeming part of this book was the romance between Adam and Gwen. I really wish the whole book had been about them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too naive","review":"Kat Martin's writing style is just not my cup of tea, I guess. I found the book too naive and far from reality. This is a romance for people who want to dream more than to read a believable love story. Jessica was too perfect (even her imperfections were perfect once we learned why she was behaving the way she was behaving), the interaction between the hero and heroine was predictable (he just happened to be somewhere always when needed, accidentally) and the conflicts, however difficult they seemed, were always solved easily. I guess I am more a Lisa Kleypas, Meagan McKinney or Johanna Lindsey (not all of her books, though) person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I do not know why, but this book started to bore me after the first 100 pages.

Its well constructed and the level delivers more than adequate pressure. BUT the coupler is nothing but problems. It fits on a grease fitting easily, but will not come off. I have to unscrew the tip to remove it. Not only is this a major pain, but it also causes the grease fittings to loosen.There is another Amazon review that talks about problems removing the coupler - but it gives the problem 5 stars. If you have to wrestle with the gun with each grease fitting, its not very useful.One more thing - the instructions are really lame. I took apart the coupler, hoping to find some problem and referred to the parts diagram to reassemble. Low and behold - the coupler parts are not shown in the diagram.I've registered a complaint on Linclon's website, but have yet to hear from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more frustration.","review":"After spending more than 2 hours trying to get a gun from Autozone loaded, I gave up. An online search pointed to Lincoln as one of the better solutions. Amazon had the 1134 delivered for only $4 more than the Autozone gun + 18\\" hose. Once you open the package, the difference in quality between the two is astounding...the Lincoln probably weighs 50% more than the Autozone gun. The design is much better with the plunger having a lock that will still work once grease gets on it, unlike the Azone version. The Lincoln primed without fuss as well; the usual frustration point for grease guns. From opening the Lincoln's box to putting all the tools away took less than an hour...including assembling/loading gun, having to move the 4Runner up/down the ramps several times to get the drive shaft zerks rotated into an accessible position, and cleanup. Oh, yeah, hit a couple of zerks on the mower during that time as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is supposed to do!","review":"I just received my grease gun yesterday and so far so good. While the manual doesn't do a great job explaining how to install the grease tube, or which way to twist the handle to release the plunger, it is pretty easy once you have it in front of you.Build quality seems great! It is very heafty. I was able to attach the nipple to my Seadoo drive shaft boot without issue. A very noticable click, a few pumps till grease came out and I was good to go. You need to twist and pull the fitting off so it may not work if you don't have enough working room to do so. This looks like it will last me for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Delivery - Good Grease Gun","review":"Lincoln 1134Item ordered on a Saturday and arrived on the next Monday.

The piston hangs up on the lip of the grease cartridges. The pump seems to produce only half of the stroke of grease - like there is some air in the system.

I would not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to Toss out the Lever-Action Grease gun","review":"I've been struggling for years with my lever action grease gun as you really do need a third hand to use it. I finally got fed up enough and did some research on-line and noticed the LINCOLN model had the best ratings. I love the way it locks onto a fitting and doesn't leak all round the sides of the fitting instead of going into the fitting as my old gun did....(made a mess and wasted grease) The Lincoln forces all the grease into the fitting easily...once you snap onto the fitting you only need ONE hand to operate! This is a quality piece of equipment and worth every penny especially with the best price and free shipping from Amazon. Now I wont get aggravated and talk myself out of greasing the cars and lawn tractor as I should be.....THANK YOU LINCOLN INDUSTRIAL 1134....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln Grease Gun","review":"After trying out the pistol grease gun by Lincoln, I was amazed at how easily it pumps grease at -10F here in Alaska. The 18\\" whip hose comes in very handy for reaching grease fittings on a snowmobiles undercarriage. Loading grease cartridges was simple, after setting the new tube in place simply screw the tube housing back on and before tightening release the push rod to evacuate the air from the inside. Once all the air is out just five pumps from the handle and your in business. There is a upside and downside about the grease coupler, it is somewhat hard to remove from the fitting & pulling with a constant pressure is preferred. The upside is the fact that you don't have to push the coupler onto the fitting while pumping grease. That 6\\" rigid pipe is great too, I love this product and will purchase the needle tip for this product as well later. All in all a great product and planning to having it for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Grease Gun I've ever used","review":"This is without a doubt the best grease gun I've ever laid hands on. Is a $300 gun better? Maybe, but who cares when you can get the durability & comfort of this one for 1/10 the price?! This thing is awesome. If you're looking for a new grease gun & have been disappointed with pistol grip guns in the past, this is the one you are looking for. I rarely use my lever gun any more, as this one develops so much pressure with just one hand. Amazon also has it for about $10 less than I can buy the same gun locally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Build Quality...Same Air Problems as All Others","review":"You can't beat the build quality or how well it works....once you get the air out after installing a new cartridge.

When I tried the hoodia, I don't feel hungry when I get off work. I end up eating around 6 or 7pm...not because I'm hungry but because I know I should eat. And I don't end up eating too much or binging either. I notice that you do need to take the hoodia pill 1 hour prior to your meal time...otherwise it won't really work. You don't have to buy the Desert Burn brand or anything unless you need something REALLY strong. I bought this and Desert Burn...I returned the Desert Burn because the Hoodia from Source Naturals worked well enough and it's much cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have small wrist","review":"Beautiful bracelet, I was so hoping it would fit.

I've only listened to CD a few times so it hasn't yet sank its hooks into me. His previous two efforts \\"This Perfect World\\" and \\"Never Home\\" are still at the top of my CD rack, however, I'm not sure how long this one will stay. His lyrics are effective as ever, but he's beginning to abandon country/western roots- which isn't necesarrily a terrible thing. Parts of the album come off as a little poppy for my taste, though this is nothing you'll here on the charts. Overall, I recommend it both as a fan and aa a fellow, former citizen of the Wheat State."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Freedy's high standards","review":"Although there are a couple of bright spots on this CD, I would recommend first-timers going with a more consistent and, frankly, better album, like This Perfect World. Johnston should have foregone the temptation to let T-bone Burnett produce the soul out of this record (as Burnett has done with other artists). It's sounding a little too baby-boomerish for my taste, rather like when Sting lost his mind and started putting out sclock. Then again, most of the blame probably lies with Johnston himself on this CD, not the production values. The songs just aren't up to par for this amazing artist, who had previously put out almost nothing but incredibly beautiful, restrained yet infectious songs. I just hope he gets back to business on the next record. Still love ya, Freedy, despite this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps...","review":"Perhaps he needed to fulfill a contractual obligation. Perhaps the muse has gone AWOL. Perhaps he just has songwriter's cramp. Perhaps Jim Keltner and T-Bone Burnett were doing court ordered community service. Perhaps he's just saving his good stuff and plans to take over the singer-songwriter world with a breakthrough blockbuster release right around Christmas. Perhaps he's been short-changed and did not receive his full 15 minutes. Perhaps he's just really, really sad. Perhaps this disc is on the cutting edge of modern music and I just can't recogonize it. Perhaps it just plain stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Surprise","review":"This is a surprisingly good CD. It's mellow, lyrical, and musical, and the best Freedy yet. Changed Your Mind is a great song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still a classic","review":"BDBN is very different than the rest of Freedy's catalog. Very mellow and more folk-jazz than folk-rock like previous releases. It's still a great album though. It's spareness really shows off Freedy's voice and there are still some great melodies but they take a little longer to sink in. Moving on a Holiday and Underwater Life are already among my favorite Freedy tunes. If you at all enjoy this album, or his others for that matter, catch Freedy live. You'll be blown away! I think I only gave this 4 out of 5 since I heard most of the album performed live and it just can't compare.

I carefully followed the manual instructions, even trying two sets of new batteries. A communication from Flytech's online support division confirmed that I was doing things right.

Every dart that hit the board stuck well. Some were even hard to get out. One caution - Don't bend the dart when you pull it out otherwise you will ruin the tip.

The author leads readers throught the rituals of Uncle Cefus' \\"great hand\\" in reuniting the murdered coachwhip snakes with their rightful homeland, and in the process leads us to believe that doing right by others may do more for luck and success than any amount of hard work. Not only is the novel poetic, but passionate, clearly exhibiting the author's love of folklore. The ficticious account is equally instructive in the lost art of conjuring (which slipped away in the 1960's).

But along the way she encounters a host of Halloween characters who hitch a ride on the broom including a skeleton, pumpkin, Mummy, black cat, ghost, and a bat. Soon the broomstick comes crashing to the ground under all the weight. They arrive to the party only to find that all of the food is gone. The group then decides to go trick or treating and eventuall crash a kid's Halloween party. With their bellies full it's off home on a sturdy new mop!

A complete and utter waste of time and so poor compared to the Yankees encyclopedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to the release of this book for months. Unfortunately, it was a major disappointment.Unlike other team encyclopedias, this one focuses on statistical recaps rather than providing the anecdotes that make following baseball so enjoyable. For instance, the book mentions Jim Lonborg's decline after the 1967 season, but doesn't explain why (he broke his leg in an off-season skiing accident). Also, it has dozens of factual errors (Rick Aguilera started with the Mets, not the Yankees).It's a shame that such a half-hearted effort was made. True Red Sox fans will be tremendously disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trump is a genius!!!","review":"You can not deny that Donald Trump is a genius-he is able to make money in television with \\"The Apprentice\\", real estate deals,books, and the most important asset-the Trump name.This book, which is not as impressive as his last(How To Get Rich)could have been written by anyone.

Comments like this are a wolf in sheeps clothing, this is just bad business advice from a guy who doesn't follow it. Donald marries girls with prenup contracts that are flawless and for good reason, is that to say that he marries people he believes are bad? No, he just writes fluff advice in his books that he doesn't follow.

The grease was included loose in the package and the ATV rack crushed all of the cartridges making them unusable and making a mess of all of the other products ordered. I was able to clean up the other items with considerable difficulty, but the grease itself was a total loss. This problem was due to Amazon's packaging. The outer carton was in perfect shape. The grease should not have been placed in a package with another heavy, shifting item.Too say the least, I am very disappointed with Amazon's poor quality packing.

This is a short story which is stretched out. Not the greatest writing, and although it is a fast read, since you know the ending from the start, there really isn't much point. The movie got a lot of acclaim when I was young, but I never saw it, and always wondered what the title meant. Now that I know it refers to euthanasia, I am not all that interested.

Feh."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie, skip the book","review":"They Shoot Horses Don't They? is a good example of creativity bringing a basically lifeless book into a stirring human drama on the silver screen. I found the book to be nothing more than a 15 page short story expanded dramatically through the use of pages that contain nothing more than the date and time. The book is supposed to be the recollections of a condemmed man but is instead a short, dull monologue devoted to lifeless characters and flat plot lines. While the plot certainly has some potential, as seen in the big screen version, anyone who watches the film and then reads the book is sure to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Vol. 3","review":"Personally i thought this was better than the third one.

I feel he doesn't have much of a personal stamp.

Thomson's Symphonies from the same series. Now that's memorial music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Bad Boy","review":"Years ago I learned that Antheil was the \`bad boy of (American) music', so I wondered how his music should sound. Well, if this is a bad boy, he definitely has become more boy than bad. For my ears this are well-crafted symphonies with sometimes-piquant harmonies and a jazz-rhythm here and there.But they gave me great pleasure in these very good performances. For me it's unbelievable that Naxos can give us such great series like these American Classics, almost for nothing. I hope they will record one or two of Antheil's ballets too. And in the meantime CPO is doing a great job by recording all of Antheil's symphonies in exemplary performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Be Heard","review":"I'm surprised these symphonies are not better known. They both have crowd pleasing qualities, and the 4th could easily become a standard at 4th of July concerts. It would be great if American music was more widely known and appreciated. Sure Copeland is terrific, but there are so many others who deserve to be heard.

You might say, well, it's supposed to be bad. Sorry, I don't buy that. The great thing about Bat Boy, Reefer Madness, and Little Shop of Horrors -- three shows that Evil Dead would like to be when it grows up -- is that they have quality scores, although Reefer isn't quite in the same class as the other two.

My father was a thirty-year army man and this was our second tour in europe. I was grade school age and just about the only american entertainment around was the base movie house. Anyway, every saturday afternoon they showed a couple of serial chapters with a feature. The Masked Marvel was one of the ones I remember most. However, on the day that the last chapter was to be shown I had the flu and i never did get to see how it ended. THANK GOD FOR VIDEO! It's still great after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"the masked marvel","review":"I enjoyed this serial which was done by the republic studios in 1943- Tom Steel and his group of stunt men called the cousins with the coleadinfg stunt man Dale Van Sickle carrid the film in addition to it main actors. Set during World War 2 Johnnie Arthur who played Sakima the Japanese spy and sabateur had william forrest a fine actor as his american turncoat and Anthony Ward who played killer Mace [a very good actor]who lead a group of thugs helping Sakima cripple the american war effort. Tom Steel who played the Masked Marvel lead four American Agents tracking down and bringing Sakima and his men to earth. The 12 chapter serial provide fast action and gave a lot of good quality entertainment.

I love Nicolas Cage. While I don't agree with the casting choice for the kid, I really liked the film. Good direction with the effects. Not too much. I think overall it's a great story line and opened the ending so that there could be a sequel or pre-quel! I like an actor that can bend him/herself to any genre. That is what Cage does. Just as this film gives us a What if senario. Good subtle humor and action along with \\"what's going to happen in the end\\" feeling.

We've watched it once a month since it was released. Of course it helps that we both love most Nicholas Cage films. We had it on DVD, but recently bought it on Blu-Ray. It's like we bought a whole new movie. It's amazing the things we pick up with the blu-ray over the DVD.The story line is easy enough to follow, but it takes a few times to see all the subtleties in the plot. Cage was excellent in his role, but we both thought the apprentice could have been cast better, especially since he had the lead role. It's a bit dark in a few places making it inappropriate for children, but it isn't overly violent. It's nice to find a movie that isn't overrun with sex and foul language, thank you Disney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun.","review":"This latest film from Walt Disney Pictures & Jerry Bruckheimer Films is pretty good fun.

Enraged, I popped it out and pitched it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Even worse than the director, Jon Turtletaub, usually makes. Jay Baruchel is usually pretty charming and here he looks like a Borscht Belt hack. Nicholas Cage seems to have forgotten how to act (plus let's face it, he's just creepy). Molina, who is an extremely good actor, has been made to look like he never's been in front of a camera before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorcery, but no magic","review":"This is definitely a summer movie, the kind to watch when the theater's air conditioning holds as much attraction as what's on screen. The special effects were specially effective, I have to admit, but the whiny, nasal nerd with the pompadour didn't do it for me. And, with that lab he had, I would have expected at least the dog to be named Igor. (Is Dave really the kind who'd keep sports equipment in his science sanctum?) That cleanup scene - well, a certain well-known mouse already owns that. Teresa Palmer did a great job being cute and saveable, but her big moment at the end just didn't fit her character all that well. And so on - there wasn't much actively wrong with the movie, just not much very right with it.The audience, when I saw this, consisted largely of parents with kids in the 8-10 range. It was probably great for them (the kids, I mean). I could have passed on this one.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"I don't understand how any sane person could enjoy this movie. Having been forced to watch it, I can say without hesitation that this movie is truly awful. The acting is pretty bad, although Nicholas Cage gets a special mention for playing the same character he has played in every movie he has acted in over the past twenty years. Is Nicholas Cage even capable of playing a character besides the \\"wise mentor with a dark past\\" at this point? The special effects are only decent, making any value this movie might have had irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who ever cast this movie should be sued","review":"This movie would have been ok (not really good but ok) if they had not cast a terribly homely kid with ZERO charisma, no acting skills or any perceivable talent of any kind for the lead role. It might not have been as bad had the kid (Jay Baruchel) SHUT UP at least for a moment or two during the movie. All I can remember is his whining and more whining................ Oh my God he's annoying! Through part of the movie it seemed he was trying to channel Jerry Lewis but that didn't work for him at ALL. Jay Baruchel SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!! Jerry Lewis was comedic genius. Jerry oozed charisma unlike Jay.Please someone take Jay Baruchel out of the movies so he can't ruin anymore movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain aweful","review":"This could have been such a great movie..

It could have been so much better than it was. Ultimately, we have to talk about writing, because that's where the trouble all began. Even so, I don't blame the screenwriters, not the one or ones who came up with the original idea. I'd have to blame the producers or beancounters. Who else would have made them come up with that insufferable and completely unnecessary prologue? Nine times out of ten, if you think your book or movie needs a prologue, believe me, it doesn't. We are not stupid. You told us the prologue as the movie progressed, just like you're supposed to. And all the places I thought this movie was going to go that would have been far more fun, well. It didn't go there. Such a great concept. And it fell completely flat.

I guess after just watching How to Train Your Dragon and The Last Airbender, the magic just got old. But if I had watched this movie first, I would have given it 5 stars probably. I just really enjoyed How to Train Your Dragon because it had more funny parts. But this movie is definately one to watch. The magic is much better in this than it is in the Last Airbender. Anyways, this is a movie to check out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romance","review":"My husband and I were looking forward to seeing the Sourcerer's Apprentice with great enthusiasm, as we enjoy good magical videos and really like Nicholas Cage. The movie was interesting and has some cool special effects. However we both felt that it centered too much on romance and not enough on the training of the sorcerer's apprentice. If you like romances then this is a must go. If you're into magic, the romance outweighs the magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprised","review":"My friend loves Nick Cage movies because they are usually easy to make fun of; so when she dragged me to this one we were expecting it to be a typical Nick Cage movie.

I feel bad for the big name actors in the film. Their performances were fine of course, but even their talent couldn't save such a vapid absence of plot. The movie was empty. Flat. Shallow. I'm having difficulty describing the movie without letting Turret's Syndrome get the best of me. It's almost impossible to describe this film without the use of profanity. If I could sue Disney to get back the 109 minutes of my life I wasted watching this, rest assured I would.

The storyline is pretty predictable, yawn. I feel like I have wasted 109 minutes of my life with this film so hopefully no one else will have to suffer the same fate. Jay Baruchel (the apprentice) looks much better on the cover than in the movie. Where did they find this guy? The way he laughs, OMG, is so so annoying. He is supposed to be this nerdy physics genius but he sure does a lot of stupid things. I give it two stars for Nicolas Cage and his giant eagle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just watched it.....and watching it again","review":"In this day and age of doom and gloom and political/economic mayhem, this movie was pure entertainment.

They should have called this movie \\"The Sorcerer's Tetchy Apprentice\\". The main character, who literally is a mental case in the beginning of the film, complains through most of the movie.Nicolas Cage, who plays the sorcerer, groggily drifts through this movie. He looked like he was watching himself in this movie - bored. There are lots of magical special effects here, some are better than others but there is nothing really outstanding in this film. This movie seems like it was made by a committee of marketing executives. Unless you are a Nicolas Cage super-fan, pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame storyline but Good Special Effects","review":"the storyline is old hat, there are big gaps in continuity, the editing isn't as good as it should be and Nicholas Cage is dreadful but not as dreadful as the nerdy guy who plays the lead or the blonde actress who needs remedial acting lessons. I felt bad that Alfred Molina had to sink so low...his evil shines and he steals every scene from Nicholas Cage who doesn't even bother to phone in his performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatuous Apprentice","review":"The promos were great. The scene where the Merlinean Ring wraps itself around the \\"chosen\\" one's finger is what made me buy the DVD. And it seems that was the only good scene in the movie. Nicholas Cage looked jaded almost bored. The director was unsure if he had set out to make a movie for kids or for the baby boomers, a comedy or an adventure. Why does the Prime Merlinean, who is supposed to save the world from the vicious Morgana, act and look like a bird brain? In movies where it is about saving the world, the hero can not be a fatuous bum. I have recently watched a few such disasters, which suffered from this very problem (read my review on The Green Lantern and R.A One). Barring one or two scenes, this movie left me cold. Looking at the price tag on the DVD, I'd rate this movie as highly-avoidable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dresden, is that you?","review":"It's not you?

I bought these compression sacs because of the positive reviews as well as positive experiences I've had with Eagle Creek products in the past (their luggage, in particular). However, these bags are truly worthless. They are like big Ziploc bags made with slightly thicker plastic. As I was testing one out, eager to find out how well it would compress some clothes for an upcoming trip, the yellow slider thing that closes the bag at the top popped off. I thought, \\"Perhaps I overpacked it,\\" so I took some clothes out and tried again. But the slider kept popping off. For $18 this should have worked A LOT better. I don't know, maybe I just don't have the magic touch that the other reviewers have.

People who like Poke'mon today are living in the past. I do not like Poke'mon anymore. As a matter of fact I recently sold this game and all the other Poke'mon stuff I had like cards and other games. Poke'mon was once the hottest thing around. But after they made that movie, Poke'mon went down.

Zante raisins (Vitis vinifera) are fine as raisins go, but they are not the antioxidant powerhouses that real currants are, and they do not have the complex flavor that the rest of the world associates with black currants.

The available memory and battery life are more than sufficient for the new PDA user and the design is very sharp in my opinion. The memory stick technology is an ingenious way to expand/transfer memory between the clie, pc and other digital toys. However, Sony has done a poor job of matching the peripherals/accessories that are offered by Palm. You get no where near the variety with Sony that you do with a Palm or Visor product.

The clie is a good value, in many ways better than what Palm has to offer, but it has a couple of design flaws. Sony can be kind of arrogant in its cost-cutting:- There is no \\"recharge\\" indicator LED on the unit or on the power adapter. There is the lighning bolt that appears when it is turned on, but an indicator light on the power plug would be useful too.- There is no hold button, so the Clie spontaneously discharges itself in your pocket. This has happened to me a number of times. For some reason the buttons are just especially easy to press by mistake.- In my particular case, the Clie stopped working after about 6 months of light use. It just would not turn on.

It was good support 24/7, but the tech said that he'd \\"run across the problem before.\\" - Seemed like he was understating the number of times this happened.

Their recommendation that I buy a new computer so my Clie would work with it pushed the limits of outrageousness.A little research showed that Palm and Visor products do work with 95, so those companies assure me there would be no incompatibility.Sony--why don't you advertise this peculiarity so other people don't waste so much of their time and yours!Roger"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low priced = low quality","review":"I bought this from Best Buy on sale, and it died after 1 month of light usage.

You can go through great works of literature or television segments or travelogues to build comprehension, vocabulary, etc. I'd also recommend this company's WordAce, which is a talking dictionary, but also contains grammar and synonym quizzes.

The novel just seemed incredibly amateurish and the writing was very cliched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Fiction based on Strongbow and Aoife","review":"This is not one of Llywelyn's better efforts. The book is historical fiction loosely based on Strongbow and his Irish wife, Aoife. It is written in first person alternating between two narrators which requires, at times, keeping track of who is talking. Considering the emphasis the book seems to place on wives and daughters, it completely neglects any mention of the daughter of Strongbow and Aoife who was the heiress who inherited his estates (he had no surviving sons). It is at odds, on various points, with conventional history and genealogy and is not recommended as a source. Llywelyn could have done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"It was a very interesting book, with a lot of cool irish mythology, and even historical facts. It made me want to read more of Morgan Llywelyn's books. It was a very entertaining book, that kept me reading once i started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but bad history","review":"Weir is a very good writer. Her work sometimes read like novels. Unfortunatly, her Richard III work should be in the novel section. I do not find More's, or Vergil's works to be of much use for historians. After all they wrote during the reign, and in the pay of, the man who replaced Richard on the throne. Weir finds them telling the absolute truth at times. She ignores pieces of evidence that don't support her theory and presents things out of context, such as Richard's moral condemnation of Jane Shore. Weir neglects to mention that in the same letter, Richard sets her free to marry one of his advisors. I don't know if Richard or Henry or the Duke of Buckingham did it, but this is one take on the murders that should be left on the shelf. There are much better works on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical read","review":"The Princes in the Tower offers a clear and engaging look at the often confusing War of the Roses. Politics and power plays are interwoven with the narration of the Princes' fate. Weir does an excellent job of trying to solve the mystery of their disappearence using circumstancial evidence and historical accounts.This is not an historical tome, but a painless and well-researched view of one of history's most famous murder mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Classic Weir","review":"If you don't know anything about Richard III and the kids in the Tower, this is a nice, entertaining orientation (even if others argue that it's inaccurate) that is an extremely quick read (particularly compared to Weir's \\"Wars of the Roses,\\" the reading time of which may be measured in ice ages). I cannot judge the accuracy or inaccuracy of her arguments or evidence because this is the first book I read. That said, I very much liked the book, was glad I read it, and am more motivated to read other books on the subject (ones they may be more pro-Richard even)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced to the max","review":"I have not yet formed an opinion concerning whether or not Richard III was responsible for the Princes' deaths. I looked to this book for a balanced view, as advertised and reviewed. I was shocked at the partisan nature of the arguments. I am a lawyer and the book was in most respects an advocate's brief--not an informative, \\"both sides presented\\" book. I have no objection to the author's espousing the \\"Richard's guilty\\" viewpoint, just to the way in which the book is marketed as a non-partisan examination of the evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely written, but very flawed","review":"Poor use of source material and an apparent preformed bias against Richard III makes this supposed \\"historical\\" work into a nothing more than a nice fiction story.I was very disappointed in the author, as I have enjoyed some of her previous work. Please *don't* take this work as a good historical reference of the Richard III controversy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be classed in the fiction section","review":"What a shame that many readers, unfamiliar with the subjects, will take Weir's words as the truth. In fact, many novels are better written and researched than this book is. To find out more about the princes in the tower, try reading almost any book but this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction attempting to pass for serious history","review":"This book has a bibliography but no footnotes or source citations. If you are a serious history student, don't waste your time on this book. It isn't worth the paper it's written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad history. Really, really bad.","review":"I'd heard good things about this book and, being long interested in the historical mystery surrounding the deaths of the young Edward V and his brother, Richard, Duke of York, I thought I'd give it a try. What a crock. Weir makes much of the \\"first hand\\" report of Thomas More -- who was only five years old at the time and all of whose sources were third-hand. She seems to subscribe to the \\"where there's smoke, there's fire\\" school of historical causation, citing the fact that there was so many rumors floating about at the time linking Richard III to the deaths of the boys. She seems to be entirely unaware of the Tudor virtuosity at propaganda. No credentials are given in the blurb on the author to suggest what her background might be in doing historical research, but they can't be much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare is better!","review":"I have never read a book before with such a power to enrage me. Even though I am a Ricardian, I normally don't mind people having other views than mine, but this is too much. Ms Weir seems determined to discredit Richard, while using biased Tudor-sources as contemporaries!!! I mean, give him a hunchback and it's Shakespeare. But he writes better. Read Charles Ross and Paul Kendall, if you want real biographies of Richard, the traditionalist or revisionist versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as persuasive as Weir thinks","review":"I read Alison Weir's book after reading Penman's the Sunne in Splendor. While I found it informative and highly readable, I felt that she had ignored other plausible scenarios and relied unduly on More. For example, she dismisses Buckingham as the murderer with little analysis except that he could not have gotten past Richard's gatekeeper at the tower, a proposition inconsistent with Buckingham's key role at that time. She also ignores the fact that, if Richard killed the princes, it was the worst possible timing. She states that he killed them to prevent a rebellion, but that is exactly what occurred upon their death and Richard must have known, as Weir later concludes, that \\"the princes posed a greater thret in life than death.\\" In sum, I enjoyed the read, but didn't agree with Weir there is \\"only one plausible solution\\" to the mystery.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I've read a bunch of Weir's other works and I've liked them all, but after having read this I began doubting her other works. Having read nearly a dozen accounts of Richard III's life and his relationship to the princes, I can say that this is more or less a rehashing of Sir Thomas More's UNFINISHED biography of RIII. Her whole case rests on the work of More, whose work has been questioned, most notbably and effectively by Horace Walpole.Weir questions her own sources and then uses them to prove her point the \\"Richard did it\\". An earthshattering conclusion? Not by any means, but the way she gets there is somewhat lazy and ignores some pretty decent scholarship on the subject. Most of what we \\"know\\" about RIII comes from Shakespeare's play, which is based on More. Weir didn't seem to stray any further than Shakespeare (the Oliver Stone of the Elizabethian age) to come to her conclusion.Again, not her best work. She does a much better job with the Tudors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts, Anyone?","review":"This is the type of book in which the author daydreams his/her way through it. What is simply speculation, rumor, hint and flat-out tall tale, becomes fact under the pen of the wishful author. \\"It probably isn't so, but I am a respected author, and if I say it is so, people usually believe me.\\" It is the sort of book for someone who is probably only going to read one book on Richard III, so Weir hammers the reader over the head with her theories, to make her point so thoroughly that the reader won't even want to get another opinion. Try Paul Murray Kendall, Jeremy Potter or Charles Ross on Richard III and become acquainted with solid scholarship. One star is one too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very badly done!","review":"I agree completely with David above. It is shameful to me that this book is considered a biography. And as to an objective and unbiased account of the subject, this is laughable. You'd be better off reading a more scholarly book on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be considered a decent work of fiction","review":"This is a great book for those people who believe that anything published in a book must be true. For the rest of you, it should be good for some laughs. Weir is a master of creative logic, repeatedly using conflicting pieces of information to support her hypothesis as she runs through the entire list of logic no-no's and fallacious reasoning. Poor Richard must be rolling in his grave. The only surprise here is that she does not blame him for the holocaust and the crash of '29. What a farce!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tudor Propaganda at its best!","review":"To the unititiated on this subject, Alison Weir portrays an unbiased,even-handed history. Unfortunately, she is far from unbiased. She starts with the a priori assumption of King Richard's guilt. This is largely an old re-hash of the Tudor propaganda version of the event. The problem with Weir is in her evaluation of sources. By arguing that St. Thomas More's account of the murders (\\"its very detail argues its authenticity\\") is true and ignoring the numerous and serious discrepancies and inconsistencies as well as factual errors, she is revealed as rabid and biased against King Richard III. See Bertram Fields for a more unbiased approach into this 500 year old murder mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flawed and inaccurate","review":"I read the book after reading several other historical novels. This one particularly struck me as inflammatory and just out to make a buck out of taking the prosecution's viewpoint.The information presented to the reader didn't support the position the author was taking on the innocence or guilt of Richard III regarding the murder of the two princes.Don't waste your time.Read instead: DAUGHTER OF TIME by Josephine Tey or SUNNE IN SPLENDOR by Sharon Kay Penman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Traditionalist view of Richard III","review":"While Weir asserts that she is providing an unbiased and even-handed account of the murder of the Princes in the Tower, she seemingly starts with the a priori assumption of Richard's guilt. She is in fact putting forth the traditional Tudor propaganda version of the event. The problem is in her evaluation of sources. By arguing that St. Thomas More's account of the murders (\\"its very detail argues its authenticity\\") is true and ignoring the numerous and serious discrepancies and inconsistencies as well as factual errors, she is revealed as a rabid and biased anti-Richard. Nevertheless, she does bring an interesting point up concerning velvet apparently found with the \\"bones in the tower.\\" Unfortunately, she does not adequately document her source here, leaving her assertion on even this point in question"},{"rating":"1","title":"i threw it across the room","review":"After years of reading historical fiction about Richard III, I graduated to reading scholarly works, all of which have concluded that there are tremendous doubts surrounding Richard's reputation. Portraits have been scanned and have shown that the hump was added, many of the sources Weir uses, whom she says are contemporaries of Richard's, were 8 or 9 years old (Sir Thomas More) when Richard was killed. Virtually nothing the man did, from birth through death, had any sense of honor, according to Weir. After boldly indicating that she would state the historical facts and allow the reader to form his/her own conclusions, Ms. Weir leads us down crooked paths and ends up forcing her interpretations on the reader. I was very disappointed in the book and the author. I don't mind reading opposing viewpoints, but this one offered far too many conclusions which were totally unsupported by most of today's historical scholarship"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research","review":"While I'm sure that it's a wonderful idea to have a book that bucks the current \\"underdog\\" and \\"Poor Richard\\" trend of Richardian studies, the fact that I discovered three factual errors in the first ten pages dimmed my appreciation of this work. Given the subject matter of this and other of Weir's books, I'd say that it is writing on the historical equivalent of scandal sheets, and not for people who are interested in the time period and serious historical study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither the last or best work on the subject","review":"Alison Weir is a good historian. Her works on the wives and children of Henry VIII are very readable and make some excellent points. This is what makes this work so dissapointing. There is little objectivity in this work, accepting hostile sources as fact without questioning their obvious bias. Weir also makes many leaps in logic that are not entirely supported by the facts.This mystery is not solved, nor will it ever. I recomend Paul Kendall's book, Richard III, or Bertram Fields (though it too has its problems) work Royal Blood"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good telling of the tale.","review":"Most of the story herein assembled could certainly be more satisfyingly gleaned from Shakespeare's Richard III or More's own account, on whom she relies heavily. At the very least, I recommed following the genealogical chart provided in Antonia Fraser's \\"The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England\\", not the one included in this book. It is so glaringly flawed it made me crazy. This book is not for a novice on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling but unresearched.","review":"Alison Weir is an excellent writer, but she gives too much credit to easily discredible sources. The book reads like fiction, but a large chunk of it is basic theories that have existed for centuries. \\"The Sunne in Splendor\\" is infinetly superior to this piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, well-measured account of the Princes' fate.","review":"The Princes in the Tower is Weir's first installment in a series of engaging nonfiction works on Medieval and Renaissance England. She begins by tracing the development of Edward IV's reign, especially the muddle of the Wars of the Roses, then explains how it came to pass that Richard of Gloucester ascended the throne and eventually did away with his nephews. Weir has drawn on many and varied sources, mostly from the era itself, to formulate a solid and detailed account of this infamous mystery. As background for Shakespeare's Richard III or just pleasure reading of the historical variety, this book makes an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tudor View","review":"I was tremendously disappointed in this book. Alison Weir excells as a biographer and historian of the Tudors, and I have thoroughly enjoyed many of her books. In this one, unfortunately, she appears to be less an historian than a Tudor supporter. Richard III did indeed have reason to have his nephews killed. So did others, and Weir hardly gives them a glance. I am inclined to give poor Richard the benefit of a doubt, but I'm not convinced of his innocence. Still, I think Weir is too impressed by the myth of More and shamefully inclined to pick and choose amongst the sources she finds credible. Isn't it strange that all of the anti-Richard sources seem to be credible when none of the reverse are? My respect for Ms Weir as an historian has been badly shaken by this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a surprise","review":"Having read her other books and enjoyed them I looked forward to this one. What a surprise! It should carry a warning on the front cover that Ms Weir is a Tudor fan. Sources were quoted selectively. Sources were a little doubtful. It wasn't what she included that disappointed but what she omitted to include. Too many personal conclusions were used.Ms Weir missed a great opportunity to deal with this wonderful mystery in an objective manner. Instead the more I read the more I began to feel she was attempting to prosecute rather than give an objective account. A great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book about an excellent spirit","review":"A fantastic rum book by world-renowned beverage consultant and friend, Robert Plotkin!This book takes you by the hand on a virtual tour of the most famous rum-producing Caribbean islands.

Compared to Victor Villadangos Vol. 2 of Lauro's guitar music (which is superb in any way), this performance suffers from many issues, the main of which is lack of understanding of this music. I do not question tecnical abilities here (even though in some places technical problems show up like unnecessary slowing down the tempo, or auckward pauses sprinkled everywhere). Most of the waltzes don't even feel like waltzes - imagine someone actually dancing on this performance. Feels like recorded in a hury, without giving the necessary level of attention. The sound is very thin and lacks confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Are All Crazy","review":"Adam Holzman's performance on this disc has made Antonio Lauro's corpse turn over in its grave!!! Technically he has a command over the material but there is not artistry or profundity in his expression. Where are some contrasts in dynamics? Tone production? Change of timbre? Not all of these pieces are meant to be played at a robotronic-fast tempo. Yuckkkk.... If you want to hear him really kill a composer's complete oevre for guitar then check out the disasters he recorded for Naxos doing all of Ponce's guitar music. This guy is pulling a real 'Goerge W.

MY SISTER WHOS 14 COULD PROBABLY RELATE VERY WELL TO THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ITS MORE FOR HER AGE GROUP. IF A TEENAGER HAS A SLEEPOVER THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH.

Judy Greer gives a great comedic performance as Garner's back-stabbing co-worker and has a lot of fun with it. But besides this subplot, the film suffers from an overload of massive romantic comedy cliches and one of the most laughable movie dance sequences ever filmed. Look elsewhere for a good time with Garner, like her TV series, \\"Alias\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with \\"Big\\"","review":"Thirteen-year-old Jenna somehow leaps forward in time to inhabit her own adult body (Jennifer Garner), thereby discovering that she has become a terrible human being who will betray anyone to win acceptance from the right clique. Trying to reestablish a relationship with the now-adult boy (Mark Ruffalo) who was her childhood best friend before she ditched him, she discovers the importance of friendship and loyalty.This tired film revisits the body-switching theme that has been done so many times before in much better films. Garner overacts terribly at times, but she has some nice scenes with Ruffalo, who plays the only character that displays any intelligence. I never believed in the authenticity of its fashion magazine setting. Jenna's big idea for the magazine redesign, which receives so much applause, is unbelieveably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute...But Useless.","review":"I know this is supposed to be a \\"cute\\" movie, but it is such a tired subject. It is \\"BIG\\" all over again....Granted, Jennifer Garner is much easier to look at than Tom Hanks....At least from this Male reviewers perspective. Garner is capable of SO MUCH more than this (Daredevil, Elektra). Garner is still good, as is Rufalo, and the film is good for what is supposed to be, it just falls a little flat due to it's re-tread subject matter. Still worth the $2 rental.....but not the late fees. 2 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can anyone say disney???","review":"The whole concept when you watch 13 going on 30. Seems like it would be a movie like \\"BIG\\". But no this movie is exactly like you would expect from the Disney company. The whole story line is a 13 year old girl wishes she was a grown up. At least 30 years old. Till she stumbles acrossed some magic wishing dust. And before you know it she is a 30 year old. I loved Jennifer Gardner in alias and in Daredevil but this movie I didn't love. If you like Disneyisk movie get this today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are the other reviewers on Ecstasy?","review":"So lame, so awful, I wouldn't even know where to start. But here are a few tidbits: Makes \\"Maid in Manhattan\\" almost look like high art. Might appeal to 9-14 year-olds but only 9-14 year-olds, say, circa 1982-1987 - and, of course, they would now, like this movie's heroine, be considerably older. One also wonders how the heroine could be friends with someone (the Mark Ruffalo character/T Heads fan)who's into much cooler music than the crap spewed throughout this soundtrack... except that would take us in a circle in which I'd have to then discuss the idiotic plot involving the mentally-challenged heroine's deep desire for the opposite of nerdiness. And, yes, the life-affirming, \\"Who cares about cool?\\" theme is cool. However, if you have more than one brain cell holding hands with another, and/or are, again, over 14, the message will be lost as this is one unbearable, illogical, unbelievable cloud of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fun","review":"well,first i must tell you that this is not a comedy film...there is a bit of humuor in the movie.but seriously the situations are not that funny...and the acting is very ordinary stuff.i dont understand why other crits went over praising this very ordinary tv serial type film.i read some reviews here at amazon and decided to watch it on this weekend.i am totally disappointed...I would recommend this movie to girls and women who like and concerned about trend,fashion,dress...only the saving grace is jennifer garner...hence 1 star"},{"rating":"2","title":"30, flirty and thriving..","review":"I'm glad that I went to the theater to watch this. I love the story. I enjoyed the 80's theme that the movie had going on. Jennifer is great in her role as Jenna. It was also nice to see Mark Ruffalo (I've never seen him in any movie other than this..I like him now, he's great) This has a lesson to it: If you wish for something, you might get it..and then you may come to the realization that it's not what you really want. I've seen the comparisons to other movies, but I do think this has some unique qualities this time around. See this, it's a nice, light story to fill the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"50/50","review":"The movie was as cute I remember it being. I wasn't too impressed with the state of the product.

I sat down, grabbed the popcorn, and covered with the blanket. My eyes were glued to the TV until the last credits rolled. A VERY funny, sweet movie where the underdog, innocent, deserving girl wins!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I didn't think this movie was very good. It was a light comedy and had a few chuckles but mostly it was just nothing special. Jennifer Garner stars with her freaky strange face as a little girl that wants to be an adult and thru the miracle of magic dust gets her wish. So its then the movie Big without Tom Hanks regurgitated for a girl but not as funny or origional. Jennifer Garner is just not a good actress. She isn't horrible but she is just not that good. I would recommend this movie to girls and women who seem to like this kind of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 going on BORING","review":"i found this movie boring and annoying!

Jennifer Garner is foxy chick,but Her Acting skills lets say are average at best. I also get so tired of all of these type of movies using the 80's music as there backdrop.they turn film into a Mini Music video as to a actual film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst film ever","review":"Actually it is....It is the worst movie ever. Worse than Ghost Dad. This movie really isn't even worth renting. To compare this film to \\"Big\\" is a terrible afront to the Film Gods. I do think the casting director did a nice job choosing young actors that looked like the grown up counterparts. I enjoyed the use of \\"magic dust\\" in the film as well. You can never go wrong with magic dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORNY AS HELL!!!!","review":"I caught this cornfest on cable a while ago, it sucked!

First of all Jenifer Garner is a hoe and her acting is not that good. Looking for a hot chick movie go with mean girls instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking humor and a solid plot.","review":"If you are looking for a movie with plenty of humor, look elsewhere. Now that that's out of the way, let's move on to entertainment factor. This movie, in my opinion, is quite absent of that as well with a confusing/boring plot. Some examples of this are: 1) the way characters react to the 30-year-old \\"Jenna\\"s questions/confusion/etc which is so unbelivable that it detaches you from the movie AND 2) when the grown-up version of her best friend, \\"Matt\\", just seems to magically appear where ever she goes throughout the city. I got tired of hearing \\"hi Matt\\" or \\"hi Matty\\" every 15 minutes. There are more, but these are just several examples of why I disliked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if you are a 13 year old","review":"bad plot about \\"magic\\" event in a child's life where she suddenly becomes a 30 year old. could have been a good movie if the concept had been turned into a better script"},{"rating":"2","title":"New twist on a familiar time-tripping concept","review":"Sometimes people make choices that lead them to become the kind of people that no one really wants to be. It's never too late to turn around.Jennifer Garner inhabits the role perfectly, but she also has such great comic timing that it's a surprise she is just finding movie stardom. She has charisma, energy and owns the screen, her destiny inevitably belongs on the big screen.Its hard to make a romantic comedy that works well and you always expect it to give in to temptation and get the characters together picture perfectly. Do Jenna and Matt get together in the end? It is a romantic comedy, but the pay-off is more satisfying. Sure, its nothing revolutionary to the genre but it has brought Jennifer Garner to the big screen and for a pleasant, sweet 90 minutes without getting a huge toothache, it's as good as you get from movies of its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a chick flick!","review":"I dragged my husband to a movie this weekend. I 'forced' him to see 13 going on 30. The ads looked so cute! He enjoyed it more than I did and I loved it! This movie was not like the other youth-turned-adult movies of the past. This was a movie that was funny and just plain fun. It is a movie about accepting who you are and liking it. My husband said he would actually see it again; which I may take him up on that offer. We are in such an 80's flashback. The music was amazing! We even tried to do the 'thriller' when we got home. I never realized how much I loved the 80's...and Mark Ruffalo was another great asset to this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny movie","review":"Just saw the movie yesterday & it was really funny!!!!

Movie delivered a good time as expected. Garner and Ruffalo are good together, the movie has an awesome soundtrack and the vision of the film is good.

Although it was inoffensively harmless it was far from a classic comedy and definately does not need to be a permenent member of anyone's DVD collection unless you ARE actually 13.Although Andy Serkis was an interesting addition to the cast yet was underutilized. I hope to see him in more movies in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick Flick for [Male] SF Fans","review":"Now that i've got *that* out of the way ... go see it. A wonderful [has she done anything that wasn't?] Jennifer Garner is extremely believable as a precocious 13-year-old frustrated by her youth.Wanting only to be 'grown up', she wakes ... grown up. & has to deal w/being an adult. Sort of. Bills aren't covered, nor are feeding yourself [altho i suppose she could be eating out], & the 'monthly visit from Aunt Mary'. Or maybe she misses out on cramps, too. But the shock of discovering that she had become a creep trying to fit into the In Crowd, discovering the guy she *wanted* so badly is now a poor taxi-driver, not a glamorous star - & that her old Best Friend understands, but can't help her because he's gone on w/his life. If only she were able to undo all the grief she's caused ...Go see it w/your Special 1 if you're into rougher stuff. S/he'll love you for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack for a Great Movie!","review":"This soundtrack adds fun and excitement to an already great movie with the classic 80's music. The music on the CD is actually in the movie, which is something that sometimes doesn't happen with soundtracks. The mixture of artists on the CD really makes it one that a lot of people can relate to,even kids like me who were barely alive to see the 80's. The people that were alive and kickin' during the 80's appreciate the nostalgic feel of the album too, I'm sure. The only let down that I saw was the fact that Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" wasn't on the CD. It plays a key role in the movie and I was disappointed that it wasn't included. From Pat Benetar's \\"Love is a Battlefield\\" to Billy Joel's little known \\"Vienna,\\" this CD rolls through the whole way. All-in-all, the movie was great and the soundtrack continued that greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun film","review":"This movie tells the story of a 13-year-old with an overwhelming desire to become part of the cool crowd. She so wants to become part of the clique of six that she's willing to sacrifice her friendship with her caring but chubby best friend Matt. When she is dissed by the most popular girl at her 13th birthday party, she wishes she could be 30.When her wish comes true, she see how her life has turned out. She did succeed in becoming popular and even led the cool group and her life turned out successfully in outward appearance - powerful job, boyfriend, and stylish best friend. But as she begins to live her 30-year-old life, she finds out that she has lost the goodness she possessed as a child and begins to regret the decisions she made after the age of 13.Gardner convincingly plays the role of a 30-year-old with a 13-year-old mind in a fun and irreverent way. The movie is light and cute without become treacle. A fun family film, probably especially appealing to girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Possibilities","review":"The same that I can say about \\"Eurotrip\\" in his camp can be said about this one in its own. Sweet, over short, and abandons all kind of interesting possibilities of time-travel change-of-age films (and it had both!). Going from '87 to 2004 could've been a hell of a trip, but no comment is made on the changing times (out of a little joke about a cellphone). C'mon, Internet, PC's everywhere, CGI in your TV all the time, something needed to make Jenna wonder about change!

It shows that shallow values get shallow results and what may appear glamorous on the surface can in reality be an empty and selfish lifestyle that leads to nowhere. This movie was well done. The characters were endearing, the plot was engaging and there were many poignant moments mixed in with the comedy. Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Jennifer Garner!!!","review":"I went to see this movie not only because it looked extremely cute and funny but also because I am an Alias addict and have numerous posters and collages of Alias and Jennifer Garner, however throughout this movie I did not think of her as Sydney Bristow, Jennifer Garner takes on the role of Jenna Rink so completely she IS Jenna. She is a remarkably talented actress and as a switch from somber Sydney Bristow we actually get to see her smile and laugh. It is a feel good movie that just leaves you completely happy. I've already ordered it and I can't wait to see the feauturettes and bloopers. I know we will see other great movies from Jennifer Garner!! (Hopefully one with Michael Vartan!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is cute","review":"As I a little kid, I owned BIG and watched it repeatedly... and while 13 GOING ON 30 does remind you of a female BIG, it's best to just enjoy it for what it is: a fun movie. It's not a great or serious film, but it's not supposed to be. Usually, I am the sort of person who enjoys watching depressing (but meaningful, always meaningful) films, and I loathe corny and cheesy films (ie, romantic comedy). For some reason, 13 GOING ON 30 does not follow the rule.Jennifer Garner (who I watch and love on ALIAS) is darling in this movie, and you can't help but love her smiles. Her delight is so genuine when she's dancing to Thriller, you just have to laugh. This light-hearted spirit remains throughout the film. It's just one of those movies that reminds you film can be fun, and you don't need to lose IQ points attempting to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, Adorable and funny but with a HEART","review":"I was skeptical when I first went to the theater to watch this. I have horrible memories of my 80's hair, leggings and music, so an 80's version of \\"Big\\" wasn't high on my priority list. But I was VERY pleasently surprised. The soundtrack is actually tolerable and I relate so much the 13 year old Jenna it's rather scary. I have to say that Jennifer Garner completly embodies a 13 year olds actions, talking, innocence, etc etc. She made this film! Mark Ruffalo is charming and adorable as an older and slightly cynical about love \\"Mattie.\\" This story really swept me off my feet, and now I can't stop praising it. It's very funny and heartwarming. Stop reading this now and just go enjoy the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"My mom owns the movie, I was bored one day and had nothing to do so I went downstairs to burrow some movies, and I found this movie. It blew...Tom Hanks Big was better then this could ever be. Jennifer whatever her name is is not a very good actress. Alot of teenagers have troblue growing up but so what we get over it and turn to older and get over those moments that is what school is about.

Its as painful as it sounds folks. Of course it turns into a \\"hilarious comedy\\", I mean, what's funnier than whining?(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-Very-Good-Rehash of Familiar Storyline","review":"Jenifer Garner is a very attractive young actress who may eventually learn to be an effective one. However, in this movie I found her performance as the teenager transformed into her adult self 15 or so years later to be irritating, single-note, saccharine and at times incomprehensible (this last complaint is not, I realize, primarily Garner's fault but rather that of a disjointed script and story). Mark Ruffalo, as her loyal teenage friend and her befuddled adult one, gave a decent performance but I thought he was miscast. In all, this type of story has been done way better in previous movies, most notably \\"Big\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and hilarious movie!","review":"Jennifer Garner did a great job!

But as soon as it came out on dvd I bought it and the soundtrack, which is also good and I've been watching it ever since. Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo have a really good chemistry and Jennifer in her first major movie role really sells her perfomance as a 13 year old stuck in a 30 year old body.

I used to be a huge fan; I have all of his albums up to \\"Full Moon Fever.\\"Unfortunately, Petty sounds like he's just about had it. Petty's songs have always been based upon pretty simple melodies and chord modulations, but...this..is...ridiculous. Talk about predictable chord changes. His songs no longer sound like effortless gems that were knocked off in 5 minutes. Oh, they still sound like they were knocked off in 5 minutes, but effortless \\"gems\\" they are not. His trademark vocal limitations, while once interesting, are now pretty darn embarrassing. He sounds like some drunken lug, slurring his voice up and down in a lazy, boring way.Maybe I'm just finally burnt out on Tom Petty. But more likely, Petty is burnt out himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review is the only one worth reading because it is true","review":"Mike Campbell is a great guitarist, and Tom Petty's lyrics and beautiful melodies have a tendency to get stuck in your head. This album has the Heartbreakers playing with competence and skill, but the songs sound too cold and distant, and the lyrics are curiously bland. He's still got the skills, but Petty apparently needs inspiration. The songs sound depressing, like a suicidal sex maniac drug addict on his last day on earth. All of these songs just make me want to listen to Full Moon Fever. Maybe he should do a solo album again, and he should definitely write some songs with Mike Campbell. 'Runnin Down a Dream' blows away any Petty hard rockers on \\"Echo\\". Only devoted fans should buy this album, for others, try the albums \\"Full Moon Fever\\", \\"Into the Great Wide Open\\", or \\"Damn the Torpedoes\\" for great music and a great time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bummer","review":"I completely agree with \\"What the Critics Say.\\" This album was really, really, really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of why I like Tom Petty!","review":"This cd extends the music that was on so many of the previous efforts that I wish were longer.

Since \\"Full Moon Fever,\\" Petty's somehow picked up a reputation as a \\"master songwriter.\\" He may have had a way with a hook way back when, but a \\"master\\" would certainly take more care with the melodies and show more invention with rock's cliches. Many of the songs attempt Petty's by now painfully familiar 'folk' feel -- which means they drone on and on without getting any place. Even the one track he should ace -- the garage-y \\"Free Girl\\" -- is more volume than actual hooks.

If they hadn't already acheived their stature, they'd be just another garage band having trouble booking gigs.

Sometimes months (or years) later I'll give them another try and I'll be pleasantly surprised that they are better than I had thought originally. This is not one of those. Let me also say that I'm a big Petty fan and it's hard to call him down on any of his albums but in this case I must. Other than the opening song there's just no dynamics to speak of and the songs just run into each other without distinction. In the course of a band's career there are bound to be lulls and, unfortunately, this one qualifies for that title. But Tom and his gang weren't gone just yet. They rebounded well with the powerful and controversial \\"Last DJ\\" that showed them to still be the true rock and roll rebels they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"I got divorced\\" album","review":"In a recent interview, Tom Petty said that this was not an \\"I got divorced\\" album. I'm not too sure I believe that as this is an epically sad compilation. In the past, he has been angry at loss, or sarcastic about it, or even momentarily frightened. In the songs contained in this album he seems to have been existentially scarred by whatever happened. Within the context of the album even the \\"I'm OK\\" and the story songs sound like he's trying really hard to convince both us and himself.He is still a great rock and roller, and I really enjoy his music. I love the almost tragic songs on this album but I still like to hear him kick the doors down every now and then.

I am a relative \\"newcomer\\" to the Tom Petty bandwagon and I have found his music to be absolutely incredible.Thank you Amazon for sending it to me so promptly. You sure beat out the record stores!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Petty fear predictability?","review":"That's the only thing I can think of to explain why he starts this album with a slow one (\\"Room At the Top Of the World\\") rather than something fairly upbeat (there are a few of those anyway). Maybe I'm narrow-minded, but I think Petty is at his best when he rocks. What drew me to him in the first place was his fusion of Byrds and Rolling Stones styles (which hadn't occurred to me could be done). But all in all, this is a fairly consistent Petty offering--not great/ not lousy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great record","review":"Echo is an excellent set of tunes. I can't compare it to other Tom Petty records 'cause it's the first I've heard, outside of the radio-played singles. On first listen I wasn't too impressed because it was a new singer and a new style of rock for me. The second time I spun it up, I was taken aback by the beauty of songs like \\"Room at the Tom\\" and \\"No More\\", and was rockin' along with \\"Won't Last Long\\" and \\"About To Give Out\\". There's hard and smooth and everything in between, making it balanced album. Just about every song is at least good, if not great. I love the message in \\"Rhino Skin\\"! Definitely worth buying this, along with Greatest Hits, to introduce yourself to Tom Petty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are the greatest rock and roll band in history.

I really enjoy the songs Swingin, Freegirl and Echo."},{"rating":"1","title":"All songs sound the same :(","review":"Only two songs that rock, Billy The Kid and Rhino Skin. The first 8 all sound the same like one continuous song. Slow melodic more of something fit for an easy listening radio station not really rock at all. It is similar to Springsteen's Ode to Tom Joad, nothing in it to really stir the emotions, just something to listen to to put you to sleep. You can really tell that he has been hanging out with Dylan too much. Alot of times Petty's sounds alot like Dylan. Really disappointed with this CD. Hope during the tour he does more old stuff and not much off this CD. Only people who want to own everything by Petty should buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Drink Minimum","review":"Budweiser should get a writing credit on this album. I would love to know how may beers T.P. had during the writing/recording of this mess. A fantastic wordsmith/composer has fallen into generic lines such as \\"You've got a pretty face...you've got a pretty face...but it's such a waste\\"? What the heck is that? It sounds like a line my 8 year old brother wrote in his 4th grade english class.I love T.P. I really do. He's fun to drive to. But, good God....if someone has the licence plate number of the aliens who stole his brain, please send all information to: Tom Petty Brain Search c/o Lester Cromwell 1330 4th St. Santa Monica, CA 90401."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"What a sad, mixed up, melancholy recording! Where are the rebellious rockers from the past that were advertised? I can't believe I waited for the store to open to be the first to buy this. As a TP&H fan since the 70's I have learned that a lot of their songs must \\"grow\\" on you. I assure you that none of these will because I'm not even going to put this in the CD rack for fear someone might accidentally play it. Whatever Tom's influences were for these songs I hope he gets over it soon. One bad CD does not a career make and I'll continue to be a Petty fan forever but this effort is such a disappointment. If anyone is thinking about buying this work PLEASE try to listen to it first. You may think it is Tom's greatest piece of work or you may think it's a piece of ----."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have trouble seeing what all the fuss is about","review":"Despite what a lot of other people and critics say, I LOVED Wildflowers, which has become one of my mandatory Desert Island discs. I also think that Tom and the boys are legendary stuff as attested to by their long and highly productive career of seriously significant tunes. However, I was really looking forward to Echo, but kept falling asleep during most of it, despite one or two tracks that try very hard to be vintage Petty or hit some of the notes on his newer directions like 'You Wreck Me' did on Wildflowers. As a loyal TP fan, can't garbage this album, but when you compare it to Wildflowers, and then some of the fantastic old material released on the recent Anthology 2 CD set, Echo becomes instantly forgettable. Don't worry Tom, you can't be truly legendary all the time, looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up, I've heard enough","review":"If you like watered-down, dumbed down music, this may be your cup of (weak) tea. It's slightly better than Petty's last two albums, but that's not saying much. The Tom Petty & Heartbreakers that were so awesome in the 70's and 80's are not to be found here. Where are the intelligent lyrics that could be found on classic albums such as \\"Damn the Torpedoes\\", \\"Hard Promises\\", \\"Long After Dark\\", \\"Let Me Up\\", etc., etc., etc. Where are the great melodies and strong instrumentation of of all those (1976-1991)albums? The guitar and keyboard work on this album is actually quite good, but it's set so far back in the mix that it's largely wasted. This has the makings of a good album, but the lyrics, melodies, and instrumentation need to be worked out much more fully. Then again, if you are just looking for background noises to fall asleep with, perhaps this will serve that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tom Petty With a Twist--a GREAT Album","review":"Echo is one of the best albums released by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers...PERIOD. Room at the Top, Free Girl Now, and the title track are all absolutely amazing songs, but the album's strongest feature is that ALL of its songs are well written and well recorded. This album proves that Petty and company are still rockin' just as hard as they ever were. Mike Campbell's well-thought-out guitar work, combined with Howie Epstein's tasteful bass, Benmont's absolutely unparalleled keyboard work, and Tom's ever-stellar vocals make for a truly worthy contribution to the music world. Above all else, however, the elouqence of language on this album far surpasses previous Petty efforts. Get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Petty's Comeback","review":"Ok, you've heard the critics critisize Tom. What I ask is \\"why\\"? What's in this album that's not in every other? There's the true \\"Tom Petty sound\\" in songs like \\"Free Girl Now\\", the loneliness in \\"Room at the Top\\" and the alternate melody to \\"Swingin'\\". To determine if you would like this CD, first hear \\"Free Girl Now\\". If you like it, the CDs for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A change of pace from his best, but still great TP","review":"TP gives us a more mellow, folk-like album this time around. There's not as much rock as I would have liked, but still a great album. It seems with old age, comes a softer side. Still, this album resembles some of his early work that started his great career. Full Moon Fever and Greatest Hits are the best two albums to buy to hear his best, but this should be in any TP fans' collection. If its just to listen to Room at the Top, Free Girl Now, Accused of Love and Echo, this album is a must buy!!! Rock on Tom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time...","review":"As a TP lover I was pleased to see that a new album was on its way. However, after having read some negative reviews I wasn't too hopeful of hearing anything that great. Echo is one of those albums which requires multiple listens before it reveals its riches. Buy it and you too will realise that all good things come to he who waits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated and overlooked","review":"I've recently come back to this cd after not listening to it for awhile...my loss because this is one of the most consistent and mature rock albums Tom Petty ever made. There are 3 gems on this that pu this over the top for me : Room At The Top, Swinging and Ome More Day, One More Night. A great effort by the most consistent, tightest rock band around."},{"rating":"2","title":"In fine form","review":"Mixing quiet ballads with driving rockers is a Petty trademark, and this CD doesn't disappoint. Fun songs like \\"About to Give Out\\" with its mention of \\"Karaoke Kate\\" driving the crowd wild by \\"singing Delta Dawn\\" and the single-mindedness of \\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\" are balanced with the plaintive lyrics of \\"One More Day, One More Night\\" and other more thoughtful tunes. Petty has consistently shown an ability to discuss love and loss in a clear and concise fashion; this CD continues this legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lackluster forgetable album.","review":"I bought the Echo CD on the strength of the Wildflowers album, which is the only other Tom Petty music that I have purchased. In comparison the Echo album was a let down. I doubt if I will give Echo another listen since there were no memorable tracks and nothing about it warranted repeated listening. I should have sampled the CD before I bought it. Well now it's off to goodwill to get rid of this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"I bought this record to help complete my Petty collection. Room At The Top had me hanging on, thinking this could be another Wildflowers album. But where I thought this record would take me was not at all what I had expected. And it's not just that my expectations were floundered, it was simply that this record lost my interest after 3 or 4 songs. Many of them feel like half-hearted blues songs, that really don't mean anything at all.Anyways, I thought Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers were wonderful. As well as some of the others too, but I couldn't really feel connected to this record. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"My public service","review":"This is not the best CD T P has made but it's a solid effort. \\"Swingin'\\" is one of my very favorite Tom Petty songs. A classic!By the way of the 6 one-star reviews 5 were posted on the same day by \\"a customer\\". Amazon really shouldn't allow that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT's been 10yr's.- STILL NO HEARTBRAKERS album","review":"Well, This is a great album but even good albums don't make the fans happy for 10yrs....WHERE IS ANOTHER. IT Looks like the HEARTBRAKERS are another ROLLING-STONES band......\\" WAIT every 7-10 yrs. apart, for another new album. HAY , ALL there FANS will be DEAD then.......REAL SMART RECORD LABEL PRACTICES\\"........YA, right. I guess the GOD's of rock and roll...just don't want RECORDS made every 2 years ANYMORE. That's how they did it in the 70-80's.....and look how good all the music was.Tom and all his friends (other big bands ) complain how crappy the music is now adays....BUT hay? Where is there stuff? I know, setting by the swimming pool, drinking a big one.....Relaxing and doing nothing but count there old money. FOR THE FANS THAT BITES. This album is good...why stop for 10 yrs. makeing more music so the famous musicians all can watch a war on TV. THAT JUST AIN'T MUSIC...That's somekind of torture for the fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the melody I'm used to?","review":"It feels like Tom Petty is trying to do something else (or new?) on this release, but most of the time it's just not any good. I miss the melodies I fell in love with and I think the material on \\"Echo\\" is quite monotonous and uninteresting with the exception of \\"Room at the top\\", \\"Counting on you\\" and \\"Accused of love\\". If you compare this with albums like \\"Full moon fever\\", \\"The great wide open\\" or \\"The last DJ\\", it's clearly not as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dude is turning into a hippie!!!","review":"From the nasally, up-close vocals of the first lame ballad, to the ending chords of the last song, Tom Petty is turning into a serious hippie!! Just listen to his lyrics about freedom to smoke dope, running around in the grass, and all this Lenny Kravitz type junk about \\"letting love rule\\". In my opinion, Petty should stick with the jangly songs he wrote of yor, where every song was a guaranteed FM rock staple. These days he sounds tired, weary, and put off by everything under the sun. For a hippie, he's pretty uptight about stuff.Well, that's about it. If you like hillbilly rock, check this one out. Otherwise, stick with that other brilliant hippie dude, the one and only Neil Young.CHECK YA' LATER, DUDES!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo","review":"Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers's Echo is a very laidback effort. Room at the Top is a pretty good song, but the majority of the songs sound to lazy and are unmemorable. Echo is a very lame album considering the highstandards Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers usually produce. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muscle, guts and brains.","review":"Close your eyes, and you'll think it's '87--this is Tom returning to the ground he stomped in \\"Let Me Up\\" and \\"Southern Accents.\\" His drawl and whine are more pronounced, the guitars tougher, the beat heavier. Mix in the aching delivery of \\"Wildflowers\\" on several tracks, and classic Petty fans should be ecstatic--while TP's '90s output has included some of his best work, this is Tom as older fans know and love him: jangling, rocking, growling and grinning. Maturity rears its head in the lyrics, which are exceptional(especially the title track). Also of interest: a rare Mike Campbell lead vocal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petty and the Heartbreakers are Kings for another day.","review":"This 15 track CD sounds a lot like what your used to from Tom Petty in the 90's. Petty not trusting anyone, in love with a girl who's about to leave him, great harmonies and toe tapping rock and roll. Some tracks sound like leftovers from \\"Full Moon Fever\\", but others lend themselves to the Byrds and Dylan.I'll look for Petty and Heartbreakers to get off on some of these tunes live in concert, especially the following:Free Girl Now I Don't Wanna Fight Swingin and Won't Last LongOverall, 4 out of 5 stars. Could've been 5 with more Campbell guitar riffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Hybrid of \\"Wildflowers\\" and \\"Southern Accents\\"","review":"This album is just as great as any other of Petty's classics, but unique in it's own way. I'd call it 60/40 between \\"Wildflowers\\" and \\"Southern Accents,\\" an earlier Petty album. It has quite a range of music. From the all out rock in such songs as \\"Free Girl Now,\\" \\"I Don't Wanna Fight, \\" (The only song I know of where Campbell is singing lead!) and \\"Won't Last Long,\\" to the mellow ballads Petty has perfected such as \\"Echo,\\" \\"Room at the Top,\\" and \\"One more day, One more night,\\" this album is comprised of all the possible facets of Petty possible. A somewhat melancholy feel is left over at the end (perhaps because of his recent divorce), but that can be a good change. As usual, Petty has come out with 15 great songs, comprising one of his best albums to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature & masterful","review":"TP & the HBs are the Beatles for the 90s. Echo is his best work to date. The band is sublime. I'm like a boy in short pants, a man in a trance, and I've got something to say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm behind the times.","review":"I just got around to buying and listening to ECHO and, although I just love the music on this CD, I felt depressed as I listened to the lyrics. Then I read these reviews and learned that Tom and Jane divorced last year, and that really makes me so sad. I believe in love lasting forever and am so sorry that it ended for Tom! (I know how tough marriage is, believe me! ) After so many years together, what happened? Sure, I'll keep listening to the beautiful music on this CD because I truly adore Tom and his band's music, but I'll just feel sad as I listen. I'm sorry that a lot of people have given this CD a poor rating because I think that it is so beautiful, and reflects a natural progression as Tom ages and matures. He's sure stolen my heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"Lots of the same thing. Every song sounds like every other song on the disc -- or in Petty's career of late, for that matter. Nowhere is there a song of a quality anywhere near what can be heard on his early albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I can't recommend this one...","review":"Tom Petty is the master of simply-written songs. He can do more with three chords than most songwriters can with 20, as demonstrated on his masterpiece, \\"Wildflowers\\". On \\"Echo\\", most of the songs aren't very hooky. Petty just seems muddled in his songwriting. The band went for more of a garage type feel for this album and succeeded sonically, but the songs shouldn't suffer. While not every song on here is shoddy, I don't like enough of them to recommend the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a disappointed Petty fan, this CD is a drag.","review":"I been a fan since his very first album and was really looking forward to this one.

He has outdone himself, again! The stories grab you and make you want more. Griffin obviously lived in Philadelphia at one time. He tells the story of a young policeman and describes his progression up through the ranks of the police department. Totally entertaining. You won't be able to put any of the books down until you finish them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One Of His Better Series","review":"This whole series can be described in two words: poorly written! In The Corps or Brotherhood of War series, you have the feeling that Griffin must have been a military officer because he includes a lot of details that the average person wouldn't know if they hadn't served. With this series, I get the feeling that he never was a police officer, and didn't spend much time researching the daily lives of police officers in order to make the story seem realistic.However, while I doubt he's ever worked for the Department of Homeland Security or the Office of the President, I wouldn't let that stop you from reading his latest series, the Presidential Agent series. He is back in form with these books, so he obviously has enough contact with current or former DHS and/or White House personnel to understand how things work."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's some plots but no gripping ending","review":"I agree with one of the other reviewers, I never did find out what happened to the religious nut who wanted to kill the VP, nor did I really care, you;ll read several pages about the guy going to stores, to work, blah, blah, blah and then onto other boring stuff.I enjoyed his marine corps books, but after reading 3 of his men in blue books, i'm finished with WEB.

A plodding story that's supposed to be about a nut-case blowing up the VP of the U.S. Well, here it is: Nobody gets close to blowing anyone up, or catching anyone doing same until the 2nd page from the end of the book and then it just ends with everyone living happlily ever after.

The book is full of data like gun and projectile weights, muzzle velocities, rates of fire, total units produced, even required quantities of raw materials and man-hours for their construction (!) and the photographs are big size and very good. There are also some diagrams showing the heavy mortars on the move or loaded on trains and some of the engineering ideas are really impressive! The Germans used also some heavy mortars manufactured by the Czechs and the French and these weapons are adequately covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great photos, good information","review":"For what is a relatively obscure subject and the overall length of the book, there was a very good amount of information in the text, especially about the 60cm Karl and the summary of the German mortars used in the Second World War on the last few pages; I also enjoyed the detailed photographs of the crews loading, adjusting and firing the mortars. The line-drawings of the mortars and especially of the Karl and rail transporter (p33-34) with the respective technical data was also of great interest.

When picking up the stand to move it, the stand will slide apart and then not stand flat. This stand is recommended to use with the cage we purchased, yet it leans over slightly due the cage's size and weight. It's very top heavy and tips over quite easily. The hook from which the cage hangs uses a small cap nut on the top to secure it. As the cage moves, the cap nut loosens and will one days release.

I ordered two of these Tubular Steel Bird Cage Stands, and was impressed at how quickly they were delivered (about 5 total days).The four star rating (I wish I could leave 'four and one-half') is simply because the instructions were so poor. Fortunately, it is pretty much a no-brainer to set it up. It is confusing because they give you more hardware than you need and, again, no real instructions. However, once put together (you will need a Phillips screwdriver and pliers) the stand is sturdy, and we hung the bird cage with confidence.UPDATE June 19, 2009: Two months ago we ordered yet another bird stand, and again it was very quickly delivered.

The box was very damaged...large tears in the box as it is shipped in a very flimsy cardboard box. However, the stand itself is in great shape and was so easy to put together.

The more interesting, seldom-heard songs in the movie aren't on this disc, so let others waste their money on it. The other reviews read like the publisher's blurbs on the back of some crappy airport fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Great soundtrack - reminded me of being a little kid (especially the Eagles song, \\"Take It Easy\\")and going to rockin' backyard barbecues where I'd steal sips of beer. Classic conglomeration of all the early '70s faves. Such a universal appeal - kids, even though it may feel like you're rummaging through your parents record collection, all of these songs transcend their time periods. I remember singing along to \\"Free Bird\\" in the back of a Camero long after the song (and the car!) was in style. Get this soundtrack, and go see the movie, too - it's kind of a chick flick disguised as a guy flick - which means that everyone will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Introduction to Biography","review":"I used this book with much success with classes of English as a Second Language students.

I suggest the author substitutes Thomas Edison bio for his."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story with moral substance","review":"I am very picky about what I read but thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is captivating to a very broad audience because of its relevance. Throughout its humorous, entertaining, yet dramatic story line it reminds us of important truths about family relationships, dealing with life's challenges, and faith. It reminds us of what is most important in life and motivates us to live so we have no regrets. I enjoyed the warm, interesting writing style and definitely recommend reading this small literary masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"You may need to pass on this one.

It's a series of cheesy 80's style originals that completely wastes her peerless voice. The music is canned sounding and amateurish, the lyrics are trite and the whole package is embarrassingly unlistenable. The cover says \\"Method Actor featuring Eva Caasidy on all tracks\\". So this isn't even an Eva Cassidy album, it's a band called Method Actor and she's singing with them. And the mix puts her so far in the background she sounds like she's singing in the broom closet. After all the other great collections this was a huge shock. I wish someone had told me this before I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' It!","review":"I just recently acquired this along with a bunch of Eva's other music. I am completely blown away with her voice. With this one in particular, it reminds me alot of early Heart. Especially \\"Forever\\". She has the strength and clarity that Ann Wilson has and it's just fabulous. It is really ashame that she's no longer with us and she couldn't have known what an impact her music has made on people like me and others. This CD is worth getting...don't let the \\"one star people\\" distract you. If anything, get it for her vocals. This one is a little more rockier and poppier than what she normally does, but her vocals are stellar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scraping the Bottom","review":"I have every recording of Eva's,and play them regularly.

The enthusiasm other Eva fans have demonstrated in their reviews seems like mass hysteria and the madness of crowds. She left us a beautiful legacy of beautifully sung music of all styles.

His voice is VERY limited in skills, and his songs aren't that good.

This show has a great story and book. if only it had a score to equal it. I'm baffled as to how it got to Broadway.

Everyone on here has their favorites so i may as well list mine. \\"For Susan\\", sung by Lithgow and \\"Don't look now\\". Brian D'Arcy James has an excellent voice as does Ms. O'Hara. i wish that someone had given them something good to sing. I would hesitate to call the show jazzy.

He talks of the future and says things like \\"when I call you you have to be ready\\" Referring to the end times. He is a TV preacher. He chain smokes and the way he talks one is reminded of Jim Jones. His Book The Tracker is FICTION. Most of the teachers at the school at that time tried hard to distance them selves from him.

In this book, Tom shares valuable knowledge passed down to him from Grandfather, his wise Native American teacher. The skills that Tom explains are time tested and true. Everything is explained extremely well, and in an entertaining fashion. One of my favorite things about this guide, and every other by Tom Brown is that he also gives the spiritual side of the subject. In this book, he tells that survival (once you've taken care of your needs) can actually be fun. It is sort of like camping, if you look at it in the right way. So, if you are curious about wilderness survival, or are already educated on the subject and need a refresher, this is one of the best books to get. Every person should read this book, and practice the skills it explains. Survival is one of the most important skills that a person can learn. Please, don't neglect the need for this knowledge, buy this field guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is not a good wildernes survival book.

For hide tanning (brain tanning) check out \\"Deerskins into Buckskins\\" by Matt Richards, tracking try \\"Mammal Tracking in North America\\" by James Halfpenny. Just about any edible plant guide will out do this book.Tom has inspired more people's interest in wilderness living/survival, and for that he deserves kudos.

On the surface, the book teaches outdoor survival skills that do work. Some of his techniques are clearly not thought out and will not work. But others are time proven methods, rating it the sole star I gave it.Where it goes astray is, the overuse of a \\"I was taught by an indian chief\\" theme. First off it's clear that no such thing ever happened to this guy. And second off, it comes out as just bizzare. \\"I Do not like to use too many of my green plant brothers.\\" (talking about using too many plants to get water). The text is constantly contradicting itself on the topic of respecting the environment, and then showing a technique that does all but destroy it. Finally his acting like an indian (when he so clearly is not, and has obviously had little contact with) is just absurd, bordering on the offensive to native americans.Don't waste your time or money, I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original was better","review":"I returned this book after briefly thumbing through it.

I think the songs that stand out the most are tracks 1,3,and 6. The music industry has to be so crazy for letting this amazing voice go along with many others. Its like they get rid of the ones that have talent and keep the ones that need to be in a cartoon show or something. Terry Dexter has a great voice and is very talented.

The unit is well made and very sound. There are two major problems that I have found: 1)when the heater is on the highest setting, the propane cylinders get so cold from the high flow of gas that the heater shuts down. This is only a problem if the temperature that you are using it in is below 40 degrees F. If you are using it as an auxillary heater in the house, it does not frost up. 2) hooking the heater to a larger tank is not even discussed in the instruction manual, other than stating that an inline fuel filter should be used. It doesn't state if the line should be hooked to one side of the heater or the other, or if you need 2 hoses.The frosting up issue is the biggest disappointment for me. I can't use it in my shed in the winter because of this. Make sure you know how you are going to use this unit before you purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product when used properly.","review":"Heat output is amazing for a small item.

Looks like lots of other people are having the same problem, plus there is a recall of the heater due to safety concerns. Makes you wonder why the engineers at Mr. Heater don't test their products for a couple of hours to see if they work ok and won't blow up your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAMING DEATHTRAP","review":"This device has only one moving part: The on-off knob. THAT KNOB DOES NOT WORK. It constantly sticks in the \\"on\\" position. What this means is that, if the pilot blows out, the device spews propane and WILL NOT SHUT OFF.

This product should be banned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Functional Out of the Box","review":"First, this is an opinion based upon personal experience with the Bid Buddy heater and should not reflect adversely upon any seller of the product. Received this heater as a Christmas gift. Out of the box, it did not fully function. The righ-side would not transfer propane to the burner--only the left-side worked. The switch for the fan was permanently \\"on\\". Did not matter if you switched it to the \\"off\\" position--the fan continued to operate. If they could not get a simple on/off switch correct, how do I trust the built-n safety switches for tip-over and carbon mono sensing While it appears to be well made, it is not. Again, tired of poor quality management vis-a-vis made in China products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This is the worst piece of junk I ever used in my 64 years.

The fan is a nice feature and allows one to direct the warm air. It is a little noisy though.The heater is a nice compact size. We use it with a large propane tank, which is probably a good idea if you don't want to be changing tanks often.

Lights instantly always, runs clean, and really puts out some warmth. Not seeing any of the difficulties mentioned in other opinions. This is the larger model, and we usually use the medium output rate to heat a leaky 600' garage on 49-degree nights. It can eat a pair of propane canisters in a couple of nights, D batteries last longer for the fan. But the way to go for us has been a 5-gallon propane tank and the plug-in AC adapter to run the little fan. Makes it way cheaper and more practical. The 5 gals lasts about two weeks.

These heaters are the very best thing to have for everyday use and especially when the power goes out!! I bought a hose so I can use it with my 20lb. tank in case I need to burn it for a long time if the power stays off for a while. Here, we lost power for 4 days at one time. These are a life saver.

I had been using one of those tank-mounted radiant propane heaters, which did the job but it took up a lot of room and was very dangerous.I had an occasion to try the Mr Heater single burner heater and liked it but I opted for the Big Buddy because I have a 10x10 tent and when it is 20 or less outside you need more heat than the single burner provides.I am very happy with the Big Buddy and the three heat settings, fan and two propane canister receptacles. The only con I have is that they make you pay extra to get the power adapter to run the fan instead of using 4 \\"D\\" batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful heater that packs a punch.","review":"Got this heater this year and really love it. It does a really great job of keeping me warm while working in my garage. I love the fact that it takes two 1 lb. throwaway cylinders. The two tanks actually last a lot longer than I had anticipated.

I contacted Amazon and was amazed they issued an RMA and immediately sent a new one-thought they would refer me to the vendor. I got that in October 2011. Now it will not stay lit and keeps cutting off. I contacted Amazon and they have not responded at all.

After performing considerable research and concluding that stories as set forth in the bible were not in fact complete, I stumbled across this book. I was captivated by the use of names and situations so easily correlated to those situations without names found in the bible. So many questions going unanswered for many years now suddenly came to closure as a result of reading this book.

The son, struggling to deal with his mother's nightly activities and a weakening hope that his father will return, tries to raise money to help his situation by ripping off a drug smuggling scam and selling the goods on the side. The Florida scenery is very appealing and well shot by former award-winning cinematographer-turned director Chris Menges, but what might have been a touching story gets bogged down in a somewhat convoluted and hard-to-swallow plot. The talents of veteran actors Goldie Hawn, Keith Carradine, and Arliss Howard are wasted here, and young David Arnott gives a particulary wooden and at times annoying performance. Based on a novella by Scott Sommer (he also wrote the screenplay)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dramatic \\"loving\\" movie","review":"The acting is really really good in this movie and i feel that this is a movie where it makes you feel a lot of different emotions, that the actors and situation provides you with, RECOMMENDED,"},{"rating":"2","title":"jack","review":"one of Goldie Hawn's less known movies, but anything by her has to be good.

It really doesn't explain very much. It goes through examples of various access tasks and walks you through what to do. But there is very little explanation of what you are doing!

I really don't know, but I treated it fine, always used the things on the sides to take it out, never left it on the floor... And it just broke. I plugged it in the second day and it broke. It's still technically usable, as it does charge and connect to the iPod if I move it around a bit, but then if I stop holding it stops charging.

Some of the descriptions of the river, the wilderness and the trips getting there at times weary the reader. I guess my biggest complaint with the story was the ending. Too many loose ends.

Kerr's book is a very personal (and not unsympathetic)account written, it might seem, to counter criticism he received as a student of Japanese. The book is littered with name-dropping to no apparent end and the very title (in Japanese) which draws parallels with Proust, is ludicrous. The fact that it won a Japanese literary prize is enormously revealing about the Japanese public in itself (and not very flattering). Kerr is undoubtedly very knowledgeable but I'd rather not have this rammed down my throat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Well, having studied and indulged myself in Japan, country, culture and people, what a let down the book \\"Lost Japan\\" was to read.

Kerr's opinionated accounts of his \\"exploits\\" in around and use of Japan, are really to be read with dismay. To the point, the only thing \\"Lost\\" in Kerr's book is himself.

I thought it was depressing and achingly nostalgic. As I was extremely excited to explore Japan, Alex Kerr focuses on how Japan used to be great in so many areas, but how it lacks in everything now. From nature, to people, the arts, and society in general, he contends that the country is suffocating. One may enjoy this book if that is what you are expecting. I, however, did not view Japan in the light that Alex Kerr portrays it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will love this book if you have actually lived in Japan","review":"This was one of most superb books I have ever read on Japan. Having lived in Western Japan for two years, I found Kerr's insights right on. I have read and kept up on a number of Japanese analysts and Kerr's assessment of the beauty and losses of Japan is subtle and genuine. Ignore the readers on this page who gave it 1-star. This book is best for those who have actually lived in Japan for a significant amount of time, have studied various works on Japan, and better yet, have been to the Kansai region. I have lived in Kyoto and I absolutely LOVED the chapter \\"Kyoto hates Kyoto.\\" No one who has ever been to that historical city can deny that glass-box architecture-loving Japanese-futurists promoted the 'uglification' of the most important city in Japan. I didn't find Kerr elitist; he is interested in different art forms than many regular citizens in Japan, but I urge anyone who loves and has lived in Japan to consider this book. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely read","review":"Most of the reviews of this book either support or criticize Kerr's point of view regarding the topics he covers. It seems to me Kerr does an admirable job of conveying what are obviously his own experiences living for a very long time in Japan. It seems neither reactionary, elitist, nor condemning. As a writer, I loved the book for its writing.Kerr has a talent for phrasing, metaphor, and humor that makes the reading a delightful breeze. Clearly his Japanese publisher felt it was a subject that would appeal to Nihonjin. I have recommended it to a couple of Japanese friends myself.Even if you're not especially interested in Japanese culture, many of the essays in this little book are great fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost without this book","review":"I was extremely lucky to find and read this book before I took a trip to Japan. Alex Kerr unravels many mysteries about Japanese society, art and culture -- among other things, he explains the conventions of kabuki and what they say about the behaviors of everyday Japanese, and how Japan's traditional need to save face led to the stock-market crash and the subsequent bursting of the Bubble Economy. Kerr's revelations surprised even the native Japanese people I spoke with about the book.Sure, most of the vignettes take a negative tone, but the more Kerr criticizes Japan, the more it becomes apparent that he loves the country -- he mourns its decay, and he hopes for its return to glory. After finishing this vivid and tasteful work, I felt like thanking Mr. Kerr. I look forward to reading his next book, Demons and Dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating trip into an ancient culture.","review":"A fascinating trip into an extremely interesting but nearly lost culture.

And it's a little unbelievable to see Meg Ryan having turned from sweet-and-perky-but-screwed-up, pre-rehab, to \\"Don't 'f' with me\\" street-tuff, post-rehab. Best thing about this semi-soap, from my female perspective, is gazing at the always easy-on-the-eye Andy Garcia. MUCH better movies about addiction and recovery: Drunks (Richard Lewis), Jesus' Son (Billy Crudup), Clean and Sober (Michael Keaton) and the excellent, early-60's \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\" (Jack Lemmon), if you can wince through Mancini's syrupy-yucky title track. (But it won the Oscar for best song, so what do I know. Different times, I guess.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but Riveting","review":"This book is not well written, but that doesn't matter. It also doesn't answer the big question, which is why the government decided to ignore the obvious Middle Eastern involvement in the bombing. The Administration and the FBI appraently wanted so badly to convict McVeigh and Nichols that they were willing to overlook everything else to make sure of the convictions. In addition, our close relationship with the Saudis probably played into our reluctance to follow the leads the KFOR team developed.Despite the rambling format, this is a fascinating book, and one that everyone should read. It makes a convincing case that the Oklahoma City bombing was carried out by the same group of people that later attacked the World Trade Center in New York McVeigh and Nichols were just front men, soldiers. Certainly guilty, but not the planners or initiators of the action.If we don't improve at understanding who we're fighting, we're going to lose this war!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ!!","review":"The Third Terrorist by Jayna Davis is a incredibly well-written piece of investigative journalism. Jayna Davis explores the evidence of a \\"third terrorist\\" with incredible detail and persistence. The kind-of presistence that should have been used by the FBI. The book reads like a novel, but unfortunatley is not fiction. I loved this book, and recommend it to anyone who wonders if the government does in fact hide things from the public. This book captures your attention, and keeps it until the last page. The book is written with such detail and accuracy that it leaves no doubt in your mind that there was in fact a \\"third terrorist\\". Jayna Davis does not contradict herself at any point in the book. Jayna Davis takes you thorugh the events of April 19, 1995, and the events leading up to that horrific day with incredibly wording that keeps you glued to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be skeptical of this account","review":"Several aspects of this account make me skeptical. First of all one of the primary sources giving information in this book is James Woolsey, former CIA director who was a big proponent of the war in Iraq. He was among the true believers that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons as well as an active nuclear weapons program. He was an advocate of an Al-Quieda link to Iraq, which most intelligence experts and administration officials say does not exist. James Woolsey is an expert at using the media to turn public opinion in favor of Neoconservative policies and works citing him as a major figure should be treated with skepticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jayna Davis has NO credibility","review":"Why do you think she got fired from her job at KFOR in OKC in the first place? She identified some poor guy as the third terrorist who had NO connection. KFOR is lucky they still have a license to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Puleezzzeee!!!","review":"Look, this is another badly researched conspiracy books. The links are not diffinitively diffinitive. It comes down to this, there were no links to Islamic terrorists beyond the intangible.

That is the same kind of ostrich reaction that gave us 9/11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is Total Fabrication and Garbage","review":"Biggest piece of garbage, by an author with a highly questionable background, that I have ever read. Total waste of time and money.Obvious the author is only trying to make money off the backs of the people killed and injured in this horrible disaster, while being a Democrat/Clinton/Clinton Administration basher. Very sick individual indeed.Many of the authors \\"facts\\" are either unsubstantiated, or have been proven wrong on countless occasions by independent investigations and experts. Further, where the author see fits, she obviously just makes up the \\"facts\\" to fit her ignorant hillbilly story about this tragedy.If you believe this garbage book, then every one of the investigators and experts on this subject must all be total liars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed and very well written! Great Book!","review":"I'm studying to become an analyst on terror groups around the world; so I already have a foundation and knowledge of how terror groups work.Let me first say Jayna Davis and her book called, \\"The Third Terrorist\\" is the most incredible book I've read in years!Jayna lets the facts and dozens of eye witnesses tell you the real story of the Oklahoma City bombing. What she uncovers is shocking! This book is very rich in content.

I never believed McVeigh and Nichols were the masterminds. Bill Clinton and Janet Reno let many terrorists who took 168 lives, escape justice. If the government would have captured each and every terrorist responsible for, at the time, the largest terrorist attack on American soil, the Twin Towers would probably be still standing today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read item","review":"This book, more than any, shows the true Clinton legacy: an abandonment of American National Security which eventually lead to 9/11.The faliure of the Clinton Justice department to follow through what Jayna Davis clearly presented in her book, and for years on her website, is appalling, and is a reason to recall Clinton and impeach him again for dereliction of duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"one point seems to have gotten past her","review":"Her work on a third bomber was very good and in fact, impressive. But just looking at the picture on the cover asks the question, how could one bomb create that non-symmetrical blast pattern. A closer look would say it selectively cut steel beams and that \\"should\\" be as impossible as our law enforcement somehow making sure no one looked for and found the obvious evidence about other bombers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts fascinating, writing terrible","review":"The author has brought together facts that cry out for further investigation, and one wonders why this has not taken place. But the writing is horrific. There is no cliche, no formula that is not used. Terrorists' eyes are cunning, or filled with hatred. Numerous law enforcement people or newsmen are \\"efficient,\\" or prescient, or resourceful. The author cannot leave any noun unadorned. Every adjective and awful adverb in her thesaurus are displayed. This would be a poster boy for bad writing, and should be used in journalism courses in that sense. But the data are highly interesting and provocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Documentation","review":"This groomed and well-planned masterpiece is not only great entertainment, but the weaving of a plethora of hard facts demonstrates the unconscionable illustration that if evidence is presented to the FBI which contradicts it's operating assumption-\\"the lone bomber\\" theory of two right-wing extremists acting alone (McVeigh later claimed he did the bombing all by himself) then they just simply ignore, obtuscate and broad-brush anyone who shows anything to the contrary. This book should be used to indict the practices, policies and procedures of the intransigent bureaucrats and higher ups in the FBI."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why President Clinton endorse the Iraqi Invasion!","review":"Have you ever wondered why President Clinton and Senator Hillary Clinton both, whole heartedly supported the invasion of Iraq after our invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11? It wasn't the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" it was their knowledge of Iraq's involvement with the Oklahoma City bombing. They knew the story but failed to take action.I could not understand the why President Bush invaded Iraq, after the invasion of Afghanistan, until I recalled the links in Jayana Davis book \\"The Third Terrorist...\\".

Who were the real culprits of this mass murder?Jayna Davis's book reads like an exciting mystery --a mystery about a truely frightening event: one of the first successful terrorist attacks on the heartland of America involving Middle Eastern terrorist. She presents a great deal of evidence that supports this conclusion. Jayna Davis and the witnesses are to be commended.This book is a must read for anyone seeking knowledge about terrorism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jayna has connected the dots!","review":"For all of you who still insist that the war in Iraq is not part of the the War on Terror, read Ms Davis. She shows with absolute certainty that the attack on the Maura Bldg in OK City was directly connected to 9/11 and to Osama BenLaden, and to Saddam Hussein.Even though the FBI has thwarted her investigation for over 10 years, she delivers the goods. Tim McVeigh, we all knew was a stooge, she shows how and who, and while you will emerge frustrated over our government's head in the sand mentality, you will also have a better grasp on the present, and why we are where we are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"Another fun Scarlet Pimpernel romp.

Mr. Brill's style is simple, elegant and expressive.

The horse especially is a masterpiece, created from a single uncut triangle it has perfect proportions and looks virtually alive. Brill's unusual style involves creating very solid, 3D models and tricky modular geometric shapes.However, these are very ambitious models, and the generally poor quality of the diagramming means they are very difficult to fold, even for a fairly experienced folder. The book would have benifited greatly from either photos or clear and well explained diagrams, as found in the 30+ year old \\"Best of origami\\".Oh, and one more thing. It's mearly a biproduct of the complexity of the models, but most of them are impossible to fold from normal sized origami paper. I have found that a roll of parcel wrapping paper is ideal for these projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here are some unexpected models....","review":"The models in this book seem a little too easy for experienced folders, but indeed it contains some unexpected models.

Macaroni and cheese is the ultimate comfort food and this book takes that to a new level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouthwateringly Good","review":"Marlena Spieler's new book is just fabulous. Not just the recipes but the mouthwatering photography by Sheri Giblin. In addition to the grilled cheese recipes, there's a detailed discussion of which cheeses and breads to use, and an accompaniments section with recipes for homemade tomato soup and zucchini pickles, as well as a salad summary.I know what I'm having for lunch, grilled American cheese on white bread with tomato soup. Although, that may disappoint the author, as she says, \\"American cheese is probably the most famous processed cheese. Don't expect to find it in this book. Why choose processed cheese when there are so many fabulous cheeses to choose from?\\" (p. 17) Well, first off, I'm in a reminiscent mood. Second, I have the ingredients in the house. But I promise, next time I hit my local cheese shop, I'll have to get some Telleggio and make the \\"Austin Powers' Shag-a-delic 1970s Grilled Ham, Cheese and Pineapple\\" or some Gruyere for a classic \\"Croque Monsieur.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"From one expert to another","review":"I run the offical Grilled Cheese Blog (search for it) and I have to say that this is the HANDS DOWN authority book on the subject of Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.

If nothing else, this record proudly states, \\"we will never make death metal again\\" (but then, you'd have known that if you read about how much Edlund hated the band's early material in the liner notes to the re-issues).But that doesn't mean they won't continue to make decent gloomy, catchy hard rock. Using that yardstick, this is probably Tiamat's best since \\"Wildhoney\\".They've built this monster on the same bones as \\"Skeleton Steletron\\", but fleshed it with stronger hooks, a few heavier riffs, and a clearer theme. It really does sound as if this is the muscles, tendons, guts, and brains missing from the last album.It's not their best. That much should be obvious. But it is a solid album. If you liked the last few albums, it won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Needed Dr. Phil in Acre","review":"While Robyn Young may have rigorously researched exactly who was where during the 1260s, she failed to invest similar efforts in researching the medieval mind. It doesn't really bother me when authors switch events around and monkey with chronology for the sake of a good story. What drives me insane is having characters raised on misery, disease, the Church and death, communicate with each other as though they'd just left their therapist's couch. The idea that all these knights were running around Outremer giving vent to their daddy issues and frustrated gay crushes, pining over whores with hearts of gold and crying about how they've never been loved is ridiculous. It's the very worst of touchy-feely revisionist history - trying to enforce twentieth century values on thirteenth century heroes to make them more palatable - and it's laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"I generally read non-fiction, and on occasion I will read some historical fiction to get a better feel for a particular time. That was my aim with this book. Unfortunately, this book didn't work for me. At first, the book held promise, cleverly weaving back and forth between concurrent events at various locales. However, after a while the book started to lose credibility. The main plot line and main motivation for the majority of the book was an invention of the author. Also, the characters start to talk with this \\"post-modern relativity\\" that just doesn't fit in with the period.By the end of the book, I couldn't care less about the characters because I couldn't relate to the choices they were making. They made no sense to me, particularly when coupled with 21st century psychobabble. I have no interest in reading the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fix for Da Vinci Code fans","review":"A hot blooded epic tale of the order of Knights Templar in the 13th Century. The perfect fix for fans of Da Vinci Code books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance novel riddled with false history","review":"I had to leave this book after only reading two-thirds of it. It started out slow and the pace never quickened. There were parts that were pretty riveting such as the Templars fighting and dying in the Holy Land. But the speculations about love interests, and abandoned families where the head of the household joins the Templars and sends his daughters to a convent were too contrived. Recent research from the Vatican archives has revealed that the charges against the Templars were false. As a matter of fact they were heroes of our civilization and only the evilness and avarice of the French king was responsible for their fall. One question has entered my mind: If these men were heretics, why would they die rather than deny Christ when they surrendered a citadel? This book is flat wrong in many areas. I would not recommend it to other readers and I do not look forward to the series envisioned by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brethren","review":"A very good plot premise that fails utterly in the execution. To put it mildly the main character is weak and overly emotional.

Definitely a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"I picked this up at the airport bookstore in Dubai where I spent two weeks followed by another two weeks in Baghdad.

I have read the Master and Commander series by Patrick O'Brian and the Sharpe and Saxon series by Bernard Cornwell. So I was looking for something similar in Brethren. And while it does share some blood and gore with Cornwell, the story and characters do not carry as well. (Oh my, did I just set up Obadiah Hakeswill as a well-developed character? Well, in comparison perhaps.)Unfortunately for me, this book shares its style more with The DaVinci Code. So if you liked that book, try this one. For me I feel this style trades character development for a few contrived, simplistic puzzles. With such a loss I lose interest. So, two stars and looking for my adventure lit elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed match of characters and scenery","review":"It was hard to picture the characters as well as the scenes despite the author's overuse of adjectives and adverbs. For example The dialogue between the main characters gave me a picture of modern day teenagers. The main character was so annoyingly weak that I did not care what happened to him at the end of this 'unnecessarily made long' story. This author has not convinced me to look forward to reading any other books written by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Later history of crusades","review":"I enjoyed the book a lot, especially parts related to the Crusader's struggle in the Middle East.

I would not recomend buying this at the currect used prices listed today. I give this 2 stars, not for the music, but for the nerve of MCA to issue this album with 4 less songs and it was already a very short album with 12 songs.

The vocal harmonies are amazing and progress perfectly with the many guitar parts throughout the CD. The best part of this album is by far the drumming. With almost offbeat patterns the drums set the pace for the entire CD, slowing it down to almost a complete stop sometime, just tpo build it back up to a choir of muscial talent.

The only fault of this disc is that it's too short. Gough's songwriting inspires me to make the bold statement that he is the closest living thing to John Lennon.

It's a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good for a soundtrack","review":"I just saw the movie, which is excellent, and now I have a face to the music I've been listening to the last two weeks. \\"About a Boy\\" doesn't qualify as a follow up to the fab \\"Hour of Bewilderbeast\\" but it none the less has some really great moments of music like \\"river sea ocean\\", \\"something to Talk about\\", and \\"Sileint Sigh\\". Some of the instrumentals do not work outside of being the background music in the movie such as \\"SPAT\\" which is a little annoying in it's mindless repetition.Badly Drawn Boy is a very talented \\"band\\" that has a great knack for writing songs that seem to just roll strait from his thoughts to the music- I mean it seems like he does this in his sleep. I recommend this as an excellent soundtrack and a pretty good Badly Drawn Boy album- Hour of Bewilderbeast is the one to get and then once you realize how fantistic this music is you might want to check out this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This album to me, is utterly amazing.

I heard \\"Something To Talk About\\" before being aware of About A Boy. I still have yet to see the film, but have listened to the CD countless times. It's solid and flows well all the way through, whether it be the actual songs or the bits of musical score. Badly Drawn Boy has proved himself a capable writer and performer of film music. I was not a fan of his music before this disc, but I certainly am now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Follow-Up","review":"Damon Gough aka Badly Drawn Boy's debut, The Hour of Bewilderbeast, was a sprawling song cycle by turns beautifully aching and terrifying. His soundtrack work for About a Boy is the perfect follow-up - another song cycle dictated by the narrative strictures of Nick Hornby's novel. Instead of confining him, though, Badly Drawn Boy is liberated. He finds universal truths in character specifics. The unflinchingly unsentimental story about a 30-something slacker who poses as a single father to pick up women through single-parent groups, and the complications which ensue, allows Gough to underscore the clipped emotions with expressive songs (both lyric and instrumental). Romantic entanglements and confusions ebb and flow through sixteen songs, culminating in the grand Phil Spector homage \\"Donna & Blitzen\\" - one of the best Oscar-bait ballads heard in quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unfortunately I bought the CD in a music shop and wasn't able to have a look at the song list (it was hidden behind the outer packaging of the CD), thus I was quite uppset when I realized that the soundtrack only contains songs of one musician. it might be good music, but as far as i remember, the movie had to offer much more than this. the least one can except is song that appears throughout the whole movie sung by the boy and his mother, and which is finally performed by the boy and Hugh Grant himself on stage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CopyProtected - Unable to play on computer","review":"Great album.

First off, it really doesn't sound like a soundtrack. The music lives on it's own with or without the storyline references. Tucked away are deep and soul-filled pop tunes that BDB has become known for. There really isn't a dull or bad moment on the disc.

I love the movie more now because I'm older and able to connect with the two protagonists who cannot express emotion. I loved the many extra features on this DVD except for the full-length commentary by Merhant/Ivory/Thompson. If it wasn't for Emma Thompson this commentary would have been the most dreadful one I've heard on DVD. Ivory has very little to contribute and Merchant is only content to mutter \\"hmm hmm\\" and \\"absolutely\\". By the way, what is \\"snog\\" (Emma uses it a couple of times)?

Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins are perfect in the leads and it was nice to see a healthy Christopher Reeves as well as a young Hugh Grant cast in it. The film is quite true to the book with a few changes - some of which were necessary in bringing the novel to the screen and some that seem quite pointless. The film is beautifully photographed with lovely views of England's countryside and the marvelous furnishings of great estates. And the acting, of course, if first rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"the remains of the day dvd","review":"I found this dvd to be very interesting,as well as beautiful.The scenery and actors are superb,As a child of WWII survivor's,this really brought home,and to the screen,many of the stories that I have heard,for many ,many years.It made that time in history come alive for me.In many ways we can take those lessons and apply it to ourselves,in our times.I would advise those who are interested in seeing a beautiful well thought out feature with marvelous acting and scenery,and so true to life--this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is urgent to see it in blu ray","review":"Perfect film. A classic in every sense: story, direction, performances, photography. So while this DVD version looks and listens very well, is very desirable version with all the advantages of blu ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"REMAINS OF THE DAY","review":"I love anything that Anthony Hopkins does is this is no exception. British films & television programs are the best. I had already seen this film numerous times before I purchased it & it's just as good as the first time I watched it. Excellent film! This is a definite keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a great movie to watch in sections. There is an onslaught of beautiful scene after beautiful scene with subtle brilliance by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson shining through. The dynamic created by their characters is spectacular. Anthony Hopkins does a better job in this movie than I have ever scene of someone remaining stoic in the face of situations that would rock anyone to his/her emotional core. His character is constantly hiding from everyone including himself. It really is a unique, stellar performance. Watch this film. You will not regret it.The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because the movie feels just a little bit long (but if you watch it in sections it goes very smoothly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great.","review":"Anthony Hopkins as always has played here just great. I think this role suited him very well. Emma Tompson played good, too, though not so well as Anthony; besides, we see her more seldom as her workmate.I liked this film very much. Why I put 4 stars instead of 5? Well, actually, I could put 3,2 or even 1. We feel a great and real English epoch, see great costumes, way of communication between people etc.... ... nevertheless, it's a very good movie, with good playing, music and scenery (I just love England's lands!) which would teach you some lessons of butlers of that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Character Study and Beautiful Period Piece!","review":"This is a brilliant drama of repressed emotions. The acting is simply masterful, Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job at showing us a very complex human being but also makes us understand him and care for him. Emma Thompson is also excellent as the housekeeper who is secretly in love with Hopkins. Christopher Reeve, James Fox and Hugh Grant are also great in support. As with all Merchant-Ivory films this one is a feast for the eyes, beautiful sets and costumes expertly recreate the era. Brilliantly smart screenplay also features some healthy doses of wit. Beautifully done, with great attention to detail. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seller Responsibility","review":"The seller was very quick and thorough in correcting an unfortunate oversight. This used VHS had reception problems and was returned. The transaction was very cordial and understanding (on both sides). Refund was immediate, including return postage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remains of nothing","review":"I'm a big Anthony hopkins fan. He never fails to live up to or exceed the limitations of any script put in front of him. As a butler in white ivory England the only thing expected of him was to play the role of a butler with supressed emotions. This of course is expected of any manservant. keep your opinions to yourself even if called upon to express them. Do your job. Boy thats a walk in the park for Anthony Hopkins to play a stone faced butler with a whisper or two of facial emotion While Emma Thompson (head maid) subtley attempts to get him to express them , but in such a boring fashion. It's not her fault and it's not Anthony hopkins fault.The script is boring. There's no drama, nigh but a hint of emotion. No love, not even a whisper of a thrill. Nothing but boring lines of conversation. No heart ache, no close friendship developing. Not even a happy or sad ending.It begins and ends on the same note. BORING SCRIPT and good acting. No plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite movies!!!!!","review":"Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins provide acting the way it used to be.

The \\"day to day\\" was about the servants at an English mansion of course. But the Jewish/nazi stereotypes were from beginning to end and the basis for all the turns in the plot. It has already been told MANY times. Also it appears you can't have a mainstream American British movie without the stock rich American interjected into the film (booooo). I thought this was about English servants and the way of life. It was kinda, in a way. But even that was muddled with weirdness. Anyway the acting was good of course. But I am sick of movies about such jews being killed by nazis and rich Americans running all over Europe (like we are all rich) all throughout time."},{"rating":"1","title":"better movies than this one are out there","review":"Anthony Hopkins as Stevens the butler constantly lets the profession of butler interfere with the living of life. The insular butler is not worthy of sympathy. Better go see an ostrich with its head in the sand. Only Hopkins and Thompson themselves garner attention in this huge yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRIIIIINNNNG!!!!","review":"I'm sorry but despite some brilliant acting performances from Hopkins and Thompson this has got to be one of the most BORING movies I've ever tried to sit through. Don't be fooled by artsy film snobs, this one is a snoozer. And oh by the way, the tenacious \\"loyalty, devotion and integrity\\" of Hopkins character that so many critics think is the cornerstone of the film, is in my opinion, distracting and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"If you want to waste an afternoon buy or rent this movie. I had seen this movie a few times in my younger years and decided to revisit it in hopes that I would understand more. I consider myself a remotely scholarly person and have been forced to read many boring classical novels, mythology and blah blah. Remains of the Day, I am sure, has some audience out there that can appreciate it, but I do not recommend it for at least 95% of the media/reading population. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remains of the Day","review":"I thought this the MOST BORING movie of all times! Gag me! Two great stars, dull movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking and Stoic Sentimentality","review":"Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson give wonderful performances deep with conviction and stoic realism of repressed emotions. At times this film is heartbreakingly difficult to watch. You can only anticipate how the characters would interact and react from the viewer's perspective and wish fulfillment. At times this is a frustrating film to watch. However, our place in life is sometimes predestined. There is a cruel and bitter lesson to be learned or perhaps unlearned here."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsubscripe american baby magazine is not easy","review":"We received magazine with suprise.

And she put nothing from \\"Sreet Angel\\" on here the CD - it had a couple of good songs on it that should'nt have been ignored. And \\"Nightbird\\" from 1983 would have been nice to have as well.

She is thrilled to wear it with her Luke Skywalker costume for Halloween. The material is thin, like most costumes you buy, but the price was right, and she loves it. It has held up through one Halloween adventure thus far, and it should make dress up and play time fun until she outgrows it.

The robe is not the one shown in the picture. It does not feature the closure in the neck area. It is fully open in front and has long loose arms, unlike the picture. The material is very light weight and cheap so when the hood is on it does not drape nicely. It will serve our purpose for Halloween but without the neck closure your child will have to have the sleeves on which will cover the costume sleeves unlike the image on the packaging. I personally feel duped but my son will still have fun with the robe."},{"rating":"1","title":"So different from the picture!","review":"I am not one to write bad reviews but this robe was not at all like the picture shows. First, it has sleeves (which are pretty long but I understand this and tried to shorten them myself) and second, it does not tie at the neck. There was no way to secure it so it kept falling off. In hindsight I could have used a safety pin but I didn't. I ended up tying the sleeves around the neck so that it wouldn't fall off as he ran around trick or treating but it looked pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Picture","review":"Well add my name to the list of people mislead by the photo on this product...it's only the brown robe.

But hey, shame on me for falling for it without double checking the reviews. I was just happy to have (thought I had) found a Star Wars Jedi costume for under $30, which seems to be the norm for cheap earth tone colored fabric.Anyway, the robe is brown. It has a hood. It's thin, cheap material. My son seemed to like it ok.

This song is a real disappointer to me, \`cuz those two did such a beautiful job with All My Life. Where the hell did they go wrong? And for some reason, their voices sound different and not as good as when they sang All My Life. I can\`t believe how every dang person in the U.S. can listen to this song and consider it one of the best they\`ve heard. Maybe your eardrums are different from mine, I don\`t know. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the story K-Ci and Jojo are trying to tell people about true love and deep emotions, like they did in All My Life.

It just looks sick and wrong, really, with this older, scary bear taking this young innocent away and teaching him his \\"bear ways.\\"This is not charming entertainment. This is a pain.

It was the night I will never forget.I remember it very much. What the movie has, the village homes made of straw like materials, Palm Trees, Jungle Scenery, the kind of boat feature in which Baby Mowgli was found are all here in real life. Including the moonlight scenery against background of jungle and Palm Trees. If you watch this movie in any African country, it will be a treasure in your memory and I keep watching this DVD over and over again. I am also looking forward to Jungle Book 2. Lion King is also another one which can match the specs. Nice work. Keep it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun-Filled Disney Movie for the Whole Family","review":"The Jungle Book was Walt Disney's last animated classic.It's an enchanting film based on the Rudyard Kipling stories about a young human boy named Mowgli, who lives in the jungle among the wild animals. I always find this type of movie so warm and loving. And it helps young people to love and appreciate animals.We first meet Bagheera, a panther. The baby Mowgli is crying and Bagheera hears him. The wolf pack cares for the baby. Then, years later,the wolves are threatened by Shere Khan. He wants to take revenge on all humanity.All sorts of problems and dangers occur.Bagheera just about gives up in his hopes to return the boy. Mowgli, however, sees some beautiful eyes looking at him and he goes into the village. Then good things start to happen.I didn't think the video was as clear and crisp as it could be. The audio was okay and in Dolby. If not for these two minor issues, I would have given it 5 stars.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the movie but this DVD is seriously flawed","review":"I picked this DVD up today and got it home to find that Disney had altered the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to make the movie \\"fit\\" on widescreen TVs. They did this by chopping off the top and bottom of the image. This results in the loss of a good deal of character animation (at least the tops of their heads and their feet). Trust me, I own the original Limited Issue DVD of this film and I did a side-by-side comparison as soon as I got the new Platinum Edition home. If you are a purist about original aspect ratios, please avoid this release and petition Disney to start a free disc replacement program. We should at least have the option of watching the original unaltered film the way that it was meant to be seen.***NOTE: There are now user images that can be viewed for this product that illustrate the cropping discussed in my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible!","review":"They cropped (or left out) the top and bottom of the picture to accommodate the new wide screen Tvs. Not good! This makes the earlier release on DVD an instant collectors item. It's a shame too because the rest of the restoration is beautiful. Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave to see how they mangled one of his masterpieces. Give us the movie as it was originally intended please."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but cropping is ridiculous","review":"I had anticipated this for many months, and am now disappointed. I noted the cropping to make it \\"widescreen\\" -- even though I understand that it was \\"masked\\" to be shown that way in theatres, as many theatres did. Both versions should be included -- is Disney ignoring today's media trends?I went and bought the old 1999 version from a used seller instead, and I recommend that if you're a true Disney animation fan, then you do the same. Cutting off characters' heads for the sake of our HD TVs is not an improvement, and this isn't the 1970s or 1980s anymore. We have choices now, and Disney should be following suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly dissatisfied","review":"While the Jungle Book remain one of my Disney favourites from my childhood days, watching this cropped version virtually killed all the magic that was in the movie. I was so distracted by all the cropped heads and feet there was no way I could concentrate on the plot. So much of the background and scenery was lost that it just threw the scenes off balance. Why even call this a platinum edition when the original 1.37.1 aspect ration was not preserved? Isn't that what a platinum edition is all about? Ever see a cropped Picasso or Van Gogh? This is the worst Disney release to date and I would hesitate buying another Disney release if they are all going to turn out this way. A total waste of money. Disney should refund or offer to replace all discs from dissatisfied customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A SHAME!","review":"Great looking restoration, vibrant colours, great stereo sound, some worthy bonus features on a second disc... But the movie, clearly conceived and designed for fullframe viewing -no matter how Disney released it theatrically- is here ruthlessly cropped at the top and the bottom to fill the widescreen tv, loosing picture information.

No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"i havent gotten the movie","review":"i never got the video i bought when will i be able to recieve this movie its been longer than 1month already"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Not the Disney Movie","review":"Despite the references to \\"Disney animation\\" and the correct date and director of the Disney movie, this is NOT the 1967 Disney movie, but the 1942 live-action version, which you can find for less elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Platinum) Great Movie, RIDICULOUS DVD","review":"I purchased the Platinum Edition.

Kipling's Mowgli is brave, competent, and completely adapted to life in the jungle. His Kaa is Mowgli's friend and protector. His Shere Khan is a fool.Disney twisted the story to make Mowgli naive and helpless. The only moment in the movie that (almost) rings true is Mowgli's attraction to the human girl at the end -- but in the novel, this only happens when Mowgli becomes a man. In the book Mowgli is driven back to man by traitorous members of the wolf pack, but returns to the jungle after killing Shere Khan and being rejected by his fellow humans.

He gives a in depth understanding of the text while not bogging down in scholarly elements that are confusing. I do not have any greek background training yet the commentary presented no problems for me. The only objections I have come in chapters 12-14 where his charismatic leanings are clearly evident. A conservative who doesn't believe that tongues are part of today's Christian life would disagress with Fee's interpretation of chapters 12-14. In Chapter 14 Fee considers verses 34-35 to be a scribal addition instead of part of the text. In my view this is a circuitous way of sidestepping the issue of women in the churcn. Overall the book will be a blessing to those who love the Lord Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly structured","review":"The film's goal is to get the word out on polygamy. Structurally, it fails to deliver. The film is all over the place. The through-line of the film is not clear and we don't get the basic information at the start of the film--this is necessary to get the point across. Without a clear foundation to build on, the film does not deliver. Footage is scarce (understandable, given the circumstances), but when used, it does not seem to correlate to what's being talked about. It's thrown in left and right to patch interviews together and doesn't contribute visually.If re-shot and re-edited, this film can have the intended impact.

While it costs a little more, Bing Crosby's The Voice of Christmas: The Complete Decca Christmas Songbook has much, much better sound quality (as well as a greater selection of songs)--I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Masterpieces in One, but Don't Buy from Scalpers!","review":"Mark Morris and his dance group are absolutely wonderful, and the music is gorgeous. But don't buy this DVD from scalpers. If you are an individual buying for home use, you can get a video at a much more reasonable price from Bullfrog Films. In fact, even if you are buying the video for an institution, you can get it from Bullfrog for less than what the scalpers are asking. In addition, I've been told that Morningstar Entertainment will be distributing the DVD within a couple of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, but...","review":"I bought this because I love the music, and because it's played by Tafelmusik. But like another reviewer, I haven't been able to watch much of it. The singing and playing are wonderful, but the dancing...I just can't take this big guy with the ponytail as Queen Dido. I don't mind gender-bending per se, but the whole thing looks like a drag queen performance. It's so distracting that I just can't watch it. What a disappointment, cuz it sounds great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atheists Should Read This Book","review":"This book is great for atheists. It will justify their unbelief and give them hope that they are right. Unfortunately, the scholarship is extremely weak and prejudiced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fania All stars in Cali Vol 2","review":"At the time this was ordered in Feb 2007. it was out of stock. I still have never received this CD as of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Conventional - Not much Digital","review":"As an experienced conventional film photographer I found this book very disappointing. There was not much new in it for me. Too much about film photography and not very much about digital cameras. In so many cases each section or page ended up with sending me to see my digital camera manual which I did not even own yet. Example: HOW TO SELECT AN APERTURE: Look in your camera manual for a section on aperture preferred or aperture priority, or apertures: (Then some blank lines in the book to write in your finding.) Very disappointing!I purchased the book as a used book through the zshops. The seller was great and shipped promptly. The price was too high for what I found in the book. I can see why the seller wanted to sell it, probably was not useful to him either. I considered reselling it myself but I don't want to go to the bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Disturbing","review":"This book is not even close to what it purports to be. It is a very basic guide to general photography, and the \\"digital\\" in the title is highly misleading. It does include a brief essay on digital photography, but the rest of book is about taking pictures, from how to use a zoom lens to types of flashes. The book is entirely black and white (and spiral bound) and has obviouly been copied from something that once included color. For instance, under \\"color balance\\" there is a b&w photo of a spectrum. In another photo, there is picture of a girl that \\"displays the classic 'red eye'.\\" Of course, you can't see red eye in black and white.I have never written a review before, but I am so frustrated by this book that I feel compelled. If I can prevent just one person from flushing their money down the toilet, I have done my good deed for the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album","review":"I love this album. The band is from Victoria, which is where I live (that's cool.) I've heard the song 'seems so far' about a hundred times over the radio, when they were 'the zone's band of the month.' All the songs on this album are excellent. When I first got this album, I could listen to all the songs without skipping any, start to finish.This is definitely an album you don't rock out to, very mellow and 'hypnotic' as critics put it.Great album, and recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant surprise","review":"This CD was a very pleasant surprise!! It is filled with catchy songs that have you coming back for more. Beautiful harmonies and lyrics make it stand out from the average band.

Includes maps, authentic photos, amusing stories and very interesting accounts of the evolution of the region. You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good not great","review":"This is a good book for a quick overview of NYC history, but it skimps a bit on some detail.

While it does have some nice features, such as the \\"Fortunes of Three New York Baseball Teams, 1903-1957\\" on p. 155, the are so many errors as to render it worthless. The worst example: p. 102 \\"City of Stores\\" map where all the stores on 6th Ave. & 23rd St. are shifted one block north of their correct locations and the labels for 2 of these stores (Stern's & Horner Furniture) are switched and two streets (University Place & 4th Ave) are mislabeled (4th Ave. & Bowery, respectively)!

IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THIS HUGE CITY STARTING OUT AS A LITTLE VILLAGE IN LOWER MANHATTAN BUT THIS BOOK GIVES YOU SOME IDEA OF WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE THEN AND HOW THE CITY GREW TO BE WHAT IT IS TODAY.

I found it to be poorly written and poorly organized. It strikes me as a book with chapters written by a variety of authors pulled together and glued into a book but without an editor to review the content. For example, from my experience, a good historical will explain the origin of an interesting item the first time it is used. Not so here and I found myself running to the computer every so often to see why \\"Canal Street\\" was named Canal Street or to see what happened to the Collect Pond. It more or less flows in time from chapter to chapter but you would never call it seamless and I found myself going back to see if I had missed a chapter while reading. As always, you are bound to learn something by reading this book, even if it is mostly how to detect poor grammar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danny Danzi rocks big time !!!","review":"Although the production could have been better I really loved this album after a few spins.

The songs are great, 4 stars just because of the production thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Works great at charging my rechargeable battery packs!

They are very well built, rugged, and do exactly as advertised. Not only do they work very well, but they also look good while doing so.

Charges fast, looks cool while doing it.","review":"Got exactly what the picture showed. The product is excellent, and charges two controllers at once very rapidly. I especially loved the lights that lit up while charging. Also, if you have a wireless headset, there is an adapter for it provided. I think the only downside is that you cannot charge any other rechargeable batteries other than the official XB360 rechargeable batteries. Otherwise, I would highly recommend buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everything but the color","review":"I like this, since it gave me a good place to store my controllers. I have the similar energizer product for the PS3 as well, and prefer that to this one since it's black. I have the black Xbox 360 Elite, so a black option for the color would've been better. Also missing on the Xbox version is a USB charging port for additional controllers like the PS3 one has.But it works well, the lights are not garish when charing or charged, and it works well. After months of use, no problem with controller hookups getting loose or anything, it still holds them well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Enegizers own batteries!!","review":"We bought this thinking it would work with ANY rechargeable batteries. It says on there that it MIGHT not work unless it's xbox360 rechargeable or Energizer rechargeable batteries. So we bought the Energizer batteries and they don't EVEN work! It took us 10 tries and a lot of time googling reviews before we realized we probably need to buy xbox360 rechargable batteries. At this point it is so not worth it! Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Charger!","review":"I love this charger, I have had it for months, I originally purchased is from EB when they first came out, and am buying another one as a present.

He does not talk about the Ideal State, rather, the States as it is -- the real and almost always brutal State. His work does not hold anything back. He tells it like it is -- like a realist.

This is a solid selection of Dream Academy's best songs. Granted, Dream Academy had only three CD albums. SOMEWHERE IN THE SUN collects the best of those recordings and with the exception of several omissions from the band's debut album, this is near perfect. A DIFFERENT KIND OF WEATHER was disappointing. REMEMBRANCE DAYS was good. But, DREAM ACADEMY is a gem. A perfect classic which everyone should own. This BEST OF CD takes the best from the 2nd and 3rd CD albums and adds PLEASE PLEASE LET ME GET WHAT I WANT. Bottom Line: This is a fine start and perhaps a perfect Dream Academy CD, but one should definitely own the act's debut CD [DREAM ACADEMY] because it never misses the mark. No filler, just pure pop perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"$199!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Are you kidding me?

I thought maybe I could just wipe the rest of it off, but there seems to be an endless supply of black dye. I don't dare use it because I fear that my clothes will also pick up the black dye. Other than that, it seems like a nice bag. If they redesign the bag and fix the dye problem, I would like it better if it didn't have the big \\"McKenzie Kids\\" label on the front and side.

I read a mixed review of this cd somewhere, but bought it anyway. WOW. How dumb was that? These remixes are mind numbing, boring and repetitive. Some are completely unrecognizable, taking the hooks and lyrics we know and love, removing them and putting in their place horribly dated synth effects and drum tracks. My one and only question: Did David Bowie hear these remixes before allowing this release? If so, what was he thinking???"},{"rating":"1","title":"largely forgetable","review":"well I'm with J Brady on this one. I guess Club Bowie is a hangover from the 80's when Bowie would release just about anything to make a buck. Most of the tracks on this album are just awful. Mind-numbing repetitive trash.

It'll remind you why you fought with those stupid, heathen critics and why you always won with arguments like: a) Billy Corgan's in-studio dictatorial egomania was a valid excuse for his sonic genius, and b) why you fell in love with D'Arcy and her bass playing.

I liked the fact that it was one of the few toys that a baby could activate without pushing a button or something equally hard for a small baby to do. Well, she ignored it for the most part, but I'm not going to blame the toy on that - she doesn't seem to play with any of her toys (is more interested in whatever she lies finding around the house). She is now 11 months and last night she actually played with it. Then, she started screaming. I ran over and saw that two of her little fingers got wedged in the star opening (between the plastic star and the bar that the star slides on). I quickly got them out, but basically had to pull the star off her fingers and she screamed some more. Luckily, it didn't leave any mark and a few seconds of comforting and she was okay.

But after listening to it many times (I can't remember how many), I started to get the idea. They're still the bungles, but this time with a Beach Boys touch. Tastes good. My favorite is \\"Ars Moriendi\\", which more or less has the Disco Volante approach. The only flaw is that it's too short, and I don't like waiting four years for another Bungle album. Not their most experimental album, but if you get bored with the mainstream bands, just buy it. And... don't forget to try Disco Volante too. I can't help myself wondering, is Zappa still alive?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Bungle has returned","review":"Mr. Bungle's latest LP California is one that deserves more than 5 stars, perhaps twice as many for the magnificant blend of rock, jazz, beach boys and Patton into one amazing experimental sound. \\"Retrovertigo\\" is the most pop of the songs, and I have read that it was released as a radio single, but have yet to heard any sighn of it on modern rock and mainstream rock radio. Aside from that song, most are structurless melodies you can hum along to but not repeat a verse. I love Mike Patton, he has inspired my vocal performance so much, so it is not hard for me to say that his vocals are uncomprehendable. If you liked Faith No More but not Bungle before, try this now, it is clear that Patton has turned Fantomas into his \\"agressive outlet\\" and Bungle is now his more natural side. Even Borsay might like it! Buy Mr. Bungle's California and listen to it multiple times. It is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just not feelin it","review":"I just cant see the whole Mike Patton thing,I mean yeah hes a great vocalist and i CERTAINLY THINK HIS BEST WORK IS BEHIND HIM. Faith No More had a COUPLE of good albums,and im not talking about Epic, but drivel is drivel is drivel. Maybe I have been spoiled by some real cutting edge music,or some of the vastly talented bands that metal has to offer,even on the progressive side. I'm sorry guys,this stuff to me while interesting,is just a complete cacaphony of noise. Perhaps Mike Patton should get together with another vocal icon who has long since run out of gas,Axl Rose,and can do some 50's doo-wop and perhaps some ballroom standards. Now THATS cutting edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"This makes my ears hurt","review":"I barely had the patience to listen to this entire album. I still don't know what kind of music Mr. Bungle wants to play. They do everything, and they do it AWFUL!! You have slow pop ballads, high-flying swing, heavy metal, techno, and even lullabies!! It's just strange music, and the horribly placed tempo changes drive you nuts. I guess some people like the different styles of music, but all put together; it's just a big scrambled mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Mix-Up","review":"So I'm at my local music store the other day and I'm listening to one of the many CD stations they have there, where you may listen to 10 different CDs. Well, I put it on what I thought was Mr. Bungle, and right away I thought it sounded pretty good... kinda like Nine Inch Nails, you know, with that industrial rock feel to it. So I took Mr. Bungle off the rack, went to the cash counter, and paid for it. Needless to say I was a little disappointed when I got back home and started playing California. I don't know if there are any two bands out there that are more different than Mr. Bungle and Nine Inch Nails.I don't know if I was listening to the wrong CD, or if they had the wrong CD in the player, but it was definitly not the CD I was listening to in the store. Oh well. Makes for a semi-interesting story, I suppose. If anyone wants a free Mr. Bungle CD, let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't get it","review":"I liked Faith No More.. I liked Fantomas.. and Tomahawk was pretty good when I saw them open up for Tool, but Mr. Bungle I am not impressed with. I did not like this CD. Sure it's experimental, but it doesn't sound very good. Could not find one memorable or listenable thing about this album, thus making this a drab and torturous musical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"why even bother?","review":"Trying to review Mr. Bungle's California is like trying explain the mind of god. Why bother? Just listen. Those who are disappointed with it apparently haven't grown up yet, or just don't get it anymore. The best effort yet by Mr. Bungle. Mature, concise, and even more intelligent and adventurous. But now I must know the mind of god."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deranged and beautiful","review":"I have all of Patton's FNM CD's, but this was first attempt at one of his other projects. I picked it after reading all of the reviews that claimed that California was Bungle's \\"most accessible.\\" After my first listen I thought it was complete garbage. I was still ready to toss it in the trash after 3-4 listens. I gave it a few more listens and liked a few more songs. By the 10th or so listen it was a full-on addiction, like musical crack. Patton is incredible on this one. To me he comes off as a cheeseball lounge singer on most of the tracks. You have to get this CD and give it some time if it doesn't click right away. At first I thought that \\"Ars Moriendi\\" and \\"Goodbye Sober Day\\" were possibly the stupidest songs I had ever heard, but now they are my fav songs on the CD. Stop whatever you are doing and buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you oh sky above....","review":"This is an album of uninterrupted greatness. The immediate profundity of \\"California\\" is amazing, and then you go back and listen to it 30 more times and each time you discover something new...hearing sound effects and musical tracks so dense in the mix that you are awed with each listen. Mr. Bungle gets better with each successive album and this is their current watermark, their masterpiece, the finest output of their 15 year career. A band together since High School, they have grown and matured and become shining gods of music. Listen to this, then listen to their other albums, listen to their side projects (Secret Chiefs 3, Mike Patton) and understand that a musical genius behemoth has landed on earth and crushed all possible competition.If you do not own this album, you are ignoring your mind and soul and they will get you for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Califormia","review":"'California' must surely be the first Bungle album to be a truly rewarding experience. Tracks such as 'Pink Cigarette' and 'Sweet Charity' will be exceptionally favourable to the easy listening FNM fans, whilst the magnificent 'None of them knew..' and 'Goodbye Sober Day' experiment whilst maintaining a strong degree of accessibility. Basically, pretty damn good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Melting Pot -reminded me of Zappa, big time!","review":"Listening to Mr. Bungle for the first time has proved to be a little challenging. For the casual listener, it will be material almost impossible to penetrate. But if truly prog music appeals to you, if you ever liked Frank Zappa or if you enjoy jumping from Ska to Middle Eastern to Speed Metal, etc., dig this album. It is filled with musical surprises at every step. Mr. Bungle, with \\"California,\\" their most recent production, have accomplished the equivalent to a musical melting pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy mother of Pearl.. wow","review":"I mean... gosh... I cant explain it! This CD is absolutly my all time favorite CD! They are so original in their work and their vocals are Awesome. Heres were the story started, im in my friend Joes car and he puts in this CD. I ask him who is this and he tells me Mr.Bungle. I rush to the store and buy this CD. I have hooked 5 of my friends on Mr.Bungle just by letting them listen to the 1st song. Me and my friends cant stop singing sweet charity in school. People tilt their heads at us and ask Whatcha singing? We just smile and say Mr.Bungle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank god!","review":"This review is not going to be long! It\`s been a while since the last offering from bungle, but it was well worth the wait. This is what it\`s all about folks! Patton at his vocal best, with second to none..... musical genius! This will go down as one of my favourite albums of all time because of it\`s versatility, every track is a beast! TOP TRACK : Vanity Fair. Mike, we need more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VINYL reissue","review":"A brilliant album, of course. But like the notorious vinyl reissue of the first Bungle album, this is not a good purchase. The mastering is extremely quiet; I found I had to turn the volume to nearly twice the level that my turntable normally requires, and because of that, the sound distorts. Some might say that this is necessary because of the way the album was recorded (multi-tracked, full-frequency, etc), but I don't think this is the case. It's a shame, because this album was clearly destined for vinyl (ten songs in 45 minutes, the 60s-style cover, etc). Warner Bros. should have done it themselves back in 1999, but oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Syd has returned to us.","review":"At the present moment, this is the only CD with Mike Patton on it that I own. However, I feel the urge to get more. These guys have great instrumentation (\\"None of Them Were Robots,\\" \\"Goodbye Sober Day\\"), and extremely depressing lyrics that seem eerie when paired with the seemingly upbeat music (\\"The Air Conditioned Nightmare,\\" \\"PInk Cigarette\\"). Pop music was almost proclaimed dead, but then I heard these guys. Mike Patton is a modern day Syd Barrett, and you will find as much insane genius here as on Piper at the Gates of Dawn. If you are fed up with all that crud on the radio, and want some GOOD music, definatly check out Mr. Bungle.DISCLAIMER: Because of its wierdness, it may take you a few months to get accustomed to California. Once you do, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Bungle album.","review":"Like others have said, this is the most \\"mainstream\\" work by Mr. Bungle. The songs on this album are infectiously catchy and will stay lodged in your cranium for days on end. It's hard to describe this album in words, but all I can say is that if you're new to Mike Patton or Mr Bungle, this album is a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"The change was for the worse","review":"I heard this albumn expecting the compositional genius of Disco Volante, but what I got was much, much worse. This was the most pathetic attempt at commercialism I have ever heard. These guys were wacky jazz gods, this pop drivel works only good as a frizbee down at the park. All you guys giving this 5 stars ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Loyalty is not relevant when bands change genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEY","review":"Okay. Some people are just rude. I take offense to calling me a fan of \\"MTV Garbage.\\" I hate MTV and all the stupid teeny-bop shluck they put on there. I was simply being honest about my impression of the music. I reviewed this CD for my college radio station and I'm sure I won't buy the CD. I'm also sure these guys do a great live show, because there music is geared towards a live audience, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to them?","review":"What the heck happened to them. Did the guitarist die? Did they forget how to rock? Does anyone rock anymore? Between this and the new Chili Peppers Ballad fest, I am about to give up on music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"This, in my opinion is their best album. Although, I do have to say that their self titled album comes pretty close though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is Mr. Bungle on a lazy sunday by the beach. This is Mr. Bungle's summer music. This is Mr. Bungle in 1999. Ok that was stupid but this is good music.

They are simply the most brillant and innovative band of the nineties. Especially good: Retrovertigo, Pink Cigarette, and Ars Moriendi."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unveiling of the Deus Absconditus is almost achieved!","review":"Mr.Bungle's California is as close to perfection without confining one to a state of complete stasis. Nonetheless, when I first listened to the CD I was nearly frozen in time. Mr.Bungle's new CD is absolutely majestic and will be elevated into a distinct musical sovereignty. However, this CD does require courage well above the assumed metal-head bravado, which is usually displayed at Faith no More concerts, when allowing the music's magnificence to penetrate through the corporeal veneer of most listeners. Again, Mr.Bungle's California has aided the Divine to slightly reveal its existence piecemeal to us through each track. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bungle's Best! - A Totem of the Living Wrought from the Clay","review":"From opening to hazy ending this is Bungle's best. Yes, even better than the self-titled shin-dig. Mike Patton has broken new ground with his stunning lyrics and awe-inspiring delivery. Mike's vocalizations, several layers deep on every rich track, swarm around themes and melodies ranging from Beach Boys-esque to Islamic calls to prayer. The band is tight while exploring innovative changes of pace within each track. In borrowing from so many familiar genres, Bungle has essentially created a new, refreshing style that will soon be copied. California is to Bungle what Incesticide is to nirvana, or Sgt. Pepper's is to, um, what's the name of that goofy band . . . I think they were Welsh, or something. Anyway, if you really like alternative music DON'T buy this cd. Your miniscule brain won't be able to handle it. Only the FAITHFUL deserve to be enraptured by Bungle's genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artwork!!","review":"Wow! Thats about the best I can put it. This is the first Mr. Bungle album I bought and it was a hell of an adventure from the beginning to end. It takes a special group to be able to take different styles of music from the whole spectrum and make it flow like that. My favorite song is probably the last one. From the Arabic vocal patterns to the Heavy Metal thrash, it was a blast to listen to. Anybody who's looking for a blend of music with no limits, Mr. Bungle is the way to go. Like many other reviewers have mentioned before, this one is the most accessible CD they put out, and I mean that in the most relative sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Bungle Has returned... and Reinvented Themselves!","review":"It is apparent that Mike Patton has an appreciation for Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. \\"California\\" pays tribute to Wilson's greatest effort \\"Pet Sounds\\".Track by track this latest effort by Mr. Bungle is nothing less than astonishing. Gone are the noise bits between songs. What has returned is an eveness to the whole project. This is no \\"Disco Volante\\". \\"California\\" is a blatant new direction for this combo and it seems they've refound their strengths while eliminating the excesses that plagued their second effort.I give it four stars...only their first album would get five."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than rock influences.....","review":"has anybody noticed Bungle's use (Stealing) of the Balanese monkey chant on this CD??? or am I the Only one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best CD in the universe","review":"take the average stars they have for disco volante, multiply them by the average stars for mr. bungle, raise it to the power 1 000 000 000 000, and you'll get the average stars that california desires"},{"rating":"2","title":"All ages!","review":"My twenty month old son dances around the house on the war path as Patton excersizes his demons right before my family's ears in my living room.

We all fall to the floor in laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!","review":"The rat certainly would be an appropriate image for this subject, except in this case it is an insult to rats.What an awful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in it's day","review":"When the first edition came out, it was an atypical O'Reilly book; they were known for publishing guides for working programmers, but this was more of an introduction to a topic instead of a reference.The problem is that it's not 1998 anymore. The technology this book explains (quite clearly!) really isn't used that much anymore, save by people who already know Perl quite well and want to leverage that skill to simple web scripts.PHP, Python, Java, and Ruby all come to mind as a few of the modern approaches to the same topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be ready to do extra research...","review":"There seems to be some good content, but I'm shocked at the number of errors in the code examples. They probably should have had an extra round of editing before they published. Check the errata page at the O'Reilly web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Write an outline before you start writing a book","review":"Fairly good content, but hideously organized. The book jumps all over the place and really lacks the coherence I've come to expect from O'Reilly books. I used \\"Learning Perl\\" to get pretty good with Perl in two weeks. The book on HTML is terrific as well. A good \\"Learning CGI\\" book to lead into this one would be nice I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a better book","review":"As I'm not an experienced programmer, I did find this book very difficult to understand. The authors assume you have an in-depth knowledge of PERL and the workings of CGI.The book does offer some good knowledge in real-life examples for Webmasters. It discusses forms and how the information is passed with certain HTML commands. However, if you want to learn about CGI, choose another. As for Perl, I've found Larry Wall's books very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"One of the worst books I have ever tried to read. Brought it back for refund. Badly organized. Hard to understand. Those guys probably paid for their own book to be published."},{"rating":"2","title":"One man's clear view","review":"Larry Brody has TV welded to his brain. In a good way. This book has been criticized for being too narrowly focussed and singularly anecdotal. I agree that it's focussed, but if I want one person's perspective and anecdotes, it's his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh.","review":"The earlier reviewer is right--there are many factual errors in this book; so many that it becomes merely a collection of opinion pieces. Frequently the author digresses so far from his stated subject--the essay on I Spy hardly says anything about I Spy--that you wonder if he even remembers what the subject is. The book is pretty much a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film but only if subtitles have been redone!","review":"This is an outstanding film with some haunting scenes and bare realism, well worth viewing if you can find a version with the subtitles redone. The subtitles from the original movie blank out in many many scenes due to white in the background. If you understand Spanish this doesn't matter to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling work","review":"One of Bunuel's best films. Deeply disturbing--mirrors what's happening today in the poor neighborhoods of the United States. As awful as this sounds, the film makes an excellent argument for abortion--if the parents are not willing to raise their babies in a proper, loving manner, society will suffer as the unloved children will surely turn to gangster rap. You can find a copy of this film on DVD on the \\"Viva Mexico\\" series--though in Spanish, the film comes with English subtitles. Also features the 'happy' alternate ending which, thankfully, was never used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrelentingly grim, but worth watching","review":"This is a rather unreletingly grim film about young people in Mexico City's barrio in the early 50s. Sympathetic and intersting characters draw you into the film, such as the orphan \\"Little Eyes\\" and his female friend, and Pablo, the street urchin hated by his mother because of her bitterness toward the boy's absent father. Audiences will be repelled at first by the boys' mugging of a blind and crippled man, but the film shows you both sides of the story. Not exactly the most uplifting material in the world, but it is a timeless example of the saying \\"Children learn by what they live.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No English Subtitles","review":"Product on this page doesn't say anything about subtitles but I guess i assumed a region 1 NTSC DVD would probably have them. Most DVDs now usually have subtitles in multiple languages on them. Not this one, it has ZERO subtitles in any language.Since this is one of the great films of world cinema and there is no American DVD release, I would recommend skipping this version and buying the PAL region 0 France import version titled: Young And The Damned. That one says subtitles in its description(Most DVD plays can be made PAL and NTSC- all regions, just google your DVD model for the code. Normally its a sequence on the remote to a secret menu).Otherwise, if you speak Spanish this version does look very nice. I might try finding subtitles online, ripping this DVD to my computer and reburning it with the subtitles i found. Not the kind of thing I want to waste my time doing to enjoy the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plight of the hopeless","review":"Undoubtedly Los Olvidados is a significant standard of comparison for all films dealing with the cruelty and despair of life at its most despairing. Bunuel is a genius to capture such horror in the form of realism, with just a touch of surrealism with the dream scene. However, realism overall seems to become surrealism in that what occurs is difficult to stomach, difficult to imagine. It's easier of course to watch this with the typical detachment that has become a part of our lives; the challenge however is to watch it and let it hit and hit hard because it is reality and more so now than ever before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mexico in Denial","review":"Los Olvidados is my personal favorite of all of Bunuel's films.The dream sequences within the plot offer obvious surrealisticmotifs, but the true power of the movie is the realism he createdby taking a story from a Mexico City newspaper and translating it to screen using mostly neighborhood kids. I haveshown this to Mexican immigrant students in my classroom and amalways impressed with the power this film wields over its audience. Incorrectly translated, the title means \\"The Forgotten\\" rather than the \\"Young and the Damned.\\" By the way,the Mexican public crucified Bunuel when the film came out, having to relent, when it later took first prize in Franceat that year's festival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film!","review":"Luis Bunuel's \\"Los Olvidados\\" is a true depiction of urban poverty in Mexico City during the mid-twentieth century. Bunuel does a fantastic job of capturing the speech, slang, and even the mannerisms of the local youth, and shows these as they involve themselves in a series of crimes including that grow in severity from theft to murder. The final scene, as shocking as it is, sums up the total disregard for human life as everyone is out for themselves. Haunting and provocative. \\"The Children of Sanchez\\" is a book by Oscar Lewis that complements Bunuel's film. Released in 1961, this autobiographical depiction of a Mexican family really takes you through a powerful journey of poverty and suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Spanish langueage film","review":"This is one of old classic Spanish language film that is realistic and very intersting.

This feature produced way more steam.I have 4a4b natural coily hair. Of course I straighten my hair first. These rollers worked magic!!! Loooooove. I will definitely use again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is a big letdown","review":"I purchased this product for my wife, after she had purchased one and only worked once.The unit I purchased also did not work as promised. Based on reviews and videos from other \\"users\\", it looked to be an impressive unit, however, after the first use on both units, the devices barely distributed any steam for the process. Instructions were followed precisely. But to no avail.My opinion is for people to not waste their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frizzy Curls","review":"I bought this because of a fashion blog (Wendy Nguyen). She recommended it and made a video of her using them, making them look super easy and convenient. I didn't find it to be either of those things. First of all, Wendy has super thin hair vs my thick hair. I don't know how much of a factor that is but the curls were frizzy, messy, and unattractive. I've used twice & haven't opened it since. It was 40$ down the drain when curls made by my 15$ curling iron & 15$ hair curlers did a way better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I purchased this set after carefully reading reviews on many steam rollers. I was replacing a 20 year old steam set that had hard plastic rollers and gave me big bouncy curls in an hour. This set sounded great as reviews indicated needing only 15 minutes to set. I have steamed the rollers anywhere from 5-10 seconds and my hair is NEVER dry in 15 minutes. I often have to use a hair dryer to complete the process so I can get to work on time. Also the roller covers leave dents in your hair. I purchased the Conair clips as suggested by other reviewers and they help. Still the curls do not last all day, are somewhat flat and no bounce. Since the rollers are foam you cannot get a big bouncy curl like I was looking for. I would not purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heating element kaput after 4 months","review":"I used the Caruso rollers 2-3 times a week and always emptied the water and kept the unit clean. I was vacationing in Aruba and planned on using the rollers on my hair as well as my friend's hair. Alas, plugged the unit in and nothing, the heating unit was dead. I had only had the rollers for four months. When I purchased the rollers, I read many reviews and several people stated that their rollers had also \\"died\\" after only limited use. I certainly did not expect to be one of them. I would never purchase a Caruso product again and have since purchased Vidal Sassoon steam rollers."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad....... boo, hoo!","review":"I love the Caruso Professional ION Steam set of rollers. I am on my 5th set of rollers. I use them everyday. It leaves my hair in good condition, lasts all day and actually is good for anyone's hair. I purchased my most recent set on Amazon. I received it on April 23, 2006. I used it less than two months, then with a loud pop, it died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap made","review":"Received this item today. Excited to open, disappointed to see. First of all, it came in colourcof grey instead of red.Most important is There are several crack markes on unit. I can tell right away that this product is made from very cheap material, plastic and foam. With cracks and obvious low quality material, i dont see it will last. I bought this based on good reviews here, which means i was misled. Will try to return it.Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam HairsetterUpdate, very good customer service though, had a smooth return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam hairsetter","review":"After reading some of the opinions of others, I was truly looking forward to getting the Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter. Unfortunately, I found that although it does set in curl, the curls are flat and they don't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did Caruso quit using the version with salt?","review":"This is my 3rd Caruso but I have used these curlers for about 15+ years. I gave away my first Caruso(that used salt) to a friend with short hair because the large curlers were wearing out. My second one just quit working but also lasted for years. This is my 3rd Caruso and I'm shocked at the cheapness of the foam on the curlers.Can we put salt in these newer model Carusos? My curls did last for several days with the original model and now I have to use them every day. I keep buying the Caruso because I don't want to burn my hair with hot rollers or curling irons.I can't help but wonder why the Caruso manufacturer fixed something that didn't need fixing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advertising problem.","review":"The product is great but is FALSELY advertised as the only setter with dual world wide voltage. The product guide clearly states for 120v ONLY. So if you are planning to take this overseas, make sure you have a converter for items that create heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used Caruso products for years","review":"I have used this type of Caruso product for years (steam curler system). I found this new version of the product to be a little less than I am used to in performance. The new system doesn't seem to steam as much as the older styles. I don't feel that I get quite a tight of curl and feel that the \\"staying power\\" of the curls is less. BUT I will continue to use it because the use of steam works best on my hair.Caruso C97953 SalonPro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter with 30 Rollers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"It's a little tricky at first, but once you get the hang of getting your hair around the rollers it works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"With all the hype on healthy hair forums about the caruso steam rollers, I was very excited when it arrived. After my first attempt I had limp curls that did not last longer than 1 hour. On my second attempt I did it on dry hair with very little products added as I though the moisture from my styling products may have made my hair to limp, nope. On dry hair with minimal product had the same limp hair. Needless to say, the caruso set went right back to Amazon for my refund. I have 4A fine relaxed hair, so this product may be great for those who tex-lax or ladies who are natural with thicker hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely strong plastic smell!!","review":"This product works well, but the smell of plastic is overwhelming. I am concerned about the long term health effects of anything that smells so strongly of plastic, and sends very strong fumes into the air. I ran the unit outside several times to try to get rid of the fumes, but they were still horrible. I do not recommend this product at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE; ROLLER COUNT IS DECEIVING","review":"I owned the original back in the '80s and loved it. I just purchased this new model with the promise of 5 different sizes of rollers, 6 each, for a total of 30.It arrived. With 30 rollers. As follows: TWELVE Jumbo/Large (in the ad, they state that Jumbo and Large are two different sizes; they are not. Roller is clearly marked \\"Jumbo/Large\\". There are 6 each of medium, small and petite.I am furious at having been duped. What's further enraging is that the enclosed roller re-order form actually lists \\"jumbo\\" and \\"large\\" with two different SKUs!This is preposterous and deceptive. Amazon should correct it right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it at all","review":"Was really looking forward to this hair roller set. It is much harder to use. Takes longer to set.

These make your hair damp so no curl will hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Breaks the Hair Off From the Steam","review":"I purchased these outside Amazon a couple years back. Wouldn't buy these again. I find that these still dry the hair out and if your hair is very long will break it off. Not sure if there are any heated rollers that won't make the hair brittle. These are no different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my hair","review":"This might work for some, but not my hair. I have thick hair that holds onto moisture (shoulder length that takes 1 hour to blow dry) and the rollers left my locks a complete mess. No curls, no shine-just a frizzy mess. I experimented with the amount of time I left the rollers on the steamer, but nothing worked for me. I was hoping that these would work because I am concerned about heat and damage, but returned these and bought the BaByliss Professional 30 Nano Titanium Hairsetter Roller Set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam Curlers","review":"This product takes too long to use. It only takes a single curler at a time and it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should know this product takes nearly an hour to set.","review":"People rave about this product. However I followed all the instructions and found it takes 5 minutes for each roller to heat up. That's nearly an hour if you use just 12 of the 30 rollers! Then an additional 15 minutes to let it all dry. The curls did not last even a few hours on my hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd like to return this please","review":"I'd like to return this please it didnt meet my expectations or needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great product after 15 years!","review":"I have used this product since I was 19 and I'm now 37.

I was a big fan of the original Caruso steam setter that required the addition of salt. It gave great curl and I got tons of compliments on my hairstyle back then. Style lasted all day. I just bought this, excited at the prospect at reliving those good hair days. But, alas, I haven't found the secret to \\"curls that last for days\\" or even hours. I've even tried leaving these things on for over 20 minutes and I've tried having completely dry, unwashed hair and leaving them in for 20 minutes. Not great curl and it doesn't last If something changes, (it's 12/20/08 today), I'll get back to ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the finish look but hate the sound","review":"The steam setter did its work well. The only thing bothers me is the beep sound when I use ionic steam setting. The continous un stop beep sound is killing me. So annoy. I did watched some video of others use this product. why there's so such sound on their video. Is it a new feature of this product or I am getting a defect one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Better than I Expected","review":"I am truly surprised by how well these curlers work. My only complaint that there were too many large/jumbo rollers that came with the set and I had to order more medium sized rollers. The other reviews for the product were helpful and truthful. My hair is thick so it takes little longer for the curl to set in but I am pleased with the results. I always get compliments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I am an African-American woman with fine, relaxed hair. I have used the hairsetter about 5 times now and my hair does not keep the curl. I have used setting lotion, let the curlers absorb more steam or less steam and have tried using the blow dryer on them while in my hair, but my hair comes out slightly frizzy and then the curl is gone in a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I purchesed the Caruso as I had been using one for years but my rollers had worn out. I though I might as well update the machine as mine was so old. I received the machine and didn't open it for a couple of weeks. When I used it for the first time I found it was defictive and didn't work. I wrote saying it didn't work and after over a week I still have no reply. It was shipped fast enough but I am very disappointed in the service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money!","review":"This is the biggest waste of money ever! I have naturally straight hair & I recently colored it. I bought these rollers so that I don't do more damage to my hair. My hair has never held a curl with these. I have tried steaming the roller for more time & for less time than the booklet says. I also leave them in for a minimum of 45 minutes. Still the curl will not hold for more than 30 min. & the curl that it does give is super weak. Now when I want a little curl in my hair I have to resort to using a curling iron. Such a bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"These things were total junk. Very cheaply made. The rollers were just plactic spools with sponge surrounding them. They loose their heat within a few seconds. Did nothing for my hair. I'm throwing the whole thing away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work!","review":"The device was broken. I plugged it in and nothing happened.I've used the standard Caruso steam rollers before, and they ususally break after about four months, so my expectations weren't too high. But this one was broken from day one, and the warranty is useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No user manual","review":"This hairset that does not include a user's manual. I find this unacceptable. I have spent over 1 hour on the Internet trying to find some instructions and there is nothing available."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for anyone who is familiar with the old clairol steam setter","review":"A disappointment. Mine arrived yesterday and I used it today. It's pretty easy to use, but the curl is weak. I bought it based on reviews and my history of some years back having a clairol steam setter. It was so good for my hair I thought it was time to give up the curling iron. Wrong. I had to go over each curl with the iron to get a substantial curl with body. Sad, now I have a full system to add to unused articles. Not cheap enough for one use."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY","review":"I have had my roller set for a little over 2 months. During that time I have used this product 2 times. Of those 2 times, I was only pleased with the result once. Yesterday, I decided to roll my hair and give this product another chance. The problem is, the Caruso ION Steam Hairsetter would not heat up. It actually began to have an electrical smell after several minutes of heating so I unplugged the unit. Additionally, I had to order extra rollers, incurring more cost, because the rollers sent with the set were not sufficient to roll my long hair. Since I am outside of the return window, I will have to eat the cost of the hairsetting set and the extra rollers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I used to have a Caruso, but it was huge. This one is much smaller and takes up very little space. It heats quickly and is very easy to use. It works so well that I use only the large rollers. I haven't even tried any of the smaller sizes because I'm afraid I'd look like Shirley Temple! My curls last all day even in the hot humid weather we experience in Austin, Texas. This time around I use only distilled water (using Texas tap water messed up my old unit). I'm very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caruso Hot rollers","review":"I bought this as a gift for my wife. So far she is very happy with it. I heard a friend compliment her hair the other evening and she went on and on about her new hot roller system. As a man, I know absolutely nothing about this stuff, but it is rare for my wife to be that vocal about anything, so I suppose that she likes it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to understand","review":"Although I have taken courses in multivriate statistics, I had a very difficult time getting through the second chapter in this text. Certainly, there must be something that is easier to understand. The author writes as if he spent his whole life inside the ivory tower and gravitates towards three and four syllable words. I thought that this book would be simple to uderstand because it is targeted to students in the social sciences. I thought wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Data and Syntax CD with the book","review":"I think this book is useless unless the author includes a CD of data and syntax as had been done by Gujarati and Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent overview of time series","review":"His book added a new level to my understanding of how to run time-series analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"This book was well researched, and provides an entertaining and enlightening insight into an era that could not exist since the civil rights movement of the 60's. It speaks to social justice and inclusion, bias and the ability to transcend existing norms to earn a living at a time when, for black America, second class citizenship and economic hardship were the norm. Mr. Watkins is the professor and we are his students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preserve History","review":"Get a copy or two for history's sake before all is re-written and it's all sunshine, roses, honey and milk.

We followed my cycle for a full 6 months without having intercourse - very difficult but important since we were not ready to have children. As a scientist, I fell for all of the evidence listed in the book, but unlike a scientist, I failed to question it. There is a lot more evidence out there that this method does not work. Be on guard, do your research, and be prepared!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REALISTIC, Historic Fiction for Readers with Patience","review":"This Newberry Award winner is a classic that may best be appreciated by readers with patience for a slower lifestyle. This is not for action-adventure junkies waiting for a roller coaster ride of thrills and suspense. I enjoyed this book because I am familiar with the setting in Northern New Mexico around Taos, which is well described in the book. For hundreds of years ranch owners have sent their shepherds and sheep to the green grazing fields in the local mountains during the summer months. The desire to go to the mountains with the sheep would have been a common personal conflict with older children. As a work of realistic fiction, it portrays a real lifestyle with real dreams and conflicts in a time and place before our modern technology, noise, and adrenaline surges of a rushed, stressed based lifestyle. This book is for the sophisticated reader who is looking for a good story in a work of historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooooring...","review":"This was the slowest-moving book I have ever read. I haven't read it in a while, but I think there was a whole normal-sized chapter where all they talked about was a feast. I had to abandon the book half way through because it bored me so much. It was a big waste of time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring BookI ever Read","review":"I think this book was so boring! I also think that the summary on the back of the book was a lie. He did not have \\"devasting\\" consquences. Please! I mean, you tell me what was so \\"devasting\\". I'm all ears.

The photos are great and the classic rhymes timeless. Would recommend for any child!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was about his DAUGHTER!","review":"Yes, Galileo was ahead of his time. He was brilliant, a genius, and a good man to boot. But, the title of the book is \\"Galileo's Daughter.\\" Yet, only 30-40 percent of the book is about her, and the rest rambles ad nauseum about Galileo's writings, aches & pains, trials & tribulations. I already know about that!His daughter was a fascinating woman, and though much information about her specifically is lost, much information about convent life must exist, and therefore, conjecture could be made and more could have been inferred about what her life must have entailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"long read but good history","review":"this book gives you alot of history that you wont find in any history class based around the letters of gallileo's daughter to the philosipher himself this book details the life of gallileo starting with his carrer as a philosipher and than his later trip to the inquisition......its a hard read but well worth the time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes scientific history a page turner","review":"I do have to agree with other reviewers that this book is not about his daughter, but besides that I found little wrong. I was hoping for historical fiction when I picked this one up and almost gave up when I discovered a more biographic approach. I am so glad I stuck with it. I never knew the details of Galielo's trial and his relations with the church, etc. I was even unclear whether he was put to death for his beliefs before I read it! Most explanations I was able to follow, but some still eluded me. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction or would be interested to know the background of this amazing man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming read","review":"Reading letters to Galileo from his daughter is something every scientist, historian, or interested reader can now enjoy. Dava Sobel tirelessly hunted across continents for the letters, and then learned Italian in order to translate them into English. The result is a splendid and insightful collection, revealing the Galileo that history forgot. Instead of the familiar and legendary iconoclastic Church-challenging rebel, we see a pious man who fathered two nuns and spent a great deal of time trying to reconcile his science with his God. This book will sweep you away to a time and place full of conflict and misunderstanding, a place that hasn't existed for four hundred years, but is undeniably very present today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The punchline makes it work!","review":"Yes, this is a biography of Galileo, not his daughter, as many people have pointed out. And yet . . .Because it is a biography of the human being, and not just the scientist, the insights into his life that we get by reading his daughter's letters to him make him vastly more real (and more vulnerable) than he would otherwise be to us.His daughter was an integral, if sometimes distant, part of his life. That's why the surprise ending is both wonderfully appropriate and moving. [And, no, I'm not going to give it away.] Trust me on this: the book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little else to say.","review":"Apparently this is one of those books that either snags or bores the reader. I'm afraid I'm in the camp of those who were disappointed. This narrative is much too lengthy, heavily reminiscent of textbook style, and as many Amazon reviewers have noted, not about the daughter but the father. Medieval history, religion, and folklore are among my very favorite areas of study, but I'm afraid I couldn't finish this particular volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not car for this book","review":"Someone in our Book Club recommended it. I have read over half - making myself read it. I like science and experiments, but it is way too much information for my interest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"faith and love","review":"An easy and totally interesting look at 1600 century religious ideas re science and a wonderful story of familial love between a father and his daughter. Faith and love combined."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rest of the Story","review":"This very well written book is basically a biography of Galileo told largely via letters written by his daughter. Dava Sobel presents the letters along with details of the time period and of Galileo's life.She also provides a balanced view of his battle with the Catholic Church and shows that not all clerics were rabidly opposed to him and that Galileo was not opposed to religion.The Kindle version of this book is very well formatted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful and Moving Account","review":"Sobel creates a wonderful picture of Galileo's life and his relationship with his children, specifically his daughter, Suor Marie Celeste. The letters from SMC to her father are beautifully poetic, even when descrbing mundane events or day to day life. I found that as I read the book I grew to know both Galileo and Suor Marie Celeste infinitely better, and by the end, was saddened almost as if by the loss of a dear friend. It is a rare and powerful work that can move the reader in such a way and create such a captivating world. Cheers to Sobel for an excellent and heartfelt piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only a great man, but a great father, too!","review":"A historical Memoir of science, faith, and love. The book purports to use letters from Galileo's daughter to form the basis of this biography and they are certainly a major part of the book but they are hardly the backbone. Tucked away in a cloister, there is simply no way the daughter could keep up with the intrigue and politics that swirled around this brilliant man except through his letters to her - which, for the most part, are no longer existent. Still, it is a brilliant and vibrant biography because it paints Galileo as a man - often sick, always intense, and forever a dutiful father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating social history","review":"I found this book fascinating. It combined science, astronomy, religion, history, politics, and epidemiology, all in one. It shows the disservice done to one of the greatest minds the world has ever produced and breaks your heart. We are fortunate to have such an able scholar and deft writer as Dava Sobel gather the information and make it coherent. (Also read her \\"Longitude\\".) Only his daughter's letters to him survive. She, or the sisters in her order, must have destroyed his letters to her because of his ex communication, so we only have half of the story. Nevertheless it is a fascinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galileo's Daughter","review":"The use of actual letters written by Galileo's daughter to the famous scientist is an interesting approach for structuring this biography of a fascinating man who made enormous contributions mathematics, physics, and astronomy. The book is easy to read and highly informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant read","review":"I have read several books on Galileo and this one offered a different perspective. There was much more detail on the more mundane aspects of Galileo's existence. This was not a book that would explain Galileo's theories and discoveries, but more detail about the life he was leading when he was making the discoveries. It is a shame that Galileo's side of the conversation was destroyed, but the side presented by is Daughter is intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Galileo's Daughter?","review":"This book was a disappointment. After all of the press, I was anxious to learn more about Suor Maria Celeste, her life and (from her perspective) Galileo. While the letters are beautifully written and offer a limited insight into her life, they are not integrated well into the story. Don't be mistaken, the story here is about Galileo alone and,while fascinating, the read is dull. Those interested in the factual detail of Galileo's amazing life will be satisfied. Those of us that bought the book based on the premise of the title and the misleading reviews will feel shortchanged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't interest me","review":"Somehow, this book just was not as compelling or interesting as Sobel's terriffic \\"Longitude.\\" Probably this is because of the letter format, which is distancing and rather off-putting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"Galileo's Daughter tells the story of the famous scientist and his illegitimate daughter, Sister Maria Celeste. The story is based upon 124 surviving letters to the scientist from the nun. Their correspondence reveals much of their relationship as well as the world in which they lived. Although most of the book is really about Galileo, you find much about Sister Maria Celeste through the many letters woven throughout the narrative. Although I confess to only a passing interest in historical subjects, I found Galileo's Daughter much more fascinating than I had anticipated. The ending, in particular, I found suitably satisfying (you'll need to read the book to appreciate what I mean). If you have the opportunity to read Galileo's Daughter you will also find it to be a pleasurable surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Opinion about Galileo?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Sobel's book. However, many years ago I read another book, the Sleep Walkers, by Arthur Koestler, with a lengthy section on Galileo ... the person and his work. To Koestler, much of the problem Galileo encountered with the Church, and many other scientists of his time, was a result of his antagonistic personality, his egotism, which led him to belittle anyone who disagreed with him. In other words, he wasn't the very pleasant and gentle guy portrayed by Sobel. I have no idea which author is correct, but I notice Sobel did not include Sleep Walkers in her bibliography. In any case it is clear Galileo was very devoted to his daughter, so he clearly had some good qualities in his personal dealings, in fact Sobel makes a strong case that he was quite generous to others. Maybe Koestler was wrong ... don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man of Science and a Man of Faith","review":"Very interesting historical review of how a man tried to satisfy science and still remain faithful to his Church. Many of the events are seen through the eyes of his adoring daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Church-1, Galileo-0","review":"Galileo never married the mother of his 3 children. His daughters were considered unmarriagable because of their illegitimacy, so Galileo installed them into a convent. His eldest daughter had a keen intellect and a great affection for her father, and they corresponded for many years. Unfortunately, Galileo's letters to his daughter were destroyed. The cloistered daughter's letters to her father consisted largely of pleas for goods and money, as the convent was impoverished. Not much of interest there. Galileo's Daughter chronicles the scientist's great discoveries and inventions. He was condemned by the Catholic church for heresy. That's all the book is about (and you already knew that). The rest of it is pretty long and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Trouble","review":"This little time-waster is about as interesting to read as the telephone book. Ms. Sobel's claim that many \\"intelligent\\" women ... entered convents so they could write and have \\"status\\" in society is offensive to the droves of women who served the Church unselfishly for centuries, most of whom lived below the poverty level. This book goes on and on for pages, cramping, straining, to make a point, and comes to no satisfying conclusion. Disappointing, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Treatise on the Nature of the Text","review":"Further proof that nonfiction is not fit for publishing. While I thoroughly enjoyed the author's book _Longitude_, I have little interest in the goings-on of daughters of famous scientists who \\"proved\\" certain \\"theories\\" about the \\"revolutions\\" of the \\"heavenly\\" \\"spheres.\\" There is very little science, and even less faith and love in this tiresome text."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I would have given this book 0 stars but that wasn't an option. This was one of the most boring books I have ever read and the letters from Galileo's daughter did nothing to increase the appeal of the book. There were too many characters and the names became confusing after a while. For any reader with no scientific background, this book is an impossible chore. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this about Galileo's daughter?","review":"I read all the reviews and thought this would be a good read about Galileo's daughter and her life. Ummm...not! It's about Galileo and his fight with the Roman Catholic Church. Oh, and there's some small bits and pieces thrown in about his daughter.I was very disappointed in this book; I was expecting to learn about Suor Maria Celeste (the \\"Daughter\\" of the title), and had to wade through all the well known historical details about Galileo for small glimpses at Maria Celeste's world. The title of this book should have been \\"All About Galileo (And a Little About His Daughter)\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Approach","review":"I enjoyed very much this work by Ms. Sobel and I was very moved by the detail and great respect that she brought to this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly rich","review":"I had absolutely no idea what I would find in this book. Was Galileo's daughter someone who followed in his shoes or otherwise became famous? I did not know. I am just reading books about Renaissance Italy these days and it was laying around our house.It took a while to get what the author was up to, and yes it can be a little dry as one recent reviewer titles her review, but if you stick with it, it is a very rich story that could easily be made into a Oscar-worthy movie. I will not spoil the book by telling you how it ends but the end very much had the feeling of a great movie script unfolding.In this book, you get a modest sized but very functional biography of Galileo, you get a sketchy but again perfectly functional biography of his daughter, both woven around each other, and you get a very good sense of what the society of the time did to both of them.That's really all I want to say but I do very much recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Historical fiction is my preferred genre, and I was excited to read this. However, this is more non-fiction. The development of the story and characters is too slow for me. I gave up after @ 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penguin Targets Female Buyers (Was it TitleVII?)","review":"There is an interesting untold story here ...of fornication and illegitimacy without \\"Inquisition\\" and corrupt and gruelling convent life during the same period Jamestown and the Plymouth Colony were founded. While a good biography of Gallileo this is no story of the father and daughter relationship nor a story of the daughter's life or calling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Concur with \\"Reader from Virginia\\", this is not Sobel's best effort. I'd hazard a guess that her publisher insisted she come out with something (anything) to follow up the buzz from \\"Longitude\\" which came out way back in 1995. Read that if you haven't already as it is wonderful but, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is BORING!","review":"Don't be fooled by all these positive reviews! If sunspots and Galileo's laundry don't interest you, save your money. The title is a total misrepresentation of the novel. It is a straight biography of Galileo and very little more. I read the whole book to get to the so-called surprise ending and wish I had my time back... what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it","review":"I diligently read all of the rave reviews about this book and sadly enough, the first few chapters, which are more historical, were SO Galileo-centric, that I have abandonded the book entirely.While some background of the political and scientific climate were well warranted, the amount of it and lack of his daughter's character during that time was severely disappointing.Maybe some day I will pick it up again, but that is doubtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascenating and inspirational","review":"I adored this book! It has everything I look for- amazing characters, beautiful writing, and marvelous historical discriptions. The added bonus was learning about the birth of moder-day science. This book was an inspiration to me, the awe-inspiring figures of Galileo and his daughter, their touching relationship and the scope of historial influences on their life. I also found the author, Dava Sobel, whom I heard speak last month at the Natural History Museum in NYC, equally inspirational. How wonderful it is to hear someone speak so elequently about their passion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps mistitled","review":"Although this book does mention Galileo's daughter, Maria Celeste quite often, it tells rather less of her life than it does of her more famous father's. Admittedly, the sources for Maria are scarce, but perhaps a slightly different angle could have been found for the book.This single problem aside, this book was rather well written. I enjoyed reading about Galileo's life in the context of the changes in the church, social issues (such as the plague) and so forth. I haven't read much else about Galileo, so this was quite an eye opener. I would not recommend this book as an in-depth look at Maria Celeste, but if you want to learn about Galileo himself, check this book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you right back","review":"This book takes you right back to the dark ages. In fact, while I read this book, I became suspicious about the earth being a sphere myself. A lot of illustrations. A lot of references, without getting tedious. Superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"HISTORY COMES TO LIFE!","review":"Once again we are presented with a story that should be mandatory in every school room. Gailelo's Daughter's not only made for fascinating reading, it brought out the human side of the great man; his familial relationships and his dedication to both church and science. During the Inquisition, I felt not only a reader, but a spectator in the most unjust trial of the church times.Galileo's Daughter is not just a great contribution to the world of history through the reader's eyes, it is a wonderful discussion novel that stays with the reader long after the book is closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sort of book which makes reading a chore","review":"The scale of Ms Sobel's research and the amount of time which she doubtlessly invested in this project fail to prevent the end product from being a surprisingly tiresome and boring book. The title itself is misleading - it is essentially another biography of Galileo - so if you bought it, as I did, hoping for a new slant on the father-daughter relationship, you're in for a disappointment. If you do feel you want to read it, I suggest you visit your local library and save your hard-earned cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father and Daughter","review":"The relationship between Galileo and his daughter is very touching. Galileo's daughter was very faithful to her father even when she didn't feel all that well herself. If you adore healthy relationships between and father and a daughter, read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exceptional Story of a Relationship of a Family","review":"The author has done a masterful job of story telling in this book. You are presented with a wonderful story of the life of one of outstanding persons of the Renaissance and one of the outstanding minds of western intellectual thought. Along the way you alos meet his family and many other people responsible for an important epoch in the history of the western world."},{"rating":"1","title":"jschlick","review":"Quite frankly I'm appalled that this book is available on Amazon for just anyone to buy. I get that this book is supposed to have a \\"WOW\\" factor but its a brutal read of very graphic and disturbing sexual interactions. I don't think this book should be available for just anyone to buy. I really enjoyed other Piers Anthony books that I read in high school. No high school student should read this book it's disturbing as an adult! There was nothing enjoyable about reading this book, which is sad. Do not buy this book.

I got what I paid for.The first performed admirably for about 2 months - I thought I had gotten a great deal. After that, the control started listing to the left during gameplay. Reseting it would solve the problem, for about 5 minutes. With time, the listing got worse and worse until it was really just impossible to play with. I popped open the second controler, hoping it was just a fluke. The second controler started doing the SAME THING after about 2 weeks.These controlers have a manufacurers gaurantee, but you have to ship the thing back to them on your own dime AND send them about $8 to get a replacement shipped back to you - that would end up being more than I paid for one in the first place.These controlers are just no good!

Like....So, they left out all the good songs for the QAF 2nd Season Soundtrack -- Part 2. You know the gimmick. Well, part 2 never came out for the first season. I am sure this soundtrack will grow on me and continue to become one of my favorites next to the first season soundtrack. But I can't help being disappointed at not feeling that tingle of excitement that I get from the short blips of killer tracks while watching the show. I really love the Deborah Cox -- Absolutely Not #2. Rising #5 by Elle Patrice is fierce also. Sorry, Mick Jagger did a better Miss You #9 than Etta James."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Season - Boring","review":"I remember last year at this time I was so looking forward to the US soundtrack - it came, I loved it! Still do. Then the second season of the show started - big disappointment! Something in the show has been lost. I dont rush home to watch it Sunday nights like I used to. And that is my recommendation for the Second Season CD - dont rush out and buy it. Its as big of disappointment as the second season show!!! Save your money - I love the music in the show, but where is it on the 2nd soundtrack? All the tracks are the odds and ends of what they play in background, but none of the good songs that you enjoy listening to during the scenes. I think it was scraped together at the last minute and put to market - just like the second season of the show itself. Hopefully the show can get some better writers for the 3rd season - if they are lucky to have a 3rd season. And for the music selections? Get some real music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to make a great CD","review":"Take one season full of great music (When My Boy Walks Down the Street, Wild Sweet and Cool, Gold in Them Hills, The Man I Love, Poses), ignore it, and instead feature one dreary club remix after the other. Every song sounds the same whether it's The Chemical Brothers, Etta James, or Sarah McLachlan. This CD is so awful it makes me long even for the fluff that filled most of the season one CD. And as for the fabulous songs on the season one CD (Proud, Straight to Number One, and You Think You're a Man), there's nothing on the new CD that even begins to compare. ...It's just tedious.

Unfortunately, they are hard to find in the US so the price is always around $80.

As one of Jehovah's Witnesses (40+ years, five states and 20+ different congregations), I have NEVER been discouraged from reading ANY of Rutherford's publications. In fact, I have most of the original publications in my personal library and have enjoyed them very much! I also take GREAT exception to his statement that Jehovah's Witnesses will take great 'pleasure' in the 'painful(?)' destruction of those not serving Jehovah! Even the Almighty God does not take pleasure in the destruction of the MOST wicked! I am very disturbed that MR. MCROBERTS is the one promoting prejudice and ill will with false propaganda!

It now sits on my desk and I'm again able to listen to Howard all day. The antenna also sits on my desk next to the unit, about 10 feet from the window. The signal is absolutely crystal clear!! Much better reception than what I get in my car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you don't want to wake up.","review":"One of my main reasons for buying this stereo was for the ability to wake up to my ipod. However, it doesn't work half the time. The directions for wake up to the ipod or sirius are abysmal. They tell you how to program the stereo to wake up, but not what to do with your ipod/sirius. I have yet to be able to figure it out which has left me using my ol' phone on through out the night with the volume up. Given my family's penchant for being \\"morning people\\" and their love of communication, this means I wake up about an hour earlier than I would prefer everyday. But that's neither here nor there. Just be aware that if you don't care for the alarm then you'll like the product. Although it is difficult to get my ipod into the cradle.

Once plugged in, my receiver, instead of displaying the name of the program or song I tried to tune in to, read \\"Antenna not detected\\". No antenna ( I tried several) no reception. Full disclosure: My old Soloist, which had worked fine for several years, started to produce the same display. The Stiletto receiver will work outside of the Soloist's cradle so I don't know which is at fault.

We started out with high hopes, but they were quickly dashed. The CG was HORRIBLY cheap, the makeup was almost as bad. My husband and I ended up laughing our butts off by the end of the movie because we turned it into a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 movie, by adding our own lines, singing our own songs, etc. AND honestly the plot is so thin and the acting so questionable, it really appears to be a bad x-rated movie without the dirty parts.Not a good buy if you want to enjoy a movie about Snow White.

But the big problem I had is that you just can't follow the story. It runs about 40 minutes to long and it looses focus going from one meaningless scene to the next. I tried to watch the whole movie three times but just got frustrated and turned it off because there seemed to be no end in sight.

Man, was I disappointed: A clumsy, far-fetched story line, flat characters, a main character that is kind of a Stephanie Plum in uniform, a very uninspired and wooden writing style (how an intense and dangerous meeting between a number of military ships of different nations with a sting operation going down can be written like the minutes of a boring business meeting is beyond me) - and on top a plethora of spelling errors, typos and some such (with \\"interruptor\\" instead of \\"interpreter\\" being the only kind of amusing one).I understand that this is the author's debut (which is why I don't rate the book a one-star).

Being married to a Navy pilot myself, hopefully Faydra will get some orders to the East Coast in the next book. She can surely get herself into something here in Pensacola or Jacksonville as well!

It wasn't obvious to me until I got the book that it was self-published. I still read it with an open mind because of the positive reviews, but it was painful to get through. Although the plot is fun in the abstract, the way the book progresses, the scenes, the dialogue and the descriptions of the locale are banal at best but often awkward.

Thus it was with this reissue, which spans the decade 1939-1949, with 54 tracks providing over two-and-a-half hours of sheer delight. Unlike many female singers, Dinah had no need to strain for the higher reaches, and her voice seems to float effortlessly above the orchestra.

I also held the applicator on for ridiculously long periods, and it never took the wart off. Nobody wants to pay 30 bucks for something that takes two weeks to figure out that it didn't work. I had two other warts in the past, and I'm going back to what does work....COMPOUND W. Its even way cheaper, and takes the same time period.

Upon first use, I felt a slight burning on the wart as I held it for the allotted amount of time required and then it turned white. I bandaged it up and the next day it was slightly smaller but definitely did not make ANY difference within a few days.

To be fair, I did find a handful of useful tips or insight into several areas i was less familiar with, but this accounts for maybe 5% of the book. On the other hand, if you are new to Mac and/or 8.5 this book is excellent and I would give it a 5 star rating. For power users, it gets one star for the few tidbits it offers mac savy users. The included CD, like all book CDs, strikes me as pointless since its almost always out of date by publication time.

This is basically a best of late 60s and early 70s Chicago rare soul. Fans of Chi-Lites would really dig it. Includes bigger names like Jackie Wilson, Gene Chandler and the Chi-Lites. Material ranges from 69-78, and most tracks have stellar horn arrangements, like \\"Suddenly\\" by Tony Drake and some contain Philly-style string parts.

Fox Butterfield tells a compelling story about a China looking at the abyss. He helps you appreciate how amazing China's economic growth has been given where she was in 1980. His insight into the massive disillusionment that was born out of the Cultural Revolution also helps one understand why there are so many \\"quality\\" problems with food and products today.Fox Butterfield has an exceptional eye for the little details that give you a sense of what is important to Chinese people in the 1980s. As you read his book, you not only learn about Chinese history, you also learn about Chinese cultural values. If you want to understand China today, you must read China: Alive in the Bitter Sea. It will move you, it will sadden you and it will teach you. What it won't do is bore you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old, but insightful","review":"Around twenty-three years old, and therefore completely out of date, 'China: Alive in the Bitter Sea' is nevertheless an amazing read and it is invaluable as an historical document.

It's a great book to read in order to understand China's more recent modern history, as it affected those Chinese who make China today."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book on china","review":"Everyone who wants to really understand modern China should read this book. The author captured the political turmoil and tragedy of culture revolution, and the everyday Chinese life with many captivating human stories from all walks of Chinese society.

It is a vast improvement over the middle part of their career, but still lacks the edge they had in the beginning. I could only listen to the album twice before it was put on the shelf forever, never to be played again. Through the Ashes is better than this album ever had the potential to be, but even that was lacking in writing and production. The only way Machinehead will become the metal tyrant like the days of old is to get Logan Mader back on lead and reapply the thrash/hardcore stylings again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I bought the last Machine Head album and I ended up selling it because it just wasn't good.Then the Blackening came out and I heard some of it at my local guitar shop and the guys were saying \\"this is the best CD ever\\". Then I read somewhere that this is \\"The best metal album of all time\\". So naturally I had to get myself a copy.All I can say is this album is NOT the best metal album ever. It's very typical and generic all the way through. There are some shinning moments, but don't run out to buy it, it's not worth the hype.The first song, Halo, and Wolves are pretty good songs. The rest of the album is the definition of mediocrity. Bottom line, there's nothing new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return To Form","review":"Infamous post-thrash metal band Machine Head releases their sixth album, which is titled \\"The Blackening\\", and this is their most epic album to date. If you thought that \\"Through The Ashes of Empires\\" was a return to form, this surpasses it. We have eight tracks here, ranging from 3 minutes to 10 minutes. Tracks like \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\" and \\"Slanderous\\" will remind you of how metal should be played. Even after 13 years since their debut, \\"Burn My Eyes\\", Machine Head has not let up. The guitar parts are amazing, Robb Flynn still remains an excellent vocalist, and Dave McClain's drumming is superb.Overall, this could be a landmark in today's modern metal scene. If you're getting tired of the usual, pop in \\"The Blackening\\", and sit back while you listen to this masterpiece of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What can i say about this album that hasnt already been said, great thrashy riffs, memorable solos, powerful lyrics that bring raw emotion and anger, and awesome drumming. since i bought the cd its all i have been listening to, i mean i could write a damn essay about how much this cd does right and then go that extra step. a must by for not just metal fans but a fan of great music.p.s. was listening to THE BLACKENING while writing the review, yup that awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another return to form -- \\"Nu-metal\\" as it should have been!","review":"Well, that's 2 great albums in a row from this band that had at one time abandoned its greatness in favor of the trendy nu-metal/rapcore sound. Remember Robb Flynn with the spiked hair? And the music to go along with it? Forget it!! It is now well in the past!The Blackening is another return to the groove-laden thrash sound they first put out on Burn My Eyes. Any nu-metal tendencies you might have thought were present on Ashes of Empires are now gone. Pure, down-tuned,groove-thrash! THIS is what nu-metal SHOULD have been.A few years ago they were playing with bands like Saliva and Powerman 5000 (yikes!). I just saw them open up for Trivium and Lamb of God. Redemption, pride, and honor -- all hail Machine Head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the extra $$","review":"Great CD by itself. The addition of the DVD makes it even better. If you bought the original, as I did, when it was first released, don't be discouraged from plunking down the added $ on this. The DVD by itself would be a good deal. The extra songs on the CD make it a no-brainer. This was one of the best metal discs released in 2007. If you don't already own it, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"The whole album does not have one bad song.

Have they even heard that album? I bought BME new, and have all their albums. This is no \\"Burn My Eyes\\", in fact, the last album was way better. If you love the whiny, tempo-killing singing, poorly placed solos, overly long acoustic intros, and the songs about Rob's feelings, which have been the ruin of Machine Head in the last few albums, buy this album. If you were expecting a return to their thrash roots as the Nu-metal fans above suggest, look elsewhere. You will be sorely disappointed as I was. Most overhyped album of the year? Indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The solo are great but...","review":"If you want to hear through the ashes... with great solo guitar you should get this album, but what makes this album get 2 star from me is after the song title \\"now i lay thee down\\" you only get song that sound sooo nu metal, yes i only like the first three song from this album, man this album is dissapointing me"},{"rating":"1","title":"YEah!","review":"Yes, another trend band!

I would go as far as saying this is the album of the year for 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Complete Album Since More Things Change.","review":"Machine Head made a couple mistakes in the past with The Burning Red and Supercharger but they've recovered. However I don't agree with it being their best album to date but it's the best they've done in a decade. After signs of hope on Through The Ashes Of Empires, they've seemed to make their first masterpiece in years and it's even a better album. The Blackening is arguably their croiwning achievement and the Master Of Puppets of the 21st century. It includes their hit single Aesthetics of Hate which shown more potential than on their previous album and it was nominated for The Best Metal Performance Of The Year. The Blackening is similar to The More Things Change with a slightly more modern sound to it. The album's solid throughout and essential for all Machine Head fans or anyone that likes hard rock or metal in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Speakers","review":"Good speakers for the price.

I would definitely recommend this game for anyone intrested in a fun and challenging truth or dare game.(especially for Bratz fans like me!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Thanks Amazon","review":"This is one of my favorite Christmas albums. I've had it in cassette format and was so pleased to see it finally made available in mp3 on Amazon. The Please Come Home for Christmas is one of the best recordings of the classic written by Charles Brown and for years I would play it for visitors to the house this time of year. The Valley I believe refers to the Brownsville/McAllen area of Texas. I like all of the songs on this album and it definitely provides a feeling of being along the border with some of the verses in Spanish. There is a touch of sadness on this album as there is in so many Christmas songs. Thanks Freddy.We miss you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music Was Dead but Its Back Again","review":"Verbena has managed to do something that hasn't happened since grunge self-destructed 5 years ago. They deliver a refreshing blend of soft, pretty songs ( Lovely Isn't Love and Big Skies and Black Rainbows) to hard rocking songs (Depression Is a Fashion and Pretty Please) that is reminiscent to Nirvana, and everything in between. Bondy is an excellent sneering vocalist who is complemented well by Anne Marie's harmonius backing vocals. So, check out this release, I guarantee you won't be disapointed, because it has something that seems to be overlooked in modern music.....its really very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure to improve on their previous album","review":"The hype in alternative circles surrounded this record before its release this past summer. The \\"Next Nirvana\\" and \\"Southern Fried Nirvana\\" labels were being generously tossed around when describing this record. On the strength of the previous record, \\"Souls For Sale\\", this hype seemed perfectly logical. The truth, actually, is that \\"Into the Pink\\" is not even as good as that record.The songs on this record, save for the excellent voice and piano opener \\"Lovely Isn't Love\\", are unremarkable and seemingly half-finished. The performances seem half-hearted as well, as if the band recorded this album in a haze of alcohol and narcotics, which is entirely possible. Dave Grohl's production, like on his own records, is pedestrian, not helping the cause at all.So, check out \\"Souls\\", avoid this record and hope the next record marks a return to previous form."},{"rating":"1","title":"junkie rock?","review":"I sometimes forget how important humor is in making good music, until I hit a record that is pretty much devoid of it. The musics OK but the band (especially the guy) takes itself way too seriously and thats a big turnoff. The band doesn't really live up to its indie hype because they fail to be anythiing but derivative (the singer can't decide if he wants to sound like Nirvana or Radiohead - as opposed to just developing his own style)... plus listening to heroin glorification makes me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this, get \\"Souls for Sale\\"","review":"I picked up this album after listening to the incredible \\"Souls for Sale album\\" I couldn't be more dissapointed. It's almost shocking to hear how bad this album is after listening to Souls for Sale. The great boy/girl harmony, guitar driven rock is gone.Instead it's all synth and studio editing. This album is over-produced and under-performed. At times it sounds as slick as a Garbage album. This isn't what I expected from Verbena. Sometimes the unexpected is good, but this time it's an unwelcome departure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album pushed back by capital","review":"This album is what nevermind was in the early 90's. It has a nice blend of soft tracks to the more harder ones. The lyrics actually have meaning unlike all of the bands today.Capital should have promoted it more and not have just thrown it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion is perhaps too much influenced","review":"by having had to read this book at the age of 14 for a college class I didn't actually want to be taking.Technically, I suppose the writing is excellent. I still remember scenes from the book, and I'm 58 now. The characters were, mostly, realistic - but some of the scenes I remember make it look to me like the man didn't actually have much use for sex.And I have known more than enough gay men and lesbians - and several transpeople, for what little that may be worth - to know that pedophilia is a base canard. But the notion that gays and lesbians are routinely attracted to children was used in this book.Only one of the characters seemed to be a consistently nice person, which is not particularly realistic considering the number of major and secondary characters there are - two or three would have been much more believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Quality","review":"A total pleasure to use---no struggle flipping.

Eric's vocals are raspy and rockin', Mark's lead guitar work is awesome and Glenn really pounds the skins. Their style is unique. Party hard rock'n'roll!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh lordy, where to start...","review":"Imagine Kiss with about a tenth of the talent and zero passion. Got it? Then you know what the Godz sound like. This music is very pedestrian. The reviewer who referred to one of these guitarists as \\"the most underrated\\" of his time has obviously never picked up a guitar. There are very few solos on this record and none of them are impressive. The chord structures range from three-chord stomp to simple boogie patterns. The singer does manage to deliver the songs with a bit of attitude, which is the only thing that makes this collection even the least bit listenable. The Godz may have been a respectable live band in their day, but this group of studio recordings is overrated by the reviewers here. I found this record in the used bin, and it's one that I wish had been scratched so I could have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"It's like a car accident. Shocking and disturbing, yet you can't take your eyes off of it. The Godz are (were) the dregs of rock and roll. I found their self titled album on cassette a few years ago, remembering the name from a Pikeville, KY radio show. It is without a doubt the worst rock and roll album ever recorded and released by a major label. If you're really that curious, check it out. You will be dissapointed! I don't mean to offend anyone, as I'm sure they have a devout following in their native Ohio, but if you're looking for obscure rock music, spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This video is well put together and it lets u understand qigong from a western view i would highly recommend it to any one"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're even thinking about getting this, go ahead and buy it.","review":"I've had a decent amount of teaching in qigong through my 15 years of martial arts training.

He makes everything clear and easy to understand so anyone, even without any prior knowledge, could understand what qigong is and how it works using examples that anyone can relate to, like electricity powering a fan. It is long. 2 courses each 2 hours long. And with my knowledge I did get a little anxious for him to wrap up by the time it was over. (I haven't been in a classroom in 10 years, what do you expect?) But I was surprised at how much I got from \\"what is qigong\\" Everything Dr Yang puts out is top quality and leaves nothing to be desired.

Dr. Yang has so much knowledge it is quite amazing.When I started reading his books about 12 years ago I found him a little hard to get into. After watching 7 or 8 DVDs I find him kind of charming, in other words, he grows on you. After watching so much of his stuff, I feel like I actually know him as one of my teachers, even though I have never met him. All of his DVDs are like attending a personal workshop/seminar, and you can watch them over and over!The truth is, he knows this stuff inside and out, from scientific to spiritual.

I will not tell anyone, Jew or non-Jew to read or not to read anything. What I will advise is to consider more than one perspective on the Jew vs. Jesus question. If you want to strengthen your \\"Jesus was not the Messiah\\" viewpoint or your \\"Jesus was only a prophet\\" viewpoint, their is plenty of one-sided reading material out there to support it. I would, however, for the sake of your eternal salvation recommend you read at least three books before securing your viewpoint: 1) The entire New Testament (focusing on the fulfillment of Old Testament Prophecies), 2) Lee Strobel's \\"The Case for Christ,\\" and 3) Lee Strobel's \\"The Case for Faith.

If you want to immunize yourselves and your children, you need to have intellectually honest and rigorous answers. This book really helps you do that.There is another book that I'd read alongside this volume to be more thorough and address more of the tactics currently used by missionaries.

Kaplan's work is exactly what you would expect from an Orthodox rabbi and is exactly what R. Kaplan intended for his obvious goal...to educate the unobservant Jew who has already made up his mind on the issue in the Orthodox perspective on Jesus. Second, I only gave it 2 stars because it's far from his best work (which I would contend is on Kabbalism) but I guess it suits his goals. In all seriousness, this book really isn't going to convince anyone who is neutral on the issue either way but if your interested in the issue it's a decent place to start from.Just be warned...everyone is biased...Christian, Jew, Muslim, athiest, agnositic...and you only really learn about any issue be it scientific, political, or religious from hearing both sides....which leads to so much more productive and respectful dialogue than what I'm seeing with most of these reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the Last Post","review":"To whom this may concern,I read the last comments about this book, \\"The Real Messiah.\\" I was interested in the book until the last guy spoke of a part in which the writer explains that Jesus incited his followers to kill his enemies. After that, this lost all credibility with me. Read the entire chapter of Luke 19:27 and you will see that Jesus was speaking in parable. Now, I'm not a bible thumber, but I did read the entire chapter to make certain that it wasn't taken out of context and to confirm my suspicions, it was. I'll probably still read the book, though, because it will, no doubt, be a fun read, and maybe I'll learn something. If you want to read a better source on the reality of Christ as the True Messiah, pick up \\"Jesus the Christ\\" by James Talmage.

I have thin fine medium to long length hair. The only plus to these is they don't damage your hair. They do curl my hair and stay in with no products for about 6 hrs but I don't like the way it curls. To make my hair stay on the roller I have to wrap it tighter which means the different size rollers become pointless. And I'm looking for volume not all over curl(which is what it gave me). Also if left on the steamer to long it will cause my hair to go frizzy. And I have 4 little kids and trying to make sure I time all the rollers while dealing with kids in the morning is distracting. My last complaint is the roller clips if you can call them that. I fight about half of them to stay in and they cause a line where they are put in at. So all in all I'm not a fan.

I have long, fine-length hair and I've never found a set of rollers that work...including these. They absolutely did NOT hold the curl all day. In addition, I found them difficult to roll as the centers are spongy; some were tighter than others regardless of how hard I tried to get them to be the same.

I bought another caruso setter just over a year ago and it burned out and was almost shocked.I did use it with salt and tried it without and the curls did not last. I just had to buy two more setters as they also come with multiple size rollers and I don't use the jumbo at all.

Lately my hair has been so dry and hasn't held a curl, so I tried these again. They are great! My curls have lasted and lasted. I love the variety of roller sizes for different looks.My only complaint is the slant of the top. It's difficult to balance the clip on top. I know the last time I had the curlers, I got in a pretty quick rhythm with rolling them and heating the clips. I am sure I will get it to work better with more tries, but so far I have had a lot of falling clips and have burned myself on the steam (nothing serious-- just slightly painful).

The only other model I could find got bad reviews, too.Unfortunately, in spite of the fact that I only used this hairsetter an average of 3 or 4 times a month, it crapped out in only 9 months! If I had used it every day, it wouldn't have lasted much more than a month!What's worse is that it apparently has NO WARRANTY!!!I must say that I am shocked that people are rating this product with 4 or 5 stars, while admitting they need to replace it often.

There is only one major problem. After owning 5 of these products in the past 8 years, I am getting ready to purchase another one. (You would think that I would learn by now, but it's the only thing that keeps my hair curly.) These hairsetters quit working for no apparent reason. You are guaranteed about 6-10 uses before it craps out on you.This last one, which was the expensive $55 ionic set was used 4 times before it stopped. I would like to hear from someone who knows what the problem is with these hairsetters. First I thought it was the tap water I was using, so I tried using spring water. Another thought I had with my last hairsetter, was that I turned off the unit after use, but forgot to drain the water from inside the container. I believe there is another company that makes steam hairsetters.

I was sad. Other hot rollers were heavy, fell out, left marks and fried my hair. So I bought this one. It is working, but no matter what level the water is at it sputters water out the top along with steam and at times gets the rollers too wet. I still use it, but I suspect the quality is not the same and don't know if it will last. Tips: Besides using purified water I also recommend buying some cheap small aligator clips from the dollar store to hold them on instead of the ones they give you.

When I plugged it in to use it the fourth time it made all the same noises, but no longer spit out any steam at all. I read and followed the directions exactly and I used ONLY distilled water.

The steam infuses my hair with moisture which eliminates the frizzies leaving the curls smooth and with a lot of shine...it's amazing. The curls last until I wash them out, but I think that's just because my hair holds a curl anyway (I can make curls with my fingers and a blow dryer that last for days...) Anyway, some people complain the caruso-steam curls don't last so if your hair doesn't hold a curl, anyway, these might or might not work for you.

BUT, worst of all, even with the smaller sizes, my curls didn't even last ONE HOUR!After reading the reviews, I picked this one, figuring the folks who liked it were probably right and the ones who complained just didn't know how to use the steam setter. Well, the complainers were right. It's going back in the morning.I had such high hopes for this to help me look so special for my son's wedding in about a week and a half. At this rate, the curls wouldn't have lasted through the pre-wedding pictures and would have been gone before the guests arrived. Here's another incident of something not being made as well now as they used to make it.Save your money and buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"These rollers are horrible. They dont hold a curl at all. I have tried every way imaginable - longer on the steamer, shorter on the steamer, longer in my hair, with a hair dryer, with gel, with mousse, with nothing, all different sized rollers.....and the result is the same - ugly, ugly, ugly. The curls are not uniform and they do not stay in my hair. Some of the rollers do not regain shape. They are just plain bad. Other reviewers are correct, the salt systems held my hair much better. I'm going back to my hot rollers - these rollers can go in the garbage. I really wish I would have listened to the other reviewers :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for damaged hair","review":"My hair was so fried that I ended up taking off 12 inches to get rid of the damage and bad layers that resulted. My shorter hair needed something to style it, and a former hair stylist suggested steam rollers. I love these. They aren't perfect compared to hot rollers, and they aren't as fast as a curling iron, but my hair feels so soft afterwards and the curl is nice. Hint: The hair is slightly moist from the steam after taking the curlers out. After they're out, I spray hairspray lightly then wait a few minutes for my hair to dry (usually putting on makeup). Once it's dry, I finger-comb it, and the curls last the whole day (and the next if I don't wash it). If I comb it out immediately after taking the rollers out, the curl is lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hot Steam Curlers!!!!","review":"I highly recommend these steam curlers by Caruso. They heat up super fast and really hold a curl well. I haven't travelled with them yet, but I know they will travel well. The unit is small and compact.

I bought the first set they had with the salt. Yes, I was shocked once by the old ones one time. Not a pleasant feeling. I purchased the saltless system about 10 years ago. It's nice not having to add the salt. I have used these on every kind of hair. In fact I just used them on my niece who has the worst hair. She's 12 and was so embarrassed by her hair she kept it in a bun on top of her head. Well, I used my rollers to style her hair for my sisters wedding and she begged me for my roller set. Her hair never looked better. Everyone that saw her wanted to know how she \\"fixed\\" her hair. Needless to say I just ordered her a set of her own. I've now bought 5 sets.

I told myself that perhaps I had made a mistake still gung ho about providing volume and curl to my somewhat lifeless do. I tryed again...sort of, I tryed to try again but the steamer refused to produce steam, once again I attributed it to user error and waited a bit for an additional attmpt. The last and final trial was equal unsuccsesful. My golden locks shall never be graced with lushious curls, I suppose.

I had to call Helen of Troy and return the unit and hopefully they will send a new one plus the 7.00 I paid to ship the junk back to them. I can only say it is a hassle and HOPEFULLY the replacement works. Really a sad thing to make such junk.

Other rollers leave my hair limp after a couple hours, but the steam rollers give my hair lots of volume which lasts for a couple of days. The best part is that these curl without all the heat. No more burnt ears or neck! Easy to use and set up. The steamer itself requires so much less space than my old hot rollers which took up half my vanity. Great for travel too - just take the steamer and a few of the rollers.Tip - I had a dash of perfume to the water for the steamer which makes my house and my hair smell wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific results - poor quality item","review":"I'd give the caruso five stars...if my unit didn't die every six months!

I used it almost every day.This is my fourth unit and I am looking into other brands. I have zero luck with regular electric rollers - my hair is super fine and long, and nothing else works!

My hair looks mamed and barely even curled (if thats what you want to call what it did actually do). I spent a good hour reading up on the instructions, applying, and letting it set and now my hair is ruined and I have no time to re-do it with something that actually works. DO NOT ORDER THESE.

After blow dry my hair i used this rollers the result was hell... It gives me a tight curl but my hair was dry,twinkled. The steam makes your hair raw, dry. It's like putting a water on ur hair. Do not expect compliment or anything. worry about your hair. It was like abusing my hair. The next day or after a few hour try to brush ur hair, it is really difficult. The idea of steam doesn't give the desired result. Even though i get tight curl, It was really wired curl it makes my hair away short and frizzy. You don't want that.

I must be doing something very wrong here since there are some really great reviews. My curls just dont stay in! I've had an Avon hot roller system (dont really remember details) and it actually curled my hair much better than this Caruso kit. I think the moisture from the steam makes my curls flop. No matter how long I leave the rollers in, (half a day or maybe just 15 minutes), I get no lasting curls. The sponges also wear out pretty quickly. I've probably only used them two or three times and the sponges look like they already need replacing. My hair is very fine... so probably hot curlers would work better.

Stores didn't seem to carry anything but hot rollers, so I was pleased to find some on Amazon.They are disappointingly flimsy and hard to use. They come with a lot of rollers, of different sizes, but it doesn't make much difference. I have to wrap my hair around them very tightly to even get them to hold long enough to put on the clip. Maybe there's a technique I don't know about, but I've used them several times and haven't found it any easier. If I manage to do it, I still like the way the steam works with my curly, dry hair.

It's so easy I would use these every morning. Now that I am older, I use them when I want my hair to look good. Best just to put some shape/body into my hair.The downside: these things get clogged after a year or two of use and I can't figure out how to fix that. They one day just stop producing steam. I just decided to buy my third set, but I'm still really glad that I did. Sure it may cost you $40 or so every time you buy it, but when used over a couple years, that's not even as much as you would spend on hair products in couple months, let alone haircuts, treatments, etc.For the job it does, it's well worth it to keep buying this product after it wears out."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"this is my third set of rollers from caruso. bought first one almost 20 yrs. ago when it was first invented. love it doesn't damage hair, works fast. curls last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without","review":"Love this product can't live without.

The authors sounded like they had nothing better to do with their time & have no inclination to make the experience more interesting by observing what was around them. Though I've been to several of the places described in these books & had a great time.Too bad, because Australia is a great country to travel around on a reasonable budget, and the people I've met here in hostels tell some great stories.

It's one of these self consciously humorous books which strains after a while. The journey is somewhat joyless with the author complaining about its monotony and making jibes about everywhere he visits. Many pages are devoted to discussing their record collection (as it's played in the car) and very random thoughts which the author noted on his tape recorder.

In my mind the Japanese quartz movement wins out over the inexpensive automatic movement in the Seiko for accuracy. The nearest competitor might be an Orient automatic diver (Orient is a Japanese watch company partly owned by Seiko).St. Moritz started out making Momentum watches specifically for the diver market. They are very popular among people in the industry, and the watches are also very stylish out of the water. They don't simply copy established watch designs. The watch has a very nice weight, a solid link bracelet and a smoothly operating bezel with a screw down crown. The overall size is closer to a Rolex than a large Seiko diver, which I think looks better on the arm. At this price point, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not send me what I ordered, lied, then cancelled order.","review":"Watch out for this guy.

I am fully aware the Momo shifter are more money, but this is not what MY customer wanted.

Then this guy cancelled the second shfter after waiting another several days. Ultimately, my customer liked the Momo design but was upset that I did not have both shifters as promised.

Two of the best articles were on how leaders really spend their time during the day and how leaders foster an environment in which other people can also be identified and brought forward as leaders.I would've rated this five stars, but there are a couple of articles (on 'defining moments' and CEOs) that weren't a complete waste of time but seemed too far divorced from the typical leader within a company that I was surprised the HBR didn't find something more likely to be widely applicable to fill the space."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was required for part of a course I had for my Master's Degree.","review":"I really just used very little of this book for part of a course I took during my Master's Degree... it's kind of OK, but I did not really like it very much.I did, however, keep it - for whatever that is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective - perhaps..","review":"I bought one of these televisions from 6th Avenue Electronics (which will NOT accept returns for LCD TVs or plasmas, so be careful when purchasing from there) for hi-def gaming on my XBox 360.

It repels water better than the last cover I had. It is really nice that it comes with all the straps, which my last cover didn't. Only complaint I have is that the elastic pull-strings on the front don't seem to do anything. It's almost as if they're not connected or don't continue all the way around the rear of the cover. I can pull on the strings to tighten them up until I'm blue in the face and it only tightens around the front part, the back is still loose. I don't get it!?

He picked up an unwanted reputation as a shootist when all he wants to do is punch cattle like before. Here, he can't do it even after he returns to his hometown. Even worse, there's a new sheriff in Somos Santos, TX who's band of deputies are cheap thugs with badges. All the sheriff cares about is bringing the town to heel and turning it into a profitable den of vice. Cray finds himself unable to live down his reputation in these circumstances, plus he's dealing with his feelings for two women, and there's the problem with the aptly nicknamed gunman \\"Mad\\" Albert Roach being summoned to town.

The bootleg had some good songs like \\"Big Dog\\", \\"Touch Down & Cause Hell\\" & \\"They Be On A Nigga\\". It being released early made Boosie have to go back to the studio and basically record a new album. I'm going to assume this album was supposed to be a double cd.(He says in the 1st song on the album that this is the sickest double disc since 2Pac) But its only a single disc. The second CD could have been a version of his previous Bad Azz disc. I have this but its a bootleg and very poor quality. So I wish I could have had a good copy of the songs.

Problem is it's not very funny, well-acted, or even mildly engaging. It's flat out boring. It is not a female \\"The Full Monty,\\" as the ad campaign leads you to think. If that were the case I would have loved it. Others can re-tell the plot, but there isn't really much beyond these ordinary women in a small English town do a nude calendar to raise money and all the hinjinx prevail. Except there really are no hijinx. Just the usual stereotypical disapproving neighbors and officials, combined with the always surprising support from the most unlikely (wink-wink) circles. Been there--seen that over and over. It's as if every cliche in these types of movies were rehashed over and over.Save your money.

Don't know why she picked a leather couch (I must have dozed off or took an extended bathroom break).Anyway, simple enough plot, but for God's sake it took forever to go through the basic formula of jealousy, joy, loss, etc. Who didn't see the wife's husband cheating on her? I mean c'mon. She was definitely no milf. It was easy to see why he didn't want some of that.Anyway, if you are a husband, boyfriend, uncle, grandparent, or any other male species.

A subplot in the movie is how the friendship of the two main characters is tested by their newfound celebrity.Based on actual events, this British movie with its wonderful rhythm-and-blues sound track is entertaining from the first minute to the last.

It was also a very quick read. Parts of the story, including a major plot feature (I won't spoil it) felt very tacked on (and as it turns out, that feature was tacked on, according to the author's notes at the end).

You never quite know what you are going to get until you take the plunge. Well, the title certainly hints, but doesn't adequately describe what is going on. I really am no prude, honest, but even I found some of the writing a little over the top. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't presented in such a form as to goad offence. It is nonsense. Saying the words, postulating the situations for childish delight. Sorry, Mr Anthony, but this one is hard to swallow. No pun intended.

Especially for we who grew up in the '40s and '50s and later became air force pilots. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, a bond drive aircraft arrived at our local airport. It was an O-47 observation plane, with a real machine gun in the rear hatch. What a thrill for a 10 year old. Of course as I grew older, I realized that the old O-47 was a pretty sorry example of America's might, but things were really different in the early 40's. However, it was very gratifying to see an article in this book about flying that aircraft in those early years. There are thousands of accounts of WW2 flying out there, almost all devoted to the outstanding aircraft of those times. This book, however has many an article devoted to how it was to fly the other unsung aircraft. There are not too many pilot accounts of flying the P-39, the P-40 in Italy, the C-54 in ATC service much less the B-18, B-10 and the old C-46.

Gene Tierney is very likable as the sweet, victorian Lucy Muir, who has an independent streak that can't be squealched. Rex Harrison is sharp and funny as the ghost of Captain Gregg, the previous owner of Lucy's new house. The two eventually become friends. And when Lucy loses all her money Captain Gregg helps her to write a book to earn enough money to pay the rent. Romantic feelings develope between the two, though they both know that any future together is impossible. Lucy tries to find love in the mortal world. That's where glib, bad boy George Sanders comes in, playing one of his most irresistibly rakish roles. A very entertaining film. You can't go wrong with this one.Jennifer K.

(tip for parents: this movie puts kids to sleep) I've seen it lots of times and if you are into old black and white movies, give this one a try! It's about a widow who moves into a haunted house and falls in love with a ghost. It's mildly eerie but not really scary. It is visually stunning for a movie of that era, the clothing is amazing and the acting seems very real. It has a beautiful, heart-felt ending which makes you think. This movie is truly one of a kind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so good they made a tv series out of it.","review":"I didn't give this a 5 star because I didn't like the ending, which spoiled the whimsical quality of the film. You can't beat the combination of Terney and Rex Harrison playing the ghost, of the ghost writer of his life, and prim Mrs Muir going to the publisher with a book that we never hear, except left with the impression that Mrs. Muir and the book do not go together. In a subplot, George Sanders plays a writer who is philanderer, yet writes children's books. Tierney briefly falls in love with Sanders, only only to find out from his wife, that she is one of many. Since the film ends in Tierney's gradual descent into old age, and death, that is a bummer. Death and dying belong in many films, but its too serious to be in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful classic","review":"I've always been a fan of this movie- I even remember the television series, although it really was from a much later era.

Just an enjoyable love story between a ghost and a human."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY DONE","review":"Gene Tierney is wonderful as the beautiful widow Lucy Muir and Rex Harrison is great as the manly ghost of Captain Gregg. Although she's warned by the real estate salesman the it's haunted, Mrs. Muir finds Gull cottage on the English coast perfectly suitable for her and her little girl to live in. In no time at all the rumors hold true, but Lucy doesn't scare easily and she and the ghost agree to share the cottage in harmony. When Ms. Muir needs money to make ends meet, she is encourged by Gregg to write his life story while he dictates! The lusty novel is indeed published but Lucy falls for a writer of children's stories (he turns out to be a cad who's married unbeknown to her) Beautiful photography and leisurely pacing give the film part of it's charm, but it is the chemistry between Tierney and Harrison that makes the movie linger in the memory; the final scene is an ethereal \\"happy\\" tearjerker, so keep a box of \\"scotties\\" handy!

Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison do an outstanding job in this film. She is a widow with a young child who finds a place to live to get away from her inlaws. It is a quaint cottage at the sea, haunted by Captain Blowhard. I called him that because he is mouthy, a rather \\"spirited\\" personality. Actually, the sea captain is a ghost who died unexpectedly and doesn't want anybody in HIS house. Well, the widow cannot afford to leave, so they find a way to respect each other and get along.It is such an enchanting story of dreams, while you watch the young child grow up and get married and while you follow the widow and her housekeeper through her trials and tribulations. A beautiful love story and truly a classic--well acted with a superb story line.After you finish watching it, you just wanna sit back in the chair and go \\"a-h-h-h-h\\" (deep sigh)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie to add to your collection of classics","review":"Great movie.

Gene Tierney's elegant Mrs. Muir combined with Rex Harrison's gruff, worldly Captain Greg made this film sizzle. Hollywood rarely has gotten it right since. No touching, no graphic sex, yet the viewer is captivated from the first moment. We believe that they are destined to be together from that moment, but somehow we don't grieve for their earthly separation.

Having seen it many times, I never tire of the love, the romance and the genuine humor that exists between the characters of Mrs. Muir and the sea captain.(Played, respectively, by Gene Tierney - radiantly beautiful, and Rex Harrison, handsome and blustery) Gene Tierney is truly the embodiment of a beautiful woman who doesn't need to be half dressed or undressed in order to show it - and the captain, though claiming to be an old salt, treats her with the love and respect a true lady deserves.

The most amazing thing about this album is the inclusion of the BBC Concert Orchestra, as well as the diverse selection of material - from PSB's early hits (e.g. West End Girls) to their recent successful Fudamental album (Luna Park, Casanova in hell and Indefinite leave to remain), and also including 'Friendly Fire' (from their efforts at writing a musical) and 'After All' from their soundtrack to Battleship Potemkin; this album is a must-have for fans old and new of the famous duo. The featured guest artists are Rufus Wainright, Frances Barber and Robbie Williams, who also add a touch of class to the evening. I hope that this concert will be released on DVD soon, it would make for great repeated viewing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my least favourite since '91","review":"This has very little dazzling guitar work from RT. His publicist certainly wanted to make his money by proclaiming: \\"Best work yet\\"! \\"RT is back and better than ever\\"! I hear none of that in this cd. This is the type of RT cd if you are trying to get your girlfriend to appreciate him and she has been turned off by all the guitar oriented dark melancholy songs of his - give this one a try. It reminds me of the RT cd you would put on in the background while chatting w/ others. if I want an epic guitar workout or storytelling-like songwriting I never put this one on for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Richard's best","review":"Been a huge RT fan for decades with all of his solo work, Fairport etc. This is way below average with perhaps 1 excellent cut, 2-3 decent and the rest below average.

R.T.'s guitar genious is not dependant on electronic gagetry, so there is no let down when he unplugs. As always, the songs are the true stars. Melodically and lyrically, Mr. Thompson delivers tasteful tunes. Let It Blow, My Soul, My Soul,and Mutton Street hit the mark immediately, and with further listening, the mix of soft, even morose material typical of an R.T. \\"album\\", make this a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry to say--boring","review":"I have LOVED Richard Thompson for years! But, I have to say, this is not a very interesting CD. Nothing comes close to the genius of \\"Vincent 1952\\" and many other previous songs.

I'll keep playing RT's earlier CDs and await his next one with hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than his best.....","review":"I forgave his previous cd (1000 Years of Popular Music)but this is a disappointment. I was hoping this was a case \\"of the more I listened,the better it would get\\" but that was not to be. It drags along without a single memorable cut to its credit.I've appreciated his guitar work for years but have grown to expect much more that this cd offers. It is not reflective of the Richard Thompson I revere.

They are in their 70's so it wasn't like the machine was getting a workout. :(The treadmill was only 4 years 7 months old when it broke and I spent hours looking for a tech in the area to get it fixed. I finally called the company and they gave me two numbers to call; one in Dallas (9 hours away and another to a Tech that apparently had never heard of this brand). The second Tech did go out to look at the treadmill ($105 charge) and told me it was going to be ANOTHER $420 (including parts) to fix. I definitely would not recommend this product or the company that sold it to me based on my experience with them. I did call the company and they offered to deduct $45 off the part (NO THANKS.)

This book serves as a primer as well as a source for recipes. The book contains a great deal of extra information on ingredients, basic tips, decorating, and much more. So you are getting more than just recipes. The recipes that the book does contain are varied. She has many different categories of cakes; Butter, fruit, custard, breakfast, sponge, showcase, low cholesterol and low saturated fat, without flour, cakes to make ahead of time, cakes that need to decorating.All in all a great book. There are a few color pictures in the begining of the book. There are many illustrations throughout the book that cover the recipes or a particular decorating technique. Once again if you are looking for something more than your average cookbook this one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The recipes don't work.","review":"As an experienced baker, I found The Cake Bible very disappointing. The recipes just don't work. The cakes come out very dry, or not cooked enough in the middle, etc. The author gives very explicit instructions for each recipe, and I followed them all to the letter. My oven temperature is perfect. And after all that work, you come out with a cake that just isn't good. There are plenty of other books out there that are so much better (anything by Nick Malgieri or Carole Walter, for instance) yet The Cake Bible is always considered THE BOOK. Forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cake Bible","review":"I never received the book. I waited and waited and finally called the company that I was purchasing it from and got a refund.

I think a couple of the white cakes are decent, a little dry though. I've been cooking for several years, and have been using a scale to reduce mistakes in measurement. It was nice to finally have a cookbook with weight measurements, however, she needs to come up with some new ideas and recipes. Her plain buttercream turned out to what I and friends called the famous \\"Egg Jelly\\", the smell still haunts me to this day. I think it called for 6 egg yolks, 1 cup Corn Syrup, 2 lbs butter- something to that effect, IT WAS HORRIBLE. Needless to say, I made my own frosting which was much more pleasant to taste not to mention look at or SMELL! Buy the book if you are in need of some paper for your fireplace, or your trashcan, cause it's pure garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even for Beginners!","review":"I am not an experienced baker, and really, the most I do is bake boxed brownies and choc. chip cookies. I bought the book because a friend of mine baked a cake I loved and it was a recipe from this particular book. The book is big, extensive and very detailed. There is a whole section dedicated to ingredients. She very well explains what each ingredient is and the reason for adding that ingredient to a particular recipe. There is also a section about the kinds of utensils you should have: cake molds, mixers, spatulas, etc. The recipes themselves are very detailed and easy to follow, but the only part I still get confused is the table she includes at the beginning of the recipes where she measures even the eggs (in grams, etc.) This is not usual for me since I am used to grab a large egg if the recipe calls for an egg, I don't weigh the egg at all. But overall, this book is great and the more you learn about cooking and baking, the more useful it will become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Dry Dry","review":"I have used this book since it came out. Every time the result has been a very, very dry cake. At first I thought it was me. But after all these years I doubt it.

The ingredients were also exact- Dutch cocoa was used in those recipes that called for it. I was most disappointed in the results. After using so much unsalted butter in the cakes (as the recipe calls for) they were quite dry. No one in my household would eat them; I ended up throwing three cakes away. After using such high quality ingredients-why would Duncan Hines be better? Perhaps the author has no feeling for chocolate cake. D. Erickson"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Pass!","review":"I had been baking for some time when I bought this book. The cakes I made came out dry, although I was careful when following directions. The real disaster was the buttercream which a) used a ridiculous amount of butter, and b) iced my cake, the plate and then the countertop! It just did not set up at all. I think I'll find another source for cakemaking - like Kaufeehaus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Also had a chocolate cake from this recipe BOMB.","review":"I had the same experience as the reader from California who made some awful chocolate cakes from this book. I too could not believe it when I followed the instructions to a T, using expensive Dutch process cocoa and *tons* of butter, and wound up with a heavy, dry cake! On one occasion, my son's birthday, I rushed to the store and bought a Pillsbury cake mix on sale for $.79. Whipped it up, added canned frosting...and got tons of compliments on it.Still, I'm willing to give this book another shot...it must have some redeeming recipes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt...the 'BEST' !!!","review":"As an avid baker, especially cake making, this book is truely the \\"Bible for Cakes.\\" I have numerous baking and cake books, but this is the one I always use.What makes this book so useful, is the way the directions are set up, the concise writing, the helpful hints, and the teaching. The author's ability to teach through her writing style is invaluable.For beginners and professionals, this book has it all. I especially like and use the chapter on baking the extra large layers. For wedding cakes this is IT !! I have had the pleasure of hearing someone eating a wedding cake I made, say \\"...My God, this is a real cake.\\" What a complement !!!Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this book is the author's sense of humor. I enjoy reading this book for the shear fun of it; no other cookbook that I've ever read, have I had the pleasure of laughing aloud.What a GREAT book this is !!!

It also offers complete recipes and instructions for cake/filling/frosting/decorating the way Rose Levy Berenbaum has made them professionally. I have permanent page markers for the pan measurement/volume chart, the baking powder vs. pan volume chart, and similarly useful pages. Full color pictures of finished cakes are amazing! (other illustrations are few) The index is thorough.

You absolutely cannot substitute under any circumstance, so if you don't want to use flour that is full of chemicals like \\"BLEACHED\\" flour and you substitute it for a more natural unbleached then you will fail...whats odd is that I have tried other recipes which I could substitute for and work just fine. I know she explains the science about it all... but other recipes seem to be more forgiving/flexible and still taste great using half the time to make.

Then I found several very good food blogs(Annie's Eats, Pioneer Woman, Brown Eyed Baker and Smitten Kitchen) and began using their recipes. Success!!! I even started getting requests for my baked goods. With my confidence in full swing I thought I would give her next book a try...Rose's Heavenly Cakes. The cakes did sound heavenly....banana, coconut, red velvet! I've tried 3 recipes with the same results....dry, disappointing and unimpressive.

While some things may change, isn't it a joy that some of the very best things remain the same? The time-honoured, welcome scent of a cake baking away in the oven, which greeted my family as they returned home from work and school, is surely one of these. Thanks to the Cake Bible, even the simplest cake recipes not only smell but also taste exceptionally good. I have been baking for years, yet this classic reference book has provided me lots of insight. Most informative are Mrs. Beranbaum's notes labled \\"understanding\\" which explain the chemistry and mechanics behind the art of baking.

Horribly dry, buttercreams tasted like whipped butter. No matter what liquers you added they still tasted horribly bland. The PERFECT ALL AMERICAN CHOCOLATE CAKE was any but perfect.

I've made two wedding cakes from it with no special skills or experience besides my iron determination. Beranbaum's idea of sweets, however, is sometimes more \\"sophisticated\\" than what people are used to. For example, I made the flourless chocolate cake for a family gathering. It was seriously awesome (my grandma and I gorged on it until we could eat no more) but it remained largely untouched by the rest of my family, whose idea of awesome cake is the sheet cake covered in crisco roses that you get at the grocery store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered new-received used","review":"Ordered new-received box with shiping tape on it as if some 6 year old kid had taped it.

Unless yousee the original mono release. The Pickwick was obviously derived from the fakestereo release which is unbelievably bad. The sound on this CD reflects the originalmono release, thank goodness."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the confusion continues","review":"I appreciated the only review available on this book since the negative aspect is the very reason I am still searching for a good conversational Irish program/book.

Julius describes his experiences of love, romance, and their unintended and sometimes undesired consequences with a couple gallons of humor. I rationed myself to approx. one to two chapters a night. Truly hilarious........and true."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good guide about how to laugh at yourself","review":"True, several of the stories are quite outdated since a night out with the friends to play pocker is almost unheard of. By the same token the women of these tales do not have any resemblance with the direct and assertive New Yorkers of nowadays. On the other hand, the elements that compose the human race remain basically unchanged, such as the dilusion of self importance, jealousy, greed etc., ang Groucho Marx is just a genious to poke fun at all those facts of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has not aged especially well","review":"While I definitely count myself as a Groucho fan, I was fairly disappointed by this book. By \\"has not aged especially well\\", I'm referring both to the subject matter (very tame) and the writing style (very dated). Frankly, I wonder if he would be at all surprised that it hasn't aged well: it looks to me as if he dashed it off in a hurry, perhaps for a quick paycheck. I found The Groucho Letters to be a bit better, but it likewise is no side-splitter. Perhaps his best writing was confined to the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"His humor just doesn't translate well to the written word","review":"Although there were a few laughs to be found, Groucho's personality just doesn't shine through on the printed page - without the ironic, self-effacing delivery he was so good at, most of this falls flat.It was undoubtably written in a hurry and has a completely manic feel that overpowers the wit. It feels like I expected Steve Martin's novels to be like before I read them - a slalom of pun, dated jokes and double entendres you can read at breakneck speed.I adore Groucho, but I think his stage presence was just too important to his humor for him to successfully write a book of this type.One section I found interesting was the way he trapped a spiritualist into betraying herself... if the whole book would have been in this vein, it would have been much more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rock Album","review":"Why has nobody gave a rating to this album yet? This one is a must have for everybody who recently discovered Queens Of The Stone Age or Mark Lanegan. Chris Goss is the godfather of stonerrock. This album is the first and in my opinion the best of the MoR albums. The sound is very bluesy and rocks at the same time. The guitar work is strong and groovy. Later albums are also good, but over here Chris has a very solid band. The songs are strong and well worked out. My favourites are Kill the King, John Brown and The eyes of Texas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to teach online","review":"I am a college professor migrating into the \\"new\\" world of teaching online.

The only things that keep him alive are his love for Kelly and the letters that he wrote her but never have a chance to send.Kelly O¡Brien was twelve when she met Jax, the college roommate of her brother and they became very good friend. When Kelly turned sixteen, Jax escorted her to her prom dance and they confessed their love for each other. Moreover, Jax made a promise to marry Kelly on her eighteen birthday but he never showed up.In LETTERS TO KELLY, Brockmann has a very different style in penning the tale. Unlike her past novels, this one is intense with emotion and filled with sadness. Readers will sympathize the main characters and sigh for them. Remember to grab a box of tissue before you start this book, you will probably cry and have tears in your eyes when the story unfolds page by page."},{"rating":"2","title":"I do whatever the little voices tell me so I LOVED this book","review":"As an author who frequently has conversations with my characters, Suzanne Brockmann has nailed it with this story.I love love love this book.

I'd buy the book again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"just really uncomfortable with the premise","review":"Up front I will say that I only made it half way through this book because I was so uncomfortable with the premise. The six year older main character falls in love with a 16 year old and acts on it to some extent. I just couldn't deal with the justifications that \\"she loves him back\\"...\\"he's going to wait until she's older\\" etc. It sounded just like all of the child abuse justifications."},{"rating":"2","title":"THREE STOOGES FOR THE NINETIES","review":"BABY'S DAY OUT is utterly ridiculous and preposterous, but it's also entertaining and has some real moments of hilarity. Joe Mantegna, Brian Haley and Joe Pantoliano are perfect as the modern three stooges who kidnap the baby of a wealthy family, but lose the baby and go on a rampage to rekidnap the tyke. With some fun special effects, improbable scenarios and slapstick humor, the movie is wildly entertaining. The scene where Joe Mantegna is trying to protect his private areas from the baby's lighter is priceless. Haley is especially funny as the big oaf and Lara Flynn Boyle, Cynthia Nixon and Matthew Gleve add fine support. It's all mindless but it's so funny who cares??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two grown up and two kid thumbs up!","review":"Really a good family movie--our 6 and 3 1/2 year olds love to watch again and again--and we don't mind not having to listen to Pokemon and Barney, either (at least for a few hours!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get what I ordered","review":"I bought this movie for my mother-in-law.

My neighbor suggested this video to me and I pressured the public library to get it -- as I needed a laugh, bad.Watching this, I couldn't mope. Watching all the adventures of the story book come true was too too cool. It looked like Chicago as the setting.So that's where the producers of the first TOY STORY got that idea of crossing a busy avenue dodging oncoming traffic. But that took some doing with the truck actually going over the active boy. Some special effects!And that scene with Joe M. hanging from the shut down machinery of a high rise building during construction reminded me of Doris Day in MIDNIGHT LACE.This was a laughable film -- in every way.

I don't get the carping about how derivative it is of Home Alone--it's a riot, so who cares? Certainly not a 7-year-old. There are some cleverly-written bits for grown-ups to appreciate, and some--like all the crotch-centered mishaps--that I could live without, but the kids think they're hilarious.

At their hideout, Bink escapes and throughout the movie, the bad guys chase him all over town trying to find him. The family receive help from the F.B.I. and try to find Bink. Baby's Day Out is actually a book that Bink reads, and he visits all the places that is in the book. Bink is extremely smart and cute.

It is so funny. It keeps me laughing for most of the playtime. I can recommend this movie to the whole family. It isn't a believable movie but is a great show for entertainment! Kidnappers take Baby from his parents only to find out Baby is more of a challenge to keep than they figured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby's Day Out","review":"This will mostly appeal to very young children or babies. Adults may be slightly bored or appalled watching a baby crawl out windows, through traffic, on skyscrapers, in a Gorillas cage, et cetera. Add in three bumbling idiot kidnappers that get racked between the legs a lot by falling onto things. That's the type of humor you will find in this John Hughes movie that doesn't hold a torch to \\"Look Who's Talking\\". I love most of Hughes movies but I was disappointed in this one.

The book predates the Web by 12 years. Its Web is a metaphor of the textile makers who use cotton. It studies the makeup of companies throughout the world who dominate the purchasing of cotton, for clothing production.A serious tome that requires some economic background. Heavily documented with footnotes, to emphasise the depth of their research. Their basic message is that bargaining power rests in these makers, instead of in the often poor third world farmers.Current readers will see analogies with how WalMart now dominates its suppliers, or how coffee chains like Starbucks often have the upper hand over growers.But while the book decries the fate of the cotton farmers, it pays to attention to the worldwide benefit of cheap cotton. It has enabled many people, even in the third world, to have affordable clothing.

Had I seen it first, I might not have bought it. In spite of the fact that I was a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s and that I like Carl Erskine, this book was a major disappointment. Pleasant, easy reading but shallow, superficial and providing neither interesting inside stories, insight into playing on one of baseball's best and most significant teams (i.e. Jackie Robinson) nor who Carl Erskine is.

Bauhaus was basicaly a punk band, now they assume their popularity among the gothic audience and call themselves gothic. For me, they sound just like old punks, and when you're punk you can do everything but growing old.

The pieces are not cut out into the shapes of the letters. The bubble shapes are harder for my 2 yr old to figure out, so he can't get them into the right spots without help. He is normally really good at puzzles but the shapes are confusing.The other major miss is the choice of pictures under the letters. For instance, under the letter D is a swan. I'm sure the manufacturer intended a duck but it looks exactly like a graceful, long-necked white swan. Even the beak looks swan-like in shape.For q they did a quail. Maybe a queen would have been more clear for a 2 yr old? He just sees a bird. V is a vine. Took me a moment to figure out what the picture was trying to depict.

My two year old loves puzzles, and I credit them to helping him learn his shapes and numbers. We have tons of Melissa and Doug puzzles but this one is terrible. The pieces are not cut out in the shape of letters so my son has trouble figuring out where to put them. Plus, the pictures/words associated with the letters are odd choices and not necessarily what you would like (i.e., quail for \\"Q\\"--he saw a bird, not a quail, and though \\"B\\" for bird).

This is NOT one of them. Older children will understand and coordintate the letters with the odd pictures inside, but will be bored within a few minutes of play. Younger children will not grasp the matching concepts used for letter/piece placement. Several of the letter pieces are interchangable, making mistakes very easy and not helping with the learning process. My overall impression of this educational product is that flashy colors and imaginative picture matches for the entire alphabet makes it pretty, but useless for anything other than a dust collector.

Actually, it was not so much a review as an ad, part of several mini-photos and descriptions that were not much longer. Sherman, a likeable enough fellow, was on the TV series SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS as a parallel to Michael Landon's \\"Little Joe\\" character on BONANZA. So.......now you know! (For the record --- as it were --- I never listened to this collection. They didn't give us turntables. However, I notice you can buy one here at Amazon.com...!!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Russian Praises Bobby","review":"I have never played higher than about 1200 at chess (hobbyist). But it is still fun to see just how good Bobby Fischer was, especially when described by GM's. Sort of like Ali being described by George Foreman, \\"He almost knocked my bald head off my flabby body!\\" (And Foreman was very good). The best anecdote is when the narrator describes a friendly visit to a later Bobby where they talk about chess. The narrator mentions how he played a game years earlier, Bobby says, \\"No, you didn't play that, you played this.\\" The narrator says Bobby was right. That is why Fischer was Fischer.The video will be tedious for non-chess players, with a LOT of game analysis, and only rudimentary photos/video of Fischer. But the games are magical, a self-taught kid from NY against the best players ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product, but seasoning is worth paying for...","review":"Hey it's great, but I do wish I had sprung for one that was pre-seasoned. If you do get this one, use your Wesson oil, DO NOT use shortning, it will smoke so badly that you have to put up with agonizing eye watering smoke for hours, plus it leaves residue on everything. Whereas, vegetable oil at about 300 degrees is much more tolerable, though it still smells.

She has managed to create a story with characters you will love and can relate to. You will leave this story feeling close to these new friends, your own family and a renewed christmas spirit. She reminds you of the true reason for the season, and how important a relationship with God is. Her part in this book will remind you to let go and let God. I look forward to reading more work from Pamela."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!","review":"This album is beyond amazing, for both a fan of the mellow sounds of goth and anyone who enjoys lush, quite music. Highlights include \\"Season of Mist\\", which is just that, a song that sounds misty and mysterious, \\"Earthquake at Versailles\\", which is both funloving and haunting, and 11:59PM October 30, which is the perfect halloween anthem!The vocals on this album are matched only by the violins and synths. This is truly a MUST for any fan of Dead Can Dance, Cocteau Twins, Love is Colder than Death or Qntal, or any fan of great music in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for two great actresses who deserve better.","review":"Angela Bassett and Loretta Divine are two of this countries best actresses. However, this film had one MAJOR PROBLEM and her name is Whitney Houston. Those studio heads with below average intelligence thought that because Bodyguard made millions that she was a movie star.

Pathetic \\"viewers\\" from various places who can't even give a name, we know what type of losers they are, feel that they have to protect a movie because of political correctness when a movie, black or white, it's just plain bad. A great film will speak to people regardless of race and/or income bracket and those affected need not to have experienced what it's like to be a black woman, by the way, I feel that a majority of black women wouldn't say this film was a true representation of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could score less than 1 star.","review":"This movie is awful. The acting talent is there, but the storyline is hateful. Came away with 3 things - according to this storyline all black men are bad, black men want white women, and white women want black men. Oh, and the black woman is right when she torches her cheating hubby's car. There are very few movies that irritate me.

She did a great job and so did all the others. The movie was funny, touching and I didn't find it to be male bashing but rather about experiences of a group of women friends. I am also happy that it was a great success at the box office because it's rare that a movie about black women can go no.1, but thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston, it debuted at no.1 and was a big hit despite being released in limited theaters because it's a black movie who are a minority in the US in terms of numbers. By the way, Wesley Snipes is in the movie, he chose not to be credited but he's there for several minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"( ;D)","review":"Love this movie, i like the issues it shows women deal with. Husbands leaving their wifes, women who love the men they can't have and other issues. A great sit and watch with your girlfriends movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney needs acting lessons, overall this one hits home","review":"I can identify with many of the issues in this movie because for most African American women, these things are a reality. I thought the acting on Angela Bassett's and all the supporting actresses'/actors' parts were great, however Whitney does need help. I love her (singing) voice but she should consider taking some acting lessons. I've seen this movie at least 10 times and every time, it does a work for my emotions. I know it appears to bash men, but this is REAL. Most men that I've met are the same way. I also spent 11 years in a marriage that I thought was fine and what do you know, he turns out to be a REAL jerk. Overall, I really liked the movie, highly recommend it and think it is a great example of a friendship shared between four strong, smart, African American women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"Love this move...

When I played it, about 5 minutes and 40 seconds in...all of the sudden the volume of the movie goes down and you hear an emergency broadcast message with the annoying beep in the background. Then it says \\"this has been an emergency broadcast....yada yada\\". Are you kidding me? I should have realized something was up with this dvd because the volume was kind of low anyway when I put it in. Amazon was nice enough to send me another one...same problem. I ended up having to pack them both up and drive to a ups drop off in order to send them both back for a refund. What a hassle. I thought selling bootleg videos was against the law?

Truth literally exudes from each word, and you are transported to a different place and time. The characters explored become real to you, most particularly the author's own voice, which is alternately joyful, passionate, sad, but always insightful and charming. You feel the need to walk these paths yourself to wash in the transcendental footsteps Ms. Wood has luckily left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a rolling pin that works!","review":"I've tried them all. The wooden rollers. The black 'non-stick' rollers. Flour, oil, bare hands, spinning tricks, aluminum presses, cold marble and dirty looks. Nothing gets dough flat without a fight... until now. This is the real deal folks... no sticking and no protests. The pin is well balanced, cleans up easily, and is just short enough to fit into my kitchen drawers with ease. It doesn't flex and puts dough right where I want it to. Despite the stiff price, it's worth every penny. The only downside is that the silicone surface does tend to pick up every bit of debris from your drawers and countertops, so make sure to wipe it off often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"We make a lot of bread, pie crust, pasta and pizza dough. We set out to find a no handle rolling pin like we always see on TV. We ran across the Fiesta even though it is a bit pricey we thought we would give it a try. Wow what a rolling pin. It has about same circumference and weight as our old wooden handle pin but much longer. We made a couple of pie crusts the other night and it rolled the dough like a charm (we did flour it). Just beware it doesn't fit in any of our drawers, we have to keep it in a cupboard with the baking supplies. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who bakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very effective","review":"I have used this a few times since I got it and the suction it creates does not do anything to free up a clogged toilet.

It was a good effort, but all of these bands are unknown and lack the talent to perform Leppard music. The forthcoming tribute with better known artist will be worth a buy, but this one is only good for Rock of Ages and Women. They totally butchered Pour Some Sugar On Me with that industrial sound. Other song sound like something out of a struggling club act. My recommendation is buy it, but make sure your not expecting a high level of exellence in the recording and performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Injustice for All","review":"This is a pretty terrible tribute album. However, there are some descent songs. Women and Rock of Ages are pretty much the only good renditions. Pour some sugar on me is AWFUL! It's an industrial version. And photograph has a contemporary standard rock 4/4 beat with what sounds like a poor man's Matt Barlow on vocals. Avoid if you can. I give it two stars only because of its two good songs and that it isn't nearly as bad as those death metal Iron Maiden tributes."},{"rating":"1","title":"deaf leopard","review":"You cant complain about this cd.

But, this is still a very funny movie, with some priceless scenes and quips, and excellent campy performances from Divine and Lainie Kazan. If you are a pretentious snob or drama queen, don't bother.

Paul Bartel won my admiration with \\"Eating Raoul\\", so I was thinking a movie with my favorite drag queen directed by Paul Bartel was sure to have plenty of laughs. I was sorely disappointed by the experience. The comic highlight is Divine's singing bit, but everything else is sub-par.I haven't seen the DVD version of this, and may consider purchasing it for the Edith Massey screen test mentioned by another reviewer, but other than that, I have no reason to purchase the DVD copy.

I'm not a prude by any means and can on occasion enjoy low brow humour as well as the next guy but this movie couldn't ellicit as much as one laugh out of me.Lesson for Today: Irreverent and crude doesn't necessarily translate into funny and entertaining.

All of the Auric Blends are amazing...they last a long time and are very pleasant scents, not overwhelming.

I also add the oils to unscented lotion. This particular scent, One Love, is a blend of cherry and vanilla. Very yummy scent. Sweet, but clean.

By the time you master this book, you will have dramatically improved your grammatical skills. I guarantee that! Are you unsure when to use the past perfect vs past simple?

Ms. Baratz-Logsted's novel, had the power to do just that, and keep me there making me almost feel part of the intriguing story. I felt at times that I was Emma's confidant, and understood her desires. Even if they felt wrong but justifiable at times, I wanted her to taste them. But the twists and turns, kept me guessing to the very end, if I was a good friend, in my understanding for her. A great and captivating read.

The motor just burned out and wouldn't work again. We made sure the plug was connected with the socket. This pencil sharpener also makes a lot of noise. I personally prefer the Panasonic KP-310 sharpener. I haven't tried out any of the other 5-star Panasonic ones. We have a Panasonic KP-310 sharpener at my school. It only burnt out after I sharpened about 4 boxes of colored pencils (300 colored pencils) in a row when helping my teacher. Note: this pencil sharpener has no auto-stop.

It takes you deep into something new and you immediately find that it is what you've been looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book has almost 400 pages... 200 are pressure traverse charts","review":"I was expecting a little bit more of a practical guide on how to use the nodal analysis to optimize production. Instead I got perhaps 20 pages or less on how to optimize a system (there's not much to it I guess), a whole chapter on Inflow-Outflow theory, 200 pages of pressure traverse charts and a chapter on IPR correlations.If you are looking for a practical guide, this is definitely NOT the book... @ $125.00 I think it was a bit on the expensive side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronic Swing Trading for Maximum Profit","review":"Waste of money.Mostly just general reference stuff which can be found in any of 100 places - how to use level 2, explanations of MACD etc.The buying hook of course is the promise of the title that the book will somehow be a specialization course in swing trading as opposed to day or buy and old.But the advise regarding swing trading given is the most common sense type that any one could think of.Save your $$ on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not for swing traders","review":"This is a good book, with very complete info on many market topics. The problem is that the focus is more on day trading than swing trading. There is little or no real info or real life examples of swing trading styles and strategies. Instead it focuses too heavily on market mechanics more relevant to day trading.The writing style is fairly easy to read, but the poor editing and grammar made me question the quality of what I was reading.Not too bad, but still disapointing. I'm left still looking for a good book on swing trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Swing Trading at all","review":"I bought this book specifically because I thought from the title that it would be about swing trading, and in particular Gann's method of swing trading (since he was the one who coined the phrase), so I was terribly disappointed after reading it to discover that it made no mention of Gann, nor any mention of the method of swing trading. Sure it mentions the word \\"swing\\" a lot, but nowhere in the book does it actually tell you about the method of swing trading itself.The book is no more than a general introduction to the whole business of trading, which as a previous reviewer noted, information such as this can be gained from any of 100 sources. And if its an introduction you want, you're better off getting John J. Murphy's \\"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets\\".The \\"Buy Used and New from $5.99\\" says it all...sorry, this book is not what it says it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Money!!","review":"Iam looking for a good book and this one is a real waste of money.

If you want a hardcore book on swing trading this not the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"As the obsessive Space Ghost fan said...","review":"COP OUT!!!!The first book was edgy and managed to create an improbable mixture of mellowness and anger. All of the characters were interesting and real, as were their problems. In the first book all the characters were forced to do things they didn't want to: X-Day was meant to be their day of liberation. But X-Day never comes. I hope that the ending of the book is meant to be ironic, that they all decided to adopt plastic smiles like the rest of the world; but the author either betrayed their original intention, or was forced to change it. As for The Last Supper: what the hell was that all about? I'm getting sick of manga publishes just throwing in random stories by the same author just for the hell of it. It was an insipid preachy fable, but at least it wasn't as nearly distracting as when Viz did it in the first volume of \\"Boys Over Flowers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible ending to a horrible manga","review":"After a lousy first volume I read the second one. It mangaged to be even worse than volume 1. The ending was abrupt and corny and a huge disappointment to a disappointing series.

I have nothing against cover albums but this one sounds like someone was forcing him to sing in the bathroom at gunpoint. The choice of songs on the album don't mesh at all with his vocal style and the songs themselves are all too slow paced. I paid over $30 for this album (import) and can't recommend it at all unless you are a super groupie diehard fanatic Rick Astley fan. I hope he comes out with another album soon with songs that he has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whyyyy Rick ?

I found my ears straining for other instruments to join in. And If you expect to hear his bold and firey baritone vocals here...forget it. Rick is singing in his sleepon this one. This is such a dissapointment while knowing what great things he can do with that voice when paired with the right production. Recall \\"Body and Soul\\",\\"Waiting for the bell to Ring\\", \\"Hoplessly\\",\\"Cry for Help\\".

The story was much longer than needed to tell the tale. The characters did have some saving factors, even with their weaknessess or character flaws, but the dialogue just wasn't that witty to me, even though the author did try to make it so. People just don't talk that way, and contrary to someone else's review, it would have been nice to see a twenty dollar word every fifty or so pages.

It was so boring. I mean all it was about is how these kids kept losing there teachers because they were bad. Miss Agnes comes in and teachs them and did a good job but all the book was about is how much the teacher helped them, there was'nt really no story to it. This book was so bad I would not recommend that you read this book. Like one part is she just sits there and talks how she wants to be the best for the teacher so that she can be the star of her class. That is basically what it talks about through the whole book, and it was so boring that I kept drifting off and thinking about other stuff while I should have been consentrating on the book. I would have put it down if I wasn't reading it for a class grade. So I would not recommend this book for you to read EVER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, but not outstanding literature","review":"I just recently finished reading the book. I found the book an interesting read culturally, but not a particularly strong piece of literature. I will use it in the classroom as part of my summer reading. We have a large deaf community and I think the children have the opportunity to learn more about people who not only want to but can learn with challenges. I loved Miss Agnes and her outlook on teaching and life. To explore about another culture and how they value education is important for students to learn. The human interaction is touching and perhaps, the strongest aspect of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful gem!","review":"An excellent book for children which won't take long to read. Large print and easy words. However the message is deep and is excellent material for group discussion. The story itself deals with a group of children who have a perception of their own worth as presented to them by adults unwilling to challenge the status quo. Another adult enters their world who challenges their thinking and directs them to dream big dreams and reach for the stars. A good lesson for children, an even better one for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fourth Grade Daughter's Impression of this Book","review":"Written By Sophia (9yrs.

The tale contains no original insight and is told on a level that is so mundane that it is neither engaging nor thought-provoking. I tried to like it, but just couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that hype *sighs*","review":"It is sold out here in Hong Kong, so I ordered it from Amazon, expecting that its popularity means that it must be an inspirational read. But it is just a lot of common sense really. And the fable created to tell the theory is way too simple to even move a reader into thinking about the theory. It is probably the biggest marketing success for the 2 marketing consultants who wrote it, so I have to admire them for their ability to see a void in the market, but the attempt could have been better.If you want to read something inspirational with a little more thought put into the story, I think Who Moved My Cheese is a much better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Standard Reference For PA Fly Fishers","review":"Dwight Landis has authored and photographed what should be considered the standard reference work for fly fishers in Pennsylvania.

This was a movie that could easily have been written by any of our friends. There are very few movies that were meant to be accompined by copius amounts of beer but this is one of them.

I think I will add Roseanne Barr as a tag for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorefest - Strike Two For The Lizards","review":"OK, I LOVED Super Troopers, I'd rate it a top 3 comedy along with Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin of the last 10 years or so, but after Club Dread and this really bad movie, you really have to wonder if the Broken Lizard team is done. The acting was fine here, but the story was horrible, I mean REALLY bad, as if it were written by a bunch of Jr High kids. Not one real laugh in the whole show. The last 20 minutes are the highlight of the movie, if such can be found anywhere in this show. At least there you can smirk and or gently muse to your self, but no laughing, NO LAUGHING at all. I don't think this movie was as bad as Club Dread, which has to be in the top 10 worst movies of all time, but there is no way I can rate this movie any higher than a 1 star. CD should get a negative 9 stars. I understand that BL is putting together a ST2. Lets hope a return to that formula brings back some comedic chemistery, because the last two BL flicks had none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It!!","review":"This is definately a movie to SKIP! It just plain sucked! Simple as that. It belongs in the $4.99 bin a Wal-mart but you still won't see me buying it. Glad I rented it first although it would be nice to get my money back. You can read about the plot from the other reviews. I thought it would appeal to me but I guess I would have had to be as drunk as the guys in the movie to enjoy it. Do yourself a favor, and look for something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching a car wreck in slow motion....","review":"This movie sucked, plain and simple. Not funny at all. I had to stop watching this half way through. I'd rather watch Mariah Carrie's movie Glitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beerfest (unrated) HD DVD","review":"I love this stupid comedy.However, was HIGHLY disappointed in the HD DVD version only because: One must have a specifically HD-capable player DVD unit to get it to play. It will NOT even play on a Blu-Ray player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympics of beer drinking?","review":"Here is a party movie that focuses on all aspects of drinking beer. It is a spectacle of drinking games, drinking contests, getting drunk and staying drunk. Of course, all of this is not exactly what I would call \\"impressive.\\" Therein lies the weakness of this movie.There are a few funny parts in this film, to be sure, but it's just not what I would call a \\"well done\\" movie, even though it is a party movie. There is very little nudity and there is some \\"dark\\" humor that just doesn't seem to fit with a party film.There's also the obvious point: films that repeatedly glorify getting drunk are not the best influence for people in their late teens & early 20s. I'm old enough to know that the \\"have fun & be happy\\" stuff associated in this movie with getting drunk is all nonsense. I was in the Navy & knew a great many alcoholics who were miserable. Am just saying that this movie is a lot like professional wrestling. It's OK to watch, SO LONG AS you realize that it's all fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foam Filled Dud","review":"After looking at some of the other reviews on this site, I am left wondering, \\"Did we see the same movie?\\"This flick is really, really bad. I don't mind Broken Lizard's rude, crude humor-I liked Club Dread-and being a beer geek the storyline appealed to me, but this is supposed to be a comedy, folks, and it was anything but funny. I could even live with fitfully amusing, but this dreck couldn't even reach that low mark.Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I was looking for a product just like this. Trek and Giant bicycle brands make products very similar to this, but for 3x the money. The assembly was very easy, and attachment to my bike was a snap. My 4 year old loves going on bike rides and has no problem climbing or staying on by herself.Would definitely recommend it to anyone considering spending a lot more money on the expensive brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest ride!","review":"I think this is a great item! My 4 year old \\"rides\\" with us, but can easily take breaks too. I actually find that maneuvering my bike with this co-pilot is better than with the trailer I used to pull. Definitely try it out before you put your child on it! I'm so glad I bought this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Quality, Poor Mfg. Customer Service","review":"I should have known better - you get what you pay for. Knowing that I would likely only use this product a dozen times before my youngest child would out grow it, I thought I could get away \\"very cheap\\". Unfortunately, this product exceeded my expectations, on the downside, of quality. I'm not even sure that this thing would last through a year of use. In addition to the general poor quality (see other reviews), the coaster hub did not work - the peddles would continue to turn if the child tried to coast. I attempted to get the manufacturer to send me a replacement hub, but after waiting 10 days, still didn't receive the shipment as promised. After calling again, they said another was \\"on the way\\" but would arrive after the Amazon \\"last chance to return\\" window. Decided that it was not worth the risk of dealing with a poor quality product AND lame customer service. I'll spend another $100 and avoid any further hassle....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love riding with my son on this","review":"This is a really fun attachement to my bike and the price is reasonable! My six year old son loves that he is on my bike and because he is attached, I can actually get places. When he peddles, it isn't that hard to bike with the extra attachement. Assembly too, was very easy. I had no problem assembling it in an hour or so. My only complaint is that it could be hard to reconnect to the bike. Sometimes it takes me a frustrating twenty minutes to get the back part to slide into the attachement piece on the bike, because the attachement is heavy and it tilts all over the place as I try to slide it in. It's also a big thing and a bit hard to travel with, but all in all, not too heavy to make a lighter attachement worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture was misleading in color available","review":"When I placed the order, there was a different picture than there is now. It was a navy blue with silver co-pilot bike. There was nothing to indicate other colors. When the bike was received it was all white, which did not match my bike. When I called the company, they said white was all that they had and that Amazon had the wrong picture on the web. I was upset because I felt that the picture was misleading and even though they tried to blame Amazon, they should've known what they were selling on the web, so there is no excuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"WeeRide Co-Pilot is a big hit with the kids (& parents)","review":"This is wonderful - we are having such fun with it, so much so my younger daughter wants us to get one so she can ride on \\"the big bikes\\" with us too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Great product, easy to install! My four year old is of average height and she fits on it comfortably with plenty of room to grow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect step after a trailer.","review":"My 5 year old was just too heavy to pull in the trailer. This is perfect as her pedaling really does help move us. This is especially helpful on an incline. She cannot ride a two-wheeler yet and has no trouble with this as my bike holds her up. Easy to hook up and unhook and not too heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike, Lots of FUN","review":"We bought this tandem bike with free shipping directly from Amazon. It shipped very quickly, was easy to assemble and our 4 and 1/2 year old loves it. she is a little tall for her age, so I am not sure if a shorter 4 year old would do as well. She loves the flag in the back that helps motorists see the bike and she pedals all the time. Definitely worth the money! At first there is a little getting used to having a kid on the back throwing the balance off (my daughter is still in training wheels on her regular bike), but this was never really an issue-- just an observation. I also think that it is helping her learn how to balance on a bike so that she can soon ride her own bike without her training wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for 5 yrs old and up","review":"Shipping was fast. But shipping box tape was loose, so one tool fell out on the way from shipment. We purchased for 3 1/2 years old girl but it is good for 5 years old which my first one enjoys most. Overall, I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it!","review":"Bang for the buck; un-beatable! My daughter and I love to rent these at the beach, when we go! So, I thought I would get her one, for home use! Start to finish, took less than 10 min to get together safely. And now, it takes less than a min, to remove, or re-connect. Very handy! I believe, there may have been some exaggerations, with the negative reviews?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with no problems","review":"I've used this about a dozen times since I bought it about 5 weeks ago. I haven't had any problems with it. The hitch that attaches to my bike is secure, so any problems that others encountered in years past seems to have been addressed. The weeride website indicates that they have updated the hitch on this model.You do have to make wide turns when the copilot is attached. If I make a turn too sharp, my seat post will turn as the hitch has stops in it to prevent it from turning too far. The copilot has not fallen over at any time.My bike wobbles a bit when my son peddles fast or turns around to look at things, but this amount of wobbling will vary based on your bike size. I am 6-7 and have a large bike, so the hitch is attached at a point on my bike that is higher than on just about all other bikes. This will cause my bike to wobble more than other bikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to secure","review":"I read all the reviews before I bought this product but chose to ignore them because it is cheap. We tried everything to tighten all connections but it just keeps on tilting to the left when my daughter was on. I'm not sure if this is due to the design or I just got a defective one. The money I saved is not worth the hassle of assembly and disassembly we had to do to return this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple Defective Units","review":"I purchased this trail-a-bike at Academy Sports and recieved a unit without the attachment for the lead bicycle. After returning it for a second unit, it had the missing part except it was not removable as claimed. After working the unit, I could not reseat the saftey pin. The second unit was rendered unsafe/unusable. I plan to return it tomorrow and go with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"safety hazard","review":"Poorly made. Our first trip out, the co-pilot began clanking after after 45 minutes of biking. We barely made it back home. We returned the product and were given a new one. The second one also broke within the first hour of riding. This time, however, it was extremely dangerous. The brakes locked up and almost threw my son off the bike. Since we were on vacation we brought the co-pilot to a bike shop and were told that a barring was broken, which would cost $40 to replace. DON'T TRUST THIS POORLY MADE PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but problems and rides off keel and unsafe","review":"For some reason, this thing always sits off keel, not perpendicular to the road. I've tried to adjust and readjust, tighten and retighten, but nothing seems to help. In addition, the seat post attachment seems to pivot out of position fairly easily, making it easy to jackknife the trailer even when not turning. Last but not least, something went haywire with the axle during the middle of a ride and the wheel would no longer turn. We walked back to the car. Next day I took it to a shop where the guy was able to remove and reinstall the ring and hypothesized that it hadn't been properly tightened at the factory. We've had one too many mishaps with this thing and my daughter is now afraid to ride it, so I'll be looking for a higher quality solution. Hopefully she isn't turned-off riding altogether. I really hoped this thing would at least be up for basic recreational riding, but not so. Maybe we just got a lemon? In any case, I'm done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this bike sucks","review":"My son rode maybe 2 miles on this bike, and from the beginning I had problems with him leaning to one side, almost falling off. By the end the bike started to shake a lot during the ride. We kept on tightening the bolts, but it never helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great for a 4 year old, but good","review":"My 4 year old daughter fell when the lead bike turned, she isn't an avid bike rider, so she's now a little scared of it. But is very stable when assembled properly - only took about 10 minutes to attach to my bike. I'd recommend it. It's great when we want to go on a long bike ride with my 6 year old and my daughter can't keep up."},{"rating":"1","title":"it came with defect and we could not get replacement","review":"This does look like a good construction and assembly was very easy. However, when we got it the critical swiwel section was stuck in both directions. The manufacture advised to return for replacement. So we did. Got from Amazon a replacement and the same problem. Had hard time getting a very old lady back on the phone and she resumed: you got a \\"lemon\\". So I returned to Amazon requesting a replacement. Well, by that time Amazon apparently raised the price for the item and now refuses to send me replacement and instead refunding me money. The explanation: we need to do quality control. That must be a lie because the item is on sale, for the higher price. Amazon appears to quality control me, a customer for over 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bike trailer but thoroughly check it when it arrives","review":"Our son enjoys the WeeRider. We have only used it on short rides and it is attached to my husband's bike. He said it took some adjusting on his part to have the weight of the trailer and my son attached behind. The trailer itself is very sturdy and we find that it takes two of us to attach it to the bike because it's fairly heavy. Once attached though, we have had no problems.The one side note I have is that the first WeeRide sent to us was clearly a return from another customer. The box was ripped in several spots and the trailer was just tossed in the box. It was missing parts and we immediately returned it with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...don't go cheap on this!","review":"We were all set for our bike ride...we made it about 1 mile, if that, and the WeeRide wheel froze up---wouldn't budge....we were stranded unless my daughter and I wanted to walk and drag the tire all the way home which would have ruined the tire and at that point I didn't know what was wrong so I decided against that. Fortunately a police man happened to be driving by and had to give us a ride home...so much for the bikeride and picnic my daughter was soo excited about.Turned out, per our local bike repair shop, that there was a factory defect with the wheel. The sprocket on the wheel was cross threaded-- which relative to the cost of the bike, was a costly repair.Had to return the bike. My recommendation: Don't go cheap- you get poor quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you get one that works! 2/3 have not for us.","review":"Our first one, the pedals/chain were defective and the pedals did not \\"drive\\" they chain, it just freewheeled backwards or forward. Sent back, got replacement. Replacement has been fine, we use it often.With our growing family, we ordered a second one. This is also defective! The mount and bike-mounting holder do not fit together, it is impossible to take the CoPilot on and off, apparently a welding error or something. So we have to send this back to. Telephone customer service was helping only by saying, \\"We can't help you with defective parts. Return to Amazon.\\"So, one CoPilot has worked fine for 2 years for us, but 2 others have come and gone on the first day due to major, inoperable defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free at last!!!","review":"I have a 4 yr old boy and a 6 yr old girl. Took training wheels off 6 yr old's bike last week and got the WeeRide copilot for the 4 yr old. The WeeRide is fantastic! The quality is fine and I anticipate only using it for 1 year or so and therefore did not need high end components. The clamp bolts to the seat post, but there is a quick release to remove the WeeRide from the clamp for storage. My 4 yr old loves being a copilot and a back seat driver. He was singing during the entire ride. The flag is nice to identify an extra long bike to cars. If you want to cycle and have 3-5 yr olds, buy this inexpensive, temporary solution and get your fanny on the bike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We purchased this item because of the bargain price and we got what we paid for. The bike trailer did not trail straight behind our bike and we adjusted it many times. The hook up wasn't the best either. We returned the item (with ease) and went with a Trek tag-a-long. The Trek is definately worth the extra money for it is a much better quality bike. The bike trailer is used by our 4 and 6 year old kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wee ride copilot","review":"I haven't had an opportunity to use it because the chain keeps slipping off the gears and I haven't been able to figure out the problem or fix it"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, fun, fun","review":"The WeeRide Co-Pilot that I just purchased was one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.

He asks everyday to go riding."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Fun!","review":"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter. SHE LOVES IT!

We're very happy with our purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dollar for dollar, best child tow rider","review":"Shopped around for something similar for a few weeks, range from 80 to 600 dollars - decided on the wee rider based on average of prior reviews and ability to return.Received today, took 20 minutes to set up, followed directions exactly to avoid the problems that many of the negative reviewers had... no concerns.Took my 3.5 year old daughter for a 6 mile ride up and down hills, over curbs and off and on the sidewalk and street - bike rode great, checked all connections several times, solid as could be with no issues, all the neighbors were impressed, are going to be looking into buying them tonight.Feel free to spend 400+ on the trek version, I am happy with my 80 ride and my daughter LOVES it. Mom is happy that it is same and secure enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some quality issues","review":"Overall still an acceptable deal for the money for us, but some problems that could be a bigger problem for the less mechanically-inclined:Two of the bolt holes on the mounting bracket were partly chromed over so that one bolt head was already stripped by the factory putting it in a little bit and another that wouldn't go in any further. Smaller diameter replacement bolts with separate nuts solved the problem. The bottom bracket is not quite right. From the factory it didn't turn easily or smoothly. Loosening it up helped a lot bit it took some effort to get it right. The pedals are cheap and do not turn as freely as I would like. Some of the other bolts are very difficult to adjust or turn at all. The unit is functioning well but it is not a high quality piece of equipment by any measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING...UNSAFE. POOR QUALITY.","review":"We were very disappointed with this bike trailer. My husband (who has an engineering degree and is very mechanical) spent about 2 hours trying to get the hitch bolts to fit together properly. He filed and used a lot of WD40. After finally getting the thing together, it worked okay, but I didn't think it was safe for our 6 year old. Very poor quality control and construction. Not worth the money! We ended up returning it to Amazon.com. We plan to buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable!","review":"This arrived at my house with a big hole in the box and missing the instructions, the pedals and the handlebar hardware. So I went through the effort of returning it to Amazon (since they wouldn't just ship the missing parts to me, no, I had to get an entire replacement. So in the replacement shipment the pedals and instructions were there, but still no hardware to attach the handlebar. So I had to go to my local bike shop and I'm still waiting for them to receive the part, and it's going to be like $50 for this solution.

I found all good reviews except one.I ignored the bad one with the wishful thinking that the customer got a bad piece.I faced exactly the same problem that the customer mentioned. I checkedthe design carefully, I found that there is nothing wrong with the piece. It is afundamental design problem. There are two clamps, one attach to the primary bike seat rod,and another on the rod that attach to the first. Both clamps can not be tightenedfirmly to prevent it from rotation. Due to the possibility of simultaneous rotations of theseclamps, the trailer can incline to a large extent. With a child riding on the trailer,it can trip over easily. This problem may not show up in first one or two rides. But witha few more rides, the friction in the clamps goes away, and they start rotating morefreely. In my opinion, this trailer should be recalled, as it is too dangerous to be on the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"WeeRide Trailer Bike a Hit!","review":"Excellent quality construction and components - something I was worried about sight unseen. Extremely stout fittings, couplings and quick disconnects. My 4.5 year old and I are having a blast! I feel much safer with him behind me rather than him beside me peddling like mad to keep up and in the path of oncoming bikers. Setup was smooth except for one small but critical detail. The swing bar mechanism that pivots up/down and side-to-side was a bit over-tightened and it would not pivot at all. The 6mm allen bolts would not come loose with a standard allen wrench, but fortunately I had a 6mm allen socket mount for my ratcheting wrench or I never would have been able to loosen it without breaking the standard, flimsy allen wrench. Other than that, it is excellent quality and performs extremely well, and I recommend it highly.MAM - Seattle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning SECOND one... wheel keeps locking","review":"We are very disappointed with this product. We purchased our first one for our daughter and on our first ride, the wheel kept locking up and we skidded to a stop. Got it to unlock, and continued locking several more times. Took it back to Dicks (where we bought it) and they exchanged for another one (same model), and the second one is doing the same thing. We are now returning the SECOND one and will purchase a different brand. We called Instep, and they were NOT helpful at all as to how we can fix the wheel locking problem. We also took the second trailer to a bike shop today after trying it out today and kept locking... they tried fixing it and looked at it without success.

I also wanted to share all the awesome bike trails we have in our community. I discovered this and we both just LOVE it. It is VERY easy to use, connect and disconnect, folds up to store. Rides smoothly and it turns easily...that was a concern for me. He absolutely LOVES this. The first time we took it for a ride, he began to scream, \\"LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!

I believe this is a result of the users not being familiar with the quick release mechanism and just screwing it on versus screwing it then folding the quick release handle. Its just a guess but the simplicity of this unit is such that I just cant imagine what the issue could be. Perhaps it would be a good idea to watch a youtube video example The trailer is well made and very sturdy they have done such a great job on the structure I don't feel there could be any just complaints about the product in regard to safety.

She is quite tall for her age, but is unable to pedal. We had to remove the reflector to make the seat go as low as possible to do this though. She can get her feet into an even position that is comfortable for her, and will hold on for the entire ride. It doesn't turn on a dime, but as long as you're aware of that and let the child know you are turning, I don't think it's a problem. I was disturbed by the condition of the box when it arrived. It smelled like it was doused in gasoline and the trailer still smells after a week. The box was also pretty banged up, and in fact fell apart as my husband carried it to the garage. We decided to give it a try though as my child was desperate to ride and the product iteself appeared to be in good condition, and it turns out we love it...despite the smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"more time on the open road...less fussing with 6 year old riders","review":"we just hooked this bike to our tandum and it works great! assembly right out of the box was simple. my 6 year old daughter has trouble reaching the pedals; unless I leave the reflector off, I cannot lower seat low enough, with the reflector left off it would lower just perfect enough with balls of her feet on pedals. this product is awesome for family bike rides, we don't have to keep stopping and fussing with my daughter on her own bike.

The bike literally just broke apart at a place where it should have been welded...maybe this was welded wrong, but needless to say - this thing is not safe! Imagine if it broke apart when crossing a road, not in our driveway!!!!

It was fairly simple to get together and adjust for my 3 year old daughter's small size. I had to flip the handle bar and put it at an angle so she would be able to reach it. We took a test ride a mile up the road and although my daughter wasn't able to reach the pedals she had a great time just cruising with mom. I am not too worried about her small size with this trailer bike. She should definitely grow into it this coming year. This is a great addition to our bike accessories. My husband, three year old, two year old and I now can go on rides together. (Two year old in an Ibert) My girls may not be able to ride their own bike yet but they aren't missing out on much with this. Great family fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Co-Pilot","review":"My four year old son loves this. We biked about 4 miles and really enjoyed it. You cant beat the price on this brand. It would be nice if it had its own water bottle attatchment. I would reccomend it to any one who wants to bike and bring your kid right behind you. It handles speed well and stays plumb. It fits well on our 3 bike trunk rack. The fold up feature is easy to use. I was able to put it together in no time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and safe","review":"The WeeRide Co-Pilot is a well built, heavy-duty ride along attachment that can definitely handle the weight of a young-to-middle aged child (probably around 4-10 yrs old). This item requires a little set-up, but all the necessary tools are included. I like the fact the pedal on the WeeRide is a free-wheel as it allows my daughter to coast if she doesn't feel like pedaling. The handle bars and seat are adjustable which adds comfort and safety. In my opinion, this is a must have for any one who wants to introduce a child to riding bicycles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned Ours","review":"Wanted to like it for the price, however had two major issues with it.First the screw hole, for the bracket that attaches the bikes together, was not drilled fully on one of the four holes.Secondly the attachment for the handle bars, that is supposed to hold it vertically in place, would not work. Called the manufacturer to get a relacement and that one didnt work either.All in all it is seems like it would be a good product if it were tested before being packaged, but just didn't trust it to use so it went back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"Good product, was concerned before purchase based on other reviews. I had no problem with assembly. on the first couple of uses the mounting bracket seemed to turn on the seat post but then I realized it was the seat post itself that was turning. Tightened its bolt and everything is working fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made item.","review":"Paid for next day shipping, but the item was missing the seat post clamp. So I wasted my money on express shipping. The \\"quick connect\\" is not all that quick and appears to be over manufactured. When you turn your bike the knuckle is too rigid and turns your entire seat.The rest of the components are under built. Disappointed with this entire unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"Nothing good to say about this product. Cheap quality. I put it right back in the box where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Co pilot is junk! Buyer beware.","review":"We bought this for my daughter to learn how to ride a bike. When she got on it all she could do was lean to left or right on it. It was terrible. I thought maybe she wasn't straightening up so I asked my son to hop on to show her how to do it the right way. He of course knows how to ride a bike. Well when he rode it it would lean to the left or right and he almost fell off of it. I do not recommend this item to anyone. Complete waste of money and they wont even take it back to refund our money. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for now....","review":"Package arrived in a heavily damaged box held together with a roll of packing tape. Left pedal was missing from order. Product itself is well built and my daughter is eager to try it out. The 800 number for customer service at WeeRide does not answer and you cannot leave a message. If I can get them to express me the pedal I will revisit this review because the product itself appears to be quite rugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it today, returning it tomorrow","review":"Bought this locally today on sale.Like some of the other reviewers, I was also unable to get the pivot points to pivot. I finally was able to get the up/down pivot screws loosened, which amazingly actually have nothing to do with whether or not the pieces will move. There's simply not enough clearance between the two pieces to allow movement. Some spray lube finally got some up/down motion (if you try hard enough), but attempting the same \\"fix\\" on the side-to-side pivot resulted in two stripped screw heads and a 6mm allen wrench that's now a little worse for wear. Also, the instructions failed to mention the 5mm allen wrench needed for the four bolts that attach the mounting point to my bike's seatpost.I gave the WeeRide two stars because it looks nice and seems sturdier than the $20-more expensive Schwinn we also just bought (but actually turns when we need it to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of room for Quality Improvements!","review":"During assembly of this bike trailer, it was clear that there was room for quality improvements:- four screws and bolts to attach it to the main bike instead of a quick release requires 5 to 10 minutes and you better carry the necessary tools on your ride.- Precision was lacking: the seat post could not slide into the frame even when enormous pressure was applied; the hinge that allows folding the trailer for easy transportation and storage is poorly constructed.I did not bother taking this trailer out for a ride, returned it instead and lost a few dollars in shipping cost. At REI we found a bike trailer - Novara Afterburner - with everything the Weeride is missing. Check out the Novara Afterburner at an REI near you; your kid(s) will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to attach to my bike","review":"I found the trailer very difficult to attach to my bike. After attaching the collar to the seat column of my bike, it found it impossible to simply slide on the trailer - it was just too tight. In the end I had to use a hammer to bang the two together, and I probably will never be able to separate them again. I'll probably have to remove the collar from my bike if I ever want to remove the trailer. Poor manufacture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"Easy to put together. My daughter loves riding behind and feeling like a \\"big\\" girl on her wee.It will be a fun and hassle free summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyers remorse for valid reasons","review":"I should have known when two of the screws were not the right size to send this back. Instead I replaced them at the hardware store and assumed all was well. I've had two issues with the tandem since. The bracket that attaches to the adult bike seat post has come loose on us twice...both times resulting in minor crashes in which the tandem, on even wide turns, essentially falls sidewasy halfway to the pavement. We've learned that we can use the tandem only if we tighten the bracket before each and every outing. That, however, leads me to the second point...my son is rightfully reluctant to go for a ride...exactly the opposite of what this product should be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't trust this rack","review":"I almost lost my boat on the highway with this rack. I have a 12 1/2' flat water kayak. I was driving through a storm with a lot of cross wind. In addition an 18 wheeler was coming in the opposite direction. It is a 2 lane highway. The combination of wind forces bent the forward hull raiser stand and partially freed the front of my kayak. It was displaced about 1 foot. I immediately pulled over. (No following traffic fortunately.) I bent the stand back and tied down the boat again.Now when I use this platform, it is still a little bent and I don't have complete faith in it. I always make sure the tie downs are very tight, but the boat tends to wiggle more now.I'm going to replace it with a Thule that allows the boat to lie flat in its horizontal plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets the job done","review":"Shopped around and Amazon had the best price on these. Lots of plastic on these be careful tightening the screws. Good cradle design, easy to use but no way to lock them to your rack unless maybe a cable type lock, I won't feel comfortable leaving them on in some of the out of the way places I park to launch for a day or more. Kinda time consuming to install and remove from vehicle I was expecting a clamp system like other Yakima products but it's not, lots of parts that could be dropped and get lost in the installation process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Fits perfect on my '05 Explorer bars. Easy to mount, robust hardware, and holds kayaks securely. Can load and secure kayaks by myself. Tightening knobs a little close to rack body - knuckle scraper. However, just a minor annoyance. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, information is valuable in all aspects of life.","review":"This was a very informative and a very simple read. In a nutshell, it defines how important solitude is in terms of how we can't get caught up impressing life judges.

Also, to deal with the challenges which God applies for you, only to make youself stronger.I find it amazing that he could put all this very enlighting material into this very short read.

Tries to come off all 'rock catharsis' but ends up very bland. you've heard these cliches before. Production could have been better. Guitars have that paper bag quality.

The definitions are very vague and short. Although it was affordable, I didn't use this book much and I found that Taber's Medical dictionary had much better definitions of words.

So, if you plan to stay on the trail for a week doing the whole Rim around the Lake, that's one thing. But if you go on a day hike or want to get off the Rim trail, the map will not give you any idea where to go, what the distance is, and what options you have.I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful!","review":"The map is just what it says it is - a map of the Tahoe Rim Trail. It is configured to give trail distance, changes of elevation, camp sites, water sources, trail junctions and crossings. All of this comes in a compact, waterproof package perfect for taking on the trail. If one needs maps of other routes, e.g., ones that include segments of other trails in addition to the Tahoe Rim, then one needs one or more other maps.

If only half her tales are true of criminals and street people targeting tourists, I wouldn't want to go there, even for a day on the beach. According to Britt and her friends, the producers of the TV series Miami Vice (not actually named) spent millions upgrading dilapidated neighborhoods to make their level of degradation believable for TV audiences. In this stew of crime, heat, poverty, and traffic congestion, Britt uncovers evidence of racially-based police brutality. Pursuing such a story not only would sour her crucial relationship with the police, it potentially could divide the city. It's a trendy story, briskly written to pull the reader along. I couldn't say, however, that it stands out from the crowd of books featuring feisty single women, whose lives are full of people under 40. I listened to the recorded book, ably read by Donada Peters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime Beat Reporter","review":"Edna Buchanan introduces readers to an intrepid protagonist in the persona of Britt Montero.

You see three kids in it with plenty of room to move around, but in fact the picture is totaly a lie!What a piece of junk. The pool first of all is made out of the same plastic that a beach ball is made from so right off the bat you know that this pool will not last for more than a few uses.Then once the pool is filled up, the side walls dont have the strength to contain the water and keep its shape.The pool is so small! No way can three \\"big\\" kids fit in this thing and have fun! My two kids had standing room only.To top it all off, the pool only lasted for three days! I tryed to patch it with the enclosed patch with no success. We just ended up putting it out with the trash.Dont wast your money, it looks cool, but it's junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Not worth the hassle or the money. The slide is not stable so kids don't enjoy it. The part of the slide that is outside the pool doesn't stay on the ground.The sides may droop even though they are fully inflated. I didn't find any leaks so I think it's a design flaw. The cannon is OK but just remember that someone will be turning the hose and on and off to keep from wasting too much water. The four and five year old got bored after about a half hour or so.If you really want one, I suggest you purchase a Coleman Rechargeable Quick Pump. It takes about a half hour to inflate everything in the pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but flawed and not worth the $$$$$","review":"This looks great but has many design flaws. The mast flops over no matter how much air is in it. The slide has no steps and is very unstable, ny son was terrified of it and I had to remove it. It is made of very thin plastic and will not last long and already had a hole in it out of the box. I got the bigger version but it still isn't that big, I would hate to see the smaller one.

He played in it a couple times, literaly, & he had fun. He loved the fact tht it had a wheel to steer. I stored it properly in the garage over winter making sure nothing could/would poke it. I pulled it out a month ago & there was a leak somewhere in the top circle of the boat which helps support everything else.I have also come across some other people who have bought Banzai pools that have had the same problem from one summer to the next when pulling it out of the garage after just one winter.

I was hoping for more of the same swamp soul-blues and acoustic funk, but what I got was a tighter sound, more electric instruments, and a bit of a bigger sound. It wasn't the mellow, down-home, sloppy acoustic groove that I wanted. However, it has grown on me quite a bit, and I can now appreciate the brilliance. The key to Mofro's music is the effective use of space. No matter how many instruments there are, and no matter how big the sound gets, J.J. makes sure that the musicians don't step on each others' toes, and that they leave plenty of space between the notes. I wish more musicians would take that lesson because it is the essence of the swamp funk/blues groove that has become one of my favorite styles.For further listening, see my review of Lochloosa. In addition, the more aggressive sound of this album brings to mind a recent gem by Black Joe Lewis & The Honeybears."},{"rating":"2","title":"New discovery for me.

The plaintive lessons of man who realizes what a woman wants, just a little bit too late, are universal.Country Ghetto and Free are a bit too freeform, although here they show the breath of their talent. Blues gives way to Funk and Swamp Rock. There is a bit of Jerry Lee Lewis honky tonk piano and 60's style tambourine that drones in the background.This is on a previous album, but one of my favorites. In \\"Fireflies\\" we get back to what works best for me. A thoughtful southern ballad. Where do the fireflies go?

Literally dozens of boring characters compete to be the least interesting, while the overall 'plot' (if you can call it that) finally emerges in the last section of the book to be about as exciting as your local weatherman harping about hurricane swells.Do yourself a favor and skip this totally forgettable travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Great product but the glue with it does not stick so i had to use another glue.

Lightfoot, a unicorn endangered by hunters as well as the other unicorns, joins her in this quest to reach the queen, along with some loving, and sometimes, quite humorous friends like the Dimblethum, the Squijumm, and others you will encouter in this book. Bruce Colville, is the talented writer of this book. He wraps together the traditional myths of unicorns into this fun, exciting story. The ending is very mysterious and suspenceful, leaving you wanting and wanting the next in the series! I highly recommend this book to unicorn and fantacy lovers of any age!

When the final book came out I was just roaming around the book store, and since my copy of In to the Land of Unicorns had been damaged in a move, I spotted the missing part of my collection! I was so happy. I fell in love with the world Bruce Coville wrote. I was 18 when I found the satisfaction of knowing what happened. Nine years of waiting and it was well worth it!

This book has no surprises but one, a \\"plot twist\\" that was obvious 6 chapters away. Did I mention I hate the annoying, underdeveloped, characters. Oh yes.

The story of a young girl traveling thruogh dangerous areas to save her grandmother's life makes the story excellent to read over and over. Each time a chapter ends you wonder what will happen next so you keep going until you have to stop. At the ending of the story you just want to scream because the next step in the story takes place in the next book. When I got this book the front cover says fairy tale.

His latest CD, Psychedelic Underground, is incredible. He has matured to a level most musicians will never reach, even though (hopefully) he hasn't neared his prime.

It is a real eye opener to the sex slave trade. I really thought that this was something of the past but there are still organizations battling these inhumane activities.

As the movie plays on and takes you deeper and deeper into the dark and horrid world of human trafficing, you can't do anything but feel helpless, scared, and horrified. This is as shocking as it comes and for those ignorant to the subject, as I was, this movie will open your eyes and will start you asking how safe are you really and how safe are the innocent children around you. They could be gone tomorrow. All for money. Get it. Watch it. Pass it on to people you know. And talk about it. Light must be shed on the darkest reaches of this world if we are to ever stop the monstrous actions found in Human Trafficing.

Can't figure it out? Neither can I, there are some rarely glimmers of light in the many stories in this film but it lacks the gravity because it's so disjointed. Nothing against Mira Sorvino but would you really expect a victim of childhood sexual assault to be so calm and seemingly unruffled through the movie? Or that a goon wouldn't recognize her from a surveillance attempt? Nothing against the actress but I would say that Donald Sutherland eclipses her in believability and his interrogation is pathetic. You'll get better questioning watching Law & Order. So while it may be a decent attempt, on the psychological, emotional heavy hitting material side of things - HT sadly misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera","review":"The international traffic in human beings is a disgrace as is this movie.

It is a simple but beautiful story that manages to convey the power of family and hope alongside of scientific technology and discovery that anyone can understand. Kids and adults will identify with the excitement and heartbreak of having to leave one's homeland with only a few possessions. The theme of having to leave one's homeland in the first place is full of eagerness, but also sorrow.The descriptions of the planet Shine are perfectly drawn, enough for us to picture it but not overkill. The discovery of the rock people is excellent, reminding the reader of all the strange and wonderful beings that could be out there.

It is not easy to write with the honesty of emotion that Stutman does: somehow these poems are raw with devastation and with the hope and rough terrain of reclaimation, and yet not overwhelming. An excellent book, I would think, to give as a gift or to share with a friend who wants to understand. Sometimes her simplest poems are the most powerful; the silence of stark paper surrounding a mending poem gives it shape.

It's been a long time since any photographer has \\"transplaced\\" me so successfully. His pictures (part August Sander and part (no offense intended) Diane Arbus) are funny, sexy, nostalgic, and almost heroic. Most importantly for me, they are fun to look at, and reflect a western PA sensibility which combines an innocent obsession (Smalley's--I've heard that he worked on these pictures for thirteen years) and old fashioned work ethic (both Smalley's and that of his many young models--who don't usually appear to be having a great time). It is endlessly entertaining to find something so familiar, and for some reason ,so comforting, in a scene so totally based on imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"One amazing collection of work","review":"I just received my copy of \\"Gymnasium\\" and let me tell you it is worth every penny. Luke Smalley has taken and put together an incredible series of photos demonstrating youth at it's best.

Picking it up 6 years later, however, I realize how much is missing. I re-read the first chapter on Easter Island, and wondered, \\"where is the account of disease?\\" Contrary to Ponting's claims, the Easter Island civilization did NOT collapse as a result of over-use of resources! In fact, it recovered from this mistake, only to be devastated by syphilis and small pox, brought by the Europeans.Instead of using Easter Island as a warning to the rest of the world, Ponting should use it as a message of hope. If Easter Islanders could recover from severe resource degradation- so could we. The key is recognizing the problem in time and working actively to resolve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete facts, needs an editor, cant stay on subject","review":"man abuses our environmentthere, now you dont have to sit throug 400 pages of ranting about how statistics are proving we destroy our environment.

This is a thorough and interesting study of how humans have changed or damaged their natural surroundings from the earliest hunter-gatherer days through the modern post-Industrial world. It seems that any modification of the environment has unintended and unexpected consequences down the road. Of course in the past few had the time or the vision to anticipate these consequences, and we are now living with the results of centuries of pollution, salinization, and general degradation. This is not a polemic but a well-argued study which asks us to consider whether our effect on the natural world has been more for good or ill. It is a good precursor to ideas later developed further in Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Haven't finished it yet. But I did stop in wonder for a good long while when I read that Plato (PLATO!) had given a good long description of the deforestation and erosion of Greece.It covers more ground than the (similar point of view and many years later) Jared Diamond Collapse. For instance, in a later chapter that I skimmed early on, he talks about epidemics and sickness. Our best health care in the world, in Ponting's view, is mostly following, not altogether successfully, in the footsteps of basic sanitation--i.e., public health and nutrition trump treatment for disease.I expect that I don't, and won't as I continue to read, agree with everything he says.

On the contrary, it's very enjoyable and filled with nice touches of humour, not to mention memorable scenes such as the sinister android version of Sarah, the return of (most of) UNIT, good location work, the rhino-faced aliens and the plan to replace human beings with mechanicals. Don't expect a classic adventure on the same level as 'Pyramids of Mars' or 'Genesis of the Daleks', but you won't be disappointed either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the Candy-man and the 6th Doctor put together!","review":"I don't remember this tale being funny or original. I never thought I'd say this about Doctor Who, but what a bunch of pants! When I placed this along side my other Doctor Who videos, they started to turn green! Memorable only for the Sarah-Jane's googlie-eyed android doppelganger! Otherwise instantly forgettable. Besides the bad taste that is.Sorry Tom. (and he's usually so good!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect combination of information and wit!","review":"Venus Revealed is a very well written book covering a wide variety of topics on Venus. I would recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the planet. Grinspoon is an all too rare author who can provide enough scientific detail to be informative in a book that is a pleasure to read. I appreciated his wit and writing style. Astronomy books are my favorite subjects, but too many of them are so dry that is takes some effort to get through them. Dr. Grinspoon, please don't stop with this one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, exciting - worth the time","review":"Books like these let the public participate in science data gathered and analyzed by NASA. Here the author has simply and clearly presented the known facts about Venus (and it is quite a revelation at times). Do read it - and participate in planetary exploration, from your arm chair"},{"rating":"2","title":"Venus Revealed: Good Science, Bad Jokes","review":"'Venus Revealed' gives a good summary of what we know, what we might find out, and what we thought we knew about Venus. The book contains enough solid, meaty science for the knowledgable reader and enough basic background to let the less knowledgable keep up. But the author works too hard at keeping it fast and funny. About the middle of chapter two he discovers that footnotes can be used for comedy asides and wisecracks. This gimmick is only funny the first hundred times. Mercifully, the jokes die down near the middle of the book. Maybe the author regained his own interest in the topic. A good book, with a lot ofhard data on Venus in easy-to-read form, but I recommend skipping the footnotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"full circle","review":"I enjoyed this book just as much as Class Reunion. In fact, Class Reunion should have just been one big book. This book brings things full circle. The girls meet up again and become actual friends as they had started out as in Class Reunion. At the end, I kept wanting more pages b/c I wanted to know what happened to them. (I'd convinced myself on the last page that I saw more text and was disappointed when there wasn't more!) Everyone's \\"second\\" life seemed to be working for them and they seemed to be happy.

Now 25 years after four girls have graduated from Radcliffe, they reconnect throughout the book, each with lives of happiness, betrayals, secrets and as you watch them create their goals, you're \\"pulling\\" for each one of them.

A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A better-than-average collection of his hits at a nice price.","review":"For the uninitiated, this budget-priced compilation of Freddie Jackson's big hits provides a decent introduction. Freddie Jackson was one of the most popular Soul balladeers of the 1980s and '90s (second only to Luther Vandross) and his five Capitol CDs are chock-full of smooth and romantic ballads which remain timeless to this day.

Some of the dead in this book can drive cars and function almost normally, but others are less intelligent and have hard times doing basic tasks. The whole scenario of a comet passing over and killing the immune system of the living and bringing the dead back to life was really cool but it wasn't totally original. Watch the movie NIGHT OF THE COMET and you will know what I am talking about. The book was a little short and very bleak at the end. It leaves no hope for humanities survival, but a great book all in all. I recommend this book highly but only 4 out of 5 to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read of past times","review":"I like this book because of all things the introduction was great.

The book is just a retread opf stuff I got on the History channel. The historic Tepes was butchered for commerial print in novels and films, lasting even into the 2000s.

Backus exposes lies that we believe in about ourselves and others and makes a way for the Holy Spirit to bring change. I am now so much more aware of how easy it is for me to fall into manipulation (based on fears and lack of trust in God) instead of simply speaking the truth.

They are often quoted in the New Testament and seem at once to be beautiful and confounding. C.S. Lewis approaches these works in a way that may seem sacrilegious to some. But for, his honesty and insights came shining through. I will never read them again without thinking more deeply, smiling at his analogies and feeling a greater connection to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lewis' work is great, but the book is too expensive","review":"As in the title, this work of Lewis is great. His reflections on the Psalms are challenging to the serious Christian. It deserves five stars.I have rated it poorly because of the printing of the volume. Even with the discount from Amazon.com, this book is WAY too expensive. Harvest Books simply issued an earlier printing. They did not bother to re-set the type, fix minor typographical errors, and publish it as their own book. The effect is that they bound a photocopy. What is more, they printed it on cheap paper that readily tears.If you're looking for a bound photocopy of a great work, then this is the book to buy. Otherwise, save your money - go to your local library and make your own photocopies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dodgy!","review":"I didn't get very far with this book because his ideas were so dodgy!When talking about the imprecatory Psalms he described the imprecations as devilish and sin on the part of the Psalmists. I decided I'd give him a chance to redeem himself with the rest of the book and read on.In the next chapter he went on to say the Psalmists did not believe in life after death. After reading this I had had enough.If you're looking for enlightenment on the Psalms, keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavily colored by higher criticism","review":"Most of the time I love C. S. Lewis. Even when I disagree with him he provides food for thought. However, I was cringing through most of this book. Lewis did not hold an especially \\"high\\" view of Scripture, and his belief in dynamic inspiration (the Bible contains divine truth, but is by no means free of human errors) is very much on display in this book. He also accepts ideas derived from higher criticism in how he describes the development of the Jewish religion, the mechanics of typeology in the messianic Psalms, etc.The chapter on praise was excellent and though-provoking, but that and the introduction were the only parts of the book that I found to be worth reading. The assumption of an error-prone Bible and quasi-pagan Jewish religious development heavily color the exposition in most other parts of the book. If you believe the whole Bible to be equally the Word of God, this book probably isn't worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's try this...","review":"If you think H.I.M. are a bunch of MTV goth posers and real goth music is Christian Death, Paradise Lost, Type O Negative, My Dying Bride, or Candlemass click \\"yes\\".If you think that H.I.M. are \\"da freekin bestest gawth band eva!!!!!\\" along with Evanescence and My Chemical Romance and those awesome bands are posers click \\"no\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nosferatu, Switchblade Symphony, H.I.M.","review":"Yet another band to add to your cheezy goth rock collection.

I'm glad I did, HIM's music is melodic and powerful, and is a thrill to listen to and the band's version of Chris Issac's \\"Wicked Games\\" is downright spectacular. It's a shame the band is so little-known and under appreciated, or we might have seen and heard much more of them. \\"Razorblade Romance' is really a once-in-a-lifetime CD and I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciate fine rock and alternative.

I love the lyrics in the song, they're very deap.6. Wicked Game: i liked it when chris Isaak did it, and i love it even more now that HIM has done it.

The music is rocky, yet melodic, the vocals are BEAUTIFUL, the lyrics are a little simplistic maybe, but darkly melancholically appealing none-the-less (and when you consider that it's not the writer's first language...). I have become completely addicted to this band, so this album needs a warning sticker attached - if you do buy it, be prepared to find yourself hunting high and low for everything of HIM's you can get your grubby mits on, and unless you're in Germany or Finland, that isn't likely to be much.

Not the most groundbreaking band around, HIM still manages to produce very catchy tunes that will stick in your head for quite some time.The songs are structured around basic guitar riffs and also some keyboards. Singer Ville Valo has a decent deep voice and sells the songs very well. The lyrical content is women, love and death - similar to Type O Negative. Strange in some way, it works well with the music and is entertaining.This album has that something about it - energy, charisma, strong melody, no fake angst, no senseless yelling. All the things that todays rock lacks.I recommend this album to all fans of rock music who want something different and fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I don't have much time to listen to new music while I'm at school, but after hearing \\"Right Here In My Arms\\" on CKY3, my interested was piqued, and I downloaded a few songs.

I mean what type of a guy would dress like a metro sexual, sing girly emotional tripe and pass that on as music.

H.I.M. must stand for Horrible Idiotic Music because it sounds like the worst noise imaginable. Imagine a dump truck backing up at 7am with the \\"beep beep beep\\" noise topped off with dragging a metal dumpster along the asphalt, just grinding away what's left of your ears and giving you a headache. That's what HIM sounds like.Wake up kiddies and teeny boppers, just because you love Bam Margera doesn't mean you have to love his favorite band too! THINK FOR YOURSELF! This music is HORRIBLE!

Lovemetal? Give me a break. The cover of Chris Isaak's \\"Wicked Game\\" isn't too bad, but the rest of the songs sound so much alike it's laughable, and the recurring themes of goth love, razorblades, depression, etc. are enough to make trendy goth girls swoon. Outfits like Nine Inch Nails, Type O Negative, and even early Stabbing Westward has done this type of thing much, much better.

Nothing is left for the reader to infer on his/her own, and the generalizations punctuating the text are neither insightful nor amusing enough to warrent the interruption. The \\"I'm just telling you what happened\\" narration doesn't work because Rosalie's boring voice adds nothing to compensate for the clutter of casual prose.I'm not quite sure what the point of the girls' letters were. As chapter frames go they were pretty obvious, and didn't fit with the plot.As a character, Rosalie is neither complex enough to make the novel serious or funny enough to make it, well, funny. She describes herself as average, and does nothing to show us otherwise.In Delbanco's favour is that her writing is controlled, her plot basically interesting, and that she has plenty of time to improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!

I've since bought reinforcment circles from an office store but am thinking that I should just move on.The other bad design is the recording device. As you're trying to learn how to work the recorder, it's very easy to \\"accidently\\" record but there is no simple way (or at least not that I could find) to erase what you recorded.

I even googled some of the women in the book to make sure they were truly \\"skinny\\". Since i bought this book (20 weeks ago), i've lost 30 lbs (that's a fifth of me gone!). I would definately recommend this book!!! In fact, my sister just came home from college with an extra 20 lbs so she's borrowing the book right now!

But I was terribly disappointed with this one. It looked pretty good out of the box for this purpose. But then several strings started breaking. Ok, cheap strings, easily replaced. But now some of the hardware started coming out, the screws on the tuning brackets, and I could see that the bridge had sharp edges that was causing the broken strings. As I started to look this instrument over carefully I just decided to not take a further chance on it before the return time ran out.

Once I opened the box it was deemed unreturnable, even though there were manufacturer problems with it.

Amazon claims it is originally 160.00 and is a 80% price deduction but this remains to be seen. I bought this as my first instrument which is fine because I knew nothing about playing music or the sound it should produce. It is very flat, and no matter what, you can't get it to tune. I have tried 2 sets of strings and it sounds okay with a good set od daddario's. I would however reccomend the 39.99 or 49.99 mandolins on amazon. They sound like real mandolins and are generally well built for the price and for 10$ more its a huge advancement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource for parents","review":"A handy book.

Spending more for cables will get you things like gold plated contacts that will not corrode or larger cable diameter for sturdiness, if that's what you think you need.

So I went online looking for a replacement, not wanting to pay the outrageous prices at department stores, and I found this. First impressions were: Ok, its 3 bucks. It probably doesn't have the best quality. But it got good reviews, and hey, It was only 3 bucks so why not? So after ordering expedited shipping, it got to my house within 2 days and it it was great. The picture and sound are crystal clear, and so far, its very reliable. And for only 3 dollars!? Amazing! So I would recommend this to a friend anyday. Wonderful buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great deal!","review":"I just purchased this exact same cable at Target for $39.99 + tax.

Well you've now come across the perfect product for your needs. Don't pay those outrageous prices for something else that will do the same thing. I was skeptical about this too when I read the reviews but worry not, this is a steal and will work perfectly.Luckily if you're a Playstation 3 owner you no longer have to purchase a special PS3 compatible cable as you would have done on the older PS and PS2 systems. This cable will work with your PS3 as well as any Blu-Ray player or anything with HDMI output.So if you need an HDMI cable now or will be in the market for a new HDTV soon go ahead and grab one of these because when you're at the store the sales person will pressure you into an expensive cable.

I have a couple of small nephews who come over to my place pretty often, and I might have to return this.

I still remember how terrible this movie was. I only tolerated seeing it because I was with my friends. Besides the extensively long, boring intro...and the slow development of the plot, which couldn't have been more than five sentences long, this movie was ultimately predictable. There was maybe one twist.However, if you are a fan of Kevin Bacon or any other actors/actresses in this film, I have some good things to say about this film. the acting is not bad. I won't say that it was good, but I won't say that it was bad. Second, the special effects in this movie are very good, actually I'd say that they were excellent.This does not mean that I recommend the film.

A subject which opens doors to a lot of possibilities, ethical ones, humouristic ones, etc. The makers of this film do not succeed in digging into any of those. In fact, I doubt they're even trying. Instead, they drown the subject in a film which is basicly about special effects, voyeurism, a ridiculous jealousy story, and unnecessary, unexplained evil and violence.Furthermore, Hollow Man is so packed with obvious movie mistakes that you don't even have to look for them; you will be annoyed anyway.A poor performace. What a shame, 'cause it starts out interesting... and ends up just being ridiculous and a useless waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin and shallow","review":"Although the special effects are very impressive, thats all there really is to this film.

Amazing special effects couldn't save this movie from a bad plot and a horrible ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Then again any thing with Kevin Bacon usually means it sucks. This wasn't scary, suspenseful, and doesn't deliver on any level. Acting stinx, plot is hackneyed and boring, this makes Halloween Ressurection look like cinematic art. This has no room on this planet. So much time you could spend doing other things than watching an atrocious film like this. See something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE CELLULOID","review":"Where do I begin to explain what is wrong with this film? The only decent part is Josh Brolin. Kevin Bacon has never done much for me, and he is positively diabolical and egotistical in this role. He does spend most of the time in this film as an invisible man, which is good, but overall the concept of making a man invisible and his going crazy while invisible is not very interesting. Elisabeth Shue has become a progressively worse actress since her Oscar nominated performance in Leaving Las Vegas. It is as though she thinks if she acts powerful and overly sexual she will be a better actress, but it all seems forced and very contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"The special effects made the entire movie","review":"Yup, thats right, the special effects were the only good thing about this movie. They were phenominal the way the made Kevin Bacon and the other animals disapear so seemlessly. However, the story became highly unbelievable once Kevin Bacon became invisible. Like the part towards the end when he and Elizabeth Shue were in the elevator....I mean come on! And when Elizabeth tried to patch up Josh Brolins wounds with duct tape! The first, 45 minutes of this movie were good, but after that, I began to get fidgety in the theater and lost interest quickly.

Instead from Paul Verhoeven we get an invisible man that's ...[aroused]... As a man I can't say I didn't enjoy those scenes \\"lol\\" but you would think a movie with such great effects and a good cast would have a better script.Elisabeth Shue is beautiful, there's no doubt about it, ...she's hard to take serious as a scientist. Kevin Bacon makes a taunting and chilling invisible man but just like Shue he's not really believable as the brainy type. In fact it's only Josh Brolin and Kim Dickens that are the only ones who look like they belong there. ...Hollow Man is a gory B-Movie with fun special effects and although I have mixed feelings for it, I recommend it because it's still mildly entertaining. Still it could have been much, much more though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better...","review":"The Hollow Man has a great premise but fails to do anything with it. Kevin Bacon is a research scientist for the government who has discovered how to make himself invisible. This movie could have focused a lot on what Bacon does when he is invisible. Instead he gets out for one night, but spends most of his time in the lab. Also, since Bacon is invisible most of the time, we just hear is voice. For all we know, that isn't even him when he is wearing a mask. The final fight in the lab is pretty exciting, but also pretty predictable. This movie would have been better if it had been set outside of the lab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, couldn't believe it....bad, bad, good.","review":"Bad acting. Bad story. Good special effects.

The trailer made the special effects look incredible, and they were. The one thing that i had trouble believing was the actors of this film. Sure Kevin \\"I don't like pants\\" Bacon can pull of being invisible, but Elizabeth Shue being an action hero, very hard to believe. She looks like she should be in one of those tear inducing Nora Ephron movies, not having to face the invisible man. Joey Slotnick, who we all remember from the sitcom 'The Single Guy' is great in the film, as he is everywhere. But where was he in the film. He had about 7 minutes of screen time. Let him, a real actor battle invisible Kevin. A little note to Kevin Bacon: Just because you like to be naked, does not mean that everyone in this country likes you naked. Buy some invisible pants and keep them on buddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie is Hollow,Man!","review":"Have you ever had the feeling that the movie's trailer was better than the movie?Well Hollow Man is one of them.The promos made it look like a cool sci-fi thiller,but instead it was B-grade horror/slasher trash dressed up with grade-A special effects.Don't get me wrong;I can suspend disbelief and enjoy mindless entertainment,but the bad acting and ludicrous scenarios(once the pet project's leader makes himself invisible,what does he do?He fondles and rapes woman.What class!)in this flick made this eye-candy buff sleepy.Had it been made with soild,well-written script and a different cast,it could have been killer.As it is,unfortunately,Hollow Man is last year's most disappointing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriuging Premise Wasted","review":"Paul Verhoven could have made a much better movie out of this material. This time he seems to sabotage his own movie about half an hour in. Sure the SFX are good, but they serve the same old formula. That being said, Kevin Bacon turns in his usually good performance. In this film he's acting better than Verhoven is directing. \\"Stir of Echoes\\" is much more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Movie","review":"I was really dissapointed in this movie. It had an interesting plot - but the acting was terrible and Kevin Bacon seemed more obsessed with looking under skirts than anything. The ending was really bizzare where the ingenious Dr. goes nuts and starts to kill everyone just because he can't have his babe. I thought this movie might be appealing to my 13 year old son - but even he thought it was crap. Some of the special effects were interesting - but Bacon should be embarrased to have even done this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was terrible!","review":"This movie looked pretty good in the previews, but believe me, it was bad! The story line was one of the worst I've ever seen, the characters were totally unbelievable and it wasn't even scarry, not at all.

How can you dislike such a great villain! The effects don't take over the plot and the music by Jerry Goldsmith is chilling. The only thing I didn't like was the ending (spoiler warning!): I was cheering for Sebastian all the way and was hoping he'd get away with his plans. Poor bad guy, he didn't make it. :( Maybe he'll be resurrected in another experiment, though ;)))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get away from her!!!!","review":"Get some friends, a bowl of popcorn, and a comfy couch and sit back and watch a group of people be so incredibly stupid over and over and over and over again that it's mind boggilingly hysterical!!! The best line of the movie is when the current boyfriend hits the invisible guy (the ex-boyfriend) and says \\"Get away from her!!\\" Because let's face it folks....if you were a serial killer I'm sure you'd think twice about chasing down a guy who makes angry idol threats while pointing a shameful finger at you. Yup...go home and cry because he just put you in your place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much to the Hollow Man","review":"When I began watching this movie I didn't expect much. And through the beginning of it, I actually kind of liked it. Mainly it was due to the great special effects. It was interesting to watch an ape/gorilla reappear from nothingness. And it was also neat to watch Kevin Bacon dissapear. But after that, the movie goes from bad to worst to just plain stupid. The story was lame and the dialouge (what little there was) seemed forced. I like Kevin Bacon quite a bit. And I think he can play a bad guy pretty well, but in this roll he isn't even there, literally. I don't really know what this movie was trying to accomplish, but it sure didn't live up to it's expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like someone had a brain fart...","review":"I took my friend Shannon to see this movie, and boy, was I disappointed. This movie had no plot, talent, or scares. I was absolutely disgusted at the violence towards the animals in this movie. And how many times can we re-use the whole \\"Invisible Man\\" plot? I guess I shouldn't have expected much, being that Paul Verhoeven brought us \\"Showgirls.\\" The movie would have been a lot better if Kevin Bacon had caused some mischief to kind of lighten up the movie, instead of just raping and killing people. The only reason that I gave \\"Hollow Man\\" 2 stars instead of one, is because of the awesome special effects. It's sad that they had to be in such a flat, boring, superficial turd of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a huge Kevin Bacon fan, I was eagerly anticipating this movie. I was so disappointed at the waste of such great special effects. And yes, Kevin, keep your pants on! Don't get me wrong, I like a good horror movie. But the way the invisible guy set out to rape the neighbor, without any hesitation, was pretty sickening. I don't agree with the other review that stated this movie shows what a \\"real\\" person would be doing if they found themselves invisible. \\"Normal\\" men aren't just waiting for the opportunity to get away with raping a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Weak","review":"I understand that people in horror movies are supposed to be stupid, but come on! These are Scientist. Not some stupid 18yo's in Scream. The other part of the film would be Kevin Bacon's character. If I could be invisible. I would permanently be out and about scaring people and purving out. Not wasting my time in a dungeon full of idiotic scientist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually like Kevin Bacon movies","review":"I really do like most of Kevin Bacon's movies-but not this time. The \\"science\\" is insipid-his invisible eyelids can't block the light, but his invisible retina can form an image from his invisible iris. And duct tape is put to marvelous use in this movie as well-enabling a man who has a hole punched in his abdomen by a crowbar to hang from a ladder by one arm while holding his girlfriend with the other. It's also hard to see why Kevin Bacons character becomes nearly invincible once he becomes invisible. The acting if okay in this movie--it's the writers who failed miserably. Ths movie also has several scenes which seem to be there merely to appeal to deviants. I borrowed this dvd to watch it-and I still felt ripped off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Man - A Hollow movie","review":"I really expected more from this film. After watching this movie, you sit back and wonder why didn't they just add a plot to this whole movie? This movie could have been made with much more creativity. The special effects were good but not having any real plot made it disappointing to watch. They left too many parts open with no resolution. What happened to the neighbor? What happened after the guy was drowned in the pool? Didn't the commity get suspisous? What happened all the times that Kevin Bacon left the lab?RP"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Improvement","review":"This film was a major disappointment! I actually wanted the villian to win for once! I was convinced it was good due to the hype the advertisements made it out to be. But boy was I wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Crap!","review":"It took forever to get to any action and by the time it did, I had already given up on the movie. I did manage to sit through the rest while my girlfriend fell asleep because of all of the action. The movie did pick up and had some decent action scenes, but it was too late. Bad choice for Mr. Bacon and Ms. Shue. Anyone for Footloose II?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow man left me hollow","review":"A new twist on the Invisible Man is what I expected when I saw the advertisements for the movie. The plot started out good enough, Kevin Bacon's character, a know it all scientist, has come up with a solution that can turn lab animals invisible. Being the pompus scientict that he is, Bacon's character decides to test the formula on himself and things go straight to hell from there. The special effects were awesome, but the lackluster, sucky (there is NO other word for it) plot made the effort seem waster. In reality I would give the special effects 5 stars and the plot minus 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Trash","review":"When I saw the preview to this movie I was blown away by the special effects and couldn't wait to see the picture. Little did I realize I had fallen into the typical hollywood trap thats used to lure audiences to bad, bad movies. Just like the Phantom Menace the film starts out with ground breaking special effects that lead to a dense script with foolish, laughable characters. Kevin Bacon's character is invisble but still manages to get his butt kicked by Eliizebeth Shoe who, seems to be forever typecast in dumb-blond, airhead roles for the rest of her life. Forget buying this movie it isn't even worh a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror Movie Junk","review":"Seems Hollywood has really ran out of good ideas for horror movies. They seemed to have found some really useful junk in \\"Hollow Man\\", my pick as worst movie of the year 2000. The story is quite nice, starting out, but as Bacon starts to fry up and burn, so does the movie. Really neat-o special-effects try their hardest to save this truck load of invisible crap, but never quite makes up for its tastes in nudity, violence, and stupidity. Give us Chevy Chase again! No, that was a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thoroughly nasty piece of work","review":"What would you do if you were invisible? Play pranks? Sit in on secret meetings and change the course of history? If you were the Kevin Bacon character in this movie, all you would do is commit sexual assault and then kill as many of your colleagues as possible. That's the extent to which the impoverished imagination behind this movie takes the concept. Throw in a few gallons of blood and the usual explosions, and you've got a typical Hollywood \\"thriller\\", but one with an underlying nastiness that makes this movie more offensive than entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Two Hours","review":"At first Hollow Man seemed like it was going to be a good movie. Then it got kind of stupid towards the end. I had kind of enjoyed it until the invisible guy gets tourched and then blown up, and lives. Just because he is invisable doesn't mean he is invincible. It was entertaining until it started to get rediculus. That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential","review":"At least the producers never pretended that this film was anything more than it was -- a showcase for stunning digital effects. The script is weak, the actors seem a bit lost, and the pacing is downright awful -- Bacon goes arrogant, driven scientist to homicidal maniac in one reel. And how many times do we have to watch the ensemble good guys get picked off, one by one, by the \\"monster?\\" I would like to have seen more of Bacon's temptations with power, wandering the streets of Washington and spreading mischief; this angle was handled much more adroitly by HG Wells over 100 years ago..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, Not good either...","review":"Okay, I rented this movie because I'm a major sci-fi horror fan, and about five minutes into the movie I was ready to burn the thing! It's awful! FXs are good, and that's the only thing that's good. Bacon's performance is terrible; the plot is dry, old, over-done, and WAY too predictable! This makes its way to number 3 on my top ten WORST films list, and it's BAD! The acting is bad, the story is bad, the usage of the \\"F\\" word makes even the roughest of sailors want to keel over dead, and the gratuities nudity is disgusting! DO NOT BUY OR RENT! And if you own it, BURN IT! This is simply a good B movie gone bad F- movi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good special effects......","review":"Nothing more. The story was a little dry and predictable...Kevin Bacon is one of my favorite actors. He should have pushed harder for a better story....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil Wins","review":"In real life good and evil are not completely black or white but colored in shades of grey. Kevin Bacon's character was a \\"good guy\\" but his scientific ego made him slightly grey along with the others on his staff. After their invisibility experiment worked on him, he went insane and was definitely in the black (evil) zone.Still, it was hard not to feel sorry for him given there were a couple of scientists more evil than he was. They were not only on scientific ego trips but decided to treat him as a lab rat.This movie was nauseating because the less evil scientists all die and the most evil scientists live. At least Bacon could claim insanity as a reason for his evilness."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUSY! HORRIBLE!","review":"SOME OF THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT. THE CHARACTER IS SUPPOSED TO BE INVISIBLE. FOR SOME REASON THEY DECIDED TO SHOW THE GUYS PACKAGE CONTINUOSLY DURING THE MOVIE. GIVE ME A BREAK. I DID NOT WATCH THIS TO SEE AN OUTLINE OF KEVIN BACON'S PRIVATE PARTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Bacon is no Claude Rains.","review":"The one and only reason I gave this movie two stars is because it has great special effects, although Universal Pictures' The Invisible Man, staring Claude Rains, from 1933 invented the type of effects used in this film.From start to finnish, Hollow Man plays as nothing more...nothing less then an Invisible Man rip-off.If you want to watch a film about a mad scientist who turns himself invisible, skip this bad rip-off, and watch The Invisible Man (1933)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheezy rape fantasy...","review":"I think the movie should've been titled either \\"Sorrow Man\\" or \\"Jealousy Woes\\". What in God's name were they thinking? Those effects took hours, days, weeks, months, FOREVER! And all for what? So we can learn that an invisible \\"genius\\" can get jealous and kill all his friends? Well, I can't say I expected anything more from the director of Showgirls and Basic Instinct. On second thought, maybe I did a little, because I enjoyed Total Recall and Starship Troopers. (And just between you and me, I liked both Showgirls and Basic Instinct. Shhh.)The score is better than the film. And, you know what? The special effects here are overrated. Stupid cartoon CGI. 'Hollow Man' is just another ret@rded mess puked out from the bowels of \\"Hollow\\"wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fitting title...","review":"I wonder if the writers realize that Bacon's character's invisibility means that light should pass directly through himas if he weren't there, not stopping along the way to be projected onto his invisible retinas, and not feeding his invisible brain with any vision information, thus rendering him blind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Man Was A Hollow Movie!!","review":"This was one of the worst pictures I've ever seen. The trailers make it look appealing, but it really is just a stupid-plotted movie. Kevin Bacon harasses women the entire movie and at the end, the movie turns into a bloody gore fest. Just horrible!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!!!","review":"Please, don't buy this movie. It is a really bad movie. I guarantee you will find a way, much better movie on TV. Unless you're an 10 year old kid who would like to know how it would be to be invisible for one day, you might rent this movie, but not buy it. It is really bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't only the man that is hollow!","review":"Where have we gone wrong in American films? Used to be that people went to the movies to be entertained, uplifted, view heroic exploits, relax and come home refreshed. We seem to be beseiged by a flood of gratituous gore, insanity and violence. This movie has many excellent special effects, but is certainly not something to see with your children (of any age). It is not only the man that is hollow, but the whole bloody thing.If 4th or 5th graders were asked what they would do if they were invisible, and you might, if they were honest, get answers like 'peeking into the girls' bathroom'. From there, the movie rapidly degenerates into a virtual blood bath with the hero/villain having nearly super-human strength and powers.This is easily one of the worst, most disturbing movies I have seen in several years. It was a true waste of time for me and the family. It truly was a hollow movie with very little redeeming value in sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever...?","review":"...well, it has some competition. Right up there wih \\"Bats\\", \\"Speed 2: Cruise Control\\", \\"Home Alone 4\\", \\"Baby Geniuses\\", and the like. I only recommend you buy it if you are a fan of animal cruelty or Kevin Bacon's ass. Otherwise, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"They could have done so much with this movie. It basically had cool special effects and that's it. Keven becomes invisible and instead of doing anything interesting or fun, he rapes a stranger and assaults another. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"If you have read my reviews for other dvd titles (Scream Trilogy Set, The Birds, Vertigo), you have probably come to know I write long reviews. But this is not to be the case. I will inform you that this is THE MOST wretched piece of FILTH two hour waste of ANY DECENT HUMAN BEINGS TIME it's laughable. I'll put it to you this way: They should show it to prisoners for PUNSIHMENT! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE run in the other direction when you think of buying this. I just surely hope that my seeing this film and being tortured for two hours will not be in vain. I hope that some poor soul will NEVER have to cringe because of this CRAP again. Thank you, I have said my piece, and good night."},{"rating":"1","title":"wake me when its over","review":"my best advice regarding this film, is that if you have a functioning brain, it may not be by the end.boring pointless bacon vehicle.I expect more from Paul Verhoeven, its almost a travesty to mention robocop and starship troopers alongside this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Movie","review":"The question that comes to mind here is: Why bother? The storyline offers nothing really new. Scientist with no ethics invents a drug that makes creatures invisible (and thinks he has another to reverse the process). He tries it out on himself (why?), becomes invisible, then goes berserk. In the end, he is killed several times, but keeps reappearing to the point of ridiculousness (and haven't we all seen that one a few times before?) in true superhuman fashion. Presumably gets done in at last (but who knows for sure?). Kevin Bacon isn't bad as the mad scientist, and the special effects are truly special, but the story is predictable and lame from beginning to end. There really is no reason to see, much less own, this unless you have a compulsion about maintaining your complete collection of \\"invisible man\\" flicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try, but I'd rather it was an erotic thriller","review":"Hollow Man was on its way to being a good, albeit trashy, science fiction thriller when it was as if the idea train derailed. Let me explain.The film starts with great special effects. First, the ape is returned to the visible and then Kevin Bacon is made invisible. These were incredibly cool moments. What follows is a masterpiece of erotic filmmaking as Bacon sneaks around molesting a few women and terrorizing others. This was an ultimate voyeuristic moment and made the movie worth watching.However, instead of continuing in this vein. The invisible Bacon returns to the lab to murder his co-workers. The film becomes a stupid, over the top bloodbath. It becomes the kind of film where characters take crowbars to the head and aren't really hurt. Stupid not suspensful, and unexciting.Its too bad the director chickened out of a great erotic film idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"standard horror","review":"i was expecting alot better. this flim is boring you can guess whos going to get killed and when the big scares are coming up.oh well a least the premise was a bit differnt than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd have to be hollow in the head.","review":"All in all, Hollow Man is a decent thriller with good effects. Many people get coerced into giving this movie a good review from all the effects but you can't watch two straight hours just of computer effects. After it finishes with the disappearing it all goes downhill, often predictable and flawed. How many people would go crazy from being invisible? And as always, he has to kill everybody then escape. The fire system sprays water and you see him, more effects. I really like the part where the water's all over from the sprinklers and Kevin Bacon hits the electrical box with a crow bar and gets electrocuted but Elisabeth Shue, who happens to be several feet away from him, still manages to not get electrocuted."},{"rating":"1","title":"The name says it all...","review":"I had no overwhelming desire to see this movie; I watched it out of idle (and perhaps morbid) curiosity. I'm almost sorry I did. Despite special effects which are, admittedly, some of the best I've seen, Hollow Man is a thoroughly forgettable movie, with a so-so plot, two-dimensional characters with largely four-letter vocabularies, and an ending that leaves you thinking, \\"I wonder what time it is?\\" I'm getting quite sick of these formulaic movies where people are portrayed as A. ignorant, and B. dispensable. They've no redeeming qualities, and are a waste of both time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Man = Hollow Movie!!","review":"I waited a long time to buy this DVD because I thought, after seeing the trailers, the movie would offer great special effects and a believable plot. I was half right! The special effects were very, very good but the plot was thin and ridiculous.

This was an awful remake of The Invisible Man. Yes, the special effects were exciting and gruesome. Isn't modern movie technology wonderful? But...so what? Bacon is not a convincing scientist. Renegade--yes. Madman--absolutely. Letch--he was perfect. However, none of these aspects meshed with him being a scientist. He played out like an adult kid who somehow got permission to fool around with very expensive military-scientific toys.A serious hole in this plot is the notion that the military would fully fund such an over-the-edge project as phase-shifting to create invisibility--and then not demand oversight. We are supposed to believe that a bunch of gen-X scientists would be allowed to run a super-pricey military project without so much as an MP in the laboratory?If you must view this wretched production, borrow it from the library like I did--there is no waiting list."},{"rating":"1","title":"watchable","review":"The plot is predictable and lackluster. The writing is medicore and the characters are generally unlikeable. Kevin Bacon's performance is good, which is the only reason to watch this film. If you want scary, you won't find it here. If you want a smart movie, you won't find it here. And if you want a good movie, you won't find it here. Kevin Bacon has been in a lot of movies; this is not one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"All effects, no story, no acting","review":"The only redeeming feature of this movie are the excellent special effects. The story is almost non-existant, and you are constantly shown ho-hum outbursts by Bacon's moody character. His acting isn't at all impressive, although his part in the movie doesn't allow for him to be. For that matter, the acting of Elisabeth Shue isn't any good, either. None of the acting is. And there are many technical questions I have and think are funny. For example, when injected with the invisible liquid, the people miracuously disappear from the outside and it works its way in towards the internal organs and bones. But, when injected in the same vein with the reappearing agent, they strangely begin reappearing from the inside then moving outward. That's just one example of the many horrible scenes of the movie, although the rendition of the body as it is disappearing/reappearing is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNEVEN BUT GOOD","review":"THERE IS NO REAL RHYME OR REASON WHY THESE PARTICULAR SONGS WERE CULLED TOGETHER FOR THIS MUSIC OF LOUNGE MUSIC.

The rest of the singing is OK, the instruments are almost entirely sampled or synthesized - not bad, but not great. And, worst of all, not Gladys; I'm disappointed that she'd intentionally mislead her many fans this way.

Cady Stanton's Woman's Bible, but this is the first time I have read it. The first surprise was that list of women who were part of the revision committee--while Stanton's name is the one associated with this work, many people were involved. The second surprise was that so much of the then contemporary Biblical scholarship, both historical and documentary, as well as linguistic, was used in the review and revision of the texts that were selected. Very well written, very clear, and whether you agree with the points of view put forth, it is an excellent read, and well worth the time. There is a long history of oppression of women in many religions, and Christianity is not exempt, and scriptures are the main tools used to justify that oppression.

I tried to appreciate it as a piece of history, but eventually deleted it. As a Christian I believe that you cannot pick and choose pieces of the Bible to suit your purposes.

This book definitely does for groups what The Road Less Traveled does for individuals. It explains the problems with the simplistic views on groups that are prevalent nowadays, and instead pleads for people to learn not to tolerate, but to welcome and celebrate individual differences. However, it is realistic in its recognition that forming a true community where individual differences are celebrated will require the hard work of emptying ourselves of our own prejudices and preconceived notions.

The only thing is the music, which is from that time, but it they are still hot songs (The Bucketheads, Ini Kamoze, M People, Coolio etc)The workout itself is fun for all levels. For a beginner, it would be good to work up endurance and have fun at the same time. For advanced exercisers (like myself) I do this tape on occasion for fun, but also to break a sweat having fun dancing.The Grind videos are really great!

I must warn you though, this is for people who love to dance. The routine is challenging, I must admit.And you have to have a lot of passion , strengh, and endurance to get it down. There are lots of dancers and two very good instructors that you can follow. You can use the moves in dance clubs, the music is great, but you may have to rewind and pause to get the steps down. This is a very challenging routine, but you will burn lots of calories and tone up while having fun and learning to dance.

And then their is only one dance section! They wasted a perfect opportunity to come up with a great, fun workout.

While Hip-Hop Aerobics and Funk aerobics are great fun, this video tends to kill some of that fun. After doing it twice will get dull. I suggest another dance routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"They call this exercise?","review":"I was really disappointed by this video. I figured that a video produced by MTV would be motivating, but was I wrong!! Although Eric may be easy on the eyes, his appeal ends there. His instruction is worthless and not geared toward the average person who is just looking to get some fun exercise. I would also describe his attitude as arrogant. In addition, there is little continuity to the movements; just when you get one move down, they explain and demonstrate a new move while you are marching in place. Save your money and time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is horrible","review":"The video is a really stupid video. It lasts for about an hour and you barely get a workout. You just follow the same dance over and over for an hour, how boring. I thought the combination was so easy and the video is really stupid. I would not suggest it to anyone. I used it once and I don't think I will ever use it again. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy video, but it got me moving.","review":"This video is good for those who have had no dance training and get bored with a regular workout. I get bored on the treadmill etc and hoped this video would provide a fun alternative. It WAS fun, but I took professional dance for 15 years and this offered no challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs from the 70's","review":"Good songs on this collection, but where it does fall short is in the liner notes, or I should say, lack of liner notes. There is nada, zip, zilch, none. Just the cover sheet alone. But I guess that's what we have to expect with these bargain cds. But the selection of songs is good, and will bring back memories of the 70's for those of us who lived through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaper to purchase every season seperate!","review":"Why does it cost less to buy each season seperately than this whole series.

Got them in a timely manner, however the quality was very disappointing. I got two pots and there were thin spots on the bottom of each from manufacturing and the lids do not fit very well at all. I had to bend the bales out to even get the lids on. About the only thing these things would be good for is as a fryer. Also, make sure you realize that there are no legs on the bottom.

I love the band and consider all of there CD's to be the best one's in my collection. Ville Valo's lyrics just pull you into a different reality.

I don't care what the other reviews say I would consider this one of my favorite CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this metal.","review":"I can understand why so many people have come to like this band, it's easy to. They're a perfect mix of pop, goth, and metal, and quite catchy. I bought this never having heard one song, and now love it. I will say I decided to buy based on the two covers. Both are excellent, and I think HIM was born to cover \\"Wicked Game\\", musically and lyrically. This singers voice is a great match on all these tracks. Other stand-outs to me are \\"Your Sweet Six Six Six\\", \\"Our Diabolical Rapture\\", and \\"When Love And Death Emrace\\". All have a good hook. Regardless of your taste, minus country, you'll most likely love \\"Greatest Love Songs 666\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Him: Greatest love songs","review":"A friend once said that Ville's music is emo, but weither it is or not I enjoy it and that's all that matters.

No. I'm just saying that I had no regets for buying my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh.","review":"Everyone seems to love this band and I can't figure out why... They're okay but not great, I grew up on goth and industrial rock and compared to some of the older bands these guys just sound bland and cliched. I mean, you can tell that the lead singer is DESPERATELY trying to sound like Peter Murphy, come on.Oh well, I guess they're better than most of their contemporaries, anyway, which is probably why I stopped listening to this type of music in the nineties.If you want something better but in a similiar vein go to a used record store and dig up an old bauhaus, christian death or sisters of mercy album."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this is the worst hard/heavy album i heard in ages (together with limp bizkit, papa roach, kid rock, 3 doors down etc.) calling this gothic is a shame for any fan of goth music. the vocalist tries to imitate peter steele of type o negative, but he doesn't succeed. the music is typical mainstream music, simple and stupid. while this may not be well known in the u.s. it definitly is in germany. this is typical mainstream junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trendy trash.","review":"How pathetic are you people? Seriously. Anybody who calls this metal needs to grow up and realize what metal is.

Or try and give it a pathetic non exsistant sub-genre name. That would only further prove my point. Look at their frontman?

Additional problem, video clips didn't download with a usable sound track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bluray","review":"Really impressed with the superior quality of the bluray. The songs are pretty good. $46 is too high for a Bluray. I think it should be less than $20. I don't know why Indian blurays are so expensive. The average price for a Tamil bluray is $30. Most of the Hindi moves are reasonably priced.Yash Raj BluRays are superb. Keep up the good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Pare's always great!","review":"I just rented this one and really enjoyed it. I knew with Michael Pare and Dennis Hopper it stood a good chance of being enjoyable, and it was. I liked the storyline and the action was pretty slick. I was not a music fan of Adam Ant, but he did a pretty great job in his role of a conartist. I hated to see him get wasted off, as I enjoyed his character. Pare is great in all his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just One Thing Wrong...................","review":"This CD has it all. From the 80's classic \\"Operator\\",\\" No Parking on the dance floor\\". And my personal favorite \\" Freak a zoid\\". It also covers their sweeter side with \\"Slow Jam\\" and \\" Midas Touch\\". This cd is a must buy for any Midnight Star Fan. But for us who are just a little bit more \\"HARDCORE\\". What is reason why \\" Electricty\\" is not on this cd?. Can someone please tell me why one of the greatest party jams was ignored from this fantastic line up? They could have taken out the \\"Slow Jams\\" Live version to fit that classic song on otherwise an incredible cd. But for those who are serious fans, you allready have it on cd anyway. But for those who don't have this cd. Here's is your chance to enjoy one of the greatest live bands around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Career Overview","review":"The Right Stuff label continues to release compilation CD's of Solar Records core audiences. I highly recommend the Shalamar, Lakeside and Whispers Best of's that are out there. And this is a good one, too.

Maybe I just wasn't as big a fan of Midnight Star as I thought. My two favorite cuts are \\"Wet My Whistle\\" and \\"Midas Touch\\". But, for those who were big fans of theirs, I'm sure you will enjoy \\"Make It Last\\" and \\"Freak-A-Zoid\\" and others.

The official Sony \\"solution\\" for traveling more than a couple of days (the battery doesn't last much longer) consists of two separate items: a cradle-less USB connector to synch, and a power supply. (The power supply is the same that comes with the cradle, but with a connector for the handheld.) Some genius decided they could maximize profit that way, but it is almost as bulky as a second cradle. I wish they offered a single USB cable capable of recharging the handheld (Targus offers such a cable but not for the PEG-Ts)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Group Treatment Approach","review":"Spouse Abuse is theoretically based in rational-emotive theory and cognitive/behavioral theory. It outlines an excellent treatment plan which includes a time-out contract, anger management skills, communication skills and problem-resolution approaches. It examines irrational beliefs that fuel anger and violence. The book has printed forms for self-evaluation, feeling list handouts and other pratical materials. The content of the book is spousal abuse, but much of the material is applicable toward the improvement of any couple relationship. Spouse Abuse was originally developed as a treatment plan for the United States Marines. The emphasis is on group treatment. Many of the skills can be taught in couple counseling or in individual therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guaranteed Tough.

After three days of moderate use, the seams began to come apart, and after a week the gloves were useless.

Which I expected, for $30. Mine came with strings and a bag, but the strings the guitar ships with are too heavy--I thought they were going to break the guitar's body. Intonation is absolutely terrible--I suspect they changed design, or started buying fretboards from a different supplier--without doing any math. Either they used the wrong fretboard, or they glued the bridge on in the wrong place. It's wrong by half an inch. For guitars, that's a huge error--it means anything past the second fret is out of tune.Do not buy this guitar for someone looking to learn to play. It will disappoint them."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Absolute junk. I too was taken in by the idea of a cheap Martin Backpacker copy. This company has made a lot of money from us cheapos trying to get a good deal. For the others who have also been duped and still scratching their heads on how to tune or play this thing, here is a tip. Put a capo on the first fret and restring with super slinky electric guitar strings. It will now play cheaply, but it is a pain to keep in tune, and forget about ever getting it harmonically perfect. It will always sound just a bit off. I have since bought a Washburn Rover, and what a gem. You do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"total junk","review":"Please, take my advice and do not buy this item.Cheap construction,horrible workmanship, completly unplayable in any tuning.If you want a strumstick, go with McNally, the best product on the market.If you want a cheap guitar,many vendors offer good guitars for under $50.00Zero stars!!! do not buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT HER BEST BUT GOOD ENOUGH","review":"I'm a die hard Anne Stuart fan and have even gone to great (and sometimes expensive) lengths to purchase her earlier works (get RITUAL SINS at all costs!). While this was not her best book, even AS's almost perfect books are great.

This wasn't it. Even with fresh batteries, the sharpener slowly ground to a halt, and the pencils didn't go all the way in -- standard size pencils were about 1/4 inch shy of sharp, with a flat end. Perhaps I got a defective unit, with the metal not bored all the way through. Am returning it post-haste.

They complained it didn't sharpen, so I tried, and sure enough, the pencil sharpens to a nice flat piece of lead. So if you need a pointed pencil, this isn't for you. If you like the flat lead (very thick, great for pencil coloring), it could work. Thank goodness for a fantastic return policy by Amazon, b/c I ordered something different and I hope it does a point well.
