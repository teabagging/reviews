This has a great story as well as great acting and amazing, I mean amazing special effects. Gollum is the best CGI character to date, no questions. Peter Jackson is doing a great job on bringing these films from book to movie. There is a difference between the movie and the book, but so what. To some movie goers 3 hours is way too long and if you put everything that was in the book in this movie, you would have WAY more than a 3 hour movie. This movie ROCKS and if you haven't seen it, DO SO! This Extended Version is going to be awesome (Just like The Fellowship Extended Version was). With up to 43 minutes of added seens, how can you go wrong in buying this. This is the ultimate DVD for Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings; The Two Towers (special edition)","review":"Great movie - great characters - great acting - wonderful special effects - and it even manages funny moments in the midst of parts favorite characters could die any moment. And that is hard to do without making it seem silly, but they've done it here.And the Special Edition is worth the extra money. It includes deletes scenes, extra commentaries, and much more then the normal version of the DVD.Recommended for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkein for non-fans...","review":"...including me! This is the first time I've ever been excited about LOR. I'm incapable of plugging through the books, but I've appreciated these films.I'm excited to see the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Jackson doesn't believe that the extended version would play well in theaters and that may well be true but I won't go to a theater to watch this trilogy as I want to see every frame he has recorded. He's contributed a beautiful piece of work that we can savor for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each successive one becomes my favorite....","review":"How could they have topped \\"Fellowship of the Rings?\\" The casting, scenery, music has become so entangled with the book that they're virtually inseparable. Plus, this addition gives us 43 minutes enhancements to tell more of the story and the characterization. I love getting lost in Tolkien's world for 3 hours or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers","review":"If you're a Tolkien purist, with little appreciation or understanding for what it takes to screenplay a complicated book, and bring it to life, you won't like this movie. To follow the books, line for line, nuance for nuance, would make for 3-20 hr episodes, that would bore an Ent to death. As it was, it bordered on being a bit of commercial travel guide for New Zealand, but you had to admit, if you were looking for Middle Earth, they found it and brought it to life, scene after scene. Could have spent a bit more time with some of the sub rather than Frodo and Sam, who were not prominent in the second book, but the confrontation at Helms Deep and the revenge on Saurman's Tower more than made up for it.This will be more for keeping J.R.R, Tolkien alive in literature, as any has done for it author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfect","review":"I just went and saw \\"The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers\\" tonight, for the second time.. and it (not surprisingly) was even better than the previous time. The first installment of the trilogy was very impressive, but the second is just plain fun. Despite some drawn out points of the film, I never lost interest.. not even for a moment. The battle at 'Helm's Deep' was amazing. Throughout the entire movie (the 2nd time), I was so enthusiastic about that whole war sequence to begin. This movie has such imaginative characters, and such saturatingly deep development into the story; you'll leave the theater wishing the final movie was out already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Magnificent","review":"I reread the book a few days before seeing the movie so I would know what was in the book and what they had changed. I was surprised to see that they did a wonderful job of moving the book to a movie but of course, I have some picky things. For one, the Ents did not pass my approval. They only seem to be big at the end when they destroy Sauromon's plans, I always imagined that they were tall giants, and compared to Merry and Pippin they really weren't.. Other than the Ents, I was ok with the movie. Not everything is the same, but they did a really good job of it. My favorite part is the Gollum/Smeagol conversation, which made several of us Gollum fans crack up in the theater. I assume that the final movie will show Shelob's lair. But overall, a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy continuation of an epic saga.","review":"At the end of the first, the Fellowship split up. So it will switch characters from time to time. You will see Frodo and Sam's encounter with the \\"precious\\" creature, Gollum, their journey to Mt. Doom, Pippin and Merry escaping from the Orcs and finding Treebeard, and many other things. Better than the first, with more, action, humor, and story. Plus, Gandalf makes a grand return."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This series of movies is one of the best at following the spirit of the books. Even though the books are not followed word for word, there is nothing that doesn't work in the movie. There's nothing that leaves you wondering \\"How does that fit with Lord of The Rings?\\". The extended dvd is good too. I have the first one and have already preordered the second. The extended version lets you get a fuller story through extra footage that is added back into the movie. Plus you also get interviews with the cast, director, etc. I would recommend watching the movies in order though or it will not make much sense. Particularly \\"The Two Towers\\" since it doesn't really have a beginning or an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adding This To Cart Is A No Brainer....","review":"4 discs including 43 minutes of additional footage all in a cool collector's box for around $25.

This movie really did amaze, and stunn, me while I watched it in theaters. It is even better than it's great prequel \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" having more action, adventure, drama, romance, and so much more. Even the visual effects, musical (score), and the plot [which moved on a lot quicker than \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"] were even better in \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" than it's prequel. All I will now say about this movie is that it is ASTOUNDING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for family for xmas gift","review":"I recently took my children to see the Hobbit and came home to buy the triology that followed.

Love the film, the bonus DVD about Gollum was packaged extremely well and came with a nice book. The statue is extremely nice too and well made. Its 2011, haha, so this set is a little out-of-print. But if you can find it for a good price like me, $17, then pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"TT storyline botched into some romantic semi plot and Gimli reduced to comic relief - how sad considering what was potential if the director resisted dark temptation to please mass crowds with simple love story (under strong grip The One Ring of Profits ...)well at least visual effectsa were good and it may be saved if somebody cut all this crap to make shorter movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tin ring.","review":"The good points? Gollum is fantastic, probably the best-realized character in this movie version of the Trilogy(so far). The scenery and settings, both digital and real, are incredible; you DO feel like you're in Middle Earth.The bad points? Everything else! Why, why, WHY did Peter Jackson and his co-writers feel a need to \\"improve\\" upon the original material with new plot devices that manage to spoil the suspense and dialogue that makes George Lucas' STAR WARS scripts read like, well, J.R.R. Tolkien by comparison? The only thing I was left with at the end of THE TWO TOWERS was a sense of dread, scared stiff by the thought of how Jackson's going to mangle THE RETURN OF THE KING!I don't care a bit if my opinion is in the minority: based upon what's been released so far, the only thing that could have been worse than this version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS is if Walt Disney Studios had tried doing it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am the Lord of the Rings","review":"This movie is totally awesome. We once again follow Frodo Baggins as he continues his quest to become a Jedi Knight. Unfortunately, Frodo is captured by the evil Lord Harry Potter, son of Queen Amadala. Just as he is about to meet his match, Gandolf arrives on Falcor and saves him. And then Aerosmith girl arrives with her asteroid-blowing-up, oil-driller boyfriend and yells \\"Let's do this\\". Needless to say, one big explosion. Awesome, totally awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does this have to do with Tolkien?","review":"This movie has almost nothing to do with the story in Tolkien's legendary books. Peter Jackson has basically written his own story and called it The Two Towers to sell more tickets. In The Fellowship he at least tried to stick somewhat close to the book and even though there where some gross inaccuracies I thought he did a pretty good job. This movie however is a joke. It does not deserve to bear the name The Two Towers. Peter Jackson basically decided to say \\"Forget the book I can write it better\\" (actually that is pretty much what he did say in an interview with Time magazine) but in my opnion he was wrong!The characters for the most part were well casted and the actors do a good job. Also, the sets looked good. That however is all that can be said for this film. Otherwise, this movie was an insult to Tolkien and his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I have read the books and yes the whole Faramir thing really made me mad, but at the end when he lets Frodo and Sam go I was okay with it. I know there were many other changes in the movie but I actually liked it. I was worried that the movie wasn't going to be as suspenseful since I had read the book and I knew what happened, but there were definately suprises. Overall I think Jackson stayed as true to the story as he possibly could. I mean three hours doesn't even begin to cover all the detail that Tolkien put into his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another treat for Lord of the Rings fans.","review":"This film is a miracle. SO much better than the theatrical version. So much more depth and character development, and a better narrative flow. A must-have for fans of the book who missed their favorite scenes, or for anyone who loved the theatrical version but would like to see a more complete version of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!","review":"This movie is just so cool! I can't wait to see its sequel \\"Return of the King\\"! \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" was an awsome, and yet stunning, movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than original","review":"This version, in my opinion, was better than the theatrical version. It stays closer to the book and has more depth and drama. If you only like the movies because of the ultra cool action sequences than you might want to stay away because most of the new scenes are just a bunch of talking.There is just one thing i dont understand. The scene where they are burying Theodin's son is kind of cut off on my dvd. I dont know if its like this with all of them but on my dvd it goes from Eowyn singing and the people puttin Theodrid in his tomb to Theodin holding a flower in front of the closed tomb. The scene ends very abruptly and i just simply want to know if all the dvds are like that or if mine is just messed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a four hour movie now.","review":"With all the extra scenes and the extended scenes, we have a great, fully detailed story, with lots of character development, much of which focused on Frodo and Gollum. They also add more scenes with Merry and Pippin dealing with the Ents.The extras as great, dealing not only with how they were able to produce massive armies for the big screen, but one chapter deals totally with just the development of the character of Smeagol/Gollum.Of course, like the first collection of DVDs, they deal with the general problems and issues of turning the second book into the second movie. The backgrounds, plot twists, special effects, weapons, languages, music, miniatures and accidents. Not only are the cool Uruk-hai back, along with the Nazgul, but we get to see the first Wargs - giant wolves who have allied themselves with the Goblins(also known as Orcs). I can't wait for the Return of the King!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Must-Have","review":"I own both the theatrical and extended version. and don't agree with the official amazon review. The extended version is simply a must-have for the following reasons:The theatrical version was hard to follow at times, but the extended version explains everything, so that the scenes and story-lines makes much more sense.While running time for a theatrical version always dictate limited playing time, it becomes apparent two minutes into the extended movie just how much detail and clarification is lost in the theatrical version.Peter Jackson clearly envisioned the extended version as the film to watch, it's clear in the pace and rhythm of the editing which seems to flow much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"For 50 years no one has been able to bring Tolkien's legendary trilogy to life because of his rich writing style and detail. Now, I don't think anyone could have done a better job than Peter Jackson. The deliverance of the story, while noticeably different, is highly accurate at reflecting Tolkien's masterpiece. The actors delivered a commendable performance. What is most breath taking, however, is the special effects. The sets, the environments, the costumes, and the visuals are so finely detailed that the movie is teeming with life. Tolkien would have truly been proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch brilliant commenators like Colin Duriez on this DVD","review":"This is GREAT folks! Not only are all the extra scenes fully incorporated into the movie, making it even better than ever, but you also get the views of experts, like top British CS Lewis and Tolkien buff Colin Duriez, the author of some of the best books around on Tolkien. I have watched this many times - hope you do too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Continuation","review":"Peter Jackson and his team sure know how to put together a DVD! As with the 'Fellowship' extended edition, this one is packed with additional footage and behind the scenes extras. There was a day when \\"additional footage\\" meant some unfinished junk that clearly needed to be cut from a movie as it was unwatchable. But not here. Every added scene blends flawlessly into the movie and has meaning and enriches the story further. The 'behind-the-scenes' footage is very thorough and entertaining, as well.A great story, great extras, and well worth the investment.By the way, for one reviewer, Tolkien wrote LOTR in the Twentieth Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, except...","review":"This was a great, seamless follow-up to Fellowship. While I have read LoTR yearly for the last forty years, I do have a realistic concept of what it took to put such a HUGE classic on screen. Leaving out less important parts is necessary to plot movement, BUT why add something that never happened and detract from the strength of one of the better characters. Frodo, Sam and Gollum were never taken to Osgiliath by Faramir. Indeed, Faramir resisted any control of the Ringbearer and party because he knew neither he nor his father could be trusted with an item of such immense power. Other than that jarring note, the movie was incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Movie Classic!","review":"There is no better movies out there than the amazing \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" was incredible! But, believe it or not, Its sequel \\"The Two Towers\\" is even more incredible! With a great music (score), spectacular visual effects, and great acting \\"The Two Towers\\" was easily the best movie in 2002. There is a lot of good drama, action/adventure, and excitement in this wonderful movie (making it one of my favorite films ever). \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is still one of my favorite movies ever (along side with \\"The Two Towers\\"). \\"The Return of the King\\" will be a HUGE phenomenon!

It is filled with action/adventure, drama, fantasy, and excitement! \\"The Two Towers\\" has wonderful visual effects, a great music (score), and very well done acting. Many fantasy characters are brought to life in this movie such as: orcs, phantoms, elves, wizards, hobbits (which are halflings) and more. The actors, and actresses, did a splendid job on acting in this spectacular movie so they deserve a lot of credit and applause for their wonderful effort. Director Peter Jackson, and his crew, deserves thousands of movie awards for making such a brilliant movie.

I especially enjoyed the sequence of the trees coming to life. I would like to see more of the special effects in this movie involving the Elves, which they bring an important part of the movie. All in all it is not a movie you can just up and leave the room, you miss one second of The Two Towers you'll be confused. In the beginning I had no idea what was a dream and what was real, it went back and forth so much that after a few minutes you hoped they didn't go back into a dream sequence again. I enjoyed the movie, excellent casting, directing and a well written script. Take out the popcorn and don't move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotr ya","review":"This is an awsome game.

Excellent visual effects, decent direction, and a much better version of the book (no long winded descriptions of things people don't care about here!) make it enjoyable.Now, is it worthy of Best Picture? No. Is it worthy of the nomination? No. The films were nominated for the same reason Star Wars was: it brings forth brilliant new visuals. It is nothing more than something too watch on a lazy, dog-dangling afternoon. Doesn't mean it's bad, just that it ain't Best Picture material (though the third film will probably win). Shut off your brain (for the most part) and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the same OLD THEATRICAL EDITION ONLY NONSENSE.

I stopped it and started another film on Netflix which ran perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome","review":"Well I have read all the books that I could get (It's not that easy here in Ecuador)and I was really happy with the movie. I agree that some changes were kinda odd, specially the thing about Faramir. Sure it gives him a better reason to let Frodo go, but I think that it was a little too much. Anyway it's a richer character than the Faramir from the book so I gues we can forgive them for that.Anyway I can't wait to get the extended edition, specially with those 40 plus minutes. I guess that Gollum's story is gonna be there.I think that the producers did an excellent job portraying the world of Tolkien and the essence of the plot and the drama. Telling a story in a film is very different than in a book cause all the things that you imagine while you read have to be shown in a couple minutes.I'm just waiting for the Return of the King."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome movie","review":"this movie was the ultimate!!!! absolutely fanastic! You should definately buy this movie, it is worth it. Don't waste your money on the matrix or any other dumb hollywood movie, use your money wisely, and it's very wise to use it for this movie!

It's a total of 4 discs in all."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 THE FELLOWSHIP, 9 THE TWO TOWERS","review":"It's difficult for me to say this, but I saw the movie yesterday and expected slighlty more. For example : 1- In the trailer for the 2 Towers there is a piece of music incredibly awsome, in the movie it did not sound that part in any part of the film, 2- I expected an encounter between Gandalf and Frodo, it didn't happen. 3- The music almost did not change compared to the Fellowship of the ring, basically the same score. 4- Definetly, the 2 towers is a different concept, in the Fellowship all the 9 people live the same adventures in a serial way. In the 2 towers, because they are separated, each small group lives their own adventures in a parallel way. Anyway, a great movie !!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Can't wait for the extended version later this fall and then on to the \\"Return of the King\\" which will garner the series it's 3rd Best Picture nomination.Awesome stuff. \\"Purists\\"(aka \\"psychos\\")be damned."},{"rating":"2","title":"this year's must see!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this is by far the goodest movie i seen in a long time. i loved it so much cause the acting was good and the action scenes were terrific. it is a wonderful follow up to the masterpiece the fellowship of the rings. i was blown away by the 2 towers because sequels are usually not as good as the first movie, but this one really was.

It explains everything that is left in question by the theatrical release and tones down Faramir to a closer rendition of the character in the book. Basically, he's not so much a bad guy.

Ugh. I'm not really a battle fan. Also, I've decided I prefer movies where you can look at the characters and not want to shield your eyes. Come on, do they really have to make squelching noises when a creature changes facial expressions? A good part of that movie could have been cut out. By the end of my movie I was fidgeting around in my seat because my back hurt due to the length. Their are pretty much no women in this, and the ones that are in the movie are undeveloped characters. If you do decide to go to this movie (although I really reccomend not seeing it or seeing the movie at home so you can fast-forward through parts of it) you should have seen the first one so you won't be as confused as I was.

I think it may be a new world record for movies...GOLLUM is the treasure here.

This film changed the characters a bit much also especially Faramir. Yes I agree films can't follow the books too closely but this one went further than the rest. Yes it was a good film if you hadn't read the book especially the effects. I don't care how Pippin removed his broach, teeth or hands but changing whole battles as at Helms Deep, where they did have warriors not just old men, women and children. Elves didn't need to be there to make the battle. I will not be going to see the next film until it comes out on pay-per-view and I'm feeling curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, if different, vision of Tolkien's masterpiece","review":"I loved this film, as well as the book. They're different experiences, it doesn't do a whole lot of good to compare the two detail for detail. That said, director Peter Jackson made some choices I probably wouldn't have - The Elven archers, for instance - but I don't necessarly think those choices were wrong, because those differences make the film experience distinctly different from reading the book.I highly recommend the film, as well as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is better","review":"But this said, I believe that there couldn't be a better movie. It captures the epic sweep and the pain and turmoil as Frodo and Sam approach the cracks of doom. It was fantastic. The filming was beyond scope. The characters were perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you haven't read the books.","review":"I have seen all 3 LOTR movies and LOVED them soooo much, but if you have read the books, some parts don't seem that great. The first movie (Fellowship) probably fallowed the book the best. The worst at fallowing the book was definantly the 3rd one, but The Two Towers was alright. It has several stupid parts in it, especially where Legolas \\"grinds\\" down a staircase in the middle of a battle. Everything else was alright though. I wouldnt reccoment it for young children though, because my 9 year old sister hated it~~ there are a lot of battle scenes and gory parts, plus the oarks can be kind of freaky looking. The story might be hard for younger children to fallow so they might get bored faster. It is a kind of complicated subject but Overall, it is a great movie, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"My god, are you lemmings?","review":"Don't get me wrong, The Two Towers is a great movie in its own right, but why are you all marching off the cliff after this piece of junk DVD?

This edition has the special features I want, but it doens't have the full movie I want. The extended edtion will have the movie I want, but also the special features I DON'T.

These things are proliferating like quack grass. Ah, but this one is by Robert Stone, one of the four or five best writers in America...and that makes it all the more disappointing. While Stone hung out with some interesting characters (Kesey, Neal Cassady, Paul Newman), his remembrances are anecdotal, unformed, shapeless. He meanders from one episode to the next and though the company is congenial, the end result is unsatisfactory. A good, lengthy interview with the man would have served just as well. Mr. Stone is a literary genius but PRIME GREEN is a minor effort, undistinguished and lacking his characteristic focus and intensity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prime Ramblings","review":"Yet another book badly in need of an editor--uneven, disjointed ruminations by a talented writer and keen observer, who lost this reader within the first 50 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal","review":"This is HIS personal history of the 60s, not the total history of the time. Not a bad read coming from that view point. If looking for some great over view of those days, this ain't it.

Jerry Garcia's trip was one view, the politics of the day was another road traveled. Stone has written some good novels which I enjoyed, which maded me interested as did the Kesey connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can remember the Sixties this well, well...","review":"The clliched quip, \\"If you can remember the Sixties you weren't really there,\\" gets a firm refutation here. That may be the only good news. The bad news is that so little of what Stone has to offer here is worth remembering. Sure, there is no point in lying about the Sixties, or making up stories just to sound good, but a litany of drugs (covering a wide range), alcohol, infidelity, a bad movie, mindless jobs, and cheap apartments obscures a writing talent and any truly enjoyable reflection on the era. If you are looking for nostalgia, this isn't going to provide much meaningful insight or satisfaction, just primarily name and drug dropping. If you are looking for a stream-of-consciousness, muddled, trail through the fortgettable parts of the Sixties, you might find this to be of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Surely I'm not the only one who was disappointed with this book. It was a fine read, but I don't feel like I learned anything new about Stone or the 60s. It seemed like several chapters were forced in order to get enough pages for a real book. Although I am a big fan of Robert Stone's other works (especially Dog Soldiers), I cannot recommend this one even to his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only gets one star, because that's the worst I can give.","review":"Oh My God.

I got to know Sabrina and John, the murder victims, and their families. This book honors them without making them too good to be true. The criminals are not sensationalized. The innocence of Davis, California appealed to my longing for the safety and security of the past.

The book was intriguing, and I felt compelled to read it until it was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Justice Waits\\" a solid read","review":"Grabs you with a building sense of shocking tragedy, and the years of mystery that followed.

But the highest points are two Caetano Veloso tracks, \\"Relance\\" and \\"Da maior importncia\\". \\"Relance\\" is a dizzying rhythmical experience, and \\"Da maior importncia\\" is probably the most subtle piece I ever heard from Gal: I have listened to it dozens of times, and it keeps getting better.This CD is not your average Brazilian music album.

This claim is not backed up in the book. First, textbook neo-clasical equilibrium theory contains neither money nor 'information'. Second, the book merely discusses qualitatively and nonsystematically ideas like positive feedback and increasing returns that were better presented by Brian Arthur. Third, even asymmetric information is not discussed (Ackerlof and Stiglitz are not even mentioned). Fourth (or zeroth), there is not a single empirical graph in the entire book, and nothing of modern ideas of network theory. So I would say that the book is more or less on the same level as Kelly's (pre-bubble-bust) \\"New Rules for the New Economy\\". All of these books implicitly hype the unregulated free market, in the face of both qualitative and empirical evidence that unregulated markets are not only unstable but are detrimental to human health and well-being."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is first time to contact to your company.","review":"Information Rules:A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy by Carl Shapiro.Hal R.

Shapiro and Varian use examples about things like network externalities that have been throughly debunked. For example, their claim that dvorak keyboard being superior to the qwerty keyboard is based upon a study done the department of the Navy when Dvorak headed the study! When this study was first referenced this wasn't understood, but at least since 1990 researchers in the area have known this. Unfortunately, a lot of this book is a decade or more behind the times.Their discussions on price discrimination do the lay reader a disservice because they ignore that many (or most) of the differences in price are actually cost based and have nothing to do with monopoly power. Some of these firms that follow their belief that significant monopoly power is everywhere will be in for a very rude awakening.

This book was very easy to read and is also fun to read if you are familiar with the New York City area.

It's been classified as a crime novel, but its not really. It's more of a coming-of-age novel about three longtime friends, all of whom have their lives thrown into crisis when one of them is being sent up the river on a seven-year bit. The writing is sharp and thoughtful. The book has the feeling of catching a time and place so well that it may be remembered as a small classic.I see that David Benioff is being promoted in the same manner Jay McInerny was a couple decades back: pretty boy author catches the zeitgeist. Movie offers, etc. Benioff has real talent (maybe McInerney did too once upon a moon). I'm hoping Benioff has more dedication to his craft than McInerney did and that he doesn't get sucked up by the Hollywood machine. He could be a real interesting novelist worth keeping an eye on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed character study","review":"I know this book has gotten good reviews, but I just do not know why. This book is not a crime novel; it is not even a novel. It is a failed character study of three friends, who are trying to come to grips with one of them reporting to prison for an inevitable 7 year sentence.Had Benioff delved deeper into each of the three friends, and explored and explained their actions in more detail, I believe the book would have been much more satisfying. As it is, I was left feeling cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books","review":"I had wanted to read this since I had saw the previews of the movie of the same name. I was blown away by Benioff's style and how he brings you inside the hearts and the minds of the characters. My favorite character had to be the frustrated English teacher, he was so realistic. Monty was the ultimate bad guy that we want to root for. This was a powerful novel and another must read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but Sweet","review":"Although just under 200 pages, David Benioff's masterful first novel draws you into a world that you never want to end. Ostensibly a \\"mystery\\" (where else are they gonna shelve it?), \\"The 25th Hour\\" is a book unlike any you have ever read, yet is so familiar and has characters so recognizable that it's like curling up late at night with a warm gun.A voracious reader, I can't stand tin-ear dialogue, and it's that more than anything else that will have me tossing some half-read \\"thriller\\" across the room in frustration. Not one word of Mr. Benioff's novel rings false. I'd rather invest 4 hours in words as beautifully gritty as these than slog my way through the latest 700-page Clancy.Benioff's masterstroke is that, even though you know his \\"protaganist\\" is guilty in all senses of the word, the classic anti-hero, you root for him the entire way.Oh, yeah, the last 20 pages are the best you'll ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"Mr. Benioff's first novel is a powerful portrait of modern day New York, friendship and of the human spirit. His characters are written as though they have real flesh on their bones; which can be a grity reality at times. The plot is fresh, and grips you from beginning to end.

This book is magnificent. I know we've all heard the \\"I couldn't put it down\\" stuff a million times, but that's literally true with \\"The 25th Hour.\\"My only advice is this: skip the jacket copy text; it gives too much away.

Readers are better off approaching it as a work of serious fiction.Judged as such: The writing is occasionally too precious but is often evocative; the characters are somewhat interesting. Middling.Judged as a thriller: The action directs itself towards the conclusion. The problem is that there really is no plot. It only seems to move in a direction when in fact there is no meaningful climax or resolution. It ends up being boring.

No one that I see on a day to day basis can truly be judged in these terms and neither can these characters.The story centers around three friends one of which has been convicted and sentenced to 7 years in prison.There is always the feeling that something violent or disastrous is going to happen.You need to read to see if it does..."},{"rating":"1","title":"mild torture","review":"Well fleshed out characters who do what you think they should do.

Or should I say 'lack of events'. The first 190 pages follow 5 characters going through the paces of their lives the day before one of them starts a 7-year prison sentence. Their lives are largely uneventful, although they were portrayed realistically. Then, in the last 4 pages, some activity occurs and the book ends. There was no real tension, no suspense. The ending was neither shocking nor surprising.

The book doesn't, cannot, support the hype. This book by David Benioff is a cute book. It's not going to be a classic, and will undoubtedly be forgotten in less than 12 months after the release of the movie. Why are the reviewers talking about \\"ringing the cash registers?\\" Is that a valid critical standard for the judging of new fiction?

The 25th hour immediately grabbed my attention and wouldn't let go. The story of 3 friends in New York who have gone down completely different paths is wrapped around the last night of freedom for one of them Monty Brogan a drug dealer who is facing 7 years upstate. His friends, a wall street guy and a nerdish high school English teacher, go out for a night on the town to see him off properly and their respective characters drive the story from there. The dialogue and circumstances that Benioff creates are realistic and credible . There is not a single false note in this novel. Every character resonates and the pages fly by.

Steve has finally given in to Lorraine and accepted that he requires another vet to help run his burgeoning practice. So Lorraine hires a new vet and he and his wife come to Cambridge.

While I think Nelken's book is also a little thin on material, and Tavakoli's book represents a somewhat dated view of the market, both are substantially more educational than this one. My own experience suggests that one is far better off to understand bond/loan trading first, plus some structuring and capital allocation. That is enough to figure out how to trade crederivs. All this hype about the insane risk in these things is crap - it's not substantially more risky than bonds, and people have been in that business for a long time.

I tried every little software program on the net to get it working but still no success.

The hidden content in question Is accessible only to those who break Rock Stars End User Lisence Agreement by using a crack (PC) or using gameshark or Action Replay (Consoles) and requires lenghty strings of codes and takes hours to get to. Though refered to as pornographic (by Anti Game activist Jack Thompson, and Senator Hillary Clinton) the characters keep their clothes on, don't expose any sexual body parts, and the scenes are no raunchier than an episode of Sex in the City.

Unfortunately, I made a poor choice in purchasing the book. What the author skimped on was the actual installation of MSCS.While there isn't room to detail every omission here, the most serious of blunders occurs during his step by step install procedure where he mistakenly tells the reader that the MS Cluster installer is asking for the IP address of the NT workstation that will administer this cluster. This is in fact the IP address of the Cluster itself. This is a serious mistake and will result in the reader giving the IP address of another NT workstation to the Cluster which will ultimately cause an IP conflict.Personally, I would recommend reading the MS documentation several times rather than this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Flavor!","review":"We just tried this for dinner last night and we enjoyed it immensely.

The ads on Nickleodean were great. And the thing is, time isn't stopped, you only perceive it as stopped because your relative time is so fast. The moview will explain it.The acting was real good...

Not a comprehensive book on the subject of writing","review":"I found the book interesting enough for a quick glance, but not fascinating enough to recommend it as a must-have. The book is comprised of excerpts from different sources that deal with the topic of writing. Since Hemingway never wrote extensively on the topic of writing, he considered it bad luck; this is the most thorough book on the subject for Hemingway fans.

The specimen flow charts were very heplful. For each common specimens received in the lab, the flow chart will tell you step by step what to do to ID the organism based on Gram stain, biochemical reactions, colony morphology, etc. It was nice to have all that info in one place instead of having to turn back and forth through several chapters.

It is cheap (you can get one from eBay for $12 shipped) and when it works it works great.The problem I have with the XA601 is when the unit is plugged into the electrical outlet for more than 24 hours the LAN connectivity stops. The only way to fix this is by unplugging the power cord, waiting a few minutes, and plugging it in again.Maybe the XA601 has a problem with overheating - I don't know.

After seeing what this editor did with what can be thought of as something for a beginner (the scarf) I was really excited for Wrap Style.However, this book is really all about the poncho and cape/capelet. When I think of a wrap I think of rectangular and triangular shapes that drape over the shoulders and (silly me) wrap around. Most of this book's patterns fasten together and have a poncho or cape shape. There are a couple that are not in this category -- but they're few.If this book was called Poncho/Cape Style I would give it 4 or 5 stars. The patterns are nice -- it's the deceiving title that's problematic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, BUT.......","review":"There is no doubt there are beautiful photos in this book, and beautiful patterns, but.....the title says for knit AND crochet and by my count there are TWO crochet patterns in the entire book. For a knitter this is great, but for us crocheters, we are shortchanged once again. It is my constant gripe that almost all books that include the terms \\"knit and crochet\\" are knit with a token crochet pattern or two thrown in. With the resurgence of crochet right along with knit, I certainly hope the editors of these lovely books will remedy this. Other than that, I have no complaints. The yarns are yummy, the designs hip and the layout of the book is very nice. But, PLEEZE, balance out the crochet part when it is included in the title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed: only 1 crochet pattern.","review":"The title says \\"....to knit and crochet.\\" Since there are 24 styles, I thought 12 would be to crochet, NO.

They are still beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my taste - but it might be yours","review":"I have Lace Style by the same authors, and I love it. It's got a variety of innovative, wearable designs. Not every design is for me, but there is enough variety that I found several things I like, and I know my friends will find other things they like, etc.With this book, the styles mostly seem very similar, and they just don't appeal to me, except for one crochet style and one simple wrap.I also bought Wrapped in Comfort, which I love, it has light, airy, lovely circular shawls couple with stories I enjoyed reading. Plus I prefer knitting lace vs. intarsia or cables.I think, however, this might just be a matter of taste. If you think you'd like to make capelets, which are definitely in style right now, take a look at both books and see which suits your tastes better, and your knitting pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"The book GOD WHO is more of a collection of essays than an integrated guide, with largely independent chapters on a scattered range of topics. Much of what the author writes consists of aphorisms or throwaway lines that don't withstand deeper consideration, turning out to be banal or just plain wrong. But, I must state that the book is one of the \\"best word-for-word\\" substitutes for the readings of other such biblical manuscripts out there today. The author, I believe, has indicated that there is a considerable degree of doubt in what religion as a whole has taught us. Few subjects arouse resistance and engender more confusion than Bible or religious talk. It's hard to know what to think, or what to do, when we're told these enchanting things by child molesters and other criminally minded people behind the pulpit. At least you can say that the author has exercised his editorial role very responsibly.

All its inhabitants (save Asterix) fall for the con man, who is showered with presents in exchange for favorable predictions. Even Obelix becomes fascinated by the stranger. Eventually, the Romans decide to use the soothsayer to convince the Gauls to flee the village, which they do. When things are becoming real dark for the future of the Gauls, Panoramix (who was in a convention of druids) arrives, and with Asterix plans how to convince the villagers to come back, and get even with the soothsayer (who, imprisoned by a Roman general, who wants him to augur a future as an emperor, isn't going through a good time either). A very good book, overall, that is strongly against gullibility and superstition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fun doesn't get translated","review":"It's one of my favorite comics in French.

Three and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice selection of holiday soul songs","review":"I listened to this CD over the holidays while traveling on a Greyhound bus. It was nice, with a couple of songs I had never heard before. Like Cold December Nights, You Were There and My Gift to You.

The glass is so thin and delicate that they cracked when going from warm water to being rinsed in cold water; this happened with the stemmed wine/tea Portmeirion glasses as well. They all broke in the same place, about 1/2 inch from the top in a complete circle. We are very disappointed and expected better quality than this from Portmeirion (and Amazon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and manipulated.","review":"The music was filmed live over 5 years ago, and out of the 28 songs, I have interest in buying 2.

Way to go, Elaine! Congratulations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a waste of money even for beginner","review":"Sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as Consulting for Dummies. The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant; But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking.

I had to go into the repair center to show them the exact problem and then a week after that it was corrected by adding a capacitor. Now the DVD player is suppose to be compatible with all formats but it is not. The DVD player plays DVD-RW intermitently if at all and sometimes cannot read Disney discs. The repair center replaced the optical reader to no effect, and Kenwood is now asking for me to ship the DVD player to them for testing.

You get to see a party with the ROLLING STONES! You get to see the BEATLES in the studio and on the road! But every once in a while there is some ORIGINAL FOOTAGE by PAUL McCARTNEY! That has to be worth something! But you also get a lame interactive TRIVIA section!

It's a pity he didn't leave it that way.This video is so poorly directed and edited that it is not clear whether you are in Liverpool, London or USA at any given time.Alf MUST have had some interesting memories from three years with The Fabs, but they're not recorded here ... John pinched a bottle of milk, there was a large crowd at Shea Stadium etc.At least half the footage is filled with Alf plodding along a street somewhere, plus many clips from Paul's world tour. (Relevance? Alf went to one concert and Paul spoke to him...)Most of the anecdotes are rehashed (George Harrison didn't like George Martin's tie) and there is little here to interest even a serious Beatles fan.Spend your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of OK","review":"This DVD is OK in the information dept. Lots of re-hashing of the age-old Beatle tail, but this fellow was there for a chunk of it all. Drove them around, brought them their dinner, runner- go-fer, drove them up to met Elvis. On the sideline but a fairly interesting side and your glad he survived it, some didn't. His tour of Liverpool is quaint and silly but it's the most I've seen of the place in one sitting. This DVD also obviously has a fairly large endorsement by McCartney. He's let Alf use segments of his solo music as background as well as snippets from what looks like early 90's live footage. Pretty nice of Paul helping out his old driver.

While this DVD is superior in audio and video quality to the multiple VHS versions I own, it is missing a total of five minutes! The sex scenes are cut down to nothing, which is a real shame because they contain some magnificently cheesy dialog and acting, and their absence really takes away from the powerfully trashy experience that is \\"Fugitive Girls\\".

I got this set for my husband and it looks great when you open it up. Nice case, though made of cardboard, and nicely packaged. Looks like it's all metal. He used it right away. First problem was the grill brush fell apart when he scrubbed the grill. Literally the bristles pulled off the brush and fell into the grill. But we pressed on. The metal skewers melted on medium heat on the grill. The handles must have been attached by glue or something, and after a couple of minutes, the handles melted and fell off. There was nothing on the package to indicate that the skewers were decorative only, so logically you should have been able to put the metal skewers on the grill. Overall just a disappointment. We'll be returning.

With a mellow but deep, clean industrial sound and dark vocals, the band has a gothic sound that I've found many people enjoy listening to. Despite all the good things I can say about it, I have heard a few complaints concerning this album from people before. Some people, namely those with an outstanding dislike of pop-music have said that Beborn Beton has been taking a road in that direction since their older, darker albums. I still enjoy this music more than most but I believe that their previous works were a bit more to my liking.

This is where Michael Tait's voice starts to sound different. One reason why this cd is not one of my favorites is because their first was \\"in your face\\" and FREE AT LAST is diverse this cd is neither and the first song on the cd is almost like the track TIME TA JAM but an overlook of thecd if you like their earlier material or if you're a DC Talk fan you should buy this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever they do is AWESOME","review":"DC Talk is great, all their CD's are worth listening to.

But after searching around, I ended up purchasing the 6gb sansa. Its interface is very user friendly and I have had no problems with it. It is a bit irritating that I can only charge it by usb, but, on the up side, I've found that it holds its charge much longer than I ever anticipated.

Downloading songs from Napster is occasionally hit and miss, but it's easy to drag and drop mp3 files from my hard drive.

They do not provide or even have a charger for the device. You must charge it from a computer USB port. You can NOT use the device while it is being charged.The worst part is what happens when the battery dies when you are actively using the device. When you plug it into the computer for recharging, nothing happens. It will not recharge. You must reset the device by removing and re-installing the battery and then it will charge. To remove and re-install the battery you must have micro Phillips Head screw driver. The micro screws are so tiny that it all too easy to lose them and then it impossible to find them.Until they fix these problem I can not recommend buying this device.

It just stopped turning on by day six. The second one didn't last a week either and it also stopped turning on. Sandisk obviously doesn't care about quality control, since both players malfunctioned in under seven days. And yes, the batteries were charged and I did not in any way damage the player to cause the problems.I'm returning my piece of trash and requesting a refund that I will probably spend on an i pod.

OS X didn't even complain when I disconnected the device \\"improperly\\". The device has a number of nice features, but I hardly got to use them, much less did I get to experience the infamous firmware bugs I keep reading about, thanks to its complete incompatibility with OS X. There is absolutely no reason why Windows should be able to simply see this MP3 player as a removable drive when it doesn't even exist to OS X.

They all require you to move to the \\"open\\" Windows XP/WMP 10 system. I would love to have someone tell me why this is better than iPod/iTunes.I would consider other players if they integrate (not just mount as a hard disk) and allow me to buy (can't use any Windows Media Audio buying services) on my MacBook Pro without launching Windows XP.For the Mac user, Apple had to create iPod/iTunes to allow us to enjoy music and they accidentally created a huge market that loves industrial design and focus on user experience.Napster, Urge, Sony Connect, Yahoo Music - Not Mac OS X Compatible.Buy an iPod!"},{"rating":"1","title":"expansion slot only uses \\"microsd cards\\" 2gb max.","review":"CAUTION-- The Sansa website states \\"that all \\"microsd\\" and \\"microsdhc\\" cards may be used with the e200 series players\\".

I can't really complain about those two things. It's got so many features that I thought $180 for the player was a steal.My only complaint (and a big one at that) is the sound quality this player transmits. I use Shure E4C earphones, and they definitely expose a bad source. The sound on this player compared to the iAudio X5L that I sold doesn't even compare (i've tried the iriver clix too, and that thing also sounds way better). The sound is very flat and muffled to my ears, it lacks any aggressiveness or warmth that i've been accustomed to.

I liked the book overall but I found it very hard to believe some of the things Mrs.Campbell described....Not only did Hosanna befriend a Jewish woman back in the 1930's her daughter has a white woman for a best friend and her sister is married to a mexican. The rich white man and the dude that washes his car are all \\"buddy buddy\\" and confide in one another, and let's not forget the ghost of the mother just pops up and controls her daughters every move from the grave. Like I said I liked the novel overall but there were some things that could've stayed buried with Hosanna...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Much Going On In This Book!!!","review":"It took me so long to finally finish this book. It wasnt because it was over 500 pages either. This book started out real good with Hosanna, but once she stopped talking, so did the book. I think the story line had good intentions, but some of the characters could have been left out like Asia, Sam, Jolie just to name a few. In real life, Kent would've never been hired again from a company he stole from and tried to blackmail. The ending of this book seemed to come together... I have read Brothers and Sisters, and it was good, but this one left alot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"I read \\"Your Blues Ain't Like Mine\\" with awe and appreciation -- a spectacular book that has stayed with me for years. I expected the same quality of writing, story and that magical touch that makes so very few books special when I started this one. The writing is still wonderful, but the plot is not much better than a Danielle Steele potboiler. It could have been improved by judicious pruning of way too many stereotypical characters and way too many storylines magically tied up in the last 30 pages. Ms. Campbell has the voice to tell a rich and vibrant story -- I hope she does so in her next effort. This one falls short of her gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaaaaaaay too long","review":"Yes, the book had an interesting storyline, however, it could have been told in about 250-300 pages. There was NO need for the book to be as long as it was. Sometimes, when you have too many details, you lose your audience and your audience forgets what your point was in the first place. I mean, did I really need to visualize exactly how Vonette's house was decorated? Not really. That information was not relevant. There were constant examples of too many details that I actually started skimming my way through until I got to something relevant. I even read another book while trying to finish this book. The ONLY reason I finished this book is because my job is very slow during the summer months so I had a lot of free time. If you have lots of free time with nothing to do, by all means, read this book. If you're looking for a quick read that holds your interest, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book. You will enjoy it.","review":"I found this to be a very good book that ended wonderfully. Some of the other reviews said that it was too long and too detailed but I think the character development was perfect. The author followed each character to the end of the book. In my opinion, it is very well written. The book was recommended to me by a friend who said it was the best she had ever read. I wouldn't go that far, but do recommend it as a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't finish it!!!","review":"I'm at page 150 and have decided to take a break from this novel. I can't keep going. The novel starts off slow, but it is interesting when Hosanna's character is narrating the story. When Matriece's character takes over the story seems to go downhill and I'm bombarded with substories which are boring and seemingly irrelevant to the central theme of the book. Maybe I'll come back to it later or slowly try to finish it, but for now I'm moving on to another book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Campbell did an excellent job with this book.

I was mildly annoyed because I was feeling that the story was too long and that it should end already, but I continued to read and it started coming together and I became emotionally involved and I had to grab some tissue at least twice. I have to give it its due. This book has it all - an interesting plot, great character development, and a very satisfying ending. It is likely one that I'll remember for a long time to come. Kudos to the late Ms. Campbell. The quality of her literary work is surely missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z-Z-Z...","review":"This book began in such a powerful way. The first hundred pages are an excellent story of friendship and betrayal. You really feel for these women and I wished that Hosanna and Gilda had developed their own companies and competed that way. But Hosanna died and took the wonderfulness of the book with her. The story takes a Judith Krantz turn with all these characters that seem to have nothing to do with the story of Gilda and Hosanna. Though excellently written, the story becomes all powder and fluff. Perhaps this is to show how surface people in this industry are. I'm trying to finish this book but too much time is spent on these vapid characters that I'm just not feeling. The story becomes like everything else out there. What a shame for a book with such a promising start.

This one starts of light-weight, and drifts along in fairly uninspiring manner, definitely more soul than funk. The new vocals are not as good as what has come before. Just as I was about to give up on it, someone gave Richard Bailey (or a drum machine) a slap, and all of a sudden off they go, funkin it all up big time. Couple of stormin tracks ('specially track 8) and some fluid latin stuff almost makes it a buy, but out of 14 odd tracks it ain't good enuf. Apart from a few highlights, overall it has a formularised churned out feel. I'd like to see the band get a couple of new players in to give a new dimension to the sound.

He playfully mocks those who lurk in churchyards, hoping to record a whisper from the grave and give themselves a thrill at the same time. \\"Food for the Dead\\" seeks to explore how concepts like \\"modern\\" vampirism and other legends develop and exist, using genealogical research and good sense.

You found it, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique read","review":"Forget everything you know about vampires and join the author on his 20 year investigation of \\"vampire\\" stories in New England. In an age where germ theory was not yet understood and rural communities at the edges of established Puritan religion struggled to make sense of consumption (tuberculosis) as it decimated entire families and regions, old folk remedies and legends led to the exhumation of the dead and the burning of hearts and lungs. Folklorist-historian Bell does an excellent job of researching these events and placing them within their historical context while bringing alive the human emotional response to the drama and horror involved. Definitely a worth while read and very eye-opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol' rhetoric","review":"This is truely the worst compilation of \\"anything\\" Hitler said.My biggest complaint is I ordered a cheaper, used version and they slammed me with a new one for over $40.00!Maybe if this was a $9.95 deal it would be worth my while.Nothing new is revealed.

The encounter between the reality, and the expectations. The reaction, and the change of the perception of life. Cynic, aggressive, with no limits, which make them and her (Claudia) stronger and at the same time weaker. Because they have created strong self defense to the rest of the world, but behind the lustro is the wounded soul, Achilles heel. The sexuality, and the free expession of it is the most significant reaction based on the new dimension, where nothing really matters, there are no values and your way is down down down to the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs (Revised Review)","review":"I loved the song selections and I originally did not give this album a good review.

Teague, reviewing the other edition, including that this book has some beautiful photographs of Sea Shells, and is not an ID field guide. Only critical point is this book has been published several times in different editions and formats and under more than one title, often with abridged contents. Not nearly as impressive in oversized trade paper binding, The full hardcover version is fantastic. I've seen the (1st edition, 1968) early edition with tipped in photo lithographs. Odd and bulky in that form, but a conversation piece. A possibly better, and less expensive way to go is this concise hard cover edition under the title \\"The Shell: Gift of the Sea\\" Abradale/Abrams 1984 ISBN 0-8109-8058-4. Essentially the same book as \\"The Shell: 500 Million Yeas of Inspired Design\\".

I literally laughed twice. That's it. I was very disappointed because Wil Ferrell can usually make me laugh with his stupid antics, but this movie is horrible. Mark Wahlberg is the same character in EVERY movie he does. He is, without a doubt, America's worst actor. Avoid this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"The writers here should congratulate themselves on making one of the most incomprehensible comedies of all time. Normally I would give a lot of credit to a film which really tried to address the current thievery going on in Wall Street firms, but the insertion of these complex themes into a slapstick buddy cop film is exactly the train wreck you would expect it to be.Aside from the absurdity regarding the overall theme, the storyline rumbles along from one scene to the next with no continuity. The jokes are unfunny and painfully lame. The acting? Phoned in performances across the board."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Ok let me start off by stating I have loved, I mean really loved all Will Ferrell movies and all his SNL skits.. Seriously this was the worst movie I have ever seen in my 32 yrs on this earth. I kept watching only hoping it would start to get good, did not happen! I don't know how this could be so bad considering the amazing cast, please do not be fooled by the names in this movie. All writers and directors were high or really drunk when written/made. Acting was bad, nothing to do with the actors, pretty sure it was just the script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly good","review":"Don't get me wrong, my wife and I are big fans of Will Farrell. Even when the movies themselves aren't great, he makes us laugh. I completely realize that there are people who don't like Farrell -- but this movie might -- MIGHT -- make those people laugh. Here Mark Wahlberg takes on the more outburst-y role while Farrell plays it a bit more reserved. Both roles give these guys moments to shine.I actually didn't expect this movie to be as good as it turned out -- it seemed a little below the radar leading up to its release. But it has all the stuff that makes a Farrell movie great -- repeatable lines, improvised stuff, and perhaps best of all his relationship with his wife and Wahlberg's response to the ludicrous nature of it.Anyway -- worth renting if you haven't seen it, and worth getting for those Farrell-friends that you have in your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"The language was terrible, the script was awful, and the plot was so unimaginative I couldn't finish this piece of garbage.

I have deeply enjoyed both of the lead actors in the past and they have given stellar performances in other movies. That being said they were the wrong people for this movie, (they did not look the part) and the story had too many \\"blank spots\\" where nothing was happening... other than Jerry Lewis silly slap-stick humor. If there was a story or plot, I missed it, and there was to much air between the funny parts. Even the car crashes were so \\"technically augmented\\" with tight shots and smearing video that the \\"apparent action\\" was a waste of time. Sorry, save your money and buy some candy outside the movie theater instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have used more of everything","review":"Too long by half and not nearly as funny; the idea could have been priceless if not so clumsily mishandled/vastly overworked. Talk about beating a dead horse (a phrase I've never understood but in this context...). I kept forgetting that there was actually a case needing to be solved. Instead, countless distractions, yelling, prank playing, endless issues with a wife and a girlfriend. But yes, they finally did solve their case...only I forgot what it was in the meantime. I will say, as a concession, that Mark Wahlberg was funny while Will Ferrell faded into the background (little better than a prop).Most definitely NOT a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so awful...","review":"I had heard that this was a funny movie and given the people in the movie you would have thought there would be some really good stuff.Unfortunately, that's not what happened. I guess this movie was made for kids who don't have a developed sense of humor yet and that the truly ridiculous strikes their funny bone like a grandfather clock chimes on the hour.To be completely honest, there were a few moments that were worth a chuckle but only because they were so absurd you couldn't do anything else but laugh... or just turn off the movie.This would be a movie I would suggest be in the rental column, and only if you got it for less than $1 because otherwise you'll be in the same boat as me with a raging case of buyer's remorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!

That's right, I turned it off before it was over-and I almost never do that. (I even watched the whole movie of \\"All About Steve\\"). It's too bad because the ideas and concepts of the movie could have been very funny but they simply are so poorly done that it is a really bad movie.Honestly, I am embarrassed for the actors involved, especially Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Michael Keaton, and Eva Mendes. I really like Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, but this movie was horrendous.The only reason I gave my review 2 stars instead of 1 star is because I remember laughing really hard at two jokes/sequences at the very beginning of the movie-but I can't even remember what they were now.Please don't waste the time-You will regret wasting your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Other Guys, a disaster.","review":"The Other Guys was a disaster in story and comedy.

It's an overall funny buddy cop film that will make you chuckle consistently but offers few large laughs.

I heard several good things and some of the previews for The Other Guys provided a nice chuckle or two, but this movie as a whole did not perform up to expectations.Now, first of all I'll admit I love Will Ferrell movies. Okay, maybe not all of them. But yes, he makes me laugh. I loved Taladega Nights and Step Brothers has become one of my all time faves. This one though, not so much. There are some funny bits here and there. Mark Wahlberg, Eva Mendes, and Michael Keaton provided some funny moments with their respective characters, but not enough to for me to enjoy the film. If you like funny buddy cop movies and want to laugh, then maybe this might work for you. But really, you could probably do better with something else.

I love Will Ferrell movies and thought that this was going to be much like his other movies. Though it does have some of his classic antics a good protion of this film had a lot of witty jokes that I an accounting major found very funny. Unfortunately the others I had seen the movie with either didn't get the jokes or didn't find many of them as humorous as I did. Some of the jokes were a little dry for their taste, but the parts in which Will Ferrell's character always seems to get the attractive women we all found funny and seems to fallow classic Will Ferrell style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for great but was painfully unfunny","review":"I know I will get a lot of flack for it but I may have laughed only once.

The only thing I did enjoy was Eva Mendes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 stars, I would!!!","review":"If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this might be worth a couple bucks (and I mean a couple - including shipping)...but if you're looking for something to entertain you, look elsewhere! Will Farrell is worse than sub-par...he is flat out disappointing. The rest of the casting is pretty terrible too! The language is raunchy, the jokes awful, and the acting TERRIBLE!!The fact that I have NEVER written a review on a movie before should say something about the magnitude of my disappointment - I immediately put this DVD back up for sale. By the way...what a waste of Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, and Eva Mendez...I'm very disappointed that they would sacrifice their good track record with this garbage of a script.Save yourself the trouble and buy something actually worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farce within a farce","review":"About 45 minutes into this movie, I literally stopped watching do to lack of interest! Can't remember ever doing that, but this movie, like alot of Ferrell's movies just don't work. You can clearly and plainly see the ATTEMPT at humour here, it just very very seldom payed off. His actions as the extreme nerdy cop are the farce within the overall farce of a cop movie. You can clearly see where the laughs are supposed to come, they just never do. Ferrell needs to reassess the movies he does...or some writer/director needs to figure out how to better harness his brilliant comedic wit, because none of his movies have done it yet (Talladega Nights and others have there moments though). There needs to be a way to let him do his hilarious farce stints, while still keeping the movie sharp and witty, rather than blatant farce comedy, where the over-the-topness of the joke IS the punchline. It can be done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny.","review":"The previews made the movie look pretty funny, but all of the preview's funniness was used up in about 45 minutes.

The casting is great and everyone played off each other so well. It was refreshing to see Will act more \\"normal\\" than his usual over-the-top crazy to get a laugh. The script was well written and over-all it was an entertaining movie. I think Walhberg is very talented and I typically enjoy any movie with him in it (especially when he makes cameo's in his own produced show Entourage). I wish Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson had bigger parts in this movie.Overall, Will and Mark made for an enjoyable cop movie and I hope there is a follow-up release...the end kind of hinted at \\"yeah, there might be a part 2 if this one does well.\\"I do wonder...how did that Prius get so shot up and never have a tire shot out? :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious cop buddy movie","review":"Mark Wahlberg is hilarious with his character's hidden talents, Will Ferrell is a comedic genius not even realizing how many hot women want him....and the cameo of Samuel L.

And at the end, the tired old capitalists-are-bad construction from, forever ironically, wealthy Hollywood-based capitalists; all the bad stuff was the result of Evil Corporations.

You have to know in advance, that there are big stars in this movie, who are capable of very serious upscale performances. There are none of those kinds of performances in this movie. Just fun, silly, have a beer and pizza, laugh out loud and say \\"did that just happen\\" humor. I really enjoyed it. I think for under $20 this is a good buy. If you like SNL, you will like this movie. If you just want to laugh, and you dont care if it has potty humor, get it. View it with a light heart. Dont read in to it.

The previews looked so promising and the movie did not deliver. Mark Wahlberg called in his performance coming across as robotic at times when delivering his lines. The worst part is they held Will Ferrell back, almost as if they put a muzzle on him and did not allow him to do what he does best, go crazy and be funny. They had him playing almost the straight man which is completely a waste of his talent. There were a few clever, funny bits especially with Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson but not enough to save this movie.

We've seen it several times and still enjoy it. We don't like all of Will Ferrell's movies, but we love all of Mark Wahlberg's (as far as we know), so we're unbiased in this review. I know it's received mixed reviews, which honestly shocked us. Their characters are just hilarious, every cast member absolutely perfect for his or her role. Eva Mendes was gorgeous and the scenes with her are unforgettable. Michael Keaton was awesome in his role. Don't want to give too much away, but it's worth watching at least once. We thought the plot was unique, there are too many hilarious lines to count, and the credits made us love it even more! 4 very enthusiastic thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action Comedy","review":"You will either love or hate this movie, there is not much room in between.There is some foul language, so it is not a family movie.

The start of the movie with action scene was a good start and i was hoping for more but throughout the entire 90 mins, it was just BAD humor.

Not impressed and Wills' career is on life support.."},{"rating":"1","title":"How About ZERO Stars?","review":"Wasted good money watching this in the theatre and it was horrible, other than the whole wife thing with Eva Mendes, this film was an absolute piece of garbage and I wouldn't own this movie in my collection if you paid me.

The three or four funny moments in no way made up for the fact that this movie flat out sucked. The plot was non-existant, which I could overlook if the movie is one funny scence after another, this was not. I am so glad that I waited to get it from Redbox, and didn't waste $20 at the movie theater. Badly timed humor litters this movie. It is like a bad SNL sketch that just keeps going and going. Do not rent / watch this movie, you will be disapointed. If you want to see a good Will Ferrell movie, watch Step-Brothers (that is a laught a minute movie from start to finish). If you want a good Mark Wahlberg flick, then chose The Fighter, or The Departed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"I was looking forward to this movie. It sounded pretty good.

This movie is a classic case of a comedy needing a good editor. No wait, scratch that; this movie could have even benefited by having a LOUSY editor. Even a lousy editor would know that the comic bits in The Other Guys run way too long, killing any kind of comedic value, and that many of its scenes make absolutely no sense and don't move the \\"story\\" along.

We found practically not a single moment that could even illicit a smile, let alone a belly laugh. There is absolutely nothing about this film that I could recommend, it has no energy, no color, and the attempts at humor play like a home-made film from a midwestern middle school. The senseless attempts at comic relief function at no more than an adolescent level, and yet much of the the content is adult.This is a terrible film, and not worth $.99, let alone 4 or 5 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my faith in movies after this one...","review":"To get right to the point... this movie is terrible. Just awful - not funny at all. I just don't understand how some people can say this was a funny movie. Besides the few funny scenes they showed in the commercials - there was nothing else funny at all. After spending good money to see this piece of garbage, I went the rest of the summer without seeing a movie. I wanted to see Salt, The Expendables, and other movies, but I just lost all faith in movies after this dumpage and didn't want to waste any more of my money. I finally went back to the theaters a few weeks ago and saw \\"The Town\\". That was a GOOD movie.

How many chase scenes, serious and spoofed have been seen in the past 60 years with all really badly resembling each other - well, OK the car models change every year and each chase seems more and more like \\"how unrealistic can you get\\". Well, OK every so often someone sets the bar higher but those studios are probably in France.I also agree with a lot of viewers that the directing/editing seemed like a hodgepodge of deleted scenes with really tenuous connectivity.Acting, even of the spoof kind, seemed so tiresomely predictably stereotypic. Nothing like formula for a few bucks when the Hollywood mansion pool(s) needs cleaning.Story? Two inept losers becoming heros - for the 1023rd iteration and not a spark of creative rendition anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny and Not for 12 year olds","review":"Kids are attracted to it as it looks like a good 'cops and robbers' movie.

I do have to agree it is a little silly and very unrealistic, but then again isn't that Comedy is supposed to be. Will Farrell plays his normal role as an \\"idiotic\\", it's what he does, detective partnered with Mark Wahlberg. Both have been assigned to desk duty for their various screw ups.I won't go into the plot because I hate spoilers and it would take away from the comedy of the movie. All I have to say is don't approach this with the mind set that it is just another stupid comedy like most of the others out today as I did when I first rented it. I couldn't stop laughing, and yes most is the \\"stupid\\" humor that is in all WIll Farrell movies, but Farrell and Wahlberg work very well together and play off each other for some creative moments.4 stars.*Minor Spoiler*The \\"Rock\\" and Samuel L Jackson don't play a major role throughout the whole movie. Just a warning if you are getting this to see them."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY FUNNY DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS DVD.... I LAUGHED FROM BEGINNING TO END.

There were many funny lines in the movie, but the humor could not compare to the boring story. The acting was lacking, the plot predictable, and the overall film was drawn out and dull. That being said, if you are a fan of Will Ferrell, I'd give the film a shot because it is similar to many of his other movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Other Guys Disappointed","review":"We were looking forward to watching this movie...Will Farrell and Mark Wahlberg are 2 of our favorites. We were disappointed in this movie; the comedy to us was flat and kind of boring. Sometimes, however, a repeated viewing helps you appreciate a movie more, so maybe we should give it another try.

Would it be because of a long tradition of frauds, forgeries and lies? The great deception of evolution is entering the 21st Century and finding that the theory is falling apart while the claim for true answers is growing.

I found the story slow in unfolding (too much time in the early part of the book repetitively setting things up regarding Max's \\"condition\\") and the characters difficult to embrace. There were some redeeming moments - the descriptions of turn of the century San Francisco, the return throughout to the theme defined in that terrific opening sentence, but overall I expected more and have found myself unable to enthusiastically recommend this book over others I have recently finished reading (such as \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" and \\"The Kite Runner\\" to name two)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable but you can find better books out there....","review":"This book had a promising concept but failed to deliver.

I am ordering his other book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this with trepidation","review":"The idea of a person aging backwards went against my scientific nature. How is this possible? Then I went to a book talk with Mr. Greer and was completely enchanted. He is a wonder person to speak with and went into so much detail about the research he did for the history part of this book.OK, so I bought the book so I could speak with him as he autographed it!! You caught me!I could not put this book down! It kept me reading and reading to find out what was going to happen next. Great book! You should read this one and simply suspend your disbelief regarding the premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I waited a week before reviewing this beautiful novel...","review":"Because I've made the mistake of fawning over a book, then fading in my enthusiasm, I decided to give it some time before hopping around with excitement. If anything, my memory of the story has warmed. You can read elsewhere about the novel's conceit. Andrew Sean Greer's talent is in making that conceit work so well - and doing it with style and language that just glows. Here's a warning: I felt somewhat confused and skeptical for the first third of the book. This is, again, one of those novels that you need to embrace for long stretches, as the atmosphere is designed to pull you in, not just entertain you for a few pages at a time as you doze off before bed. If you commit to the book, you'll be overcome with real emotion in the final third of the story. (I zipped out and bought Greer's first novel just to make sure I'd have it when the mood hit me.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanting, but BORing!!!","review":"Yes, the writing is exquisite and enchanting, and I really wanted to \\"like\\" this book, but it is a TOTALLY BORing story. I could not and did not want to finish this book. I am referring to the audio CD version. For me, a \\"good\\" book is one that makes me want to rush to my car before work/after work/on shopping trips to hear the next installment. Having \\"Max\\" in the CD drive, I walked a little more slowly, took fewer shopping trips. This book was a chore to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute joy to read","review":"I am in grad school, busy reading assignments, yet the draw of Max Tivoli was too powerful. After reading a wonderful review, I couldn't wait to get started and I am so glad I did! Max Tivoli is one of my all-time favorite books, next to The Man Who Fell In Love with the Moon by Tom Spanbauer (sp?). This book is an absolute joy. Buy it, then be prepared to buy it again and again as you share it with everyone who you can think of...it is a wonderful escape.If only college textbooks were as engaging and fun to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Are each the love of someone's life","review":"The book is about loss, hope, and above all things, love. The Confessions of Max Tivoli is a heartbreaking confession of a man's love for the love of his life. It showed us the strength of love and how it could overcome any obstacles that lie head. How one man is willing to sacrifice his life, family, and friends to be with the woman he loved.The Story is paced well with well structured character development. The Central them of \\"Love\\" is well carried throughout the whole novel. It starts with the line \\" We are each the love of someone's life\\" filled with hope and love and ends with the same line as well, only this time it was heartbreaking. Sometimes the story jumps from time to time so it might cause a little confusion, but in the end, everything will come together and the experience is pround."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wins the prize for most maudlin book ever...","review":"Bleh! I don't understand the glowing reviews. The idea behind this book could have made for an excellent story; but the main character, Max Tivoli, is horrible. He is a weepy, miserable whiner. Sure the writing is colorful, but that doesn't make up for Max's incessant complaining. Even when he is supposed to be happy he comes across as miserable and utterly pessimistic. The entire book essentially consists of the main character/narrator feeling sorry for himself.Couldn't stand this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions of Max Tivoli","review":"Wow!

And a sweet story.Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This story had me hooked from Page 1","review":"Unique plot, beautiful prose and characters who live and breathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overated","review":"I was tempted to stop reading after the first 50 pages, but I kept thinking something interesting would happen. Nothing does. If you find yourself in the same situation, save yourself some time and stop. Better yet, don't even start. As another reveiewer said, there are much better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF A GREAT IDEA","review":"I want to start by saying that I still feel I am missing something with this book. Maybe it's my fault that I absolutely felt nothing for these characters. The writers style is sooo tedious. It's all flowery description, that is wonderful at first, but after a while you want some kind of forward progression in the story. Even two-thirds into the story, I was still waiting for some reason to pick this book up again and keep reading. I don't have a lot of time to read so I really pick my books carefully and, except for a few choice sentences, I just regret the time I spent on this souless story that seemed to have so much promise. What a waste of a great story idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"I must agree with Charles Weinstein, who posted his review on March 22, 2004. Rather than paraphrase what he so eloquently and perceptively found lacking in Greer's book, I would simply direct those who might be swayed by the gushing, glowing reviews to read his before buying this disappointing work. Such a promising premise - and yet the characters left me caring not a whit for them, or what ultimately became of them. Having just finished The Time Traveler's Wife and You Remind Me of Me, this book seemed liked an apt continuation of the theme - time and place disjointed, the placement of characters we care about in impossible situations. I gave up after 175 pages, read the last page, and moved on to the next book on my shelf - Peace Like a River. Higher hopes abound."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Not the Only One","review":"To the reviewer who asked if they were the only one: the answer is no, you're not!I had--if not high--at least moderate expectations for this book. I love speculative fiction and enjoy slow-paced, rich novels. But \\"plodding\\" is indeed the correct term for this plot.I felt oddly disconnected from all of the characters and had no sympathy for anyone. Often, the prose was very self-aware. This is a book looking for a great editor.Such an interesting premise that never came to fruition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flowery language and eratic time changing but interesting","review":"I picked this novel for our book club and 100% of the participants had difficulty getting through the book. The language is very flowery and overly descriptive and some people complained because they couldn't figure out how old Max was at some points in the book. It was an interesting concept and we did have a good discussion however. I have to admit, I have thought about the book since so it can't be that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ssssssnore!","review":"I'm having such a hard time staying awake, and caring about Max. If there's a story to tell - - tell it! Stop skipping and hopping around from the present to the future and back again. And what does everyone find so enthralling about how this book is written? Get this: \\"But I could not be stopped. She swam like a mermaid in the swamp-tank of my dreams.\\" - - What??? Greer's photo on the flap is one of a handsome, young man. I would have sworn this book was written by a crotchety forever-old man (maybe like Max). I am SO TIRED of wasting Good money on Bad books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Curious?","review":"I have not read this book, however I did read the novella by F. Scott Fitzgerald, \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\", and I'm wondering.....is it just me or does this book have the exact same plot?"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Grow Old","review":"The best thing about this novel is the sublime and accomplished writing. Greer is certainly a master at conveying the complexities of life and how the heart, in a fully-realized life, is always completely engaged. Max is a one-of-a-kind character that never fails to involve us in his unique life. A most rewarding reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This is one of the best pry bars for trim I have ever used.

I am a violinist seeking tips on dealing with performance nerves, but I am starting to think that \\"nerves\\" are a subset of different types of \\"stress\\" which we experience through the journey of life. The concept that sometimes we want to hold on to our problems rather than really fix them struck a chord with me. Perhaps it is easier to blame our \\"stress problem\\" for disappointments in our personal and professional lives, rather than actually finding a way to overcome the problem and tackle life head-on (there would be nothing to blame then, if we fail ... but accepting the possibility of failure opens you up to the possibility of success)."},{"rating":"2","title":"tease tease tease","review":"The \\"Soprano on Her Head\\" is just the thing to help gain perspective on what it means to be a functional and social musician. Very nicely written; it's like a literary box of chocolates: take one topic at a time, or devour the whole book in one go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky but worthwhile","review":"The author suggests unconventional ways of dealing with musician's nagging problems, such as, self doubt or technical plateaus. Her approach and ideas are a bit quirky but useful. She challenges musicians to step outside the conventional pedagogy box to explore solutions in fresh ways. Hidden under this new way of addressing problems is the feeling of empowerment musicans will gain if they listen to her advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best, but fans will like it.","review":"I've listened to this album many times. I've tried to give it a chance. I just don't see this as her best work. After a while all of the songs begin to sound the same.The most moving song on the album is \\"Visitor from Heaven\\" about Wendy Hope, a baby girl who lived just a short time in the fall of 1991.Many of the songs seem too contrived, or unnatural. It's as if Paris is trying too hard.I mean Twila no disrespect. I like her music. While I do not hesitate to recommend her other work, I'm unable to speak as highly of this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Guys","review":"Twila Paris is a very gifted and prolific songwriter but I was sorry I bought this CD. I listened and listened to this CD and I was highly disappointed. This CD is VERY rock oriented.If you were to erase the lyrics and just listen to the music you would not be able to distinguish it from a hard-rock album. Most people buy the CD because they have heard \\"God Is In Control\\" and have heard it was her best album, but I advise that you save your money. I really do not think its worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Piece Character Song Carnival","review":"This a great collection of songs, sung by the characters. A must have for any One Piece fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Travel Companion","review":"Have made my way through several books on travel photography lately, undoubtedly the best I have read!! There are many other books available which are useless when it comes to being practical. This book is not a picture book, just very informative. Recently I went away for another trip overseas and actually lugged this book along for the ride. Susan lets you in on good places to start for every major country in the world and also places to avoid...incredibally usefull. More handy then a 'lonely planet' for photographers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"If you're interested in tips on how to approach buyers and sell photographs, then this book will have some interesting insights for you. However, if you're simply interested in taking better pictures then you will find very little of interest. The book is sparsely illustrated (no color photographs at all and very few b&w), and there is very little useful technical information.Certainly Ms. McCartney has had many varied experiences, but there is not enough material here to create an interesting book; she discusses the many places that she has visited (an impressive list), but fails to discuss any particular area in any meaningful depth.If you want advice on selling stock photos to XYZ company then this might be the book for you. If you want to improve your photography skills or are looking for artistic inspiration/guidance then you'll be disappointed. Much more highly recommended in National Geographic Photography Field Guide, which contains everything that this book lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"very few advices...","review":"This book was a disappointment... Yes of course McCartney is talking about travel photography and gives a few -good- advices but the book is a real pain to read. She keeps talking about herself and how great she is and how many countries she traveled and another couples of very useless stories. Also some points are very discutable.... p23 \\"You don't have to be handsome or beautiful to be a successful photographer, but you should strive to be as physically attractive and well-groomed as you can be.\\"To conclude, there are very few photographies, B/W, outdated and some of them not very interesting at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and very thorough, some color photos would be nice","review":"If you want to dive into the world of travel photography or brush up this is an excellent book. It is full of information, not only on the technical side with lighting tips with the use of flash and film, the difference in what to expect between color and black and white, but also includes tidbits on where to travel, suggestions on what to carry to minimise loss of luggage. In addition the self assignments are instructive and very useful. One minor quirk the lack of color photos, i guess this was done to keep the price of the book down given its size but a few color photos would have added emphasis espicially when discussing general color filter use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gensis of Kirk Whalum's recording career","review":"If you are reading this than you must either be like me, a real fan or someone who has a great deal of time to waste. I bought this CD after owning all of Kirk's other work. It is not easy to obtain an authentic CD. But when I did, I was happy I did. I had never heard the hit Rodeo the first track on the CD. There are others on this that I enjoyed. I enjoyed Kyles Smiles (written for his son who is now quite a bass player, now 20+ yrs old) and Floppy Disk. A real collector should own this. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmemorable ................","review":"The only reason Kirk got his recording career started with this cd is because smooth jazz was lacking the quality it has today. If someone tried to start their career now with something like this they would sink without trace. The specific reasons don't matter.

Short on insight and long on self-admiration, \\"A View from the Monastery\\" turns out to be no more than a look in the mirror for its author. If you enjoy reading books which celebrate the destruction of monastic culture and present tendentious arguments in favor of the shallow pseudoliberation of the 1960s, this is the book for you. (P.S. I didn't much like it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A View INTO the Monastery","review":"Br Benet provides not so much a view of the world FROM the monastery as one of the monastery itself from within. Smoothly written, this book is a kind of memoir which may serve as a rudimentary introduction to much of contemporary Catholic monasticism. (Not every community, naturally, is mirrored in Tvedten's book - this much he says, and should be expected.) Nonetheless, \\"View\\" must be read critically, as it is very much the particular view of one man.One serious shortcoming, from the Catholic doctrinal standpoint, is Br Benet's treatment of homosexuality. Lacking some important nuances, a reader might be misled about the Church's teaching on human sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes interesting but light reading.","review":"The book has some funny stories in it. It flows pretty good and is not hard to read. But it has some of the same problems as Kathleen Norris's books. Too much on how monks are \\"just like everybody else\\". Why are they monks then? Also some bad language that seems to just be there for shock value, like in a movie for teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's is one of all you need to the A.'.A.'. system","review":"This book one of the most important tool to follow the system of the A.'.A.'..

This book gives you the path of the AA down pat. Gives you all of the references and puts everything in front of you so that you can be practicing the art, rather than looking all over trying to find what you should be studying next.Also the author assimilates all of the syllibuses for the grades and presents them in a digested format, so that you can get a good overview of what you are supposed to be learning at that particular grade.Contains many nice pictures and also gives some interesting information of who the key players were during the formation and early times of the AA. Gives the true identities of Magickal mottos listed on many AA documents from the past as well.A good reference for anyone wishing to tread the path of the snake."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of $50","review":"I made the mistake of giving weight to the other reviews.

The first Art of Happiness wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either. This one takes the concept - trying to use the Dalai Lama's teachings to create some kind of self-help system - one step too far into hokiness. It's drivel, really.

I found this book to be void of any meaningful content, to the point of lameness. While I sincerely respect the Dalai Lama and his philosophies, this book comes across as a make work assignment dreamt up by Howard Cutler because he ran out of things to do for a while. Don't bother with this one - there are many other books out there that will help you to improve your outlook and performance on your job and career."},{"rating":"1","title":"name dropping, dishonest egoist","review":"Cutler is nothing more than a name-dropper, hanging on the coat-tails of the Dalai Lama.

His Hokiness","review":"Dr. Cutler's writing may be sound modern analysis of living and working and the psychological and emotional mechanisms we employ in doing both, but the book does NOT successfully present HH Dalai Lama's foundational views. Like Cutler's first book, this one smacks of self-help and, irritatingly, the Dr.'s self-service as well. My impression is that Cutler's name should be on this book and it should be sold as a popular analysis of the words of HH Dalai Lama. It is CLEARLY not a joint project as suggested by the author credits. I won't go so far as to say I am offended at how this book (and the series) has been marketed, but I do feel it has been misrepresented. Surely, readers of HH Dalai Lama's works will realize this at page one and take from this presentation whatever value they can with that awareness. Better wisdom from HH can be found in numerous other titles sold here at Amazon, or even online for free at places like buddhanet.net or snowlionpubs.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much substance.","review":"It is difficult to pull out substance from this book because there is too much unnecessary dialouge, mostly on the part of Howard Culter.

After a chapter or two I realized this really has nothing to do with his holiness, it is just Cutler's babbling on about his thoughts and entering the Dalai Lama here and there. At first I became more and more fed up with this book, but then I took a break and realized that the Dalai Lama's words, the few of them, were very powerful and uplifting.I gave the book two stars because it is obvious that Cutler just used the Dalai Lama as a marketing tool, which worked in my case, to sell this book on HIS thoughts and not the Dalai Lama's.If you are interested in this type of material I say get the book...it is a good read, but beware that you will be reading about Cutler's experiences more than the Dalai Lama's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"A bit of a fraud.

Throughout the text, Cutler keeps asking questions that the Dalai Lama is obviously not particularly interested in addressing. He is polite enough to come up with some answers, but it's clear that he finds most of the questions either irrelevant or too general. Most of the content turns out to be a tired repetition of the most obvious cliches (\\"don't let $ determine your worth\\", etc.) Cutler and the Dalai Lama seem to be on completely different wavelengths and their interaction comes across (at least on the page) as forced and not particularly stimulating. Even the attempts at humor fall painfully short.

Initially I was thinking that 30GB may not be sufficient but haven't filled up yet.Only negative part is you can't connect to your computer without AC power because USB plug is behind the battery and you have to remove the battery to connect to PC which sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"good recorder","review":"I really enjoy this little gadget.

After video recording a trip, it died. Completely. If you own this, put in a memory card right now, because it will DIE! It was a huge waste of money. Just buy an iPhone and use the camcorder on that...it'll last longer and it's way more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"This camcoder requires ImageMixer 3 software to watch videos on PC and I did NOT get one with my purchase and trying to find help on internet to buy this software is not much encouraging either. I found like around $30 to buy IMAGEMIXER 3 SOFTWARE to make your videos work on PC. This is ridiculous. I would NOT recommend this camcoder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Camera, Worse Software","review":"The camera is of only average quality, The video is grainy even in the best light. However, two things make this a product to avoid; first, the software is horrible and second, customer service will dodge you, forget to call you back, and argue with you about the terrible software. Proprietary file types never work very well and this camera is no exception. To avoid endless hassles, avoid this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camcorder for the price!!","review":"I received this camcorder on August 21st. I used it the same evening. It was extremely easy to use. Within 15 minutes of having it out of the box I had it plugged into the wall and was filming. I have only used it indoors so far, the room was well lit and the picture quality was very good. The image stabilization works excellent. I was amazed at how steady the picture was and I filmed entirely by simply holding the camcorder in one hand. I am sure that there are probably better camcorders on the market. But in my opinion Panasonic has delivered an excellent product for the price. Most hard drive camcorders sell for over $500 and I got mine from Amazon for under $400. In my opinion that's a DEAL! I would highly recommend this camcorder to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same video quality as my little digital camera & way more time consuming.","review":"I researched and researched camcorders and this seemed like the best choice. I was wrong. The video quality was about the same as my little digital camera. The worst part was the software that came with the camcorder. I wanted to just upload video directly from the hard drive, but you have to use their software. In the end it took twice as long to get the video into a useable format than it would have to burn straight to DVD and then upload to my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo relaxing","review":"So comfortable and strong.

However, the openings in the wire mesh are simply too large for most vegetable pieces. What is worse is that all the way around the basket, where the side meets the bottom, are very large openings that allow thick potato or pepper slices to fall out when you flip the basket over.

Ban and Ginji are very funny characters, and they always seem to get the job done. Other characters are quirky and interesting, and there is a lot of emotion packed into some parts of the story making it more than just a pure comical series with some real emotion tied into the slapstick of much of the series. There is also good action and animation that tells the story very well. Why the negative review, then? $90 plus is unreasonable for this SECOND SEASON ONLY box, when the complete two season set is ten dollars less. Some of you may already have season one, but it actually makes more sense to have a duplicate copy of the first season and pay a lot less money than to spend over $100 (with shipping) for only half of the series. Give your first season box set to a friend and buy the two season set instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZULIEKA DOBSON","review":"ALTHOUGH BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN, ZULIEKA DOBSON IS ESSENTIALLY THE WHOLE PLOT CENTERS ARROUND ONE JOKE.IT SEEMS THAT ALL THE UNDERGRADUATES OF OXFORD HAVE FALLEN MADLY IN LOVE WITH THE WARDEN'S (DEAN'S)GRANDDAUGHTER.

Truly inspiring plotline,ay? Well, it only gets worse from there. The lead actress is not as attractive as the cover would have you believe, the story about the 'behind the scenes' in TV makes a daytime soap opera seem complex and, frankly, there\`s just not enough nudity to make you forget how bad this is, even in the pantheon of bad Joe D\`Amato films. Why it\`s generally listed in the Horror / Exploitation catagory is beyond me - I think they think folks who like these genre\`s will (and often do) buy anything. After all, they got my money, didn\`t they?

But now in May, we've been pulling lots of ticks off of one of our cats. I just now pulled up the product listing on amazon to see whether perhaps it was claimed only as a flea collar, but it does say \\"flea & tick\\". It seems ineffective against ticks.

Who better to learn from then Merle's own son, right? At first, Thom Bresh's charming but informal style of teaching was a bit hard to follow. He seemed to skip through things and it was sometimes hard to tell exactly what he was doing. As my own skills picked up, though, I realized Thom's approach was very much in keeping with the Travis style of picking - forceful, swinging and loose. If you're a beginner, like I was, you might want to start with Marcel Dadi's excellent and very precise DVDs (Nashville Picking vols 1 & 2) and then move on to Thom. Either way, you're bound to return to both again and again, and learn a great deal in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For All Merle Travis Fan, Pickers.","review":"This is one great piece of musical instruction. This type music can only be learned by watching someone and having them go through it step by step. [Mr. Travis] played a Very Unorthodox style of chords and his own licks and I really dont know how anyone could transcribe them to note. But \\"Thom\\" takes time to walk you through each chord and 2 finger picking method and really makes it simple. He plays different songs made famous by his Dad and then shows you all the chords and notes. Pretty simple.

Regardless of certain extrapolations, this work parallels some of what Nostradamus prophecied and reflects certain current events. The book contains other interesting information about other connected events, such as dead presidents, as well as being very thorough about the Bible's Revelations, which I had had no contact with before. Also, none of the other reviewers seem to realize that this book was originally written in French(which is the one I read), and that what they're reading is a translation...which may have an effect on the communication of the finer nuances present in some of the arguements and discussions.

Also the little ring that is supposed to keep the lid on is total garbage. It slips off constantly so flipping is out of the question unless you are extremely careful and pay attention to that ring.

The Teletubbies sing about Mary and her little lamb, and more. I think the penguin part is fantastic.Although the whole video is about animals, it is broken down into little segments that make it easier to reach a 'good stopping point' for children, so the option is there to only watch a short segment of it.I use this video (and all others and TV) as a time for my kids to wind down at the end of the day or just prior to nap. A short time to just sit and turn off their brains for a few minutes. I know about the controversy surrounding the Teletubbies, but I just refuse to believe that this video teaching anything bad.

I have enjoyed Gene Getz's writing in the past, but not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"from behind the lens and pens","review":"This book offers an insight into Clinton and his presidency, that is from an outsider- a reporter. To say it is impartial is ridiculous, it is merely ambivalent.At times, Harris seems enarmored by Clinton and at others like he is studying a bug. But can he really know the inner machinations of the man and the office from his perch? This is why his views are politicized, he constructs them as an outsider.His writing is superior to Stephanopoulos, an insider and certainly to Clintons', making this an easier read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brit Hume got it exactly right","review":"Hume wrote: \\"John Harris reaches a generally favorable verdict on Bill Clinton, but there is no lack of evidence that could lead to a different conclusion.\\" Harris writes well and is obviously a fan of the former President. The title \`The Survivor' is perfect, after reading about the countless missed opportunities during his eight years in office and how much time was spent just trying to survive politically, you realize this most charismatic and personable man's greatest accomplishment was just that: Survival. Perhaps President Clinton felt progressive in his own mind, but in practice he was mostly reactive. This well written book is definitely worth reading for a sympathetic account of the Clinton years.

Itrs fair, from cover to cover. Does an excellent job at disecting the Clinton presidency from the perspective of recent history rather than current affairs. Harris's treatment of the highs as well as the low, shows a classiness that you just couldnt get from Anne Coulter (on her best day). Harris's assessment that although Clinton was often a tortured decision maker, and hard to work for (because of this and other things), that he usually made the right decision for the country and for the game of opolitics he was forces to play, was right on the mark. Unless you think that in order to be considered moderate you have to constantly attack Bill Clinton you will agree that this is a moderate, fair, and accurate assessment of the Clinton presidency. I have bought it for several freinds, and recommended it for my book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a positive light on the Clinton years!","review":"It is nice to finally have a book that portrays Clinton's presidency in a positive light. The times were not that long ago and I remember them being mostly good times yet just about every book today seems to make them look like Armageddon.Most males I know think the whole Monica thing was a drawn out charade by people who love gossip and were grasping out straws trying to sink Clinton's presidency. Those same anti-Clinton individuals try to make a big \\"conspiracy\\" theory out of Whitewater because they believe most people were \\"asleep\\" during those eight years and will not remember how well off the country was during those eight years. Well the truth is that we have had nothing but bad times since the Clinton presidency ended.Bravo for you Mr. Harris for finally trying to paint a more honest view!"},{"rating":"2","title":"as close to fair as you can expect","review":"If you feel Franken, M. Moore, Hannity or Rush are credible, than this book probably isn't for you. This is as close to fair and accurate as your going to get. While it's obvious the author is favorable to Clinton, he doesn't hesitate to point out his mistakes. Someone might complain the book doesn't mention every single incident, but what book can? Even \\"War and Peace\\" can't. I am very much enjoying the book. It's virtually impossible to find an unbiased book. Everyone has an opinion, just give me the information and let me decide.

Their voices are SO great and unique.(I use the word unique a lot in my reviews, because I believe that is what sets artists apart from one another) My favorite song of theirs in What Hurts the Most, because they sing it with so much emotion. I got chills the first time I heard it. Stand and Me and My Gang are also great songs. You know what? They are all great songs. What else can I say? Buy it, Buy it, Buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what hurts the most","review":"First of all, I would like to point out that, I like the song, \\"what hurts the most\\", their radio single, but Mark Wills cut it first on his (and the crowd goes wild) and was just a pinch better and radio friendly.Why wasn't his version selected. But, any how, The song, \\"me and my gang\\" is a very upbeat catchy, rockin song. And check this out, my wife hates country music, but she loves that song, and the newest, \\"life is a highway\\" so whatever they are doing, keep it up. She is into hard rock and mostly rap, but maybe she will cross over if they find that specail chemsitry. We could always use another country fan out here to keep country music famous, like Eric Church sang on his (sinners like me) album on the song, \\"pledge alligenace to the Hag\\",\\"they say country's fading but we're still waving the flag round here, we're people still pledge alligeance to the Hag\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Me & My Gang","review":"Rascal Flatts' fourth album ME AND MY GANG finds the country trio moving more towards a pop/AC sound. Throughout each album they have moved closer to this sound, but on this album there is a much more polished sound. This isn't a bad thing! The harmonies are still beautiful and intact, and the songs are great. The first single was the very moving song \\"What Hurts the Most\\", a song about loss. Definately a highlight in their career, at least for me. The title track was a hit as well, not a favorite but it's pretty good. \\"My Wish\\" is their latest hit and it's another moving ballad. In fact, the ballads are what carry this album. My favorite is the moving ballad \\"Words I Couldn't Say\\", which would be a hit if released. \\"Cool Thing\\" is another great song. Other highlights include \\"I Feel Bad\\", \\"He Ain't The Leavin Kind\\", and many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I signed up just to review this album. I'm a huge fan of Rascal Flatts, but I had never bought one of their cds.

I rushed home and preordered the whole album on iTunes, and I downloaded it at 12:01 am the day it was available. It really is a great album. My favorite songs would probably be \\"Me and My Gang\\", \\"Yes I Do\\", \\"My Wish\\"a, and of course \\"Backwards\\" is just a funny, good time song. I would 100% recommend buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"This CD contains alot of slow love gained/lost type songs but it is a nice change. \\"Ellsworth\\" tugs at your heart while \\"Me and My Gang\\" shows the fast paced songs that these guys are known for.

The first CD will always be my favorite but this is by far my 2nd favorite out of the 4.The tunes are catchy and filled with energy and you just want to keep playing it. I really enjoy the clever song Backwards and Me and My Gang is very catchy as well. It's an even mix between up beat songs and slow mellow ones.This CD will definitely be on REPEAT in my CD player!! Oh yeah, and if you've never seen Rascal Flatts in concert, you don't know what you're missing. They ROCK!!!Here's a tip.

With their amazing harmonies and the passion that comes out of every song, one can't help but place this cd in their cd player and let it run right through. Each song takes you on a different journey. That is what I love about the Rascal Flatts. No matter what mood you are in, theres a song. Especially on this cd. In the mood to have fun? Put on the song Backwards. Need some uplifting? Put on My Wish, or Stand. This is the one band that allows you to put a cd in the cd player and play it all the way though without skipping a song.

This is just one more insipid set of songs. Any 13 to 30 year old girlies will think it's really great because of sappy lyrics.

Then again, this is coming from a band who got their big break by showing a male rear end on a video. That speaks volumes about the substance and musicianship one should expect from this release. There are no musical elements except for LOUD found anywhere on this album. I don't really blame these guys, look what passes for country music or any music today. Lower than mediocre rules the airwaves and billboard charts. Seriously, can you go into a honkytonk and listen to this without looking over your shoulder? No musicianship + the most annoying boy/girl voice in the business + songs written for first graders + expectations of \\"country\\" fans = today's version of new kids on the block and Grammy winning country superstars.

The only reason they are considered country is because they suck too much to make it on pop radio. Lots of bands do this....music sucks...throw a fiddle and steel guitar behind it and play it on a country station. Boy bands are NOT COUNTRY MUSIC, and Rascal Flatts IS a boy band. And although all boy bands suck in my opinion, the Flatts (lame band name, too) are at the very bottom of the boy band food chain. Can Gary LeVox's voice get any more femmy? Is it possible for them to depress us anymore with all of their weeping, whining, Skin sobbing songs? What Hurts the Most? My EARS!!!

My favorite songs on here were probably Stand, Backwards, and the title of the CD itself Me and My Gang. On the very beginning of the song Me and My Gang, they have this little \\"wah - wah - wah - wah - wah - wah\\" intro part that I really enjoyed. I'm still trying to figure out how they made that sound, if it was like a bass guitar or synthesizer or anything like that. This CD does have a majority of slow songs in it, but I liked them all anyways. That's what Rascal Flatts is - a boy band sort of. I can't blame them, so I might as well give the overall CD 5 stars.

Every song is amazing and I highly doubt I could pick a favorite song. There's insprational songs like My Wish And Stand, a few sadder songs like What Hurts The Most and Ellsworth.

By the second \\"relaxation\\" pose, I was laughing out loud. Rodney had placed the yoga strap behind his back, around the feet, around the ankles, and pulled his legs in like a trussed up turkey. To lean back properly in this position, he had about three blankets, a gigantic bolster, what looked like a foam wedge, and a few other unidentifiable pose helpers. It was really ridiculous. Nor were alternatives offered, or help with the set up of this complicated wedge, blanket, bolster arrangement. I do not appreciate yoga that over uses props, and this one pulls out all the stops. It would take twenty five minutes to even attempt to jerry rig blankets and such to attempt this pose. Not so relaxing. Even the pose with the wall included lots of props; wedges and such.

Ignore the fact that the child whined while picking up the other 200 toys. The idea is that eventually the child will pick up the whole room without whining.Ha- I haven't found that to be the case while teaching and I haven't found that to be the case with my children (age two and younger).I think you can easily skip this book and find a more comprehensive book with more ideas that are better suited to reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great documentary with a nice touch of Python nonsense.","review":"John Cleese takes a different style in teaching us about the power of the human face.

Subjects of Beauty, Expressions, Identity, etc are explained not only verbally, but with great skits and sketchs.

The only problem is, there is no instruction booklet for post video workouts on your own. Dr. Rouse should stick to medicine and leave the workout videos to the professionals. His trite words do nothing to inspire or motivate. His instruction is too fast and undetailed for learning, but not routine enough to follow as a workout. He doesn't count out loud, nor does he keep an acurate count -- five on one side, seven on the other. For every exercise he does a different number of repititions, with no explanation as to why.And finally, my biggest questions is - why is this video entitled a.m. stress relief? Dr. Rouse never mentions anything about why you should do these exercises in the morning or why they releive stress. I think it's just his way to sell videos.

Imagine listening to one of the samples presented here 20 times in a row. The sample represents the whole of the song, which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top. To me, this signifies a lack of creativity. There is so much potential in each of these songs, but it is as if Avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song. Maybe my expectations were too high, expecting a Billy Childs type of song structure.

I actually saw IT (can't even say the P word anymore) when IT first came out and IT was the only movie I ever felt compelled to walk out of.

Even the kids, who like almost anything as long as it's not black & white, hated it. The music is terrible, Popeye's lines are almost incomprehensible, and Shelley Duvall's Olive Oyl is not cute or sweet or even the least bit likeable.

Unfortunately, Robin Williams was panned for this movie. The colorful little coastal community is picturesque in a shanty shack way.

The characterizations of Popeye and Olive make them somewhat eccentric, but they are very true to the cartoons. And the sets and costumes! There is so much to see and appreciate in every shot that the production design reminds me of Jacques Tati.So if you didn't like it, perhaps you are happy with the comedy of Adam Sandler.

It could be seen as a clean, wholesome family film or an oddball cult classic. The scenes range from warm and fuzzy to slightly disturbing (like when Brutus tries to sell the baby Sweet Pea). Even the music is different - the lyrics don't rhyme. Altman's improvisational style of letting actors control the scenes adds another level of strangeness to the whole affair.Maybe that is why this movie endures. It is like other lasting films that just barely rise above the status of \\"cult classic\\" - like MASH, American Graffiti, or Paper Moon. What saves these films from obscure, cult-classic status is their sentimentality, unique and innovative direction, and ability to elicit themes everyone can relate to. They are also entertaining and fun to watch. Try not to think to much and enjoy Popeye for what it is - a pretty fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I yam what I yam","review":"This is one of those movies Ihave to watch at least once a year.

It has the full cast of characters, with many more in the background if you are familiar with the comic strip. (no seahag or goons.

I've only walked out on two movies in theaters in my 50 yr. life; this one and the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The casting of Williams and Duvall was good (the only movie I ever thought Shelly Duvall was ever well cast for, FWIW) but that's about the only positive I can think of.

The only good thing about it is Robin Williams, and as far as I'm concerned, this is his most disappointing role."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it...","review":"I truly do appreciate it this movie for all the qualities fans like to discuss (i.e. casting, and faithfulness to Segar's conception, etc.), but the pace of the film is finally too sluggish to pull a decent recommendation from me. Unless you have a nostalgic soft-spot for this movie (as I do), you're unlikely to consider your time or money well spent on this DVD. As others have said, the ending is incredibly bad. I doubt I'll ever watch it all the way through again.

Everyone should own it.","review":"I'm like the last guy. I get so tired of hearing movie critic (and even Williams himself) say how bad the movie was. Everyone has their own opinion, AND they have the right to be WRONG. I may be a little bias because this is the first actual movie I remember going to see at the theater when I was a kid.This is by far Robin Williams' best movie. I love the music, the acting, the comedy, the scenery, the story and the family oriented nature of the film. I still get the songs stuck in my head after I watch it.The DVD looks like it has been remastered. The pictures and sound are better than I remember them. I also own it on VHS, so I know there is some difference there. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there should have been more extras.

Robin Williams is excellent as Popeye, but the real star here is Shelley Duvall. She IS Olive Oyl. She steals the movie. The mistake I think filmmakers made was making this a musical. That really wasn't neccesary. Robert Altman's direction is right on, but takes the material a little too seriously and a little too dark for a comic book tale. Still, the movie lives on with a loyal following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popeye reigns supreme!","review":"This movie is a classic , right from the epic establishing shot to the spinach chomping finale! the cast is perfect and Robin is brilliant as popeye . there are some catchy musical numbers in there too , and while popeye is a bit of a wimp at the beginning of the movie he soon sends Bluto packing! you'll either love this movie .........or hate it . i love it, go figure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I watched this as a kid and now have children of my own. We watched it again last night. I must say that this film is brilliant. In the hype of contemporary special effects, over acted and over sung musicals, this film somehow captures the flavor of the cartoons, yet builds its own characters. I was hooked as a kid, and now my own kids are asking to watch it again. It is clean, morals are taught, well acted, music is on spot for the purpose. Very much a classic - Williams and Duvall are excellent.

Segar stripin twenty-five years or more, but my two tween sons were a great excuse, and POPEYE is actually a damn good (if utterly idiosyncratic) movie. Yes, it's a musical. Yes, all of the characters are utterly caricatured. Yes, it does lose track of itself more than once, and starts too slowly. And, yes, the spinach thing is done much less subtly or well than Segar would have. But it's indisputably Popeye -- and miles closer to Segar than any other moving-picture version has ever come -- and a hell of a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true masterpiece for young and old alike.","review":"For those fans of the 70+ year old cartoon, this is the pinnacle of cartoon converted to reality. Between Mr. Williams and Ms. Duvall as Olive Oyl and Mr. Black as Bluto, the cast was nigh to perfect. The imaginative drafting and construction of the unique set of Sweethaven is just as enjoyable. There is a solid plotline and Popeye the Sailor has to continually deal with the rogues in town and those who would exploit those he comes to care about. The costumes and makeup are as unique as the town.Fear not... and give this classic a try. Hopefully you will come away wanting more and more... spinach. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's JUST SOMETHING about this movie ...","review":"This movie has a combination of things which personally strike me, not least of which is Robin Williams portraying the powerful Popeye (and who else could do the job?!?). There's something about the story and the development of the characters and the unusual music that keeps me glued to the movie, providing me with laughs and a sense of refreshing, delightful entertainment.Recommend this movie? You bet! But I don't think that it's a movie that everyone will enjoy; just those who want a wonderful trip back to their childhood with a living Popeye and Olive Oyl. For those who want to take that trip, I think this movie does a very special job. One that I'll cherish for years to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring movie I have EVER seen","review":"Hands down, this is the worst, most boring movie I have EVER seen.

It comes with a floral scent, but some other options would help.It's too bad there is nt anywhere to purchase the filters and fragrance dispenser because everything else about this air cleaner earns high marks.

Brilliant insight into the little-known world of how the WSJ reporters approach major companies. This is an important read for all corporate PR departments and top managers. In today's world, exevcutives must know how to deal with the press. ... However, I am disappointed the authors didn't simplify the accounting transactions and take time to really spell them out. They could have used some illustrations to give an idea of what Enron's CFO was doing. I read the book carefully, but still can't explain to others the basics of \\"off-balance-sheet partnerships\\". So, you will find this book insightful. It is well written. The reporting has the WSJ truthfulness about it. But,I just wish they took the time to explain off-blance sheet partnerships. Many companies use them legally/ethically. So what are they? I am still not exactly sure what Enron did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Perfect Book, but ...","review":"This adds to our understanding of Enron's collapse, and of broader matters, including the wary symbiosis between the financial press and the short sellers.Short sellers, stock traders who in effect bet that a certain stock will fall within a given time frame, are important to reporters because they make their money searching for weak targets, like lions looking for the weakest wildebeest in the herd. The weakness is newsworthy.On the other hand, short sellers may benefit by spreading false rumors as well. Maybe nothing is rotten in the corporation of Denmark, Inc., but the rumors that something is will still drive down its price!In sum: short sellers can be a source of information or of misinformation to financial reporters. This book captures that situation, portraying one of its authors as more receptive to such sources and the other as more wary."},{"rating":"1","title":"On and On and On . . .","review":"\\"24 Days\\" is both a story about what went on at Enron and how the Wall Street Journal reporters followed and wrote the story. The book is interesting at first, but after awhile the detail becomes overwhelming and pointless.In addition, the book did not provide a clear understanding about CFO Fastow's side deals. To be fair, however, the deals were so complex that even with printed documentation in hand it was not possible to decipher what was going on, and other books on the topic have not clarified the matter either. What is clear, however, is that the side deals were kept under the radar as much as possible, and even deliberately hidden in some instances.Another clear conclusion is that neither CEO Lay, former CEO Skilling, Enron's Board, nor numerous highly-paid stock analysts knew the full details or even tried. No evidence of their interest in any details was revealed.

Of course, at Enron almost everything was tied to the short term performance of the Company's stock which proves nothing and collapsed as a house of cards.(Mt Laurel)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read The Smartest Guys in the Room","review":"This book is too tied to the authors and what they were doing versus what was happening at Enron that the authors were not covering.

It may trigger you to set you on a path of further development. This 'trigger function' is about the only value of the book. If you are on a path and have done some work on yourself already, it's a waste of money and time. Hypothesis is stacked upon hypothesis, no sound argumentation is given, it creates confusion and fails to give directions for possible solutions. In one word: shallow.

Arguments are based on hypothesis and are for the most part arguable. He treats Homosexuality as on one end of the acceptable sexual behavior scale. I do not recommend it to Christian men. It is clear that the author has a very shallow and distorted understanding of the Bible too. It creates more confusion by suggesting too many reasons for certain behaviors.

No other views or extrapolations are used. Tunnel vision and too stringent for the 21th century. Usually when a book is written on a well writtten subjest matter---fatherless sons--their are other view points and outcomes that can be discussed. The cover is misleading \\"The Search for Masculine identity\\", where does it suggest gender changes or subconscious desires. All in all, it was a negative read-depicting fatherless sons, all fatherless sons to be doomed for many years with problems (at the end of the book he touches upon additional dark issues .There are positive outcomes , not that homosexuality is bad, why not talk about the strengths and positive parenting of the fatherless sons. It could have been touched upon. The theory is stagnant viod or modern thought, and multilinear thinking.Too much of one trained thinking is not good and no credit to the author.

No. It is is propaganda that helped fuel racism of the era. I love Gene Stratton-Porter's other books, and in them she depicted protagonists who are victims of prejudice: victims of social class prejudice, and victims of prejudice against women. And these discriminated-against protagonists ultimately triumph. In this book, however, she turns characters into racial caricatures--the idealist, pure, earnest, white female protagonist versus the evil, conniving, murderous, Japanese antagonist, who dies in the end because that's what he deserves. Sure, study it as history. But point out that the author succumbed to racism. She didn't explore racism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined Gene Stratton-Porter for me","review":"I didn't see the previous review warning about the racist nature of this book--but I wish I had. I read the first couple of pages (the second paragraph contained an ethnic slur) and had to put it down. I looked the book up online, hoping that the racist character would learn her lesson by the end--but nope. Now I won't be able to reread Freckles and Girl of the Limberlost without thinking of Porter's proud racism. If you like Porter and don't enjoy racism, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. One of the main story lines in the book is the main character, Linda, helping one of the boys at her high school so as to be the valdictorian of his class over another boy who happens to be Japanese. There are some parts of the book that are terribly racist-America for Americans and preserving it from the \\"red communists\\" the \\"yellow Japs\\", the \\"treachery of the Mexicans\\" and the \\"slowly uprising might of the black man\\". The rest of the book is ok-a girl's struggle to do the work she was meant to do and getting her fair inheritance from her selfish sister. I am halfway through this book, but i don't know if I will continue. It is tragic that the author of The girl of the Limberlost descended to such a level-fear based propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember when it was written","review":"Just the info about the desert plants should make this a book to read. Yes the romance is a little hokey.Many of you say it is racist but you have to remember when it was written.I think she was way ahead of her time and was right to try and make people aware that people from another country were using free education in our schools here to infiltrate.Isn't that just what happened before 911? Didn't they train at our colleges and flight schools. Didn't we, for free, show them how to do this?When you read a period piece you have to read it as just that and remember what period you are reading about.It was written in 1921.And what happened exactly 20 years later? umm Pearl Harbor? the 911 of the 40's??If for nothing else at least read the parts about the desert.

The concept of the \\"Yellow Peril\\" was rampant at the time of authorship, so I shouldn't have been shocked. The story was mediocre compared to some of Stratton Porter's other work (the Harvester was awesome, and a Girl of the Limberlost, Keeper of the Bees, etc. are good reads, too.) I can only say that it was educational to be able to read something by an author that I admired and see that it was so obviously racist.

But even if that weren't the case, the story line of a young girl writing articles for a magazine and then including so many of the magazine article recipes in the book was really boring. Then to top that off, she was really preachy about morals. Because I had read \\"Freckles\\" and \\"A Girl of the Limberlost\\", I had thought I would enjoy this book. Boy was I wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sweet book marred by racial prejudice","review":"This is the one book written by Gene Stratton Porter that should not be read to children. The book contains many of the same themes as The Girl of the Limberlost ,with a intelegent heroine who is in touch with nature. However, the book reflects the strong racial prejudices that were present when it was written. One of the central story lines deals with the threats of immigrants, especially the Japanese. I do not recommend reading this book as a first look at the author's works. To enjoy it you must be able to detatch yourself from the racial commentary and understand that it was typical of that time-period in America. Ignoring the sections dealing with the Japanese, it is quite a sweet book. Unfortunately, the prejudices will make many people so angry that they will not be able to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Book for the 1990's!","review":"This is a story of two sisters who react very differently when their parents are suddenly killed in a car accident. Set in California in the 1920's, it is full of interesting information about desert plant life, loyalty, friendship, being different in a high school setting and young love. If that's all it was, it would be a great romantic adventure. Unfortunately, in a rare twist for Ms. Stratton-Porter, the dated suspicion of immigrants, the expressions of white supremacy and the murder of a Japanese suspect make this book inescapably racist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Textbook for Academic Work.

In April, it just stopped working. I thought it was the battery, so I had it tested. It wasn't. It was a problem with the watch. So in less than a year the watch had two problems and apparently died on me. I sent it back to Fossil for the second time last week and I'm currently waiting on them to return it.

The bookstore should pay you for buying this mess. The first Net Force was readable. This book is not. There is a horribly boring plot. The villains are terrible. Not even Toni and Alex MIchaels could save this terrible book. The rednecked Georgia computer genius who played the role of the hacker was awful. The Senate aide who was helping the hacker was terrible. The third world connection was also lacking. All in all a bad book. I hope Tom Clancy starts writing his own material again.

Why did it take two people to write this junk?They stretch the concept of Virtual Reality to unbelievable levels, seemingly just to put people in period costumes/sceneries. Instead of using it in a credible way, they turn it into a gimmick.The character interaction is quite pathetic (everybody gets lucky with the best looking woman, without half trying). More like a porn movie.Clancy novels used to have oodles of technical detail. He used to be a real source of insight in how the military and it's technologies work. Now he seems to just crank out Hollywood'isms just for it's own sake.I'm sorry that Mr. Clancy felt the need to put his name to this.

I agree with almost all of the negative reviews. I got lost with too many shallow characters. The VR was so beyond belief that I simply could not suspend my disbelief!

That way you can drop-kick it away when you realize how bad it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Words do cannot describe how truly disappointing this book was.

The research and veracity I've come to expect from a Clancy novel was totally missing. Some of the forensic methods were completely wrong and the use of VR for following a hacker's trail was just stupid. I couldn't wait for this book to end and was tempted again and again to just quit wasting my time and burn the book so no one else would get hooked into reading it because of the Clancy Stamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Hmmmm...not quite what I expected. While the plot line provided some excitement and a surprise or two, this just wasn't as satisfying as some of the other series created by Clancy. The near future setting and the use of virtual reality both felt somewhat contrived. I'm not sure how the use of virtual reality scenarios improves the investigative abilities of the forensic computer analysts. I found the passages describing these scenarios to be distracting from the main plot line. Also, while I have no problem with character development, why do we need to have TWO love story subplots? It felt like overkill. Overall, this wasn't a terrible light read, but its far from the best thriller I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please....","review":"Like a government agent on the trail of a deadly terrorist is going to stop and take the time to write a new VR 'scenario' each time he searches the net for a clue?

Boy was i wrong. It wasn't the shallowly developed cahracters or the meaningless subplot that annoyed me. No, it was the main character. Alex Michales was a goo protagonist in the first netforce, but in the sequel he disolved into an annoying whiner who put his family troubles over the need to netrualize a terrorist threat. I am a fan of tom clancy and I am not criticizing all his works, just this . If you want a good clancy book, buy OpCenter."},{"rating":"1","title":"As interesting as a paint-by-numbers painting","review":"It's been a few years since I read a Tom Clancy novel. I recall they were long page-turners with lots of technical detail and macho sentiment. This book is relatively short, with only an occasional bit of silly technical detail thrown in.

Hibbert's excruciating detail about Nelson's social life, liesure travel, meals at inns, parties, Lady Hamilton's dresses accumulates to the point that it is very tempting to \\"abandon ship\\" on this book.

Here he's produced a nice-sized collection of his work, examining the rights we covet, ignore, talk about and fight about, that we live for and sometimes die for.As Dershowitz says, the contest to develop and maintain rights is a perpetual one, and for the past several decades, he's done his part, and then some.

I found the first three books (that was as much as I was able to endure) to be quite tedious. While there were some interesting characters and plot developments in the first book, the series continued to stretch itself far too thin and wide. Jordan loses his appeal as he tries to expand the scope of his series far beyond its strength. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche, slow but descriptive","review":"It has been a long time since I read this book. I bought it based upon the reviews and I'm not sorry I did. Now I know to be wary of Jordan. Like I said, it has been a long time since I read it but I do remember very much that, overall, I really didn't enjoy it. It was slow and more than a little cheesy and so cliche. It was very descriptive, however. Jordan does have an eye for detail but the detail put in was just too much, which affected the pace of book dramatically. I suggest, however, that you try the first book at least. If you like it, great! If you don't like it then you can pass in on to someone you don't like. I suggest everyone read \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", if they're looking for a good fantasy epic. Ciao."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book worthy of the garbage","review":"The book was not very good and I believe that Jordan stepped beyond his bounds with the characters.

Written by Robert Jordan, it tells a tale of three simple farm boys who soon get caught up in a great quest. It turns out that they are taveren (people who can manipulate the course of events), but they are some of the strongest taveren to ever live. The first half of the work describes the characters and something of their past. It isn't until the three get separated and begin their individual searches to once again find each other that the book really starts to pick up. Despite this slow start, the book is a great beginning for the series. If you want to start reading the WoT series, I highly recommend reading Eye of the World first. That way you won't have to look everything up in the glossary all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books I have read","review":"This book is a lot better than any book Tolkien had ever wrote.

It starts great. It's mysterious, unpredictable, exciting...Then the long, drawn out, boring middle. I was forcing myself through the pages, sure I'd get paid off with some glorious climax, but the ending was so anemic I felt cheated. The series improves but wastes way too much time, sometimes an entire book has hardly any contribution to the overall story. Tolkien's world was overflowing with history and atmosphere and mythology, so much that it's still rampantly discussed all over the world today. Jordan exhausts the possibilities of his world quickly and I lost interest just as fast. Rand is a boring character and the \\"One Power\\" (the world's source or magic) is very nebulous and unconvincing. Overall it was a cool story but with way too much useless, aimless plot wandering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!","review":"Some people think slow love songs are boring. The same thing over and over again.I don't think so. The same theme can be used many times as long as it's well done. And although this book contains a dark lord it's still good because its well written. I don't understand this thing about Jordan babbeling. I thought it was the other way around. I think tolkien's(he's great)got babbling nature descriptions but jordan does not have babble of any sort. Maybe the last books in the series do but not the first five I've read.So I think the book's just plain great and hope to find more writers as good as jordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST fantacy book out there to date!","review":"Robert Jordan is absolutly a genious.

I stoped at the middle and returned the two books in disgust.

I find Mr. Jordan to be extremely long winded, and where Mr. Tolkien took 3 books (4 if you count the Hobbit) to recount an epic tale, Mr. Jordan is up to what, his 8th? And there is no sign of an end in sight either! And while some people say that the plot of the series is \\"intricate\\", I have to disagree: it's just a lot of plots bunched in together, that makes me wonder if the author actually has any idea where the story is headed (again, we come back to the fact that he is up to his 8th book and there's no sign of stopping!) If you want an epic tapestry of a story, try the Fionavar Tapestry by Guy Gavriel Kay (some of the best fantasy ever written, period). At least he can tell an epic in 3 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of that author.....

There are no uplifting aspect or morals. The story and characters were very addicting and attractive, but there are like four good guys in a world with a million bad guys.

The characters are annoying and whinny. The only interesting character was Thom and Jordan found a way to make him disappear half way through the book. I'm a big fantasy fan and this is crap. i am only 600 pages in the book but that is all I can read. Nothing happens. I haven't even got a rush from the action which was poorly written. Jordan is an author that discribes everything in sight to the most minute detail. Which makes it the most slow paced fantasy book I've read. He plagerizes Tolkien through the whole book and never has one original concept. Anyone who likes this book hasn't read real fantasy like Goodkind or Brooks. Jordan if you read this please stop wasting inocent people's, like me, money on awful fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"Jordan's Wheel of Time series has taken the fantasy epic and given it fresh direction. The characters are entirely plausible, their actions and reactions in this hugely developed world are accurate and believable. The sheer scale of the series makes it worth reading. It is up there with any top ten fantasy series you must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Foundation","review":"The Eye of the World introduces the reader to a very Tolkienn-like world filled with evil, magic, politics, and love. Jordan is a bit too wordy towards the beginning, but his style grows on you the more you read.The one thing that separates Jordan from most other fantasy novelists is that his characters have depth and that women have a place of prominence. At first the women seem to all be arrogant and domineering, but as the story progresses the vast differences between the different women and the full depth of their personalities manifests itself.Jordan makes this world feel alive and mysterious and these feelings only grow as the reader continues through the next few books. This is arguebly the best fantasy series since Tolkienn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. This books is full of action and adventure. It is complete with humor and other emotions that pull you into the book, making you believe that you are on the adventures with the main character. This is an excellent book, and a start to an excellent story. I have read all 9 books so far, and this one is one that sticks in my mind the best. It is a great book, and a must read for anyone who is interested in fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING IS DERIVATIVE","review":"Okay people, not everything is DERIVATIVE of TOLKIEN. Fantasy is by its very nature made up of elves, noble men, wizards, dwarves, orcs, etc... Simply having these characters in the story doesnt make it derivative.Second, there is a basic formula to fantasy novels. This can be seen as far back as ancient greek myth (which is where the inspiration for LOTR came from). It goes like this...\\"Farm Boy sees/hears of trouble, rescues girl/town, becomes hero.\\" That is the backbone of our beloved fantasy novels.Because of all these things RJ and all other fantasy novels, while following a similar story line have all taken a \\"road less travled\\" and in doing so, they have opened our minds and imaginations to their \\"version\\" of the story as they see it!READ THIS BOOK AND ENJOY ITS TALENTED AUTHORSHIP, Dont focus so much on its \\"derivativeness\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelent","review":"I have really enjoyed reading this book the characters are interesting, the plot is good the story great and it is rather fast paced, I believe that this is the best book in the series and I have read all the books that are available so far.

It's refreshing to find a book that doesn't depend on sex, violence or vulgarity to make a colorful story. I love the large array of interesting characters and was drawn into it immediately. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you have to read this!!!","review":"These books are THE BEST books out there. Even better than Tolkien...if that's possible. They are what fantasy is about; they have EVERYTHING!!!!! And even when outrageous things happen, they're written in a way that makes them seem more realistic. Robert Jordan has a way of making the story scary, funny, breathtaking, heartstopping and mysterious all at once...He has created a world with complex cultures, customs, and peoples; a world so intricate and detailed that you can't help but fall in love with it. Everyone i've recomended these books to has LOVED them, and you probably will to. so ORDER THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy","review":"This book is a prime example of good fantasy writing. Robert Jordan makes the book come to life. The story is developed, interesting, and creative. The only con to this is that it is lengthy. Robert Jordan has ten books now all over 600 pages I believe. For impatient readers, or those pressed for time, a shorter book might suit you better at this point. The good thing is that you can read this book quickly. It's intricate but not as confusing as J.R.R. Tolkein for example (not that I'm dissing him, he's a genious). Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An addictive read!","review":"The size may seem imposing on this one, but don't let that fool you. I finished it in nothing flat and asked for more. One of three boys from a small unassuming village holds great power in his hands and is the one being sought. But let me tell you, the other two aren't anything to dismiss, either! Here you will find wonderfully developed characters, a world to get lost in (thankfully there are maps!), and a storyline that will keep you interested and wanting to go on to the sequel (The Great Hunt) when you are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showed promise, but failed to deliver","review":"I read Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series before I discovered all the positive reviews about Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time set and decided to give it a try. Actually, I didn't really have much of a problem with the characters; they're all pretty standard fantasy conventions. What I had a problem with is the way that the book just plods along. I got up to page 448 and finally gave up -- it just wasn't worth the effort to continue. And I certainly couldn't see myself suffering through another seven books of the same. This is not a new story -- Tolkien did it, as have Eddings and Goodkind, but The Eye of the World simply says and does too little within the 800+ pages the reader is asked to wade through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great books...","review":"I must admit I was skeptical of a fantasy book, as the only fantasy prior to these books I had read was Tolkien. I have read this series twice now. The second time was almost as good as the first. Robert Jordan's series was just getting off its feet and it shows in this book. I would rate it as the 6th best book in the series. That being said, it is still a great book and will leave you with a desire to read more. I can't wait for Book 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the JR Tolken books","review":"Better than the JR Tolken books. I am now reading book 3 of the series and they get better by the book. The more you read the more you will enjoy it. There are several interesting plots all going on at the same time. Also many interesting characters involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragmented","review":"This greatly abridged version left me very confused. I rewound and listened to parts repeatedly trying to follow the plot. Then I accidentally came across the unabridged audio book at my library and saw that it wasn't just two 1 1/2 hour tapes - it's several times longer. How could the author Robert Jordan allow such a massacre of his work? Now that I am halfway through the full unabridged version I understand and appreciate the storyline and the characters. This is rich! I'm really enjoying it. Don't cheat yourself, read the book or get the unabridged audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridgement ruins novel","review":"While the book is fantastic, this abridged version is missing to many vital details to follow. The listenter cannot even follow the storyline, much less grasp the richness of the world Jordan builds. A 30 hour story is smashed into a 3 hour reading, and it just doesn't work. I highly reccomend the Wheel Of Time series, but not the abridged audio-tapes. I would strongly reccomend either reading the book, or finding an unabridged version of the audio book.--- jds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune meets Tolkien","review":"Would not suggest reading this book to anyone. Especially if this is your first trip into fantasy worlds. Jordan seems to have taken the works of Frank Herbert, and JRR Tolkien, smashed them together, and mangled them... badly. The book is advertised as expanding on the world of Tolkien, but that reviewer must have been drunk when he wrote that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is grand but the abridged audiotape is LAME.","review":"I was hesitant to buy this book on tape because it is abridged and read by someone other than the author. I decided to buy just the first tape and decide on buying more after listening to it. The abridgment is horrid. Important pieces, needed to help the story line flow along smoothly, are totally cut while insignificant parts remain. The reader, Mark Rolston, only made things worse. I realize that pronunciation is bound to be different, and I tried to deal with the seeming slaughter of names and places, but I could not make myself come around to his style of reading. Pronunciation aside, the reading made me ill. His false enthusiasm and halfhearted emotion was more than I could endure. I would not recommend this particular rendering of the book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Sci-Fi fans.","review":"Robert Jordan has been criticized for his Tolkien-esque feel, but who wouldn't want to aspire to Tolkien's greatness? Jordan masterfully creates a world that is vivid and entertaining. Although some of his city names may mirror Tolkein's land, the similarities do not continue for long.The Eye of the World is a coming-of-age novel that focuses on the development of 3 teenage boys who have yet to understand their true potential. Jordan is able to create several characters that are all complex and changing. Few of his characters are flat. Even though his characters compete for center-stage, Jordan is able to balance the intertwining stories to captivate the reader.My favorite aspect about this book is the presence of strong female characters that are both powerful and courageous. Few writers with a male protagonist spend as much time developing their female counterparts in the way that Jordan has done in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wheel of Time - Disbelievers","review":"To let you all know where I am coming from I have read all nine of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time books multiple times and love them all.The Eye of the World is probably my favorite book in the series. It introduced me into the world, developed characters without confusing any (which by the way was a problem with some of Tolkiens writings), and left me wanting more. While the wisdom is snotty she is still important to the book overall. And while other characters are annoying or stupid or anything else that we don't like, that is okay because it resembles real life. Jordan does a wonderful job of drawing in the readers attention, although I must admit for the casual reader this series may take awhile to read; I read it, all nine books, in about 3 weeks. As long as you have some patience, you know the ability to read Tom Clancy's big long books, you will love this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start here...And be surprised...","review":"This is a good book indeed...Not the most fantastic book you've ever read, but it's a must, cause it's the beginning of one of the most imaginative series of our time...I'm not going to spoil, so all I can say is: read it and even if you find it a little too long or something, stuck to it, cause the Wheel of Time series got so much to tell you that, when you'll finish this one, you'll be wanting the next one so much... Give it a try, it's worth!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest fantasy series there is","review":"great book/series for young and old.

One thing that the audio version is *not* is \\"enjoyable\\". I don't mean to be rude, but where did they find this narrator? I have never heard such bizarre and disconcerting intonation in any professional audio production -- the stilted and odd vocal mannerisms bring out the worst in Jordan's formulaical prose. At no point could I ever bring myself to even begin to get mentally immersed in the story -- the narrator's unpredictable gasping, pauses, and idiosyncratic intonations are continuously unsettling.I give this one star only because I am not sure that if I left that choice \\"-\\" it would show up as zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble, dribble and more dribble....","review":"This book is nothing but a boring Tolkein ripoff. And the number of people willing to give it 5 stars is plain ridiculous. I've even read some comments comparing the author to Shakespeare. I can promise you one thing, the name Robert Jordan will not exists in literature in 20 years time, much less 100!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version a Giant Disappointment","review":"I love this book. The story itself I would give 4-4.5 stars.I was very excited to get a version for my Kindle. It's just so much easier to read for me than my well-used paperback. So why do I give this 1 star?1. $9.99 for something you can pick up for much less. Yes, it looks like the Kindle price came down to match the price but oh well.2. There are no maps (at least when I click on \\"maps\\" from the table of contents, it goes to a small blank area before chapter 1). I read on the Tor website that the e-books of The Wheel of Time would have maps, drop-down letters at the start of the chapters, chapter icons, etc. Amazon, where are my maps?3. Drop-down letters at the beginning of the chapter are rendered as a single letter on the line above.It looks like this:This is supposed to be a fancy start of a chapter.I hear that the Sony conversion is gorgeous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resenting the waste of my time!!!","review":"I can be brief.. because those other negative reviewers were so accurate. These books start out great but lead you nowhere. This IS Jordan's cash cow and he is milking it for every penny by writing all sorts of nonsense. The story keeps getting more complex with useless petty details and there is no end in sight.He's even writing prequels already. I resent the waste of my time in this story which I shall never finish. Save your cash and buy.....anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can pass this one safely","review":"I got about halfway through the book, when I just couldn't get on. Why? It is unoriginal. Gob'lin please no. Writing shows no special style. If you want to read fantasy, go get George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. Or even Goodkind's Sword of Truth, brutal though it is, Goodkind at least has a gripping plot unlike this bad copy of Tolkien. If you have read any of those two authors you will be dissapointed with Jordan.I can't imagine anyone reading volume after volume of stuff like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book + series.","review":"I enjoy this series and it is definatly one of the best.

Other than that, the series is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definate Must-Read!","review":"This is one of the best books I've read. Though it took awhile to get into, mainly because there was no review on the back. It is high class fantasy, unlike most of fantasy, though not really wordy.

The Great Hunt is even better in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I understand the coments of the book's detractors.","review":"Mat is left totally undeveloped, and Nynaeve could be summed up in two words: \\"Grow up.\\" The climax seems rushed; odd for such a long book. But beyond that the tale is well-crafted and enjoyable. If the book is to be judged by the enjoyment of reading it, this one hits a home run. The classic conflict (good/evil) Is done with more finesse than most writers can manage. If you're a fantasy fan, don't overlook it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good......BUT","review":"Basically, the book (and it's sequels) are very well written and enjoyable and I'd give it a 4 or a 5.

A friend gave me a copy, and I forced myself to read through all the difficult-to-pronounce names of people and places. But by chapter 5, I was hooked, I could hardly put it down. The characters start to fill out, and you begin to care about what happens to them. The plot is full of surprises, keeping the reader on his toes. I worked in a bookstore, and now I understand why customers were always coming in to find out book 8's release date! If you read fantasy, you have to read this one.

It was thin, weak, and hackneyed. The world the characters inhabited was fine, I suppose (or could have been), but the characters themselves became absolutely infuriating by the time I was halfway through the book. They were like cardboard cutouts- and cheap ones, at that. The women, especially...don't get me started.

All I have to say is that one of the best ways to know how good something is is to look at how many people try to copy it. sure other people have writen long 5+ book stories but the current popularity of in them is all because of Robert Jordan and the Wheele of Time. so ask your self. Do you want to read stories that may be ok but are basicly people jumping on the band wagon. Or would you like to read the storie that will go down in history as one of the greates works of fantasy ever writen. one of those stories known not only in Sci-fi fantasy circles but world wide?Buy it, read it, put it down and say 'WOW!' than pick it up and read it again because I garantee you missed something."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great.","review":"Robert Jordan's a great writer and this book entrapped me untill i was done with it.

It has captured me and now I have started collecting the series on Audio CD. I LOVE this series! It is so discriptive to allow you to see exactly what Jordan sees. The result is that you learn each character by heart. You fall in love with them and don't want to let go. I highly recommend this series for those who can't get enough of the never die shows. I am sad to think the one-day this series will be over. RJ has a very clever way to reel you in to his own little world. He has a great since of humor that he springs on you when you are not expecting it. Each character has such differant styles that it is hard to think how he can keep them straight through the whole series. I am currently waiting on BOOK 10 and can not wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for first time fantasy readers!","review":"Okay so I read the Lord of the Rings because I saw the movie, and Tolkein totally hooked me...than I was left with a question? What do I read now? Ive never really read anything before except a McDonald's menu. After scouring everywhere I decided to pick up The Eye of the World. I read the glossary first, studied the map, and 100 pages into it, I was HOOKED! Now I'm on book 3, purchasing book 5 on hardcover, and my girlfriend thinks I'm a bookworm now! I'll show her bookworm!Good Series!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, DRAGGY *yawn* - A major let down","review":"While waiting for the release of book 6 of the gripping Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind, I decided to give Wheel of Time, a series that has often been mentioned in the same breath by fans, a shot. What a disappointment it turned out to be. Compared to Goodkind, Jordan has the imagination of a peacock. His plot drags on and on and on with hardly anything ever happening except a bunch of terrified farmboys running, dreaming, and then running again. I may not be so harsh had I not read Goodkind prior to this, but I have and I can't believe people actually rate Jordan alongside Goodkind! Sword of Truth is way superior in every way - imagination, originality, plot, characters, suspense, violence, style of writing blah blah. SO my advice is, if you wanna give this book a go, make sure you've never read Sword of Truth or you'll only drive yourself crazy comparing the 2. I couldn't help it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE DIMENSIONAL CRAP!!!!","review":"This book sure does use alot of words to convey nothing. A bunch of kids set out on a journey with some sort of sorceress and her bodyguard. They gett attacked by trollocs, get split up, then get attacked by trollocs some more, then run some more. yada yada yada. The is very little character development. Mat Perrin and Rand may as well be the same person. It wouldn't make much difference in the story. Egwene and Nynaeve and Moraine are the same too. Lan could have been interesting but instead he is just wallpaper. I was expecting so much more from this book. Unless you like reading countless numbers of words that do not culminate into anything meaningful do not read this book. A monumental waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Friends don't recommend this to friends","review":"A friend of mine recommended this to me after we discovered a mutual liking of George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, so I gave it a shot. For about a month I forced myself to read this thing, a couple pages a night, but about 250 pages in I couldn't take it any more. This book is horribly written, repetitive, uninteresting, and just plan boring. If you're like me and books generally keep you up at night because you get somewhat addicted and play the \\"just one more chapter\\" game with yourself, then the best thing I can say about this book is that it will definitely cure you of that behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book is a must read for any fan of Fantasy Fiction. Tolkien created Fantasy and Jordan perfected it. He has created a world so real that every little detail is taken into consideration. I believe his magic system is the best ever created. This would make an incredible RPG world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story,terrible characters","review":"The story is sometimes interesting,sometimes boring but the characters (especially the female ones) are annoying!

It takes that long for the characters to develop any real depth or the story any real originality. Book one, 'The Eye Of The World,' isn't terribly original or well written and it will take Jordan the next couple of novels to reach his stride and put out something noteworthy. When you get there, you will be stunned by the scope and weight of his story, but it takes a considerable--and perhaps rediculous--amount of your commitment to get to that point. I wouldn't start the series unless you're looking to kill time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Anything Ever Happen?","review":"My expectations of this book and series were high, considering the majority of reviews. After 300 hundred pages I would say that this is a fairly boring book. I have decided not to complete the book as the thought of reading 9 more of the same size, considering the first 300 hundred pages of this book, is not worth the effort.Try reading the first 5 books of the Great Book of Amber, then stop. You will find that much more enjoyable and cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"anyone hear of J.r.r. tolkien?","review":"Well i read this book and i am not pleased. Mr. Jordan tears apart what Tolkien created and filled it crap. Im sorry if i couldnt write a book that was at least a little original, i wouldnt write one at all. Unfortunatly Mr. Jordan has.

It doesnt deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light hearted fantasy adventure for the kids.","review":"You have to suspend your disbelief when you are reading any of the books in the Wheel of Time series. I like a good fantasy/adventure type book, but this is a bit like comedy capers when dozens of huge troll-like creatures cannot even lay a finger on a few farm boys in a battle. It's also sad to see a world completely dominated by hen-pecking women who have all of the men literally shaking in their boots. If I see the word \\"bristled\\" again I think I'm going to scream!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"It speaks of the sad state of fantasy literature that his mound of hack is touted as its pinnacle. Granted, Jordan can do one thing quite well -- write descriptions. That does not necessarily make for a good literature, good characterization, or a good plot. As a matter of fact, Jordan has no concept of how to create a plot and his characterization is atrocious. The book is full of superfluous characters and pages of filler. There is no climax or conclusion, and the action scenes are unengagingly writtne. It is too bad, really, for once in a while there is a glimmering of an idea or a nice scene. Mostly -- boring, derivative, and over-long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anyone give this 5 stars?","review":"This book was a complete waste of about five ro six hours. I tried it out because of all the good reviews. It was way too predictable. You just knew what was going to happen from the beginning. The main charactor (I didn't even bother to remember his name) just \\"happens\\" to have a sword from a group of the best swordsmen around. Jordan tries to throw you off with a few other charactors, but did a horrible job of it. If you are sick of reading crap like this, try reading \\"A Game of Thrones\\" by Geroge R.R. Martin, or reread Tolkien's stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope you have spare time, your never gona put it down.","review":"This is certainly the best book I've ever read. Most books start off boring, but the action picks up after only two chapters. I've never seen a series with so many characters and so many diffrent sub-plots. Robert Jordan truly made his own world. All I can say now is I can't wait for his next book to come out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly OK!!!","review":"I read this book considering its much acclaimation, but this book doesn't proves true to its hype. Robert Jordan has stolen everything right from the plotline to the characters name and the geography of the world from others, mostly from Tolkein.The biggest letdown I found here was the ending. The climax is written in too much hurry, I think.First of all, I dont know why the name Eye of the world. It only comes in the end and only for 2 pages and doesnt have enough importance. Than from nowhere 2 Forsaken enters and our Hero battles and defeats one of them too!!!READ THIS BOOK FOR JUST MERE ENTERTAINMENT AND DONT EXPECT TOO MUCH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring at best","review":"I am a huge fantasy fan, and picked up this book because of a literay comparison on the back cover to Tolkien. I was eager to be swept away into a complex world only to be sorely disappointed. The story line has borrowed extensively from Tolkien and in itself is too simply written for me. The characters were not developed enough and nothing lasting or truly exciting happened at all in this book. By page 600 I was straining to keep my eyes open and praying for something to happen and was left with nothing. Jordan has thrown in references to the past ages of the Breaking of the World and alludes to historical context to place the current setting. However alludes is all he does it was like he was throwing random references in anywhere and would not elaborate to build up a good story. This book in no way is comparable at any level to Tolkien or any other great book. This book would be good for children I suppose because that is the level of the writing in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 1 is good, Books 2 thru whatever spiral downward","review":"Book 1 is good. However after book4, I really wanted all thecharacters to just pack it in. The world is heading for ruin and thecharacters are getting into petty arguments and not cooperating. Oh my the world is ending and I have to do the laundry again, whaaaaa! Sheesh! Please end this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but I never bothered beyond this one","review":"A kind of typical Tolkien knockoff. Better than some but worse than others. If you really dig fantasy then Jordan will probably suit you just fine. If your standards are high (and mine are) you will probably want to pass this one on. I was bored out of my skull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Disappointing","review":"Although the beginning was a bit slow, I stuck with \\"The Eye of the World\\" and continued reading, hoping the story would eventually pick up. It didn't. Robert Jordan's eye for detail is the only positive element of this book. The story dragged on and on (too wordy!), I couldn't relate to any of the characters (frankly, I didn't care if Darkfriends bashed Rand's head in with a club), and there was no drama or suspense whatsoever (I knew what was going to happen a chapter before it did). The \\"climax\\" at the end was pathetic and not a climax at all. Read it if you have absolutely nothing else to do in your spare time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best fantasy series yet.","review":"It is true that Jordan's description of things sometimes gets boring. But if you focus on everything else, you'll forget about everything you didn't enjoy.What makes Robert Jordan's writing so exquisite is that he can create a world of good and evil with believable characters and an exciting plot. This is my HONEST TO GOD opinion! I am not sucking up AT ALL!In comparison with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", the Eye of the World is much more detailed and described. It is more of an epic than Tolkien's work. Now, don't get me wrong. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a beautiful, moving story full of magic and emotion. But it seems to me that Jordan's work is more of a series, while TLotR is more of a huge, single masterpiece.All in all, The Eye of the World is deeply recommended by me to anyone who is even thinking about attempting to maybe like fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koo Koo Cacho For This GREAT Book","review":"I love this Book!

Save Yourself.","review":"For years now Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series has been unfolding. Actually, unfolding is too strong a word. It implies movement of some kind.Taken by itself, Eye of the World is not a terrible book. Nor is the next book, The Great Hunt. Why then does it merit one star? Because this series long ago descended into a quagmire of unresolving plot threads, unmoving story, static (but oh-so-detailed) characters and meaningless dream sequences. ....And the fact is, it's not that great a book to begin with. Here's the plot: A mysterious magic user tells a farm boy that it's his destiny to stop an arbitrarily evil force, a force which happens to reside an unreasonable distance away - on the other corner of the map in fact. If this plot does not scream \\"Original\\" I don't know what does.Taken by itself this book is a little padded with a rather vague climax, and not anything that special.Taken as a whole, the series is a lot padded, incredibly plodding, ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for its time, a good laugh now","review":"Reviewing a classic, it's good to remember how relevant the book was for its time. What seems a cliche now, could very well be a new/uncommon idea back in the days (1990, I believe?). With this in mind, Eye of the World undoubtedly is a good introductory book with some merit for younger readers.Reading it in 2008, however, will reward a more mature reader no more than a smile. Every character is overexaggerated and the dialogue will either make you vomit or tip over with laughter (thankfully, the second for me). The overall level of writing is below average. Even the contemporary \\"gems\\" like The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss will stand tall in comparison to Jordan's use of language.If you are a new reader looking for an idea of what to expect in this book/series, let me warn you - don't even start.

I guess I had high expectations for this series. A few reviewers compared Jordan to Tolkien; nothing could be farther from the truth. Jordan's ham-fisted foreshadowing takes all of the mystery out of the plot. The Orcish knockoff Trollics (how mundane is THAT name) were about as frightening as my family dog. I never felt for the characters, they never came across as real. Perhaps this is a good introduction to the genre for young readers. If you are looking for a mature fantasy series try George R.R.

A friend clued me into the EOTW, and, despite a slow beginning, I soon became enthralled with all the subplots and intrique. One of the more fascinatings things I found about reading Jordan is trying to imagine where he could possibly go with all those seemingly trivial tangents the stories take. I'm on book 3 now (it's taken me a month) and I'm trying to pace myself for the #8 release in November (I hate waiting). I really enjoy the Aes Sedai; having women take such a pivotal role in many of the main events makes this series so much more than a sword weilding/blood spewing fest. My favorite character though, is one of the men, Perrin. I hope Jordan develops this character's complexities in dealing with his \\"gift\\".

He is quite adept at keeping the reader guessing. One thing I really like is his ability to convey even the mundane thoughts of the protaganists. Rand, Perrin, and Mat are all \\"real\\" people. The story line progressese nicely with lots of surprises and interesting twists. It was a very enjoyable read.That is not to say that the story is not without a few flaws. At times, I got bored with the failure of advancement of plot. Rand and Mat do wander a bit too much.Yet these little annoyances do not detract from the main story.

It was written by David Eddings and it was titled, \\"Pawn of Prophecy.\\" It featured the young farmer of unknown parentage who sees a mysterious shadowy cloaked figure trailing him at times--but it's always gone. It has a blacksmith of virtue and oh-so-practical values who doesn't like to hurt people or be called \\"Lord.\\" It has a mysterious dark-haired, beautiful sorceress who is very imperious, allows no nonsense, and can often be found brushing her hair before bed. It also has an old storyteller who has more skills and knowledge than others would believe--he's more than he appears. Oh, and there's a connection between the main characters and wolves.

The group ends up getting split up for some reason but are magically reunited and work together to destroy the evil being almost magically. Tons of pointless filler is included in order to make the book longer until the author realizes he has a deadline to meet and does a insta-ending where by some strange form of magic the charachters travel farther than they did in the first 60 pages in the book and almost instantly destroy the evil being with as little conflict necessary in about 30 pages.

Comparing their respective works tends to obfuscate their relative worth.The series as a whole seems like it would have made a great trilogy or possibly quartet. The early books have strong plots, clear themes, usually pleasnt (though occasionally irritating) characterizations.However, he soon becomes enamoured of his own creation, and like frankenstein's monster or a golem of old, it takes on a life of its own and refuses to die a natural death.

Unlike others, I don't care that Jordan rips off Tolkien (trollocs, anyone?). Instead, I'm furious that he has stolen characters straight out of Eddings's Belgariad: the sturdy blacksmith with down-to-earth values, the haughty, blue-clad, imperious sorceress, the vagabond old man storyteller, and even a connection with wolves. The opening, where Rand suspects some shadowy figure following him is also straight out of Pawn of Prophecy. Why hasn't Eddings sued this poser? Also, the boys vs. girls theme that Eddings began to take a little too far by the 8th book (in the Mallorean) is already overdone obnoxiously by the end of book 1. Surely we can find better authors that don't steal their ideas straight from better sources. Read Eddings and compare for yourself.

Jordan excels at creating a complex, involving world with a real feeling of history. Contributing more to this distinction than perhaps any other aspect of the world is the highly systematized and endlessly fascinating type of \\"magic,\\" explored very successfully and at great length throughout the series. Battle scenes are also very well written. Characters are somewhat less compelling, especially later in the series, where they often speak and act according to simplistic gender stereotypes. These books can also be stylistically tedious at times, covering and re-covering the same ground; Jordan displays little metaphorical and descriptive inventiveness. But these faults aren't really apparent in \\"Eye of the World;\\" just be prepared to deal with them in the later volumes, because once you read \\"Eye,\\" you'll probably be hooked for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but it took some time before it got addictive","review":"Well, the book is well written and all that, but I think it took just a little bit too long before I was unable to put it down.

With most books, when something sad happens I usually sit back and sarcasticly say the words ''How emotional''. With this book, when something sad happens I feel sad, when something good happens I feel happy. I don't watch tv much, but if someone could make a movie that was half as exciting as this book, I would watch it over at least ten times. (I say this because that's exactly what I want to do with this book)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's gotta start somewhere","review":"I love The Wheel of Time. I am now on the fourth book and I can tell you I will definetely finish the series. When I finished TEoTW I thought it was the best, yet when I continued I found that the books keep getting better and better. Therefore you have to start somewhere. Perhaps the reason TEoTW isn't as good as the other books is because of the insane character development that manifests in the others. Jordan writes with more attention to detail than any other author I've encountered. His young characters face hilariously awkward moments, and we learn that courage and believing in yourself conquer all. Pick up this book, because by the time you get to the fourth or fifth, you'll be extremely happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fantasy series","review":"Everyone complains that the series gets worse towards the end. I at times was frustrated towards the 10th book, however in the end you really wish Rob wrote more. You miss the characters and the awesome character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A workout for the brain.","review":"Did you know that there are people who actually find running marathons fun? Really!Well, if you are not the type that likes to earn your enjoyment through sweat, hardwork, and commitment then you probably should not read this series. It is time comsuming, addicting, and will leave you anxious for the next book. For people who like to work for there play, I highly recommend it. I fell in love with this book from page one, although first time readers should give it at least the first chapter.Nothing like MORGAN LLYWELYN, MELANIE RAWN,GUY GAVRIEL KAY or even TOLKIEN. These are a few of the authors I enjoy reading and I have never felt that any author should try to be like them. If anything I like these books BECAUSE they are so different. (although...have you read anything by TERRY GOODKIND)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A word about the Aes Sedai","review":"Since so many have reviewed the overall content, I want to add that this author has created a very interesting spiritual milieu -- the world of the Aes Sedai, a group of women who have been specifically trained in the ways of spirit and then move into the world to assist. As in all \\"religions\\" there are those who hold to the pure intent and others who are seduced by power, authority, and the other hazards of assuming responsibility of a higher nature. The thread detailing the history of the Aes Sedai was my favorite part of the books!!! The Wheel weaves as it will."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a non fantasy reader","review":"I'm not a big fan of fantasy, well, I've never actually read fantasy before. I have attempted to read a couple and found that I couldn't get into it. But this book was very readable with a great pace. I didn't have to work at the book at all. For such a big book, it went by quite fast. I don't have major raves about it because it didn't hit any particular emotional or philosophical spot, but I did enjoy it. I'm now looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rand is the Dragon Reborn! (Woo! Ruined it for you newbies!","review":"You might all think this book is about Good vs.Evil from reading the rest of these reviews, butits not! Its the Battle of the Sexes! Every otherline a women calls a man a wool headedstubborn ox, crosses her arms, and sniffs.Make the sniffing stop!!! All women in WOT MUSThave some kind of chronically stuffed nose!But really, this book, aand all after it kick.They are really the best I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read","review":"All i can say is that this is one of the best books i have read in a long time... I would compare it to the Death's Gate Cycle... but that is like comparing Fast Fry Steak (DGC) and a Sirloin Tip (WOT).. i'm only now reading the second book of the series and i can't put it down.. looking forward to the rest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Couldn't put it down!","review":"I really had no interest in this type of book until my friend told me how great it was. So when he finished with it, he gave it to me to read. Well, I loved it, I couldn't put it down! Jordan goes into his characters lives so intensly that I felt like I'd known them for years. An excellent book, definately read it if you get the opportuninty. I'm in the middle of book 5 right now, and I have 6 waiting on my bookshelf!!! They get better as you go along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good.","review":"I got the idea of reading this book one night when I was bored and a friend said it was good. I bought The Eye of the World the next day. It was a little slow getting into it, but not boring. After the story picked up, I couldn't put it down. I expected it to be good, because I trust my friend's judgement, but this exceeded my greatest expectations. Even if some (okay, most) of the elements of the book are \\"borrowed\\" from other fantasy writers, they are changed enough (in my opinion) to not provoke me to run around screaming about plagiarism unlike certain other reviews here. For a start to a series, it plays on your sense of the familiar to make you feel relaxed while reading it. I don't know if the others are the same way or not, but I only have one complaint about the book: It is a little too long for paperback. When I finished I had to glue the cover back onto the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danger! Addicting series with no end in sight","review":"I don't know wiether to thank or hate the friend who recommended this series to me. It certainly is enjoyable, at least up to book six where I am at. The characters definitely seem like real people, the vivid detail gives a feeling that I've visited these places. The political intrigue and fanatical religious fervor of each culture resemble this morning's newpaper headlines. You get a sense that Jordan wrote down his favorite Tolkien literary devices on 3x5 notecards, suffled them out of order and then for the first three books in his series pulled a card at random when he needed to spice up the story. HOWEVER, as the story progressed he did become more original in ideas but sacrificed plausability. I have and will recommend this series to people, that is if I can find anyone left who hasn't started it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eye of the World. . . It just MIGHT be worth it. . .","review":"In the Eye of the World, Robert Jordan writes a very good story. I must admit, however, that the story is far better than the four stars that I have given it, yet in all honosty, compared to the second and third book, the only reason that I'd give to read it is so that you wont get hopelessly lost latter on. . . Still. . .it's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fantasy ever writen.","review":"Tokien is the King of fantasy, but Jorden is most definitely the crowned prince. A suspence that keeps you hooked to the end and keeps you dying for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please make the hurting stop.","review":"What, may I ask, is so wonderful about this brain-dead book? It can't be the story, which is some God-awful combination of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Seven Samurai\\". It can't be the characters, which strike me as mindless zombies meandering from point to point with little to no personality shown on their parts. The idiotic writing can't be it. So, what in heavens is it? Masterpiece? Greatest fantasy ever? I don't think so. But people will keep buying it and reading it, and then they'll come here and talk about how wondrous it is. And I'll be left to wonder. Why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"The Wheel of Time is not badly written, just very unimaginative and a general rip-off of the whole fantasy genre. I myself hate when authors babble too much, which is clearly the case here, but even if you like that kind of thing, the book isn't _that_ good.It's a very ordinary fantasy tale with a party of heroes, all of them with Great Destinies, traipse around the countryside and try to evade evil shadow-wraiths (Tolkien), ghosts and some or other Lord of Evil. (He didn't show up in the first book, but I refuse to read another 2000 pages to meet him)They're simply not worth the number of pages you have to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read!","review":"This is an excellent book! I liked it so much it only took me 5 days to read it, and I am going to start the second soon!! Anyone who likes fantasy and adventure, this book's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To save you some time.","review":"This is a good attempt to recreate the works of Tolkien, if you want fantasy on a grand scale, do yourself a favor and read tolkien. Please don't read thousands and thousands of pages to find this out yourself. The story goes on way to long, about 8 books all 700 pages long. Just read Tolkien you will be much more pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"The beginning was a little slow, but as you get to know the characters, you learn to love most of them. There is wonderful use of forshadowing, in this book especially, and I only have one criticism. This is totally a male fantasy. This theme of hormones (yes hormones, not necessarily love on the guy's part) begins to run a lot deeper in the later books, and is somewhat annoying to us female readers, but overall it is a fun read. It goes by fast, adn you really get to know all of the characters. Don't be daunted by the size of the book it is a fast and enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Already?","review":"Although I enjoyed reading most of this book, it seemed to just spiral downhill towards the end. The beginning was slow, and although many parts had me holding my breath out of fear, or reading more to find the answers to intriguing questions of Rand's past, when there were only 100 pages left, I had to force myself to finish it, and by the end I was so shocked that Robert Jordan could ever call the end a conclusion, that I almost regretted picking up the book in the first place. All in all, there are equal amounts of good and bad parts in the book, so it's up to you whether you want to end the book confused and feeling unfinished to read through the good parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"If you are in need of some serious reading material, and want to read a series of books for the next year or two, pick up this book, and start the series! You'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start to the series","review":"By now I have read all the books that have come out in this series so far (that being 9 books) and I find the whole series enjoyable if not a bit drawn out. The first book is excellent for a first in a series. Robert Jordan creates an entirely new and imaginative world with original ideas and captivating plots. I enjoyed the companionship between the Two Rivers folk the most, especially between Mat, Rand and Perrin, each who think the other two are great with women. The books that have followed The Eye of the World are good; each book has its own individual climax while still leaving questions unanswered, and each time introducing new characters and new plots. An excellent book, a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a master minded jordan","review":"I think jordan really hit it big with this book.

I read it like it was the Bible for my life at the time, a few years back. I stayed up all night reading it. I was soon addicted to it like methamphetamine, so much so that I read the next five books. I think that there are too many books in this series, but the first couple books are mind-bogglingly good, and the first one is slap-your-own-grandma crazy awesome. I like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, The Lord of the Rings, Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, and most of the American classic novels. Do yourself a favor, read this book. Come on, there are a gazillion (READ: over a thousand) reviews on it! At the very least you'll have something to talk about with thousands of other people in the world, and the reason for reading a book directly behind learning and opening your mind is having something to talk about with people! And so began the birth of the New York Times Bestseller List..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm just getting into epic fantasy . . .","review":". . . so I can't really review this book relative to the genre, or to the rest of the Wheel of Time series. However, I can say that it's the best book of any sort that I've read in a long time. The story is heavily detailed, with plenty of action, suspense, and intricate plotting. That might seem like enough, but the key to liking a story is caring about the characters, and that's where The Eye of the World comes through in spades. Lan, Moiraine, Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve, and Thom are all likeable, fully formed people, and as I was reading I found it easy to feel what they felt (especially Rand). I give The Eye of the World my highest recommendation. I'm going to read the next book in the series, The Great Hunt, as soon as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable.","review":"I remember this book had me on my heels all night long and longer. Beautiful and vividly created worlds and magical things endlessly filled me with hungry awe. The struggle of the main characters so excitingingly formidable.

An extraodinary, breathtaking long adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Regretful","review":"The cover-page looks nice. That's the only thing good about this book.

I tried very hard to enjoy this book but it was terrible. The characters were the worst ever seen, the settings were boring and the plot was put together rather stupidly. This is the worst work of fantasy along with George R. R. martin's Game of Thrones. There is so little wonder which graces these books. Stay away from this book. If you haven't already read, Tolkien. If so go and try out David Eddings and or some of Terry Brooks' works. Stay away from Robert Jordan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a boring book","review":"I admit that I am just getting into the fantasy book scene, but I read the LOTR books and I loved them. So while looking for something else I picked up this book. Mostly because the cover said something about Jordan picking up where Tolkien left off. Boy was that wrong! I got about 300 pages into this book and just could not stomach it anymore! Robert Jordan's writing style is boring. I really don't care about any of the characters and I feel like he had the help of a 10 year old to write this book. It's like he asked some kid off the street to make up names for his characters and names for the places. Maybe he enlisted that kid that wrote that other LOTR rip off Eragon.I was totally disappointed in this book since I was looking forward to reading a really good series, and this one had so many books in the series I was hoping for it to be good.So save your money and go buy the LOTR instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"this book was great, although its not as good as the ones that follow it. i've read all the books up to the 9th one and am waiting for the 10th to come out now. the first one doesnt really get into what the others do, it really just builds the characters and stuff, which is great, but doesnt seem all that interesting when you read it... especially the first half, but i do highly recomend it, just dont stop after it, read the second too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Fantasy enthusists","review":"Beware!

I gave it a chance...6 chances. But seriously nothing ever happens. It's all so dull that any action is greeted with such enthusiasm that you think its the best...but that's like saying \\"Nick Cage is the best actor ever!\\" after staring at a brick wall for 3 days. The good parts are only good because the rest is so boring. Even by book 6 some of the characters still don't believe they could possibly have special powers, even after they use them. Don't get me started on the ridiculous metaphors. Good lord. \\"Does a sliverfish swim through a net made by a Halpen?\\" What?!?! Maybe if you told us what the heck those two things were we would know. I love my Sci-fi, fantasy, all that. I'm a self proclaimed geek. But even I have my limits.

Any costs associated with producing this book we recouped a thousand fold before anyone ever thought of selling the ebook.

True, it does have some familiar ideas (which Jordan acknowledges), but these are merely exposition for the many plot twists and exciting adventures to come.

When I began reading the SoT novels, I was actually laughing out loud at how extensively Goodkind ripped off Jordan's almost every idea. At any rate, this series is very original and exciting and I would suggest not even starting the series unless you are willing to read every book at least twice as there is so much information it can't all be absorbed in just one read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow","review":"This is the first in what for the most part is a highly entertaining series with a couple of good twists on magic use and its consequences. That being said I would like to warn readers who are more into the action packed detial light fantasy novels that Robert Jordan is not one to skimp on the details even in a full out battle. He seems to remedy this use of extreme detail in the following books but none the less this almost over use of detail can cause the book to move quite slowly, which may cause some readers to put the book down in defeat and miss the experience of a lifetime that the rest of the series gives.Overall I give it four stars for the sheer literary brilliance of the author and his ability to make the mundane glow with detail and. Only reason for the lack of five is due to the fact that the detail may turn some readers away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed, vibrant, exciting","review":"I just finished this first book in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, and was quite impressed with it. While it is certainly not great literature, Jordan has certainly crafted an imaginative and (emphasis here) greatly detailed fantasy world. I was truly impressed with the complexity and the attention to detail evident in this book. The action scenes were fantastic, exciting and well-written, and the whole of the story is placed in a world as credible as our own. As I begin The Great Hunt, I only hope the rest of the series is as great as this initial entry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just short of a classic.","review":"Well, not quite a resounding classic, yet it still manages to be thoroughly entertaining. I must conceed that if the remainder of the series follows this example it will get somewhat tedious, however, in and of itself I found this book a great read. The characters were likeable, the plot involving and no, it was NOT too long, unless you have never read fantasy before. I'll definately be reading The Great Hunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but has some flaws","review":"This book was definitely good. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Jordan has created a wondeful and memorable world, however i feel he screwed up with one thing. He obviously tried to give women a greater and more important role compared to most other books. I totally agree with him and applaud his efforts. However he went a bit over the line. Instead of giving women a more important role or a role equal with men, he totally thrust them up over men and made them totally dominant. Men are like pets to them in this seris. The women in this book dont do anything but talk about how great they are and how stupid men are. Theyre personalities sometimes make me angry. They refuse to ever be wrong, even when they obviously are. And if theres ever a problem, they blame it on men. Men men men men men. It gets to me. Other than that though i loved this series so far and am currently on book 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"pringles","review":"This book is like the first chip from a pringles can... you just have to consume the rest. ;) Cheesy I know, but I will always treasure this book for opening up the door to Robert Jordan's world.

His first book was very entertaining and capturing, but there was something about the last chapters the confused me: His battle with Aginor. I think it became more confusing in the norwegian version of the book because it wasn't written in Jordan's \\"true language\\" it was translated from English to Norwegian. I think I will read the last chapters in the english version, maybe it will become easier to understand than."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down - instantly wanted to read Book 2!","review":"I'm quite glad that I was introduced to this remarkable series. I'm amazed by the grand depth of the world that Rand and his companions live in. Even though I'm the kind of person who likes to get into the action quickly, and the real action didn't start until past page 50, I still loved it. I read it so much in such a short period of time that I felt it was not around 800 pages, but much shorter. The non-action parts of the book are quite interesting, and the action makes you feel as if you are really there. I recommend this book as a must-read for anyone who likes fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a whiter shade of pale","review":"O, the Shame: 782 pages I will never get back (800, including the glossary). Read Tolkien, Martin, Rothfuss. Then reread them. Do this instead of wasting your time on Jordan, whose work pales in comparison. Highly derivative of Tolkien, but about a hundredth as well written or interesting. Never makes you laugh, like Martin does every time you encounter Tyrion Lannister. Gives you almost no real sense of character, as does Rothfuss with his protagonist, Kvothe. Overall, just really dull, flat, and lifeless. I slogged through this first book of the series but will never crack open the 2nd or 3rd I unfortunately bought as part of a box set. One last thing - they say, \\"Never judge a book by its cover.\\" But, in this case, the extremely cheesy cover (of the mass market paperback edition) really should have made me stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera with weak female characters","review":"Jordan seemed to think that one makes a strong female character by giving her magical powers rather than making her a strong person.Unfortunately, all his female characters behave like spoiled children playing at being grown ups. This might be tolerable if, through the series, these characters matured. But they don't. In fact, all his female characters are the same petulant 4 year old wearing a different dress and hair colour.Amid world shattering events, all they can talk about is who's going to kiss whom and who gets to boss whom around. The discussions about bossing around go on interminably regardless of whether it's a conflict between two women or between men and women.I'm not sure Jordan ever actually met a strong woman.The \\"who's the biggest hen in the hen house\\" fiasco never stops and gets extremely tiresome, detracting from the story constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, for Pete's Sake!","review":"These books started out quite promising, but have gone on so long, with new major (and totally pointless minor) characters popping up so often along the way that it has devolved into fantasy soap opera. Only buy these books if you're into endless serials in which nothing is ever resolved. Give me strength..."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"Jordan has basically taken ideas from all the great fantasy books out there and has thrown them together. He has \\"borrowed\\" from Brooks, Weiss and Hickman, and of course Tolkien. There are even elements of The Dark Tower series by Stephen King in here. Also there is no reason to have over 10 books in the series, at this point it seems to be about making money rather than developing a storyline. Do yourself a favor if you are a serious reader of fantasy, skip this unoriginal series by this unoriginal author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Outstanding plots with characters so vivid and interesting you will find it hard to stop reading.

However, I did plod through it the first time around but couldn't do it the second time around as I tried to figure out why so many people lked it.My favorite author is George R.R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series.I will add that RJ helped rejuvenate the fantasy genre in the early 90s in this first book.However, for the reasons stated above, as well as just not liking any of the characters or feeling enough emotional resonance . . . RJ cut in to the pacing too much by going off into Historical tangents too often . . . I can't give this a very high score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I was looking for a good book to read and was a bit hesitant to pick up this book. I don't like to read books that I won't finish. That this series is 13 books long and none of the short, it seemed like a daunting task to start the series and not have the wind to finish it.I was pleasantly suprised with the first book. I gladly picked up the second and am enjoying it. I've heard that some of the other books can drag on, but so far, I'm in for the long haul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty easy & enjoyable read","review":"Pretty pleased with the first book in the Wheel of Time series. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the continual feeling of \\"Oh my, this is so scary & dangerous, how could it possibly get worse? Oh wait, like THIS!\\" Not a bad tactic, seeing as it keeps you reading, but knowing there are several more books it'll be interesting to see what else Robert Jordan can bring to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I had high expectations from this book, as it was recommended to me by many people I trust on the topic. I gave him a long try (two third of it), but had to stop reading it, as it was too much: all the components and ideas I refused to meet in a book were there: characters who bump into other main characters \\"by chance\\" (yeah, I know, it's the Wheel of time), sort-of teleporters to make travels faster... Sorry, but for me it's old fashioned fantasy working when there is nothing else on the market. However: the book is very well written, and the world seem to be rich. But I couldnt find any affinity with any of the characters... R. Feist or R. Hobb gave me way more adventurous feeling and pationate worlds to devour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start to a bad series.","review":"I hate to say this because the author has passed away, but picking up this book will be the begnining of years of pain. This book and the few that follow it are very good, they get you hooked. Then the series slows to a crawl and it becomes a chore to finish because you've become interested in the characters and the story. Jordan begins to write like a college student trying to fill space on a page of a term paper. Sadly, he passed before finishing and I've just learned that the author chosen to finish the \\"last\\" book is going to stretch it out into three. This is after the first writer stretched a decent 5 books into a torturous 11. I will not continue, I advise you not to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start","review":"The Eye of the World provides an excellent starting point for the Wheel of Time series. It shows Jordan's world, and lets us know just how big and varied it is. In all the novels I have read, none has given me the illusion of an entire planet full of people such as Jordan's has. I can find only two faults in this book. One is that it seems as though very little happens by way of the plot when compared to later books in the series, and the second is that the ending seems a bit rushed, like he needed to meet a deadline and quickly wrote the last few chapters. It is a worthwile book, however, and a mere prelude to an amazing series of books. If you have ever wanted to see a real, living, breathing, fantasy world, look no further than the Wheel of Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Excellent","review":"I'll admit that when I received this 700+ page book for Christmas a year ago, it was one of those forced thank you smiles I gave in return. But, when I had nothing else to do, I picked it up and read it in 2 days. I now own all 8 books of the series so far, and am eagerly awaiting the 9th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter an incredible world, get stuck reading 1000's of pages","review":"I have read 7 of the 8 books in Wheel of Time and have thoroughly enjoyed the world created by Robert Jordan. A world without electricity and pollution, a world where good and evil are at war. This first book introduces interesting characters who are confronted with important problems to solve. Much of the book covers their unending journey to battle the Dark One. My complaint is that the wonderful complications are not brought to a satisfying conclusion. With each book, I think \\"Boy, this will be great when all these interesting characters resolve all the problems they face\\". Unfortunately, the reader is teased and left hanging wondering what will happen, and so on to the next book. I wanted to a nice climax to the action. I keep hoping, book after book, that some conclusions will be reached. Why not conclude the story already and have the next book start a new story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rulish to the extreme!!!!","review":"This book is by far one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read, and it is one that I highly suggest any and all fans of the genre read. While the switching between characters can sometimes be a bit confusing the story itself grows harder to put down with each twist in the plot, and as the characters grow you will come to love and hate different ones at different times. This one is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will never end...","review":"I case you don't know much about this series, know this: there are already 10 installments, and more to come. And just take a look at the size of each volume!Before you pick up this book, look up the reviews of those poor souls who have read the last installment - notice the weariness? Most are bored and upset, and even those who kind-of-liked-it are really tired of it. Because the truth is, this series will never end.And the pity is that this could have been a very good series. \\"The Eye of the World\\" starts out as an excellent book, with rich descriptions and 3-D characters. But, around mid-point you start to have this nagging feeling that things are not progressing as they should, that events are moving way too slowly, and it just gets worse and worse.So: you have been warned. I was able to break the spell and abandon the series afte this first volume; there are many who have not been so lucky..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first in a series of wearisome trudges up a sand dune","review":"Jordan's work is fantastic! These are the rave reviews of friends and family regarding Jordan's Wheel Of Time series. Fantastic indeed! The book is so overdone with useless detail it reminds me of a recent hike of mine up a gargantuan sand dune near the Empty Quarter: I thought I'd never get to the top. But I went on, waiting expectantly for the breathtaking panorama that would overwhelm me. However as I crested the dune what did I see? More of the same dull, labour intensive trekking ahead of me with Jordan's dunes stretched out endlessly before me. Endless because of the anticlimactic non-resolution which I'm certain is part of Mr. Jordan's marketing strategy. Well, Mr. Jordan, you can ply your wares elsewhere. I'd rather read the sales brochure for a vacuum cleaner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle transfer full of errors.","review":"The book was a great read; I got it for my Kindle as one of my first choices. But it's the worst transfer I have ever seen - obviously nobody took even one look at the output before putting it one sale. When I complained, I was asked to report \\"where the error was\\". After listing over 75 errors, I gave up looking and sent the list in. Surely Amazon could work out that the entire file was rubbish, but now I see it's still on sale.Don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fantasy volume ever (and I've read a lot of that)","review":"Robert Jordan has created a milestone. The Eye of the World contains everything a great fantasy novel should have. I own many fantasy books, but not a one comes close to The Eye of the World's stature. Anyone who thinks that the Wheel of Time series is going nowhere should read it over again and reevaluate their poor judgement. I own the first three Wheel of Time books, and I'm getting into the second one. And it appears to be getting better every page"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous and slow","review":"The series starts with a bang, but deserves to have died an honorable death at the end of volume 3, at which point it becomes very clear that rather than bringing things to a logical conclusion, the author decided to milk as much money from his readers as possible. Whole volumes have now been written in which the plot does not advance one step. I quit reading about two-thirds of the way through volume 5 and any reader with half a brain or with something better to do (like watch the grass grow) has done likewise. Perhaps the most over-rated series in the genre. Doesn't hold a candle to J. R. R. Tolkien"},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"this book was very disappointing. I bought it after a lot of people said it was one of their favorites. I found it boring and too long. It might have been better if it was maybe half as long. I read 13 other books while reading it because it was so long and boring. I was going to rate it a one star but I think the charater Loial deserves a star of his own. He was about the only thing from the book that I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated...","review":"I tried reading this book, and I found it boring, tedious, uninspiring...I was also frustrated by how much was 'copied' from Tolkien, an infinitely better writer. I did not find myself getting into the book, and more importantly, it's a story with not much substance or beauty to it, even in the language.also, I think this series would continue for a loooooong time; I don't know if Jordan would ever stop writing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start, too bad the series stagnates later","review":"I've been reading this series since the first volume was initially released. I loved it for years, but now I have to admit: Robert Jordan has failed to make a completely engaging series.After book six, RJ seemed to run out of creativity and even a sense of telling a good story. NOTHING HAPPENS ANYMORE! Interior monologues going to seven or eight pages at a time is a cheap way to pop out a 1000 page book and call it epic. The series is not beyond redemption - if RJ remembers what made his series popular in the first place and makes a stomping good last few books I'll be happy. But I have the horrid growing suspicion that the Last Battle is going to be a bunch of characters standing around a council table talking on and on about saving the world piece at a time while still fretting over twisted romances.Read the books but be ready to be let down after Lord of Chaos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!!","review":"When I first read the Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien I thought that nothing would come close to its excellence. However, this first book in an eight book series completely blew me away and it definitely equals Tolkien's work. Once you read this book the other seven seem to fly by. Jordan is a master!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating but...","review":"I loved it, it felt like I truly was in another world, escaping evil etc. BUT... Jordon's books are more like a dream world than a reality. His characters are so one sided and fake. If girls acted like Egwene and Nynaeve the human race would have perished long ago, its so frustrating that Jordan can weave such an enchanting tale but not understand people enough to create decent characters. The book loses the whole theme of human relationships and interactions, its sad. While I'm rambling, what the hell is Jordan doing with Moraine, she's an intelligent character so why can't she tell Rand what she knows??? Jordan really needs to rethink his methods of creating suspense. Hard to believe I liked the book despite all of my gripes but... I did ...and I'm now on the thir d book of the series.One last thing: If you want something deeper than jordan with just as much plot (kind of a darker flavor) try Consider Phlebas by Iain M Banks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absording and wonderfully written!!","review":"Robert Jordan has created a world of fantasy that is better than any I have read. The length just improves the quality. I highly recommend the Wheel of Time series to everyone! Read this book. You won't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A paradigmatic fantasy","review":"I have to admit, after reading the first 5 suspense-packed pages, I expected a great story to unfold. However, after the main characters were introduced, I began to see where this predicable fantasy adventure was going: nowhere. The plot is painfully long and drawn out, and the characters are so typical and uninteresting, that after 300 pages I became indifferent on whether or not the slobbering, rabbid dog things that Jordan calls \\"Trollocs\\" killed them."},{"rating":"1","title":"all this praise is overblown","review":"I am a great fan of fantasy and sci-fi, but this is one of the few books I couldn't bring myself to finish. I believe I would have enjoyed it had I read it at the age of fifteen or less. However at the age of twenty all I can say is: boring. Characters lack development, names of beings are just puns of other more known names (The main bad guy is Shai'tan - Satan). There must be at least a dozen authors who can and has developed the \\"innocent youngsters chased by bad guys\\" plot better. It is basically this: be chased, fight Trollocks (Orcs), encounter new characters (and then forget them), be chased some more. I am honestly puzzled at the five stars-reviews. Especially if you are a Tolkien fan: keep away from this book. I would swap the entire series for one Terry Goodkind book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Modern day Tolkienistic style. Jordan delivers fantasy on an unprecedented scale.This book is a beautiful fast paced epic packed with social commentaries of every kind. If you start the series now, prepare to be hooked forever. There are currently 8 1000 page books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jordan taught me how to read","review":"i used to hate books...until i discovered the wheel of time. i never thought a book could surpass a good movie, or any movie at all. it's like watching tv under a magnifying glass. i knew how each character felt, a movie couldn't do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, In depth book","review":"The Eye of the World is a well thought out book, all things considered. Although certain people or places reminded me of Arthurian legends, most of his ideas were pretty original. He thought about each of his characters carefully. Although I didn't like his descriptions of the journey(directions) he described the land fairly well. All in All an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic fantasy with the flair of Dune.","review":"The Eye of the World is a thick book, but a quick read. The characters seem very real, but Jordan builds up a good plot, it fizzles out; then you can't wait to read the next book in the series. Jordan has an eye for detail. If you don't like somewhat slow and detailed books you shouldn't read this. Jordan tends to be long winded on their journeys. And the Aes Sedai remind me to much of the Druids from Terry Brook's Shannara series. Over all The Eye of the World is a good read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning","review":"Robert Jordan has written a sory that comes to life right in front of you. The way you feel that you are write their is breathtaking. You feel every emotion the characters feel. I predict this series will be one you pick up and never put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books I ever read","review":"This serie is the best I ever read about fantasy. All the characters are very realistic and build up with a lot of care in giving details. The aspect were he started with and the evolution through the books are very amazing. Everyone who likes fantasy, must read those books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it from me. I'm no fanboy...","review":"If you like fantasy or epic tales or stories set in detailed worlds--this is the first in a series of novels for you. If you like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars or Star Trek then there is a chance you'll like this book.The author's writting style is good, but not as renown as some of these reviewers would have you think. Sometimes things can seem cliche or trite. The pace of the book is great until the end. The ending is poor. Fortunately it is only a small part of a larget series.I like epic tales, some fantasy novels and stories set in detailed worlds. Hence, 4 stars. I've not quite finished the 2nd in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!!","review":"Eye of The World is an excellent book with many great plot elements that keep you guessing. Robert Jordan creates an epic world with many great flashback scenes that show the old days in the Age of Legends. The characters are so enthralling that I couldn't stop reading. The magic and the battles are so well-written that they paint a perfect picture of the scene in front of you. There are many characters but all are well-defined. The book is a bit on the long side but has great climaxes. The book has very little time where it is boring. Whether it be escaping from Trollocs or killing Fades, this book is full of action!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad","review":"A short summary of the book: An ancient wizard who was defeated many years ago takes an interest in 2 young country bumkin boys. But don't worry--they're being helped by a wizard from a dying order and a ranger who's secretly last in a line of kings.Yes, this book is a sad, pathetic rip off of Lord of the Rings. Really, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself while you can...","review":"The esteemed reviewer that wrote the review titled \\"Danger, Danger, Danger\\" has summed it up very well. The first few books are very good... then not so much. Add to that the fact that there are 11 (yes, 11) of these tomes released to date, and the story line is still in a complex shambles with little sign of ending, and you have a sad continuation of a series that started with excellent potential.And another thing (pet peeve time) what is up with the cover art on these books?!? Could they possibly have picked worse artwork? It's horrible... HORRIBLE...Anyway, I gave this book 2 stars, +4 for the first few books, -2 for the rest. Start this series knowing that the first 4 or so books are very good, then you should move on and read Wiki for the plot summaries on the rest. You'll save yourself weeks of wasted time to read more worthy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Why does everyone seem to think that Robert Jordan is so great? The reason(s) escapes me. While he does indeed have some skill as a wordsmith, I found the book dull. Although I tried on two seperate occasions, I never got more than 100 pages in (and it takes a lot for me not to finish a book once I've started it). If you're looking for the next Tolkien, Jordan's not it--not by a long shot. And they say that the first book is the best of the series... Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ever","review":"This and the other volumes of Wheel of Time through Lord of Chaos, are some of the best books I've ever read. The characters are well developed and interesting, the plot is unique and well told. Unfortunatly it dosen't stay that way though, Crown of Swords on are some of the most boring books I've ever read, with Winter's Heart being somewhat of an exception. Many other reviewers seem to be basing their reviews for this on the horribleness of the last few books but I think this should be called what it is, a great book. If you don't like the last few go review them. If your into fantasy you should get this book, just beware it will go downhill after the 6th book. (Crossroads of Twilight was so boring I couldn't even finish it) Other reviews explain the plot better than I can so I'll just leave that to them and end here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheel of Time Series","review":"I was fortunate enough to have been able to start this series with the prequel and I am continuing through the series. I love all of the books I have read so far.I read other fantasy series and although there are characteristics that are common, much in this series is unique. The unique aspects, good story lines and the strong character development is the reason I am totally hooked. If you don't want to get hooked, don't start this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"Short and simple: This is a good book in a good seriesWhy?Robert Jordan succeeds in establishing an extensive base for all of the characters' personalities. (My personal favorite characters are Perrin Aybara and Nynaeve Al'Meara) With a decent plot behind the story Jordan manages to quirk the reader's attention with new information and other surprising events and characters. True, this is a lllooonnnggg series but it is a good read one time through. The way I see it is, if a book can make me laugh until my sides hurt, want to burn it at that moment, and even want to strangle some of the character's throats at times, then this is a good book and series to read.I would drone on more, but then I might spoil the fun. Enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urgh...","review":"I hate to say it, but I've given up on the sci-fi/fantasy genre. This book is weak at best. I really tried to like this book, but I could never get past the blatant use of other author's work and the shallow storyline and character development. Every incident in the book occurs way too easily. And, the decisions the characters make are all too obvious and often foolish. There is little deep meaning in this story, no matter what people claim.In a nutshell, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating and infuriating","review":"The most frustrating series I have ever had the misfortune to read. Fifteen years and eleven books later, with over a dozen story lines left open, often not returned to for hundreds of pages or even a book or two, Jordan has an 'untimely death'. I firmly believe had the author lived another fifteen years he still would not have finished this series. Not a single story line can I think of does he actually end, just milks this plot forever. The plot itself is intriguing but Jordan goes on and on and on averaging 800 or so pages per book but never takes them anywhere. Now, after his death they've hired another author to complete the work. Get this, ala 'Star Wars' the finale will not be tied up in one book, but in THREE more! Only one of which is published, the second comes out Winter of 2010 and the third sometime thereafter. Lord of the Rings entire storyline, a lengthy and detailed story for sure, was but three books. Now, we need three to finish up after eleven already?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic first novel...but.....","review":"I always thought that Jordan's Wheel of Time series to be the best of modern fantasy...that is, until I read George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. The WOT series is brilliantly paced (at least for the first three-four books) but Jordan eventually becomes his own worst enemy. His style really works for the first three books, but he goes on overkill...and some of his character's quirks that were interesting at first get rather dull as all of his new characters seem to be exactly the same as everyone else. George R.R. Martin has done the best job at writing character development I have ever seen. If you like Jordan's books (and I do!!!!) you will LOVE George R.R. Martin!!! Jordan himself called Martin's books \\"brilliant!\\" You MUST give the Martin books a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"These books are wonderfully written. they flow from series to series, and each and every detail is a factor in the plot.

And you can bet i aint buying the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It\`s pretty good so far","review":"It\`s so far far so good. There are the few occasional boring parts but the book keeps you well wound in. The battle scenes are, in my opinion, better than Tolkien. It\`s not just saying he was slayed like in Tolkien but it\`s more interesting and it draws you in more. I\`ve read all of Tolkien in about 2 months (I\`m usally faster than that)and found there not impossible but I\`m still wondering if the 30 million or so pages of Jordan will be read by me. I checked out the Eye of the World from the library about 2 weeks ago (I\`ve got one more week) and I\`m only on page 243 of about 814. I\`m writing this review on March 21 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eye of the World","review":"I thought this was a very good book. It is full of detail and history, it's not too confusing, it deals with realistic characters...etc., etc. There are some similarities and the Lord of the Rings and some people might say that it is too similar. I disagree. I like the Lord of the Rings better but I am yet to see a writer and can come even close to Tolkein's skill. This is much easier to read than Tolkein-There is enough detail to allow a reader to see, touch, feel, smell, taste etc., etc. but it's not as overwhelming as Tolkein. It has an interesting and intricate plot that will captivate almost any fantasy fan. I highly recommend this book as well as the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME!","review":"When I started reading this book I wasn't sure what it would be like. (I picked out of random in the fantasy section at my local[book store]that's what I normaly do to find good authors.) I had heard about Jordan before but the books just looked so long I figured it would take me months to finish but I finished in four days because I simply couldn't put it down. It's a captivating storyline with well developed characters. I am not going to give away the storyline but I strongly urge anyone who reads fantasy or wants to start reading fantasy to begin with The Eye of the World and The Wheel of Time series. You won't regret your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Epic Series","review":"To get to the point, character development is deep, Jordan's descriptions make you feel as if you are their with the characters seeing what they are seeing. The storyline is intricate which does not allow for you to become bored, nor does it allow you to put the book down. Before you pick up this first book eat well, becuase once you start reading you won't be able to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this series","review":"If you are looking to read a well written fantasy series then stay away from anything with Robert Jordan's name on it. I won't dwell on what everyone else already agrees on. Even most of the loyal Jordan fans have to admit that the last five books of the series were subpar to the earlier volumes. NOTHING HAPPENS. Over half of the books are filled with boring descriptions and stock phrases (not to mention stock characters). RJ doesn't understand that you might not want a highly detailed description of every thread of a woman's dress every single time you encounter her. He doesn't need to constantly remind you that certain characters have mannerisms. There is no point in reading something that starts out good if you know that it ends up crap. RJ is a hack. Don't waste your time with him. Read George RR Martin if you want to see what good fantasy is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed Good Read","review":"Robert Jordan is by far the most spellbinding storyteller I have ever read. His ability to place the reader in the story surpasses every science fiction and fantasy writer I have read (and I have read many). If you enjoy fantasy, this is a must read. I worked as a manager for a bookstore in Florida for six years. I recommended the title to many people and told them if they did not like it, they could bring it back to me and I (not the store) would give them their money back. No one ever returned a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like His Writing","review":"Ok. I just read the Game of Thrones. G RR Martin is a fantastic writer. his realism, storying telling are awesome! Unfortunately, Jordan seems like a 1st grade writer in comparison. His narrative is boring and details are abundant in areas that done matter or create any sense of a rich world. I really don't know much about the character of the protagonists and I am through the 1st novel. Seems so simple in comparison. Also, the overly complex made up names are just plain dumb. Just because it is a fantasy world with magic, etc, doesnt mean that someone can't be named Jack or Tod. How about Tim the Enchanter? .... anyway.I bought this book at the advice of a student who told me that it was \\"GREAT!\\" ... I should have known better for 2 reasons: the student was a doofus and I tried reading this book years ago and threw it away because I couldn't get into it.Save yourself some trouble and read something else.

The ending was great however. So I went out to buy the second book. It was good, if a little confusing, as in charaters the seem to be plotting at the beging then don't turn up for the rest of the book. I even enjoyed the third book mainly because Perin's in it so much and is pretty much left out of the next two books after no.4. After that it was just one huge book after the other with mindless things that I decided to waste my money on something else. If you want to waste time and money on a go nowhere book series go ahead. I'm done until the final book is realease. Don't belive me, old WOT no.6 sit on my shelf unread to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good the first, even better the second","review":"I have been a WoT fan for quite some time now. This book is definitely not the best of Jordan's work, but it is good. To appreciate the book, remember that this is a long term plotline, that has still not concluded after the 10th book. It is a very good starting point though, and shows a glimpse of the world that unfolds throughout the rest of the series. Don't skip this book if you plan on reading the rest of the series, else it is akin to learning History starting after 1800. I certainly do reccommend this book to Fantasy fans. There is a lot of detail to wade through, but heh, that could make the story for you!And don't worry if you're not thrilled with the writing style. Jordan only starts setting a rhythm (sp?) here. His next couple of books sets the mood and tone for his writings, which I find I like even better. Give it a try, I did and didn't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll devour it!","review":"First of all, don't be fooled by the cover. I was! I thought this book would be extremely boring, but I vowed to read it anyway since it was a gift. I was happily surprised! This book is like Lord of the Rings, but even better. It has a slow start and honestly it kind of went on and on in some parts, but it was definitely worth it. I promise you, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but derived","review":"As of writing this I have not read much epic fantasy other than the Lord of the Rings. The EoTW is written well, not the best, but Jordan has a decent command of language skills. The basic plot is very similer to the Lord of the Rings, complete with black riders, orc like creatures, a magician type, a white-towered city far off, Mountains of Mist, a geography calling for lawsuits, etc. The characters and places are weakly named. Imagine a Fellowship of the Ring in which once the characters get to Bree, they then go on to another Bree, and then to another and another. That is what this is, but Jordan adds alot of character into the storyline, which keeps it interesting. Half of me wants to cringe in blasphemy and the other is very pleased with the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"Jordan's language does not evoke the grandeur of Tolkein.

In this book, Rand is the only character we get to know better. Mat, Perrin and others stay distant. Even so, the story is pretty good and intereresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"JORDAN IS THE MASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When i first saw this book i would've never thought i would be sucked into the world that Robert Jordan created. With all the detail he gives i feel like a part of the ongoing adventure myself. I would recommend this book to anyone with imagination!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read War and Peace. It's shorter.","review":"When this book made its debut, and the wheel of time began to turn, the vision looked promising. Now, however, the series can no longer pretend to aspire to the heights of fantasy reached by Tolkien et al. This is not a great story; it is just a long one. The wheel of time continues to turn, with so many readers shackled to it, and it shows no sign of stopping. That additional observation made, I echo the comments made by the reader from Charlottesville, VA, on 2/24/99. Shakespeare, indeed! Lord, what fools these mortals be! Portia and Viola could teach the Aes Sedai a thing or two about womanly wisdom, although I must say Rand usually appears even more indecisive than Hamlet. Adieu, adieu, why cannot this writer say \\"adieu\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"After hearing all those things about Jordan, I finally tried the first book. And I'm disappointed. I can't understand why he should be so good; I thought the book far too long, even boring. There are other authors much better than Jordan, with deeper charakters, more action and better humor. Sorry, but Jordan is by far not as good as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too complex for simple readers(see morons below)","review":"The deepest fantasy book ever written. Foreshadowing and little secrets are thrown in aplenty by Jordan, most to obscure and intricate to be noticed on the first read.

His depcitions are so believable and real. His characters are every day people who would rather be normal and be left alone than be dragged off in to an adventure where the future of the whole world hangs in the balance, thus, making them even more real-seeming. They don't want to be heroes, but they become so in spite of themselves. The magic, myths, monsters and legends are refreshingly creative and new. I am sticking with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked for life!","review":"Oh my God! This book is so immersing.It is the best fantasy I have ever read!The world Jordan creates is more than a reality that exists only when you read the book.His carachetrs stay with you all the time. They become like old friends. And what a plot!It is so envolving!At the begining it moves a little slowly,but by page 68 it is never boring again,not for the whole 7 books. And it is constantly original.Jordan is a true genius!Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!","review":"Great series, once you start you can't stop, but the 12th book isn't here yet!!!!

This book is just, how do I say it so, so, so stupid. Here is why:THE BADFirst off, the women are unrealistically dumb, idiotic, vicious and cliched. All the ones on the good side are slender, beautiful, unintelligent model-types, while the ones on the bad side are ugly, old, and tomboy-ish. Second is this major dump in the plotline: after escaping a roup of disciplined golin/troll things (armed with catchpoles) the escaalade across a river and get lost (LOTR cliche as big as Asia) and promptly spend 300 pages in the dumb forest before suddenly finding each other again, \\"spectacularly\\", and then getting lost again.THE GOODThe first 150 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH HELL YEAH","review":"This book goes down in literary history with the greats.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing novel","review":"Robert Jordan created a masterpeice when he wrote the Eye of the world. I have read the entire series and am beginning it again. What Jordan does is develop a huge plot on many different levels. In the first novel, all the characters converge toward the same finish. But as the series progresses, characters parts in the book become more independent of one another. Therefore, for Jordan to go into the same detail he utilizes in the first novel, many of the later novels slow down. The series on a whole is very good, but he develop's so many individual stories, that the pace of the books slow down. I would not mind this, except it takes three years for him to write a book. However, I am looking forward to the end of the three years."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTE TO TOR: Better spine glue on the paperbacks!","review":"The first book of a truly innovative mythopoeic fantasy.

Mark Rolston was GREAT in Aliens (the second one) but he wasn't really made for doing readings. Aside from that, listening to the abridged version of this story leaves so much detail out that Robert Jordan is known for. So, what I say is already listed in the title of this review... grab yourself a copy of the unabridged version. And if you're a true fan, you'll find it on CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, Lousy Abridgment","review":"I have a long commute and have listened to many audio books. All told, these are the worst abridgments I've ever heard. It's really a shame as this book series is quite enjoyable. I somehow doubt Robert Jordon had a chance to review this abridgment before it was released. Listening to this is like reading the book and skipping every other 25 pages regardless of the story line and transitions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel Of Time","review":"Jordan had the start of what could have been an amazing series... unfortunately, he refuses to end it, and is really just milking the cash cow now, on his 9th book. Ironically, the Wheel Of Time Series is much like the Wheel Of Time In The Book, repetitive and never-ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy but familiar read","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I look forward to reading the next installment of the series. The interaction between men and women can be annoying at times, and there are stiking similarities to Tolkien and I would imagine other fantasy epics. The thing is that I love Tolkien and the entire fantasy prototype, so a new face on an old idea works for me. Though while the skeleton is the same, do not fear, the comparisons are not so much as to take away from the book.Also similar to other fantasy series, with so much introduction, the book does not tend to grip you (or I should say me) until you are well into it. I read the first half casually and the second half relentlessly.I highly recomend this book, even if I am told that the series drags in the later books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Tolkien's Estate sued this guy yet?","review":"There was not an original character in this book.

A group of people go to a town, fight with evil people, flee to the next town, fight with more evil people, ad nauseam. My fiance' made me read this book, promising that \\"it gets better from here.\\" He's right--you have to read _Eye_ in order to get to book 2, _The Great Hunt_, which is where the series starts getting good. Trouble is, it gets bad again after about book 5, _The Fires of Heaven_--the last truly good installment of the series--so I don't know whether to recommend this book or not.Here goes: I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a boring prelude to a series that is really good for a while but peters out into insipitude. Expect frustration..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book get so many good reviews???","review":"I've read a lot of fantasy novels in my 36 years on Earth and maybe the reason I could not \\"appreciate\\" this novel is because the standard fantasy formula has become so repetative and sleep inducing. This book is too long winded (like so many other bloated examples of this genre) and, as a result, BORING!!. I had the same problem with Tad Williams's \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\". YAWN!! I stopped three quarters of the way through EOTW and started reading \\"The Anvil of Ice\\" by Michael Scott Rohan, a much better fantasy (get it thru amazon.co.uk).In closing, life's too short...read books that are intelligently written.

This is just....boring.Probably it's just Jordan's writing: it sometimes too plain, and the tempo and sequences are not inviting.The imaginations are good, the concepts are mindtickling, but the executions are sometimes lacking, the characterizations are sometimes plain, and could be downright annoying (the wisdom, for example).This is the first book that is promoted as great work of fantasy but bores me tremendously.I probably have read too many modern, more bombastic (but nicely written) books than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what people make it out to be.","review":"I don't think this book is very good. I think Robert Jordan draws things out way too long, and his character development is weak. I read the first 600 pages of this book waiting for it to become original and exciting and it never happened. There is not much to distinguish Robert Jordan's series from typical fantasy works. These are not works of genius (meriting 4-5 stars). They are simply entertainment. What pains me the most is that Robert Jordan can be eloquent at times... why can't he escape the \\"pure entertainment\\" bug? Also, half of the book, even down to the names, is plagiarized.Don't waste your time. I'm on a quest to get rid of mindless entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a story that sucks you in and will never end.","review":"While this book was good, the series that it become draws out to a never-ending teeth gnashing bore.

I picked this book up, having resisted the series for years...... and I wasn't enchanted. The characters in this v-e-r-y long, endless, weighty, unbending doorstop of a book are very hard to like. The boys are nitwits and I resent being stuck in the heads of rather thick people who do very stupid things over-and-over. The female characters come off somewhat better--Jordan goes out of his way to show them as strong and smart, but I think he overdoes it. It would be far better to see equally interesting and \\"strong\\" (strong doesn't have to mean \\"perfect\\", you know) characters. Instead... ::sigh::I was pining for Earthsea, or Zelazny's Amber series, or, for heaven's sake, a couple of Moorcock's Elric books long before I turned the last pages of this monster. The other reviews here do not inspire confidence that this series is worth it. Go read something else (IMHO)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The new gold standard in epic fantasy","review":"Robert Jordan paints a vivid portrait of a world with a deep sense of history, with its own traditions and cultures, where the reader is swept up into the current of the great events that will decide the fate of the world. His heroes and heroines are men and women whose ordinary lives are not so very unlike our own, and we learn to care passionately about them as we see them grow into the great men and women who carry such terrible burdens and endure so much to preserve family, friends and countrymen alive in the face of such overwhelming evil. If you love Tolkien, you'll be blown away by the Wheel of Time series. Robert Jordan really makes his characters come alive, and the plot lines are interleaved in a complex and interesting way that leaves you on the edge of your seat in suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK SOME PROBLEMS","review":"This is an excellent book and the ones following aren't bad. But Jordan takes a long time between books and most fans start to lose interest. Wait till the series is done then by the whole thing and read it. Some of the books do fall short and seem to just be part of the journey almost as if he wasn't sure where he was going. Some of the main characters are barely mentioned in some books and are the sole focus in others. Plus there are a lot of characters to keep track of many don't really participate but as long as you don't try to remember every innkeeper barmaid and minor villain you should not have much trouble.

Jordan's writing, though flawed, had a pleasant flow to it despite a bit of redundancy and the like. But when it comes to his subject....I about hurled.Let me explain, first of all, that I rarely dislike books. When I do, the reason is most always the same: because I don't like the characters. Barely half-way into the prolouge, I was disgusted with the people that made up Jordan's world. How could they be so horribly afraid of the man that would save their world from complete and utter destruction?! It made no sense.I went on to finish the book and remained unsatisfied. I deeply disliked the main character, and that usually means that I won't be continueing the series.

I don't know what it is about Jordan's books, but i really enjoy the characters and their development. It really is like a soap opera, but what the hell!

I am not a Fantasy fan, though I did read the entire Tolkien trilogy and got involved enough to learn how to write Quenyan in college. Comparatively, Eye of the World is thin, it just looks thick. There is no actual development in plot or characters, just a very long chase scene over many, many chapters. It would be more aptly titled \\"How to Take a Simple Plot Idea and Make it Last for 500 Pages\\". Though, to be fair, if one is young in the world, it probably would be an entertaining read.

As such, I didn't read another volume until 2005, only because I had just moved and didn't have anything else to read until my stuff arrived from Maryland. So, I read the second book, which wasn't bad, followed by the 3rd book, which was too soon. All of the characters idiosyncracies were getting annoying, the new bad guys didn't seem nearly as dangerous as the old ones, and the Dark One was again (temporarily) defeated at the end. If RJ can't resolve a story in the same number of books it took Tolkien, then I care not to continue, especially as the plot seems to be waning already in book 3. Subsequent books, I imagine must be mind-numbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly over rated","review":"This book (along with the next 2 in the series) is a readable book. My problem with it is that the characters for the most part are completely unlikable and come across as very annoying. Nynave tops the list. She spends the entire book (and the following 2) blaming all of the worlds problems on Moraine and plotting a way to get revenge even through Moraine has only helped her. Then there is Matt who cries the whole time and cant seem to take and order from anyone. Perrin who manages to gain a cool power, pisses and moans that he is a freak because of his power instead of using it to help out. The other problem I have with the series is that all of the power (political, Magic) is held by the women of the story. This may sound sexist but I just can't picture being scared of \\"the women's circle\\" or being bossed around by a 20ish wisdom (Nynave).

I didn't even finish CoT because it was so boring. Alot of people say that Jordan makes super descriptions. He does, but CoT is basically just a waste of paper full of useless and aggravating dialogue. It is just about a gaggle of witless girls blushing and talking about pregnancy. I was very disappointed with this series. It is like a drug that feels good at first, but eventually leaves one feeling deprived. If you are looking for good fantasy try authors like:George R.R.

Then it starts rolling downhill like a snowball from Mount Everest.By the 4th book, the author is mostly focusing on useless characters that add nothing to the plot and just take up page space.Rand, the main character essentially paints the author into a corner by being too powerful (the whole series could have ended if he just held 2 items at the same time)Every single female character fuses and melts into 1 uber shrew, that competes for the title of world's biggest stereotype. I honestly ended up skipping chapters when I saw they were about Nynaeve. Not sure what this reveals about the author.The quality of the writing goes down. Entire sentences are repeated. Pages are devoted to crossing a street.TLDR: Read the first book and stop, or skip the series if you can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pages for not enough story","review":"The longer the book, the greater the obligation to make every page count. This book does not live up to that obligation. It gets stuck in a rut less than half way through, uses filler as a failed attempt to make up for the monotony, then finally manages to dig itself out just before the very end. Do yourself a favor and pick something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMPTY CALORIES! Read Tolkien, he says more with less.","review":"This had a simple magic to it which I really appreciated. Yet the series is over 7,000 pages long. That is hundreds of thousands of words. Read The Lord of the Rings (LOR) instead. Its not even 2000 pages, a remarkable story, and best of all, you'll remember the beginning, end and everything between. It is a memorable work and you'll appreciate the long history developed in LOR. Should you want to read more, The Simillarion tells the early times of LOR's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever","review":"This is one of the best books ever.

Robert Jordan weaves so many seemingly meaninglessstrands of plot into one magnificent web that it leaves youthirsting for not only the conclusion but for each and everyword leading up to it. I lost many hours of sleep deeplyinvolved in helping along Rand, Perrin, and Mat as theybecame intertwined with every aspect of Jordan's aweinspiring creation... :-) if you can't tell i liked theseries a lot and can truthfully say I have never read itsequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"It drew me in quick!","review":"The ability to draw you in quickly most books don't have...

I strongly recommend this cheap 750 page piece of art !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I'm new to fantasy. I have to say, this is great! As much adventure as any adventure series, and more thrill than any thriller. As a reader of psychological thrillers, I was afraid fantasy just wouldn't give me the rush I'm looking for in a story. Was I wrong! Robert Jordan really tells a wonderful story with strong characters. I can't wait to see what kind of mischief follows Rand from book to book. You can bet the rest of this series is on my wish list."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"I was forced into reading it. HORRIBLE.

It NEVER ends!The author continues to spew worthless crap at you after 10 books with still more to come! I have to admit that the first half of the books in the series are excellent (hence the 2 stars), but after that it all goes down the tube. Why start a series that will just dissapoint you? It is better for you to never know of Rand's world and his adventures then to have to suffer through the worthless pages of nothing that the author throws at you later.Save yourself the heartache and dissapointment. Instead try out something worth your time like George R.R.

Don't read this book until Jordan is done writing","review":"If you start reading this book now, YOU WILL BECOME OBSESSED! This book is the first in a long, great series. If you start reading The Wheel of Time series now, before Jordan is finished, you'll eventually catch up to him. This is the point at which the insanity begins. Waiting a year and a half for the next book to be published will drive you mad. These books are worse than heroin. So in summmary: Greatest Fantasy Epic ever written! Don't start reading them!

As I read the bad reviews of this book and series, I have two feelings toward these reviewers. One is curiousity, about why and how someone could live without loving WOT. The other is pity, that tey can't understand something like it. People complain that he uses too much description. I love it. I gobble up every description, as i brings me closer to this world that I seem to live in more often than here. As for complaining about the length, that is pathetic. If you can't read a book this long, than you don't deserve to. And the wait. Come on, you guys! I'd like to see any one of you write a thousand page book in a year that comes remotely close to a WoT book. I would just like to ssay that i think that this is the best seven books that exist(and I have read a lot, _incuding_ Tolkein). I can't wait fr TPoD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book, a very good series for fantacy lovers.","review":"Once I started reading this book I didn't want to put it down. Robert Jordan transports you to a place of Heros, demons, and magic. Jordan has an excellent sense of detail. I can't wait to read book eight of this already large and adventurus story. I encourage any reader who wants a nonstop action story to read this book. You'll find hours of enjoyment from these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fantasy Series Ever","review":"I read Eye of the World, and was absolutely stunned. I couldn't put the book down until I was done, and then I picked up The Great Hunt and kept on going. This is, by far, the best fantasy series I've ever read. I like the way Jordan describes everything you need to put yourself inside the book. When I read Eye of the World, I cared about what happend to Rand, Mat, and Perrin. I wish I could say the same of every book I read, but the Wheel of Time series tells the story of good vs. evil in a new way. The book takes place in it's own fantasy realm, with Aes Sedai, Trollocs, Gleemen, and a unique history that is interesting by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely spellbinding!","review":"This book will capture you like a hungry shark. Jordandisplays a world that is so real, so three-dimensional, youfeel that you are able to reach out and touch the characters.Lavishly described settings provided an immensly richbackground in which these characters were placed, givingeven more of an edge to this captivating book. Page afterpage, you will want to know more about this adventure storythat completely alters the previous bounderies of thefantasy genre. This book is destined to become a classic, soset a place between Tolkien and Asimov. Hey, the Wheelweaves and the Wheel wills, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"This book doesn't compare to George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. While Jordan endlessly discusses dozens of topics that have nothing to do with moving his storyline along, you, the reader are stuck hopelessly waiting for something interesting to happen. To think that there are a dozen or so more books in the series makes me cringe. Pick up a copy of Martin's series, and you will one day thank me for it. Martin's focus on character development and story puts The Wheel of Time to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye of the World","review":"I thought this was a complete rip off of Tolkein but not as well written. It took too long to pull the reader in and the build up in action was way too slow. It was way too wordy, and I'm used to reading Homer and Lovecraft, some of the \\"wordiest\\" guys around.I don't know how many pages the first book is, but I stopped about halfway through and went to get my copy of the Lord of the Rings.Don't waste your time reading this, go right to the source and read Tolkein instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bland bland bland","review":"Must have been asleep the last few years or else subconsiously ignoring this series as I've only just read this, the first one. Thought it was one of those 1970 fantasies; the 1st generation of post LOTR books and as such could forgive its obvious ripoffs and dull dull characters and chaste dialogue. But......then I realised it was written in 1990. Come on, this is criminal, it is so lacking in originality its like a joke. Who the hell agreed to publish this and dear god how can anyone find it engaging. There is so much more interesting fantasy out there; beautiful; funny; shocking; and imaginative. The Eye Of The World is none of these. You should be deeply ashamed Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolkein Rip!!","review":"Just a rip of Tolkein's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (a classic novel.)

Every time one of the village boys encountered a serving-maid, I'd say along with them, \\"Wish ____ was here, he knew how to talk to girls!\\"I'll bet the book could have been shorter without all the deja vu events, not to mention the neverending journey to Tar Valon, or wherever they were going. Jordan has good ideas, but that's some massive overwriting. And there was nothing original about the characters. Lan's the usual strong-silent type who falls in love with a woman he can't have. Rand et al are the innocents loose in the big dangerous world, discovering their talents. The villain (or villains) is never developed either.What settled it for me was the glossary, where the main clans of the Trollocs were named. The names are fancy misspellings of Devil (Dha'vol), Goblin (Ghob'blun), Golem, Demon, Banshee and other fantastic creatures. Great puns. Ha ha. Terry Pratchett did it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gateway into a wonderful series","review":"At risk of repeating the 20-odd reviews above this one, I can honestly say that Eye of the World is quite possibly one of the best books I've read.

He makes Jack sound like a pompous jerk and Steven like some kind of effeminate twit.Patrick Tull was the master in this category. With his readings, you don't really need any \\"he saids\\" because you can always tell from the voice which character is speaking. The regional British accents, the accents of foreigners speaking English - they are all spot-on. With Tull, you soon forget that you're being read to, so involved do you become in the story. With Cyrus Vance, you're always aware that someone is reading to you, and not very well. So, be advised: be careful which reading you are purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"The Complete Aubrey/Maturin NovelsI have read the entire Aubrey-Maturin Series from the 1st (Master and Commander) through the 21st (The Unfinished Voyage) three times and I have the entire series in my library.

Why do I tell you that? I was over halfway done with the book and just had to give up. Nothing was happening. Nothing. The only thing this book had going was that a woman was on the ship, Aubrey is clueless and ornery, and that they were all headed to Oahu. That's it. Pretty thin for any novel at the halfway point.This book was a solid letdown and had zero action in it well over halfway through the story. The only appeal I can see for this book is for readers who are devotees to the series, and who don't mind a bunch of filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and weighed down by jargon","review":"In high school, I was assigned to read this book and do a paper on it. It's one of the dullest books I've ever read, because there is so much unfamiliar sea-jargon that I was unable to visualize the main characters' surroundings. The plot was dull, I could care less about the characters, and after reading it, I could not describe what had happened plotwise. I think this book is appropriate for sea-lovers, because they would find the sea terminology interesting, but for the lay reader, it's like being thrown overboard without knowing how to swim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book","review":"I agree 100% with Annie Murphy's review. This is not a book that's really going to help a new dad and it's intended message is mostly wasted because those who actually need it would never read it. Also, it seems very repetitive.

Those same men actually are probably already prepared with the right attitude and behaviors that ironically this book does NOT speak to. This book is meant for those types of dads that don't know where to start (psychologically) with the prospect of daddyhood, and well - unfortunately, those are the same men who wouldn't pick up a dense text like this. But being a new mom, as well as a daughter who was mostly estranged by her mostly inadequate dad - I was curious to read it anyway. The book does not read in an engaging way to captivate a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Fantastic! A rare gem.","review":"This is pure comedy gold, really, really funny!It's short, only 8 minutes but if you like shows like 'the office' and 'peep show', you're going to love this.The film follows Simon and Susan, having decided to give up their 9-5 jobs, they attempt to make a new life in the woods(in a tent!)... really, you have to watch this guy, he's crazy, absolutely hilarious, the things he says and does! I nearly wet myself watching the spear fishing scene, you'll know what I mean when you see it...The script is superb and not only is there some astoundingly well crafted dialogue, but the performances and direction are also great..

But...hindsight, right? This is a MUST read for James Dean fans but more than that it's a beautifully written love story, and a paen to NYC in the 1950's. A time and place for all things exciting and a great time for the young to be young. And Jimmy, oh...Jimmy...how lovely it seemed you were even though definitely not perfect. And I loved both of them (although there was some very \\"personal\\" info I almost blushing during reading; didn't find it necessary to include.) If this were a work of fiction it would make a beautiful novel, too. Liz Sheridan, whether you know it or not, YOU'RE A WRITER!!!

How is it that there are pictures of Jimmy with a lot of his closest pals and girlfriends but Liz S. had no photos of her and Jimmy? I don't put much credibility in her claims or Bill Bast (who's biggest claim to fame was a friendhip with James Dean). I think she was one of his friends/gal pals (friends with benefits as well Bast could have been) but I think the relationships they write about are more fiction & embellishments than truth. Jimmy's dream girl was Pier Angeli and as hard as it seems to be for both Ms. Sheridan & Mr. Blast, neither of them was the love of his life-just pals in passing."},{"rating":"2","title":"He admired bullfighting,photography,& learned..from..an egg.","review":"A nostalgic, quick read..much dialogue.

Dizzy is mentioned in other James Dean biographies but their relationship was more on a platonic level, as his was with Eartha Kitt. Jimmy liked dancers and respected those with a love for the arts but his real love was Pier Angeli. I have a hard time giving all of Elizabeth's quotations credibility since there is no way anyone would choose this style of swriting without telling a fictional story. This book just didn't work for me and became hard to finish since I just can't help but think it's bogus. Do the research on JD, read \\"Rebel\\" and other books on JD and you'll see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liz is hoping for a movie deal","review":"Liz's style hints at hopes for a movie deal. The book reads like the screenplay of a made for TV movie. I must confess that this annoyed me. She tells her story in dialog and descriptions that could double as scene notes. Who can remember their past to the point of everything being in quotations? especially conversations from at least a half century ago! She denys wanting to be one of those profiting from a relationship with James Dean, yet I can see not other reason for her writing this book. Money must have gotten tight after Sienfeld. If she really wanted people to know the \\"Jimmy\\" she knew, better to have kept his letters. She says she burned them after he died.The women I know only burn letters from lovers when they get dumped. No Offense Liz, but I was not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE book for James Dean Fans","review":"I received this book for Christmas and I absolutely love it. I've already read it twice since Christmas.This is the book for all the James Dean fans out there--young and old. Liz Sheridan writes about the James Dean that no one knew about except Sheridan and Dean. I must say that Sheridan does write about the TRUE James Dean without the limelight that is mentioned in the other books. Sheridan knew Dean for who he was on the inside, not because of his short career.This story goes by really fast for a love story; I couldn't even put it down!

Bad start to what turned out to be a bad series.Note: I've read this entire series up toThe Body in the Attic: A Faith Fairchild Mystery (Faith Fairchild Mysteries), and the best rating I've given any of them is 2 stars, which is sad and says a lot about the series. I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series.

Assorted characters, all tied together very loosely . . . results in no one person to care about.The key to the plot is Kate's revenge. She is rich, apparently smart, and has people fawning all over her. Then why does it turn into a shoot-out at the end of the book, with Kate doing much of the shooting.

To the editors: Did anybody read this before publication?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads more like a screenplay than a novel","review":"Being a stranger to Jack Higgins, but being aware of his reputation, I was really looking forward to this book, but I was very disappointed indeed. Admittedly, I was not aware of the characters from the previous novels, but the characterisations were laughable and the action read more like a screenplay than a novel. The plot flowed swiftly, but not in a stylish way, more in a \\"Sean did this, Kate did that, so Sean did something else\\". It was more reminiscent of a high-school story than anything.If you want to read a good novel, with real suspense, that requires some emotional engagement, try some Ian McEwan."},{"rating":"1","title":"a thriller? not even close","review":"Maybe I'm missing something...I've read and loved tons of \\"thrillers\\" but Midnight Runner just didn't keep my attention.

Lots of excitement in this one and a favorite character almost gets killed. (would hate to see that). But Dillon is ever watchful and this makes a good afternoon read.

The long and the short of it is it's a decent book. I rated it 4 stars only because there's not 3.5 stars. It's a decent book for the most part. Higgins really should have added another 100 pages or so, IMO, to this book. He builds it really well, and the closer is just too quick compared to how long the build up was. It's a fairly easy read, and goes by quick. Higgins will keep you wanting to come back for more, but the closing is just to quick compared to how long he takes to build it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story spoiled by reader","review":"There is a difference between reading a novel and acting in a play--a distinction that escapes Patrick Macnee as he narrates this book.

The reading was so bad that I'm reluctant to comment on the novel as I was too distracted and annoyed by Macnee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Excuse for an Audio Book!!!","review":"This is without a doubt the WORST and most UNPROFESSIONAL production of an audio book I have ever made an attempt to listen to. Patrick Macnee does a horrible job of reading this novel. His voice inflection and attempts to convey the context of the novel are amateurish at best.It is my practice to purchase books on tape for long business road trips. I picked this one up at a local Boarder's book store ($29.95) and settled in to listen to it this past weekend on a trip from Fort Worth to Kansas City, MO. I was sorely disappointed! Macnee is extremely difficult to listen to. His attempt to take on the various characters in \\"Midnight Runner\\" is like listening to fingernails on a blackboard! I could not listen to his rendition past CD number 2 and thus have wasted the money spent on this worthless piece of work.I have learned my lesson!

Needless to say, she has no idea what she's soon to come up against: Sean Dillon, Blake Johnson, Harry and Billy Salter, Roper, Daniel Quinn and others.A fast-paced thriller. The character of Sean Dillon is reminding me more and more of a character by the name of Dirk Pitt. You thriller readers know whom I'm talking about. Somehow you just know that no task is impossible.

She's more like a stereotype of a high school English teacher. Ironically, the Kindle edition is chock full of spelling, spacing, and punctuation errors, as bad as the typical community college English papers the character says she hates. The central character is supposed to be a diver, but she keeps calling fins, \\"flippers!\\" She's very inconsistent, sometimes diving without proper safety equipment and standard precautions, sometimes getting angry with others for failing to follow safety protocols. The dialogue is awkward, and often really illogical. For example, she spots a cigarette smoker on land as a \\"swimmer because of the way he moves.\\" Former competitive swimmers can spot each other y the way they swim, maybe, and by the way they don't smoke. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold Your Breath","review":"Luanne Fogarty is enjoying her time off from teaching by rebuilding her family home deep in the swamps of Florida when her occasional job diving for the police gets her involved in a mystery.

And who is the unidentified first woman and where is her body?This is a wonderful debut book. The plot develops nicely, and the characters are interesting as well. The real star here is the setting. Ms. Alam is able to bring the swamp to life using all five senses in a way that places you right there without overshadowing the characters or story.

I plodded through the story but from the very beginning it was apparent that Ms. Alam is not a diver and apparently thought only people who know nothing about scuba diving or cave diving would read her book. This diver won't waste his money on any more as her lack of knowledge of even fundamental equipment and terminology is a turnoff to me. Don't waste your time if you want a story that is scuba oriented.

The heroine, rather than being a well-endowed bimbo, is well-endowed and smart, and figures out very quickly there is more to their situation than just Stevie's deciding to produced his own television show to find himself a wife.

Much of it reads likle an overdone book report from someone who did not enjoy their topic. While there are many interesting tidbits here and there, few of them are developed in a way to make them interesting, and may be missed completely if the reader is not careful.

Do we understand Garp any more than we did when we first met him, back on page 10?Then, I say, this book is like a Mercedes without gas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story; dire writing","review":"A great story made painful to read by shoddy writing. I am no author but I found Irving's repeated use \\"of course\\" when telling his story distracting - three times in a half page. Shame, I loved the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Books....So Little Time....","review":"I had heard so much positive about this book...that it was on my 'Books to Read Before I Die'...list.Well, I will die with having read 1/2 of it. I kept reading, I guess...because of how great it was supposed to be. I mean...John Irving! I got to the half way point and thought...\\"Where is this going?!\\" I then realized I really didn't care. And put it down. Page after page, I finally came to the realization there wasn't enough of a story/plot to get me to turn another page."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Acording to Garp' fails to please","review":"When I first opened this book, I expected to find a rich novel full of lessons and all that trash. But, by page 100, I found myself reading anecdotes of perverseness, like in other Irving works such as 'A Widow for One Year'. I think that it is under-estimated and very wrong. It has no good things to get from it. It is only there, for people to read and react. Action. Reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"More subplots, deus ex machina, and characters whose actions and thoughts defy reason, per-page, than a Tom Robbins novel. Getting the rug pulled out from under you this often is only fun if you're wearing a helmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Competant","review":"I have read lots of Irving's books and this is not one of his best I am sorry to say. I liked it; it made me laugh a lot and want to keep reading, but reading other peoples' reviews I agree there seems to be too much sex-related material. Enough is enough Mr Irving! I especially found the chapter about Garp, Helen, Harrison and Alice's little \\"crisis\\" to be a little appalling. Also, it's hard to sympathize with Garp when he's such a pathetic character. I lost track of how many times he cheats on his wife. Liked \\"Prayer for Owen Meany\\" and \\"Cider House Rules\\" much much better but this is still worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I read this book along with A Prayer For Owen Meany and both books are excellent studies in tragic characters. Garp, a school teacher seems to finally get his life together only to be undone by an obsessed woman (she reminded me of the character in Fatal Attraction).The book never gets boring and is difficult to put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect!... For Inducing Sleep...","review":"I've never had such a rough time reading anything the way that I had a rough time reading \\"The World According to Garp.\\" It is hundreds of pages of pointless rambling. Irving describes the hell out of EVERYTHING and just goes into way too much detail. And not only that, but its details that are completely unimportant. Reading this book was a pure, brutal struggle and in the end, I realized that there was absolutely no point to it. In the beginning, I thought it had potential, but little did I know that I was beginning one of the most bland books I've ever read. Don't even bother, unless you're an insomniac seeking a good, deep snooze."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Irving Classic","review":"This book (like all of Irving's, possibly with the exception of The Fourth Hand), is phenomenal. Not only was this book captivating, but it also had me laughing out loud. This was the first Irving book I read, and I liked it so much that I've read 4 or 5 others. My other recommendations would be A Prayer for Owen Meany and A Widow for One Year. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Audiobook Version","review":"I was a \\"Garp\\" fan from the day the book first appeared, and have personally owned and given away close to 50 copies in the past 20+ years. I also re-read the novel at least once every two years. Because of this, I was looking forward to owning the audio version with great anticipation, for it would have allowed me to experience the joy of Irving's masterpiece during my daily commute.No matter how compelling the material, audiobooks stand or fall on the performance of the reader, and in this case, Michael Prichard was a poor choice. Not only did he seem emotionally unconnected to the story, I almost got the feeling he was reading it for the first time. Every sentence carries an unspoken question mark, as if he's asking the listener what the hell he's talking about. Monotonous, droning, and utterly clueless for 20 straight hours. Shame. Where is John Lithgow when you need him?Stick to the novel, or read it aloud into a tape recorder yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare literary event in my reading life","review":"I have read hundreds of classics and many contemporary writers, and I consider that I have \\"literary\\" tastes, although I enjoy a good Stephen King novel or even trashy thrillers. And authors that fall between, such as John Updike and Joyce Carol Oates. But, I don't get John Irving. TWATG was the only book I have ever read that I didn't finish after having completed virtually all of it. I literally had only a few pages to go, but I was beyond caring. I've really tried to find something to like about this author--but Irving's style (if you could call it that), his attention to odd, irrelevant detail, and his mannikin-like characters leave me cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent story with a wild and varied array of characters. The story is unique and very rewarding.The only reason I dropped a star was because I felt at times he went into too much detail and ended up making the book slightly too long.This was my first John Irving book but will not be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC TO SURPASS ALL CLASSICS","review":"Garp is, beyond all doubt, the best book I have ever read (and will ever re-read, and re-read, and re-read again).This novel is hilarious, but does not come up short on trajedy either. I laughed, I cried, and I laughed and cried at the same time. The characters are very obscure--making me wonder what disfunctional people surround the author--and this only makes them more loveable and funny. As the end of the book approached I was caught up in not wanting it to end, and wanting to see how it ends.\\"In the world according to Garp, we're all terminal cases.\\"WARNING: I noticed while reading other customer reviews, that this book was poorly reviewed by a select few people.

This was 1983, long after the hype and a year or so after the movie. I was so moved by the characters, the scenarios, the undercurrent of young lust that undercut many of Garp's best intentions, and particularly by the fierce, bearish devotion he had for his loved ones. Fourteen years of marriage left, I still doggedly avoid the undertoad, knowing all too well that we're all terminal cases..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know Garp","review":"Although I agree that PARTS of this book were depressing, it also had its light moments and its humorous moments.

I think most people would want to know a character like Garp."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a loving book","review":"John Irving's Garp surrounds himself with characters who fill us with wonder and amazement.

Through it all he maintains a zest for life and embraces it wholeheartedly, along with a strong love for his family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I read it when it was new. It's been, uh, nearly 30 years, and I still remember it. As a total, TOTAL waste of time. Never saw the point, of any of it. Boring plot, uninteresting characters. Unengaging. You know those songs you hear on the radio sometimes? Trying to be wise? That sound like someone sat down and said, I'm gonna write a song! And they wrote a song, just to have written a song? That's this book. He wrote it because he's a writer.I am sensitive to style. So when I read people who say that the prose is so wunnerful, it is incomprehensible to me. Maybe Garp had a theme. Maybe it had a plot. It remains incomprehensible to me.J"},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see is not what you get","review":"I ordered the book pictured here and supplied the ISBN so that I would be sure of getting the correct edition required by my graduate professor.

I was 2/3 of the way through when I realized I was doing everything in my power to avoid continuing it, and quit reading it at that time. The first chapter promised a Catch-22-like festival of insanity, but after that the story sunk into a mind-numbing pathos devoid of all hope and amusing to only the most avid sado-masochists. Stay away froim this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The World According to Garp\\".Some of the parts were a bit drawn out, like for example, the ending.

Garp can fool around with college-age babysitters and Alice, but when Helen has an affair, she looses Walt and Duncan looses his eye.That was almost enough to make me burn this book.I have to admit I'm getting quite tired (after four Irving books) of the repeated themes...male obsession with sex, private boys schools, Viennese prostitutes, and flat female characters. For someone who's so popular, you'd think he could tell an original story once in a while.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretentious or Comic?","review":"I saw that another reviewer said that Irving's work was overly pretentious, which, in a way, I agree with. I just though I ought to mention that one of the things that makes this book very good is that the writing is so pretentious and utterly cliche of a stuck up historian/biographer, to the point were it is cynical and comical. When I first started reading this book, Irving seemed so full of himself that it showed in his writing, but after awhile I could understand that this was just another tool that added to the sarcastic melodrama of the life of Garp. Once you get into the style, it is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels ever written.","review":"Of all of Irving's works, \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" and \\"The World According to Garp\\" remain my favorites. Besides being funny (I nearly choked on a Big Mac while reading it for the first time in a McDonald's), Garp is beautifully written. Irving 's ability to make the ridiculous seem possible makes this novel a great read whether you're picking up for the first or hundredth time. My advice: buy the Modern Library hardcover edition because you'll wear out the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words Can't explain this book","review":"It was absolutly magnificent! It's about a father's fears of the world. And it didn't portray any of the characters as being good or bad the were all just unique. I was left with my mouth gaping through out the whole book. You need patience to read this book however. I'm not saying it's not a page turner bc it defintly is. But it's a novel inside a novel. I found it to be very enjoyable and was written with a very good pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal end Extraordinary","review":"A warning to readers of \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\": Throw out your expectations of John Irving. APFOW was a spectacular book, but very different from this one.A warning to more sensitive readers: Just because an author depicts disgusting or un-Christian behavior does not make him an advocate of it. Authors are both observers and commentators. Read the commentary as much as the events.That said, I have to comment myself that this is one of the finest books I have ever read. I believe that John Irving is one of the writers of the twentieth century who will be remembered long into the next one. His characters are bizzare to say the least, but he makes them real to us and never trivializes any of them. Irving has a wonderful sense of the comically tragic, as well as a unique perception of human fallibility. In the novel according to Irving, we are all terminal cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read.","review":"This was such a great book, i couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting. There were countless times that I laughed right out loud. - FJM from Boston"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth moving","review":"I read this novel in 80's .

And the director who has followed the story and not made big artistic compromises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and contradictory","review":"It is a very sad and contradictory book, for example Garp doesn't let the drivers go fast in his living address for the safety of his kids, but when he is coming home, before he arrives turns off the car lights and keeps driving killing one of his children, this is safe? let's ask to his son.The writer writes and writes until everybody is dead some by the age and some by an accident."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book!","review":"The only time I ever skipped school was when I was in the 8th grade. I had borrowed a copy of The World According to Garp from the library (mainly because the movie was out and was rated R so I wasn't able to see it!). I began reading it in the cafeteria, waiting for my first class, and became so engrossed I knew I could not put the book down until I was finished. Irving weaves a rich tapestry - his characters are so vital it's hard to believe they are not real people. I highly recommend this book to any and everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully eccentric!!","review":"i may not be a writer, or a student of literature, or anything else related to all these other \\"reviewers\\", but i am an avid reader. John Irving has had me spellbound since i picked up A Prayer For Owen Meany years ago, for a project in high school. i've gobbled up everything else he's written....only to find myself wishing that he'd publish something else soon!! The World According to Garp was such fun to read, although i won't hesitate to say a little shocking, at times...i lost and regained my respect (and hope) for Garp several times throughout the novel, but i was absolutely thrilled with the ending...this book was excellent, just one step behind A Prayer For Owen Meany..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever read!","review":"This was by far and without a doubt the WORST book I ever read. It was so horrible that I refused to finish it. The title character is badly written, unfunny, and unsympatheic in every way. The book deals with such subject matters as death, love, infidelity, and then some more infidelity with such indifference that it is painful. If anything thhe book seems to make fun of people's pain, suffering, and humiliation. I hated this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"This book was entirely divorced from anything I could relate to. It just seemed not surreal enough to be \\"trippy\\" and too unreal for me to get involved in the story.Was the self-mutuilation of the Ellen Jamesians symbolic? What was that supposed to be I had no idea. All of the relations described in the book seemed contrived and just plain weird.Only for very few of the characters did I even feel a slight interest in, but they tended only to be tangential to the story.All in all this book is an absurdist account of the gender wars. It is not so absurd to be entertaining, but too absurd to be involving.My motivation for purchasing this book was because so many reviewers thought that this book was hillarious. Well, if this was hillarious, how would you describe Douglas Adams? This book was about as funny as gangrene."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this book...and I never hate books.","review":"I HATED this book. I wanted to scrub my mind after reading it. This wasn't a narrative...the only conflict to be faced by the main character (i.e. plot) was life itself. Irving was not satisfied with following around the title character for his entire life from birth to death; he also stalked the character's children and reported on their odd and early demise to make sure that every person in the story you had ever known was in their graves by the end. Yes,that too is true to life itself, but I don't need that in a book--I can see that in my own reality. Why would I want to subject myself to a depressing fictitious depiction of this? Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!","review":"Everyone I know raved about this book. I was so excited to read it, but it has disappointed me all the way through! When I was mid-way through the book and was going to stop reading it, my friend begged me to continue because something \\"big\\" was going to happen. Well, when it happened, I was still bored and the stories within the book (the ones written by Garp)are toally irrelevant to the book, boring, and in my opinion somewhat offensive to women. Don't waste your time with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star rating is too much for this book.","review":"A bad book by an untalented author.

Although sometimes the novel can go off track and get into some very odd, promiscuous sex scenes, I highly recommend it to anyone in for an exciting adventure into the world according to T.S. Garp. His mother is a very loving but odd character with needs only filled by the warmth and compassion of the many people she looks after in her mansion. She is a die-hard feminist but still loves some men, one of whom has turned women to her delight. Garp has much love to give and many people to give it to. His wife and many mistresses receive much love from this affectionate man and he loves his mother just about as much as she loves him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want this book to end","review":"It is a rare treasure that can make you laugh until you hurt in the midst of weeping; this book is one such treasure.

Life happens to him, and it moves Garp forward, backward, and onward, just as it does to all of us. Garp's life is comical, full of love and hate, sprinkled with deceit, deception, and tragedy, and one that you will be happy to have read about. This was a very enjoyable read and a very touching and sad story at times"},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"after reading and adoring A Prayer For Owen Meany, I had very high hopes for this novel.

I am currently reading The Cider House Rules and loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside The World According to Garp","review":"In this novel, not only does John Irving tell us about the twisted and wonderful \\"world according to garp\\", but he lets the reader expirience it. Through the use of his dry humor, vivid imagery and incredible story-telling, John Irving has created a masterpiece.\\"The World According to Garp\\" tells the story of T.S. Garp,a writer, and his eccentric femminist mother, Jenny(also a writer). We follow Garp through childhood and adulthood, once he has his own family. The book deals with shocking and serious issues, such as rape, infidelity, and death. Yet, woven through this dramatic tale is a kind of twisted humor that is extremely refreshing. Irving portrays Garp's unique imagination though Garp's writing, and through Garp's life expiriences. We are drawn into Garp's amazing world and learn to laugh and almost believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Learning C then Learning about programming PIC","review":"The title of the book is misleading. I was expecting to learn about programming the PIC using CCS C but 8 of the 9 chapters dealt with learning C and had nothing to do with the PIC. The one chapter the did deal with the PIC was short and did not give a lot of information or examples. To me, this book is not worth the money. But if you're looking for a beginners guide to C with a brief description of some of the commands used to program the PIC using CCS compiler, then it may be worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"A fairly straight forward book for the beginner.

The destructive power of the sprinkler system, lawnmower, and cigarette. The thrills of riding on a bumblebee. But in this sequel, we don't really get to see the world differently--at least not as much as the first film. It's probably why the third movie--which I haven't seen yet--wisely went back to its original roots. This is the sort of movie for people who liked Attack of the 50 foot Woman or something. In short, there just isn't much merit to this film and you're better off entertaining yourself with something else. The very fact that--at the time of this reviewing--only a handful of people reviewed this movie should be sending klaxons off in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Viewing","review":"This movie is just plain fun, silly, silly fun. The premise is absurd: a scientist accidentally zaps his toddler with a magnification ray and the kid \\"blows up\\" to 120 feet tall and menaces Las Vegas. No one gets hurt in this humorous spoof of 1950s horror films in general and a sweet sequel of the classic Honey I Shrunk the Kids in specific.

I enjoyed it then, and when I watched the movie again last year, I found out that I STILL enjoy it.I agree that the movie should have had more characters involved instead of sticking to the main family (for the most part) but that's not really a big problem. The fact that the kid blows up and walks around doing some creative and amazing things positively makes this a great family movie, in my eyes. When the kid finally leaves the house so all the people can see him, this is when the plot really kicks in.

His parents mastered the literal frontier, and David went on to master the scientific puzzle known as Jackson Hole, in Grand Teton National Park.

You will not find a more fascinating, humane and stirring account of the sciences than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rising from the Plains","review":"McPhee encompasses the histories of Wyoming from the geology to the people and legends that add insight into Wyoming culture. Interesting, well-written journal entries of a woman raising a family while dealing with the harsh realities of Wyoming in the late 1800s are placed intermittently between dense descriptions of Wyoming geology. Being a fan of geology makes this book a whole lot better but the way he describes the formations and landscapes makes for a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short review","review":"This is the third in the series of books on Western geology, following 'Basin and Range' and 'In Suspect Terrain'. John McPhee has the ability to write very readable and knowledgable essays about almost any subject that he chooses to examine, and these three books are very much a case in point.Whether you are seriously or just mildly interested in geology, this book is entertaining and infromative. There is enough family history (of his geologist companion), geological history etc. to keep you fascinated and to make for a good reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A geology road trip","review":"I am not sure how to describe a book like this. It's ostensibly about the geology of the Rocky Mountains around Wyoming. However, McPhee is a journalist. Much of the book entails driving around Wyoming with geologist David Love, who grew up on a ranch in the state. There's a lot of Love's biography mixed in here, and the stories of his parents and their ranch. There's also some of Love's views of the changing discipline of geology, especially the declining prestige of field geology. Much of Love's work has implications for hardrock mining, coal mining, or oil and gas development, so McPhee discusses that. Those things have environmental implications, and both Love and McPhee therefore have mixed feelings about the economic development that they would otherwise support.Odd as that mix is, it works. The book is inexplicably compelling, and you feel as if you're in the truck with Love and McPhee, learning to read the geology of Wyoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I loved Zyman's earlier book, so I expected more of the same.

The story knows what it's about, and the actors give great convincing performances. definitely a tear jerker. as an American viewer i guess I also found interesting how the film used life in the States and possibility there as a plot device, so that we get the American dream and its forms showing up in Beijing during a time of economic transformation to inform the plot from a few different angles. anyway i'm glad i watched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"I read many reviews saying this was one of the best gay love stories ever. great gay movies are extreemly hard to come by. most are d-movies with horible acting and silly plots and bad filming. i was told by many that this one was \\"different\\" its \\"fantastic\\".

But don't expect a \\"feel good\\" message--there is definitely more work to be done than meets the eye.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt at The Celestine Prophecy","review":"This book has to be one of the worst that I have read in a long time. The story is implausible, the characters are unbelievable, and the message is too hidden, not to mention too convoluted. A winding story that weakly tries to give its reader the same sort of feelings of destiny and purpose that Redfield's \\"THE CELESTINE PROPHECY\\" instilled in all of its readers. Not only did I feel that this book was a waste of time, but of paper, that it's Taker vs Leaver mentality is souly against. I gained nothing from this book, and found myself only confused and bored from the lack of any sort of involving plot line. If you are seeking enlightenment, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Gorilla what happens to Dan.","review":"This novel was recommended to me by a friend and I thought it would be a good read. Unfortunately it is not. The story is silly and one sided and really cheesy, a telepathic gorilla? The author uses the bible as a historical document to prove points. The bible is fiction from a very small area in world 3000 to 2000 years ago, not a historical document to back up presented points about the state of the world. The main character also seemed very dense and could not learn from the gorilla!!?? Typical people are stupid animals are smart type fare. The author also presents the idea that all tribal people were nature friendly and eco smart not in those words but you get the picture. Yes let's just jump in a time machine and take everybody back to the Stone Age, just like the Gunghu gu tribe in the jungles of the Congo. Poor examples, poor arguments, poor reasoning, and faulty history make this a book to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown and sophmoriphic","review":"Aren't we a magnificent genius, Mr. Quinn? ! While Ishmael may wow naive college students, anyone who is at least marginally introspective has probably already discovered the ultimate moral of this novel on their own. And since the whole book only exists for this one conclusion, there is no real reason to read it.Quinn sounds like he comes from the same soap-boxing style that Ayn Rand likes so much-- you'll discover the life lesson in the first few chapters, then drag through several dozen more only to discover Quinn has the same moral as an episode of Captain Planet.To be fair, he does have an interesting explanation for the origin of the Adam and Eve myth. But that is hardly worth suffering through the rest of this plotless dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMPORTANT MESSAGE about this Book","review":"I know that I'm copying a previous reply, but I must reiterate READ THIS BOOK, it deserves five stars not 1 (I just put one in order to get attention to the review). Also, all of these bad reviews (1 stars), are just proof that this book is an interesting read. Anything this controversial has to have affected people in a strong manner (either loved it or hated it). To be honest, it is not surprising that there are bad reviews. It is an intelligent book and this means that a lot of people will not understand it that well. Don't let all of these 1 star reviews fool you about the validity of this book's message. The truth hurts, and these people just can't come to terms with what they have read. So I recommend this book only to those intelligent people who are willing to read this book with an objective, open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Book I've Ever Returned Based on Content","review":"A particularly irritating trait of humans is our proclivity to impose our ideas of how to live life on others. To embody this trait in a telepathic gorilla makes it borederline unbearable.I read 58 excrutiating pages of this book before returing it to the bookstore, binding still intact. If you want advice, don't look to this author's thinly veiled attempt to impose his surface, barely freshman level understanding of philosophy and social/environmental justice through a gorilla for the answer.I enjoy reading and books that have a message and are written creatively with an appreciation for the intellegence of their audience. I don't enjoy receiving the equivalent of a laundry list of things to do to be a better person - it makes me hostile.The only true principle I took from \\"Ishmael\\" is this: if you happen to meet a gorilla who tells you to meet him to discuss the failings of the human race- run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time reading it!","review":"I was intrigued when I heard about a book where a gorilla has a dialogue with a human regarding the fate of humankind. The topic is rich and there is so much to say about the whirlwind of madness the human race is caught in! Daniel Quinn managed to write an unconvincing and uninteresting book on this important topic. His arguments are weak, his comparisons are farfetched and the impending doom is only hinted at and never clearly presented. His solutions to the \\"problems\\" are somewhere between naive and inexistent. Whatever he had to say he could have said on 20 pages rather than 250.Reading this book and finding out that so many people actually liked it, made me lose faith that humankind can actually be saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations =>=> So-so Message","review":"I consider myself an open-mined, reasonably enlightened person. I read this book on the recommendation of a good friend, whose prior suggestions I've enjoyed greatly. So, my expectations were fairly high before reading the book. Unfortunately, I felt a sense of disappointment after reading it. While at times interesting, my overall impression is a mix of \\"duh\\"and \\"this is old hat\\". Like some of the other reviewers, I felt that the author's generalizations detracted from the integrity of the message he was trying to convey. I wouldn't put this one at the top of your list. Nor would I say that it had a significant impact on my life (although several other books have)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest your hard-earned book money elsewhere","review":"A novel idea, but lacks \\"what can I do about it\\" clout. Too much repetition, and nothing more than a new age, reflective diatribe (one man's opinion of humankind's assault on nature and the animal kingdom. Do yourself a favor and invest in material that gives hard core answers. I was told this would be a life-changing read. Indeed, it is not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"This book was an OK book. it had some great ideas in it, such as distributing condoms instead of just food, to really help with the population problem. But in general i found Ishmael a bit dull. There was absolutely no plot. For a novel documenting the dialogue between a monkey and a man, you'd think there might be some action somewhere in the book. Nope. The guy goes into a bar and nothing happens! Just when you hope some new characters will be introduced. While my friends all seem to love this book, they have a higher tolerance for boring things and seem to like 'classics'. Instead of picking this up, i recommend reading Thom Hartmann's \\"The last hours of ancient sunlight\\" for some real inspiration and education"},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing sideways on lined paper...","review":"Daniel Quinn has written a book that people will either love or hate. The reason to read it is right there. If such a book can inspire so many to write such empassioned reviews, then there must be an important message in it. Those who call it trite, or drivel seem to have an underlying fear in their reviews. Those who praise it so totally also have a certain fear. This book seems to say that we need to give up a great deal in order to save the world. If you look at the vision Mr. Quinn wants to express, then you can see that he wants us to see the world in a different light. Basically, the world would be a better place if we learn to understand that humanity isn't cursed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy !","review":"The most important book I have ever read. I'm no longer shamed to be human. We now own four copies to lend to others. Ignore the \\"story quality\\" and focus on the messages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really interesting, but...","review":"Ishmael is a really fascinating, incredible book, and it's had a huge impact on the way about I think, etc, etc, but it doesn't really tell you what to DO with all these ideas you've just acquired. I mean, you can't stay in taker culture without being a part of it, but it's pretty pointless to just drop out of society- you can't impact anything by doing that. So what's the solution? How are we supposed to live to bring about change? Ishmael claims to be telling us that, but it doesn't really."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book get such a good rating?","review":"This book had so many good ratings, I figured it must be something great to read. I was disappointed. I'm concerned about the world; but what some people thought was a creative way at looking at the problems and how it got that way was just annoying and confusing to me. I read books to either entertain or inform my mind and this did neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"There are a few good points in this book, but Quinn's back to nature argument is childish at best. The world isn't just going to drop everything and go back to hunting and gathering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"Although parts of this book were intersting, in general, it was bizarre and difficult to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stolen from Disney Movie Plots","review":"The gist of this work of pseudo-philosophy is that human beings are evil takers who have ransacked the earth, and the animals are those who give back to the earth. This is a an evil/good binary philosophy for environmentalists written in such a simplified generalized way that the entire works comes off as propaganda written for the mouth of a anthropomorphic gorrilla. The soapbox is higher than the Sears Tower. Cute Lovable Animals. Evil Humans. How is this different from hundreds of Disney movie plots?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More New Age drivel","review":"Oh come on! An answer to anthropocentrism? I give it one star because of the points made about the need to care for the earth. But we knew that, didn't we? Or is this Social Darwinism in disguise? That bit about not over-producing food for worldwide distribution as it will cause ever increasing overpopulation- dying isn't so bad, right? I would submit that there is hardly any worse way to die than by starvation. This book is quasi Socratic trudge to the maxim Live and Let Live. The history is ludicrously simplistic, the metaphor of Takers versus Leavers is ridiculous- and some of the Leavers groups Quinn uses to illustrate his point have some of the worst drug and alcohol problems on the planet. This is new age drivel- yet another guy with another idea which will save the earth. Believe this: If you didn't get it from your Bible you sure as shootin' aren't going to get it from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ishmael (how white males will destroy Earth)\\"","review":"The book is written from the slant that white males in modern society are powerful enough to destroy the entire whole of life on the planet. If you agree, and you are \\"searching\\" for some way to \\"solve\\" modern society you may want to read this. If not, skip it entirely.The only reason it got 2 stars, instead of 1, is that it was fun to get mad about this and rant a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original Soul trip and wake up call.","review":"As always Daniel Quinn delivers. Great reads for anyone alive today facing the reality of change.He is a writer for all, with a vision that wakes the soul, mind and consciousness of all who dare pick the books up and open Pandoras Box. Happy Journey. \\"B\\" creative and learn from those who know. .....Fast and friendly service from Amazon, many thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your life!","review":"Very rarely would someone put their personal integrity at stake for endorsing a text unconditionally. After reading this book, I have learned of the subject matter and about reality. This book is a must read for anyone that wants a new perspective on reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"For people who have never thought before","review":"This is a terribly boring book. I speculate that it is popular because some people have not been exposed to ideas presented in this book. The ideas are not new or revolutionary - Mr. Quinn is not a ground-breaking philosopher. He is recycling what has been said before, and which an intelligent person can think about without any prompting.I found it incredibly boring not only because of the lack of philosophical (spiritual??) originality, but also because there is hardly a story line; the story line that does exist is hardly believable. I want to know where the gorrilla gets its' food and water and how does it reside in an office building? Where does it go to defecate? Where is animal control for the jurisdiction? It is a ridiculous and boring book. I am hoping that the bookstore will allow me to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's a discussion about this book with sane people","review":"Just another book set upon indoctrinating our kids.

Here's a discussion about Ishmael you may find enlighteing: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberalism at its worst","review":"Regardless on your thoughts about man vs the planet and about the best way to preserve both in harmony. This book is nothing more than the basic liberal attempt to blindside the arugment by stating his premise as fact and then basising all future theories on this \\"fact\\". But if you are not allowed to dispute the original arugment than all future arugments have to agree, hence no ability to make up your own mind. The author does this by his choice of words such as labeling one group as the \\"leavers\\" and the other group as the \\"takers\\" and stating that these names carry no meaning other than to identify the groups. This is what liberals do and I for one would like the 2 weeks back I wasted reading this veiled attempt and liberal brainwashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and Disturbing","review":"This book is blatantly anti-Semitic and anti-Christian blaming both groups with everything from over-population to animal extinction. The overall tone is pessimistic and negative. It premises are ridiculous and offensive and display nothing more than the author&#65533;s twisted take on history and his strong anti-religious views. Who will like this book? It will be loved by KKK members, environmental terrorists and people with no hope for the human race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ishmael...aaahhhh","review":"This book stinks! Aren't you supposed to actually understand it. When I had finished it (because the school assigned it), I burned it and then ate it! This book is like a dictionary. Step away kids, this book is dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind opening experience","review":"Ishmael is one of the best books I've read in my life. It's not a book to read and be entertained by if you have a small mind, it's a book to read and entertained by if you can see past the story, and get to the meaning. Who cares if it's a gorilla being the teacher, he's absolutely right about every thing that he says. We are destroying the world. The takers are the ones who can't see the message in the book, all they see is repetition and a gorilla. The leavers understand, they know and care about what's really going on. They understand Ishmael. Save the world, be less concerned about yourself, be a Leaver. If you can see past the story, and know that the book has a really powerful message, you're one step ahead of every ignorant person who can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash for pseudo-intellectual children","review":"This book is the WORST. There's nothing wrong with earnest idealism, Socratic dialogues, intellectual journeys, talking gorillas, mythology deconstruction, or ecological-mindedness. Taken together, however, and done by Daniel Quinn? If you like this book you are either a monster or a freshman. Go read Steve Healey's \\"How I Became a Famous Novelist\\" instead. Namaste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book took way too long to read, but I finally finished it after being dragged through boring narrative, uneventful plot delivery, and virtually nonexistant character development. Don't waste your time. You are better off reading a term paper about anthropology. Daniel Quinn thought he was clever, but I know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"Ishmael, is personally, the worst book I ever read. I had to read it for school, and I was falling asleep trying to read it. There is no action, whatsoever. In like the whole book, they are sitting in that room, discussing the end of the world. The slightest action takes place when Ishmael goes to the cricus, but still, boooooring. After they talked and talked for the whole book, Ishmael dies, and it just ends right there. The man doesn't even do anything. Just cuts off with the writing on the poster. Personally, I hope that no one my age has to ever read this book again, for it is incredibly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planet of the Ape Celestine Prophecy","review":"I dunno... the central angle of this book, that all the world's schools of thought are wrong...EXCEPT THIS ONE, is a bit hard to take. The narrator character, disillusioned with his previous gurus and mentors, finds enlightenment from a psychic gorillia, who apparently offers little different than his former teachers, other than he's a big hairy ape. Some people like this book, but not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ishmael: Literary Pestilence","review":"I think it is rare for an author to so effectively capture every literary (and intellectual) horror. Ishmael is the home of atrocious writing, painful logic, and quicksand pacing: it is the longest of short books. And Quinn, with sadistic flair, so pummels the reader with repetitive, tiresome pseudo-socratic ramblings, that one is left weak and confused, hoping for mother culture's only certain salvation: the whisper of \\"nuclear winter.&quot"},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing book","review":"i had to read this book for a sociology class that i took in college and i found this to be one of the most confusing books i have ever read. it doesn't have a truly easy way of following the book all the way threw form beginning to end. i may of had to read it for college but ended up stopping reading it because of the confusion of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pro or anti- Ayn Rand?","review":"If your read Ayn Rand's the Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged, you have to wonder if Daniel Quinn read a lot of her books because the them of his book appears to be exactly the opposite philosophy of Ayn Rand, except progress is present in a primitive ape. Daniel Quinn may have an agenda for all to debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I forced myself to finish this book only because it was given to me by a friend. This book is about Quinn preaching his philosophy through a fictional gorilla. I suppose he thinks it is easier to get his views across by voicing personal opinions through non-human form.I was irritated by the repetitiveness of the gorilla's lessons (What did we learn yesterday?) and the position of \\"Think for yourself. You can't figure it out? Okay, I'll tell you what to think\\".Quinn covers very few social topics, but presents them like they are the only items of importance. Out of 200+ pages, less than 50 were thought-provoking or interesting. The book is preachy, boring, and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but far from perfect","review":"Like some others in here, I would actually rate this book a 3 or 4, but since when I check out a book one of the first things I read are the negative reviews, I thought I'd throw my $.02 in here. For those who insist that this book \\"doesn't back up assumptions with facts\\" or that it's \\"just another new age diatribe\\" I'd suggest following up a reading of Ishmael with Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" which not only won a Pulitzer, but backs up nearly everthing Quinn postulates about \\"how things came to be this way.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad. . . Not GOOD, but not bad. . .","review":"My views on this book may seem a bit jaded, but to be honest I'm just getting tired of hearing how \\"bad\\" humans are. I'm proactive when it comes to the ecology, but this book makes it clear that the only thing humans can do to improve this world is go away. Sorry Dan, not gonna' happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already, I know we are bad people!","review":"This book has some interesting veiwpoints, but come on! To repeat the same things over and over and over seems like a waste of the trees we're trying to save! I don't understand how people can rate it a 10, I personally fell asleep four times in two pages. If you want to be told what a terrible rotten person you are by a smelly gorilla, then this book is for you. But I personally feel that your time could be much better spent picking up something that is actually entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying narrative","review":"I agree that this book contains interesting, thought-provoking ideas. However, they are presented as a work of fiction where a man has conversations with a gorilla. This conversation is essentially one long narrative by the gorilla, interrupted by the man occcasionally saying, \\"I think I see what you mean\\" or other empty banalities. There is no plot worth mentioning.The ideas in this book would have been much better served if the book had been written and sold as a plain, scholarly nonfiction book. As it is, it is just too annoying to read, and unsatisfying both to readers looking for a work of fiction and to those looking for philosophical ponderings about the role of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change the World","review":"Ishmael has changed the course of my life completely. For the better of course. I do not expect everyone to retain what I have from Quinn's book, but what it has done for me is spurred an entire movement of thoughts, ideas, and dreams. Before Ishmael I was very confused with human culture and what purpose we have in the universe. As an atheist, things seemed obviously plain, but unexplainable. Ishmael has explained much of it to me. I recommend this book to everyone I meet. No matter one's opinion, it is a read necessary by everyone because of the ideas it brings to the table. The ideas themselves are not only controversial, but (ironically) brand new to our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorilla as Teacher","review":"Who would have guessed that a gorilla named Ishmael would teach me more than most of my college professors! After participating in a global warming action day yesterday, I came home and thought about Ishmael and what he can teach us about living in harmony with our home planet and its inhabitants. Mother Culture has led us down a dead-end path. Ishmael helps us challenge Mother Culture and pay attention to Mother Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ishmael","review":"Ishmael is an amazing book that will change the way you look at the world.

MODERN SOCIETY'S PROBLEM!!","review":"I would have never chosen to read this book on my own. The only reason I read this book was because it was an assignment for class. The author presented his liberal ideas as fact instead of as a theory, which it is. The author's only evidence is hypothetical situations and distantly related examples. THERE WERE NO FACTS! Aside from being completely untruthful, the authors anaolgies were often too random and too off-topic to make any clear points. What's more, this book is AN ATTACK ON ORGANIZED RELIGION! I was deeply offended as all my values and ideals were treated like a hokey, senseless rubbish. THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH READING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God","review":"Oh. My. God. This book was mindnumbingly stupid. I felt like I was reading my environmental science textbook. This book does not make you \\"rethink your entire existance,\\" it makes you roll your eyes every 8 seconds. This book would only appeal to someone who needs someone else to think for them (which, in fact, the narrator does).

Don't let anybody influence your opinion. Go ahead. Read the book.The book is not offending in any way. Its content may introduce some ideas that are challenging to one's faith/belief, yet it is undeniably a classic. A brilliant masterpiece. An intelligent author with thought-provoking ideas.If you are a believer in God, who may be offended by this book, then here's a practical advice on how to read and enjoy the book at the same time: Consider your faith (whatever it may be) a constant, while viewing wisdom (knowledge) and science as variables. This way, you will enjoy this book to a great extent, and most importantly, will not be offended by it!I truly love this book, and I think Daniel Quinn is one of the most intelligent and influential writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great quick-read that really makes you think about the way people are living.

The premise may seem silly to some, but I soon became thoroughly absorbed in the parable of what our nearest relatives in the animal world would tell us if they could. Almost every day my mind finds its way back to Ishmael's thoughts in regard to how silly we supposedly \\"superior beings\\" are, how we foul our own environment and refuse to accept accountability for what we are doing to all of the innocents who are among our victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Thought-Provoking","review":"Read this then read the next two (The Story of B and My Ishmael). Simply amazing and life changing.

It talks about how our current race is heading down an unsustainable path, while also looking back through history at the tribes and people that were more sustainable.

You must read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple, but immensely important message.","review":"No, this book is not on the same level as Faulkner and Hemingway. Guess what? Doesn't matter.The message of Ishmael is what is truly important. That message? That humanity, through an understanding of its own cultural psychology, can alter its destructive habits.Many have criticized Ishmael as a work that is too \\"simple\\", and that only children could benefit from its message. To them I would like to say, \\"Then why didn't YOU write it, when the Turner Fellowship, and the half a million dollar prize?\\"Just because the message is simple, does not mean it is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile Ego-Stroking","review":"While I agree with much of the philosophy presented in Ishmael, the book is damned by its presentation. The author seems more concerned with stroking his ego and making his philosophy seem unique and mind-blowing than writing a good book. Instead of intelligent discourse, we've got a condescending monkey who repeats things ad-nauseum, has a penchant for hyperbole, and spends the rest of his time trying to make the author seem like a genius. Well guess what, Quinn? Any reasonably intelligent high schooler has thought of these things. Trust me, you are not the first. Keep the philosophy, just don't present yourself as brilliant for having it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Silliness","review":"This book reads as if it were written by an idealistic teenager who had recently read Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\"; \\"The Trial of Socrates\\"; and other Socratic influenced pieces. A simple argument piece with no heft to it at all. I guess no gorilla can know everything, but Ishmael shares \\"wisdom\\" of a pre-21st century world, at best, and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life after Ishmael...","review":"This has been one of the most important and enlightening books I have ever read - it touched so many issues that I had thought about, but hadn't been able to articulate. If you've ever wondered, even for a moment, what our place is in the universe, you must read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not perfect","review":"First, I must applaud Quinn for not blaming all the ills of the world on organized religion. I think religion is mostly invented and can be a tool of ignorance, but anti-religious is no more openminded than religious and books like this tend to be religion fingerpointing. This was one of the best books I ever read, but I had my disagreements. When you throw out as many opinions as Quinn has I think most people will have disagreements, but Quinn probably welcomes that.The writing style was annoying, but necessary. If Quinn tried to write a story and tie all these messages into it no one would get everything he was saying. My biggest turnoff isn't really with the book, but I happened to start the book after thinking about these subjects a few years. Before I finished I had reached the point where I was tired of lamenting the society I live in, which is very much the theme of this book. In all, fascinating book and it will get you thinking like nothing since Carl Sagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nihilistic philosophical propaganda","review":"Awful. Just plain awful, and full of mushy-headed thinking. There isn't any real intellectual debate between man and gorilla in this book since the agenda here is Man = evil, Nature = holy. The gorilla makes his pronouncements and the man simply accepts them. \\"Gee, I never woulda thought of it like that, Mr. Gorilla.\\"Any true philosopher could have poked a kajillion holes in the gorilla's argumments while doing multiplication tables in his head.It starts with the shaky premise that civiliation--beginning with the invention of agriculture--is all about destroying the world, and it takes off from there. If you accept that premise you'll probably join the navel-gazers and self-loathers who heaped praise on it. I wish I could give it zero stars.If you have been taught to hate yourself for being a member of the human race living in the modern world, you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MONKEY! BAD!","review":"This is just bad. If anyone would take the time to step back and think about what is said, objectively, the ideas in the book can not stand up by themselves. If readers are looking for a book that really makes them think, let me Recommend Italo Calvino's \\"Ideal Cities\\". It provides a base for thought without conjuring up weak solutions for out problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"I began reading Ishmael with the highest of hopes. Those hopes quickly faded however. Ishmael is easily one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever had the misfortune of reading. I am not saying this only because I do not agree with Quinn, but also because Quinn fails to make accurate accusations of his \\"leavers\\" and \\"takers\\" Quinn contradicts himself frequently, making him look like an pathetically inexperienced author. I sympathize with anyone who has ever had the misfortune of reading Ishmael. Too many people are crediting the book with \\"changing their views...forever\\" This is one of the worst things a book can do. A truly intellectual book may challenge or even change your views, but true intelligence is knowing that they may very well change again. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this atrocious \\"adventure of the mind and spirit\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting nonsense","review":"This book, although presenting thought-provoking and somewhat unique ideas, also makes many very outrageous and unsupported claims. The main character just sits around as his teacher asks him crazy and ambigous questions which wastes lots of time. An example question: not exact quote sTeacher: What is your race's myth about creation?Main character: Are you refering to the genesis?Teacher: No.and they spend a page arguing whether the creation of earth etc. are just myths and eventually the main character agrees. Half of the book is just them dawdling about unsupported hypothesises. Many of the things that this so-called teacher claim can be found to be exactly incorrect when given serious thought.If you are gullible or stupid and want to here what may seem to be revolutionary insights until you think then I reccommend this book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the attention it is getting.","review":"When I was first given the book, I've heard about all the spritual rap and how it changes people's life, I was excited. But what a disappointment it was. The nameless student is annoying in that he gives me the impression that he does not even try to think. Ishmael just gives some over-generalization of human nature, then the student is eager to agree. The story line is thin and Ishmael keeps repeating things as if the readers have no memory or that repeating a statement makes it more true. He assmes all the readers are idiots, and just plain out TELL them what they ought to think. I resent that. The student should have provided more counter-arugument. I have many questions to ask but feel left out because the student is too dumb to ask them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would much rather have teeth pulled","review":"When I first heard about this book, I thought it must be really great because of all the attention it was recieving. Boy, what a disappointment. I found it completely annoying the way the gorilla repeats himself as if the reader has never had a thought of their own outside feeding themselves. It was insulting! The ideas were not profound. The only thing good that came out of this book is that it reached a group of people that probably would never have given environmentalism a second thought. For that I thank you, but as a work of good literature this book was far from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story of a Teacher/For Quinn is Just a Preacher","review":"The story of a teacher seeking a student, but not just any student! You! In page after page, the author, speaking through his \\"teacher\\" in the form of an 800 lb gorilla, demonstrates his complete ignorance of even the most basic principles of population and economics. Quinn almost urges a return to the hunting and gathering lifestyle never minding the fact that this prescription would shave the earth's population thinner than the hair on a baboon's bottocks. If I had read this book when I was young, I may have been taken in by Quinn's primitive arguments. But in my old age, I recognize that his logic belongs to an age of ignorance something like 8 million years ago, when we branched off from the gorillas. Interesting given his choice of avatars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bankrupt","review":"Writing as one who teaches Conservation and Environmental Sciences at the college level, I can say that this book contains more factual, scientific, and ethical flaws than any other single book I have ever read. If you wish to teach students to think critically this would be a great book to dismember paragraph by paragraph. It represents the worst of 1970's touch-feely environmental thought. I could write a dissertation on the problems this book represents. The most fascinating and disturbing aspect of the book is its ability to completely seduce the uniformed. I have yet to meet a single academic Historian, Anthropologist, Geographer, or Environmental Scientist, who likes this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ishmael shows us the subtle culture we don't know we have","review":"Daniel Quinn and Ishmael leave an impact on the reader long after one puts down the book. While reading this novel, it is hard to put it down, because you want to learn more. Teaching us about Man and his history, we see that \\"our\\" branch of humans has gone astray. Ishmael forces the reader to think: about what being human means, about the human history we have been taught, and about Man's relationship with the rest of the world. Through reading this book, one can realize what the problem is, and perhaps realize how to solve it"},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking and unique","review":"Ishmael raises some interesting points, some I'd never thought of before reading the book. The writing isn't the best out there but I still think this is a very important book in terms of the human race and the world. I've always known that there was obviously something wrong with the way we as humans were living but now I can see what exactly it is and where the roots of the problems are. I understand the issues and even how they can be resolved thanks to Daniel Quinn. Ishmael tries to show us a new way to live that we're not used to but if we can manage to live as he recommends the world will be much better off."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Socratic Method Given New Life","review":"Daniel Quinn takes the age-old method of teaching through question and answer to new levels in this riveting book.

The book talks about nothing and I would never reccomend this book to anyone. This put me to sleep everytime i picked it up. I just wanted the book to end. And I was hapy when the book was all over. I had to read this book for a class I taking otherwise I would have never even picked it up after the first chapter. The only way I would reccomend this book is if it was for something so you could get to sleep at night. This book taught me one thing- how boring a book can be. I would rather sit in the corner of the room and have to stare at the wall for hours instead of reading this book.

Daniel Quinn may appear to be a genius however he is merely stating the obvious. Ishmael is a book that has opened my eyes and changed the way I view the world. Quinn writing style flows in a comfortable way that keeps the reader wanting more and more. Ishmael describes ways in which humans are taking away from this world without even noticing. If anyone has ever had the thought that there might just be something wrong with the world, Ishmael not only answers those questions, but enlightens the reader towards so many other problems that humanity will face. This is a book I believe everyone in the world should be forced to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darwinism","review":"The book will cause you take a probative look into all that we have learned about our \\"civilized\\" culture and that of \\"primative\\" third world bretherin. The only problem that I had with the book was that it didn't go too far. The narrator of the book offered little resistance to Ishmael's thoughts. Here is a gorilla basically telling you of the evilness of your ways and all you say in turn is yes I see. Or, when Ishmael stumps the guy, Ishmael says think harder and then the guy instantaniously gets it. That aspect made the dialouge a bit unrealistic. But in terms of the depth of knowledge and ability to make the reader think, the bookn is incredible. A definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Thought - neither more nor less than we need","review":"The premise seems crazy, if inventive. This \\"dialogue\\" between a man and a gorilla turns out to be an exercise in critical thinking (good, therefore, for everyone!) Ishmael invites the reader to question the very underpinnings of \\"modern\\" culture. I don't know about you, but I find that to be a very worthy enterprise. We do seem to be driving ourselves to extinction - maybe Ishmael has something to teach all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"I also wish I could give it zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really hate this book. I can't understand how anybody can actually like this book. It's impossible to believe anything that comes out of a Gorilla's head, even if that Gorilla is Mr. Quinn himself. With Gorilla gone, is there hope for man? In this case, Yes. Getting rid of Ishmael would be a great plus to society!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"If it were not required for a humanities class, this book would have found its way to the trash long before I had the misfortune to finish. The book is nothing more than new age fodder for wanna-be hippies and baby boomers looking for answers to how their lives became so empty. I can say that Mr. Quinn needs to get out of whatever commune of self help and get rich quick guru's he's stuck in, and find his way to the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Although this is arguably the worst book I have ever read, I must admit that the author deserves some credit for it. After all, he must have put a lot of effort into coming up with such unrealistic ideas, and it shows. I don't know how in the world the author managed to stay awake long enough to write this much redundant, pointless information, when the entire book could easily be summarized in one chapter. Unless for some reason you enjoy subjecting yourself to endless hours of unbelievable boredom, stay away from this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting message, oddly written","review":"i won't comment about the style, as many others have- but calling this a novel is pushing it.apparently in order to save the earth, we must abandon not only our evil civilization, but even be prepared to accept our individual deaths (from starvation, disease) as acts in the hands of the gods. tough stuff for even a leaver society to swallow, i think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad science, intolerable to read - good messsage","review":"This book is chock full of bad science and shoddy reasoning. I agree with the basic message that we need to re-examine our cultural assumptions to survive as a species, long term. This is hardly earth-shattering news to anyone with a brain. But, the irritating main character in the book rolls out falsehoods and wild speculations as obvious fact - and the even more irritating secondary character can only reply \\"Oh I was so stupid now I see you are right about everything\\". Rush Limbaugh would have a field day with this book. It shouts \\"I'm a wacko hippie freak - kick me!\\" This book is a disservice to environmentalists everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever","review":"This is the worst book ever.

I forgot about it until I just now finished readingGuns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond, which addresses the same topic as Ishmael--the development of agriculture and rise of civilization--but does so thoroughly, logically, and with some real scholarship. Reading it made me think of Quinn's book and I understood what was wrong with Ishmael--it is armchair philosophy instead of real research. Quinn has a interesting theory, but it dosen't come near real anthropology."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"Ishmael by Daniel Quinn is a novel about a man seeking knowledge of human fallacies andhow to save the world. It is about teacher who is a gorilla named Ishmael who has studied human nature for much of his life. Ishmael teaches the man about the two human cultures, the Takers and the Leavers. It gave a lot of insight into human nature and why Takers feel the need to conquer the land. The manner in which Quinn portrays his ideas through question and answer relation instigates self and social analysis. It bashes our culture which is a uncomfortable but necessary. Te reader is involved in the learning process. The format is tiring after awhile, and the book lascks plot. The realizations about everyday life make the book worthwhile and a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience It.","review":"Simply amazing. You must read it to experience it.

While the viewpoint expressed is unique and compelling, it is the open-ended nature of the conclusion that I really felt gave the reader a jolt. Really leads you to question what you think you know. The story dragged a little for me at first, but after I got used to listening to an ape tell a story, it really pulled me in."},{"rating":"2","title":"New way of thinking","review":"This book is just wonderful. I was a little suspicious as I was reading the first chapter, but I kept with it since it came highly recommended by a friend bought the book for me. I'm hardly an avid book reader, but this one really made a difference in my outlook on life. It's been almost a year since I read it, but the principles have stayed with me. I've passed my copy of the book along to two friends, both of whom have also loved the story. Now I'm buying a few more copies to send to some of my other friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ishmael","review":"When I began reading this book I thought it would be interesting, as it had been highly reccommended to me. But I was in for a big surprise. This book has possibly changed my life - or at least opened my eyes. As soon as I picked it up I just couldnt stop reading. I started one evening and halfway through a lecture at university the next day I was finished. That was this morning. Since then I havent been able to stop thinking about the messages it conveys about society and mankind and thier place in the world. Written extremely cogently... Tomorrow I'm going to the library to look for more of David Quinn's books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Change is scary, take it or leave it.","review":"So many telling reviews here. Basically, I see two types of people reviewing this book: 1)Those scared but willing to accept Quinn's message, regardless of his skills as a writer or his scholarly accuracy. 2)Those scared and unwilling to accept Quinn's message, choosing in their impotence to criticize the work itself. We're all scared, and if you're not, then you better wake up, and fast. I don't see much leadership amongst us, and I'm thankful for Quinn's bold, half-baked snarl of an attempt to get his ideas through my confused and frightened skull. Since when was the truth easy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The BOOK isn't that good. The IDEAS are.","review":"I can understand why this book could be so life altering to someone who had never carefully considered the place of Man in the world.

I thoroughly enjoyed the blatanly agressive style of the book - there is no way to misconstrue the message presented through the story. However, approximately two-thirds of the people I talk with who have read this book feel absolutely ATTACKED by the story.For the most part, these folks simply cannot put aside their anger over Quinn's alternative view of The Bible and its \\"raison d'etre.\\"For my money, though, I find new points of view to be quite nourishing; and though it's been two years since I read it, hardly a day goes by when it doesn't come up in conversation in some way or another.Don't read this book unless you're willing to let Quinn twist your mind around and play hardball with it. Once you've read it, you'll never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ishmael","review":"This is a fantastic book with very insightful topics, such as why we are living the way we are and how we can become more sustainable.

Once you get past the first few pages and the interesting premise the present, I was enthralled and could not wait to turn the page.

Initially, I was very moved by the underlying message of the story which I interpreted (fundamentally, at least) as a wake up call. I'm not at liberty to call Mr. Quinn's historical or scientific facts into question because I am not an historian or anthropologist. I do know that a good book is characterized partially by its ability to cause change and urge its audience to question things that they might otherwise overlook. The message of Ishmael is so simple, yet so hard to incorporate into our technologically-advanced, power-hungry lives. Even if the book doesn't cause people to alter their destructive \\"Taker\\" ways, it will most certainly force them to think about what it is they're are doing and what effect this inevitable damage will have on their lives and the lives of generations to come"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile Utopianism at its worst.","review":"In this book, Quinn opines that the hunting and gathering way of life is superior to our own. He believes this while presumably enjoying all the comforts of modern industrial civilization, and he shows no sign of joining the Bushmen, nor do I see any of his ardent fans doing so either. The tendency to idealize pastoral life from afar is as old as the Greeks and Quinn is merely the latest to express this flawed idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious crap","review":"I can't believe all the lavish praise everyone's pouring on this book. Its not that good! Some of the ideas are interesting, but you have to slog through all this poorly written dialog to get there. And the author uses the dialog format to praise his own ideas. One character will say something, and the other will exclaim \\"Thats the most amazing idea I've ever heard!\\" Quinn's pretentiousness drove me crazy. Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"Ishmael is truly a fascinating novel and has changed the way I think.

Nothing too groundbreaking if you have any common sense and an anthropology/history class or two. But does he really have to be so damned preachy?I had some hopes for this book before I started reading it. It was highly recommended by someone I respected, so I gave it a chance. Even after the same damned message was beat into my head page after page. Man is the problem, dating back to when we dropped out of the trees and first made fire. Whatever. Mr. Quinn, if we stayed hunter-gatherers, would you have ever had a chance to write your little books? You would have been dead by age 20. Your cavalier attitude makes me drop to my knees and thank God for technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pete and Repeat were on a boat, Pete fell off who was left?","review":"This book is frustrating.

I also thought that a telepathic monkey was stretching it a bit... It had NO plot what-so-ever, and this made it EXTREMLY boring.

If everyone in the world read this book, the world would be a different place.

If you feel the same way, maybe you should get this book! Quinn definitely has the knack for keeping the reader interested in a 300-page dialouge, though he seems to fall into spurts of redundancy at intermittent points throughout. \\"Ishmael\\"'s merits lie within its tendency to create a vast universe of possibility within a few lines of text, and Quinn is able to articulate some very basic philosophical ideas in a new, fresh way that would make it appealing to even the most stubborn \\"Taker\\".On a side-note, do not watch the movie \\"Instinct\\" after reading this book!

I feel sorry that you are so deafened by Mother Culture that you cannot hear someone else's words of warning and encouragment. Do you not feel that SOMETHING isn't right about the way we are living? Where did all our \\"morals\\" come from? Why do we have to work so hard for what we need to survive as a species?(And don't kid yourself...we ARE a SPECIES, just like the birds, the turtles, the jellyfish, and gorillas!)If you could just come to the realization that there is no \\"one right way to live\\" and look beyond what you've been told so far, you would not be so critical and frustrated with other's optimism.

He uses an interesting and fun teacher/student relationship with a wise but droll and lonely gorilla as a teacher. Be aware that the book becomes cynical and ends up making most of us humans to be misguided at best and evil at worst. It is the same old glorification of nature and demonizing of humanity, though there is certainly some truth to this in the way we treat our environment.

In the first chapter or so, I thought I might drop out of the lecture because it seemed so childish. THEN I was hooked. Daniel Quinn has a different way of looking at things from the way I do. (\\"Life, The Universe, and Everything\\" type questions and \\"42\\" is NOT the answer, per Ishmael). I cannot agree in my heart with Quinn on his analysis of how religion and civilization came about, but, in my limited 69 years of education, I cannot refute it.

Not everyone sees it and the people who can do something about it don't see it, and even if they did, would there be time to slow or alter the course of such massive momentum? And does anyone even know how? (And is the iceberg really there, or is it a mirage?) Daniel Quinn's book gives one theory of how things came to be as they are and why we are on a collision course with doom if we don't alter our way of thinking about the world and our relationship to it. There are no easy answers to such a huge predicament, and Quinn doesn't try to provide any. In this book he just tries to convince us that there is a problem.

I found \\"Ishmael\\" to be extremely heavy-handed and bombastic - every viewpoint the author espouses is spelled out for the reader through a thin veil of narrative. It's written using simplistic and unimaginative language - utterly lacking in delicacy and subtlety (kinda like this review!). It's comparable to a young adult novel in terms of complexity. The book's premise and the data used to support it has a very dated feel - there's not much in it for modern readers.I recommend you get your fix through some other literary source. If you consider yourself reasonably well-read, \\"Ishmael\\" will be a struggle to complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"This is a classic example of the sort of \\"pop philosophy\\" book which excites people who have never read anything else.

As others have suggested it is so annoying you find yourself beginning to analyze why it is so irritating and of course there is value in critical thinking. As a reader who enjoys non fiction I found the format of the talking gorilla ridiculous. The basic tenant of book is good. We as humans are destroying the planet with pollution, population and disregard for all other ecosystems. For those of us who have not noticed this before reading the book then perhaps it is a good read. But for anyone who is poignantly aware of this already this book will feel like redundant information. The premise could be written in three pages so I resented having to read the whole book to pick out the simplistic kernels. In any case, it has made me feel so strongly that it has compelled me to write my first book review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-think the world.","review":"In the same way that Kerouac's masterpiece \\"On the Road\\" changes the way people live their lives, Daniel Quinn's equally prolific \\"Ishmael\\" changes the way we think about them. Through the wise titular character in the form of a gorilla, Quinn teaches us the error of our peoples ways, and does what he can to point us in the right direction. The story is captivating, interesting, and leaves you wanting to do something to make things better for the future generations when you're finished. Anyone with an open mind and an open heart should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking...","review":"While I don't view this book, or Daniel Quinn's apparent animistic leanings, as a literal way to live, I find the logic and ideas behind it to be fascinating. One of the main ideas of this book is the effects of \\"Mother Culture\\" on our sensibilities and actions. We never notice it until we're introduced to it. After that, we see it everywhere we go.I'm looking at other books at the moment, but I'm definitely recommending this book to my friends.

I was gravely mistaken. This book should be required college reading, and without a doubt will be considered a classic within its own right.

With early man's development of agriculture, the human race divided into two different groups of people: those who live by the hands of gods and those who attempt to live as gods themselves.

My personal opinion: \\"yeah, yeah, we know.\\" Ironically enough, he writes his animal character with the same kind of arrogance he criticizes. If you want to read a work that I feel is more current environmental philosophy that is showing us the way rather than reiterating history read \\"The Abstract Wild\\" by Jack Turner (fantastic) or look into the works of William McDonough.

But it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"with brain gone, is there hope for quinn?","review":"This book is frustrating.

A poorly written Socratic dialectic between a curmudgeon gorilla and a lobotomized Willy Loman. Equal in literary merit to \\"Bridges Of Madison County\\".

It assumed its readers did not have a basic understanding of evolution, anthropology and philosophy. Ishmeal is about a great ape who teaches a human about our place in the world, trite, very trite. It was tremendously annoying to have to imagine an erudite gorilla pontificating telepathically to a student while chewing on a stick.This book is very outdated. Its message can be summed up in one sentence...Humans are not the center of the universe and therefore should not live that way. There, I just saved you $13.95 (plus shipping and handling)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ishmael","review":"I never thought that I could learn so much from a talking gorilla. While the ideas presented in Ishmael were very interesting and held my attention, the book as a whole was not that special. There were few truely original ideas in the book and there really is no plot. In fact, it would make more sense for Quinn to put these ideas into an essay rather than somehow stuff a talking gorilla and his student into the novel. Ishmael also talks constantly about how we will believe everything that \\"Mother Culture\\" tells us to believe and calls us fools for having believed what we have been told. Yet, in the end, the book is asking us to blindly follow Quinn's ideas on the world just as blindly as we have followed our previous beliefs. While this was a good book and deserves to be read, make sure that you keep an open mind. Ishmael presents many problems and yet does not present many solutions, making me hesitant to trust the majority of what is said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not read a good book instead?","review":"I'm not going to say this book has no redeeming qualities. Underneath the faux-mystical \\"enlightenment\\" that's supposed to be going on here, there are some valid points: societies that rely on non-sustainable methods are non-sustainable (duh), and that this isn't a very compelling message (duh).The long, meandering, and usually boring path that we have to take to get to this message, and the program for saving the world offered once it is revealed, are both a waste of time. Anyone seriously interested in the topic of society and ecological collapse would be much better served reading a scholarly work or two on the topic. Anyone not seriously interested should probably just read some good fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Ishmael","review":"This book changed my life.Like a fish swimming in the ocean who takes water for granted, we can't help but take our own culture for granted. It has become invisible to us, because we live in it. This book will make it so you can see it again.

Prepare for a paradigm shift."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I EVER READ","review":"OK, I consider myself an intelligent person and I read everything with a skeptical eye. There is no other book I've read which has changed my world view as much as Ishmael. Call me idealistic, but I want to save the world and I think reading Ishmael has given me the best idea on how to go about doing it. Oh, and if you don't think the world needs to be saved I suggest reading a newspaper sometime.

A friend of mine recommended Ishmael during a conversation, so on Tuesday (8/14/01) I picked it up. I couldn't put it down! I finally finished it (while taking care of my two kids) shortly after my sons went to bed, and I haven't been the same since. Never in my life has one day changed my perception of everything. You owe it not only to yourself, but to the rest of the world - to your children and any children you know - to read this book. And don't just read it as a story, read it as OUR story. We are all looking for answers - I know I always am - and we all feel so out of place. Well, once you put down this book, if you truly let it take you inside yourself, you will know why.

This book is bad for several reasons. Let me sum them up: 1) It is not believable. The author takes huge liberties in order to make this old story sound sensational, such as his claim about a painting with a woman and a cigar, which is not true and the artist has rebuked. It is conjecture passing as nonfiction... 2) The author's premise is related to the morality of the 60's but somehow it just isn't interesting. 3) The story is old... 4) The author's narcissism is painful to read.

It succeeds. This is not the book to buy if you want a sober recitation of the facts or a thoughtful analysis of why impeachment failed; it is, however, the first place to start if you want amusing (but unsubstantiated) rumors about Clinton's sex life, and plenty of names named (whether justified or not). Occasionally, you get a few insights that may be worth something beyond sleaze value, such as Larry Flynt's role in dethroning Newt Gingrich's would-be successor, but mostly this is an unpretentious hatchet book having fun with the most mockable of recent presidents. Occasionally Eszterhas will get a little too gross for most readers (the last thing I wanted was another recounting of the cigar incident), but almost everyone will get some laughs out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"This book just rambles on and on and never seems to end.

I don't think we need to know all the sleaze- manufactured or true- when there remain topics of critical importance to be explored such as East and now West Timor, AIDS, Sri Lanka, famine and the likes. Humor is always appreciated by this reader, but not when it is at the expense of others. The author does appear to have devoted considerable effort in writing this \\"tell all\\" tale and for effort he wins 1 star- besides there is no check box for zero stars.

If you have followed the turbulent career of Eszterhas the screenwriter and wondered what kind of a book he might conjure, this is it.I was as bored as everyone else during the Lewinski scandle, but if you thought there was nothing else to say about it, you must read this. Eszterhas breaths new life into a subject that before seemed as dead as Dillinger. In his own style, part narrative, part Hollywood tell all, part essay, he shows us a new side to this, one rarely seen under all the intense media glare that surrounded the time.If you want an entertaining read that is also an interesting look back, pick this up.

How can anyone be expected to top \\"...it depends on what the definition of 'is' is\\" and \\"...about the diameter of a quarter.\\"? Of course Eszterhas does not seek to ridicule the president, he seeks to praise him...by muddying the waters with an inappropriate literary engine having the opposite effect on the reader.

Typical of a left wing zealot nothing must get in the way of supporting your left wing buddies even if they are criminals. Eszterhas supports clinton because he is one of \\"us\\" he says. He likes what Clinton has done for the country. Mr Eszterhas likes people, wants to help them, and wants to see government helping people. In other words he a a do gooding Liberal from the 60's mold. If Mr Eszterhas is so so pure, how can he support a president that bombed a foreign country because he wanted to take the heat from himself. This Eszterhas seems to gloss over.

When switching from one channel to another it takes as much as 6 seconds to complete the change. Since we're channel surfers, this is completely unacceptable and I intend to replace the set soon (after 6 months). I called Sharp about the problem and they told me it was not something that could be fixed. Many people like to surf the channels and it is absolutely impossible with this set. Be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Picture (while it lasts!)","review":"I usually don't bother writing reviews unless I find something that is exceptional. This is the rare one that happens to be exceptionally BAD.Just like several other posters, I had my Aquos for a few weeks then it died. Just the two leds flashing in some pattern. The repair man took three trips to fix it over a two week period. The warranty just expired last month and the *!#@$#%& thing is just flashing leds again.Judging from a quick Google search, If you get one that dies in the first month - exchange it - quick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful...","review":"I had assumed I was going to get my set professionally calibrated after I bought it, like I had done with my last TV. Sharp, however, has deleted the picture controls necessary for calibration, so the best picture you can possibly get by \\"knob twiddling\\" is far inferior to what can be produced by almost any other set. Sharp, of course, does not mention this in their literature, and none of the reviews that steered me towards this set in the first place mentioned it either. If you absolutely love the picture as you see it in the store, then go for it. But remember, the lighting and power conditions in your living room are not the same as in the store. The best I can do with the rudimentary controls Sharp supplies is a choice between slightly green faces and slightly pink ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a literal Memento. But it's funny, sexy and fun to watch","review":"It's hot, sexy and totally thought provoking all at once. 11:11 is like nothing you've ever seen. Brain candy and eye candy both. It's a cautionary tale for America's self-absorbed pop culture wannabes. It's everything I love and hate about TMZ on film. Beautiful cinematography. Well deserved award for Best Cinematography in a Short Film from the Boston International Film Festival. It has a great concept, interesting soundtrack and great look. It's only 20 minutes long but the DVD has a great easter egg under special features. You can watch the movie as a loop, first backwards and then forwards or just forwards. I would recommend watching it the way the director intended to exercise your right brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent holster","review":"I ordered this holster and received it at 9 Am the next morning. The quality is exceptional and fits my glock 21 perfectly. It rides high and very close to your body so great for concealed carry.

The book is poorly organized and there is little continuity or consistency in the examples.There are typographical errors as well as syntax errors in the examples. Many of the examples are fragments only -- I spent many hours trying to understand the concepts and many more hours trying to make the code work.One example: the concept of pointers is difficult enough, but there is relevant and important information regarding pointers in chapter 9 that should have been introduced in chapter 4! I had to struggle with pointers for 5 chapters, and as a result, was not able to successfully complete course assignments due to incomplete comprehension of the pointer concept.I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR!","review":"This book is extremely poor and unclear.

For one, the light output drops off way too fast. It has an impressive beam with fresh batteries, but after relatively short use, it's too dim to justify the enormous size and weight of the thing. Many lights, such as the modestly priced Surefire G2 pack just as much light output (or more) but are easily pocketable and much much lighter. Also, the smoooth plastic reflector gives it a dirty, spotty beam with noticible dark spots.Really, the only thing this light has going for is that it is a pretty indimidating body and has a definite macho appeal. But if your looking for serious illumunition look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Flashlight","review":"I bought two of theses maglight 3 D Cell flashlights to be prepared for power outages.

The LED is going to replace the bulb in all flashlights shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperweight","review":"I expected more from this light having purchased many of Streamlight's excellent products.The so-called beam is ringy and irregular and the bulbs dont last very long.Too many other modern lights available that are a quarter of the size and weight that easily out perform the Mag Instument line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"When it was first introduced the Maglight was top of the line. Now the Maglight is years behind current LED flashlight technology. The light is well made, but the adjustable beam is very poor in quality.

The two are a winning combination. You will not lose this flashlight. It will not break. It does shine 3 football fields away. You will be viewed with authority while wielding it.I keep it under the bed so that when the power goes out or there's a bump in the night, I know where to find it. It's a club and a light, exactly what you need when you hear noises in the night. Love it! Every man should want one. It weighs well over 5 lbs and it'll pack a punch if necessary. Two hands are required for a good swing. It's about the weight of a professional baseball bat with batteries installed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got to have my SIX Ds!","review":"Why buy a 4D mag, when you can get a SIX!

I used one of the old models for 30 years until a leaking battery killed the switch. They don't make a replacement switch for the \\"pre D\\" serial numbers so I had to replace it. Good price and very prompt delivery (two days from order). A great flash light and an even better defensive weapon. I never went on an alarm call without the Mag Lite and S&W 38 Special. The only change I would make might be a 44 magnum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a flashlight.","review":"I'm a little over these big maglites. Cool at first but it gets old.

It usually gets used when commercial power has failed, or a tree has fallen, or a car has decided it's not moving from the driveway or street...or when something goes bump in the night and maybe you want something in your hand that's a little more substantial than just your hand.Iconic aluminum body that stands the test of time.With all that said, the light for this flashlight is almost quaint. In fact, it is quaint, and anytime I see an an incandescent bulb with a filament in a flashlight, I have to worry about something I don't have to worry about with LEDs: the bulb burning out.Clearly there are better lighting-only choices available with current LED technology.But sometimes in the dark, you might need more than a beam of light to help ease your mind.Select as much for its mass and length as for its candlepower:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MAGLITE FLASHLIGHT IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FLASHLIGHTS I HAVE EVER OWNED,AND I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRICE OF THIS PRODUCT AND WITH THE FREE SHIPPING YOU CANT GO WRONG WHEN YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FLASHLIGHT FOR ANYONE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Fast shipping, accurate description, and fair pricing!

This is a large flashlight that is very strong and well made and I know will take years of abuse. The price could've been a little better, add the cost of 6 D batteries, and this ends up being a fairly pricey flashlight but it is a quality product for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The king of flashlights","review":"There are two kinds of flashlights: the run-o-the-mill commodity number and the Mag light. Mags are the \\"Snap On\\" tools of the flashlight world; built without compromise to become a sort of working art. They resemble a good quality camera or telescope in their construction.The four D-cell Mag is the Caddy of them all. These are incredibly bright (you'll regret looking into the business end of one). Four D-cell capacity translates into very long service on a change of batteries. And if you ever find yourself in a dark alley (which won't be THAT dark if you lug this sucker in with you), the sheer size of this flashlight will be a comfort - it's like a nightstick in length and heft. Like all the larger mags, they can store an extra bulb in the cap (included) so you're never caught unprepared.If you're the sort that's always losing flashlights, spring for a Mag - you'll like it so much that you'll surely keep track of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you want authority? You got it with this 6D","review":"Wow, this flashlight is awesome! Having it really give you another level of confident in dark places. It's not as bright as a much smaller flashlight with LED, etc. however, the 6D is there for another reason. It doesn't have the reach of a golf club but in dark environment, it's the better choice. With most Mag-Lite, the focusing feature leaves the light with dark circles in flood mode. However, the 6D is bright enough to offset that. Best of all, it's made in the US, not like some bad quality-prone made overseas. I know, I know, some overseas countries make good stuff too. But not flashlights as good as this and at an extremely good values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be far better with LED bulb","review":"About 1.5x brighter than the 2D halogen maglite. The 3D LED maglite is way brighter than either though. Would like to get a bulb replacement for this one.Battery life is only 11 hours? Since it's not a whole lot brighter than the 2D cell I was surprised by the short battery life.If you're not a security guard you'll look like one carrying this flashlight / baton. It's huge, which is probably the reason why you're buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery saver","review":"Best flashlight I've seen.

A classic Maglite product. Made from aircraft aluminum. It is really rugged that it became an issue with the LAPD for using them as a melee weapon. Wife does not want to touch it, it is heavy like a sledgehammer.Pros:-It is blinding bright.-Adjustable beam spread by twisting the head, which is also serves as the on and off switch.-Well constructed in every detail.-Water resistant-It even includes a spare lamp inside the tail cap (under the spring).-Reasonable priceCons:-Uses 4 \\"D\\" batteries that makes it so heavy and big. It is a struggle to carry it unless you need it also as a weapon.-Maglites are somewhat overrated in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Maglites are the best flashlight one could ever buy!!!

That being said this is a great flashlight for what it is. It is not a million candle power spot beam that you could get for the same weight.

Instead, take a look at some of the new LED based flashlights, or the Xenon/LED combo lights made by Streamlight (called \\"TwinTask\\").

If a battery leaks you can just trow the flashlight away, the insides are so tight the batteries get stuck forever. Their guarantee is basically useless as they'll blame the battery manufacturer. The aluminum machining makes getting the bottoms on and off difficult, easily cross threaded.My one star review is because they don't deserve their reputation.

She has very odd facial expressions and bashes people with muscular bodies, saying things like women don't look good with six-pack abs. Hmm, good to know what you think, but not helpful in my life! I do 3-4 DVDs per week, I rarely pull this one out more than once a month. I only do because it was so expensive and I figure I must be missing something!

Can't go wrong with the lost love plot, but it's nothing viewers haven't seen before.Area 88 isn't something I'm interested in watching again -- a bit boring all around, and not something that would entice me to watch again.

It is small, with just enough capacity for two or three servings, and does a fairly good job of not under/overcooking the rice. However, and this is the most disappointing aspect of the cooker and the reason it only gets two stars from me, the lid doesn't fit tightly AT ALL. As a result, even with only one cup (!!) of water in the bottom of the cooker, the rice and water boil over and bubble everywhere, creating a sticky, hot, ricy film over everything within eighteen inches' radius of the cooker. Definitely dangerous if there happen to be children exploring the counter, or if you are close and not paying attention. I have rectified it by wrapping the perimeter of the lid with wet paper towels to make a tighter seal, but I would not recommend this cooker to anyone who isn't fond of \\"fixing\\" brand-new appliances."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment","review":"I agree with the other reviews that the instructions that came with the device are incorrect with regard to the water:rice ratio. Furthermore, as noted already by others, the lid does not fit snugly and the water will bubble up and out if you have it even half full. I did find that if I presoaked the rice it would not tend to bubble over as much, but who wants to presoak the rice for 30 minutes prior to cooking? After you add in the cooking time, it would be faster just cooking it on the top of the stove. But if you do presoak the rice and don't put that much in the device, it will turn out nicely cooked rice. I'm getting rid of mine, however, and getting something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"an eye-opening experience to the joys of everyday life","review":"I had the pleasure of taking a philosphy course with James Carseat NYU, and \\"Breakfast at the Victory\\" truly captures his questfor day-to-day miracles.

However, knowing where Steven Curtis Chapman has gone from here, it is easy to see how short this falls of his potential.One constant in Chapman's career has been his thoughtful lyrics, and this album showcases them well. At this early stage, his music has some catching up to do. While he does have a catchy contemporary sound, it is far from distinctive.The first track, Faithful Too, is about two minutes too long. Consider It Done is a very obvious rip-off of Hall & Oates' You Make My Dreams. His Eyes and His Strength Is Perfect shine as examples of Chapman's true ability, both as a songwriter and a vocalist.

Hre husband, Lord Peter Wimsey, is off on one of his regular secret missions for the government, leaving her to cope alone. When a Land Army girl is murdered in the village, during air raid practice, the local bobby asks her for help as his staff have been seconded to the military, and he is aware of her experience in solving criminal matters. A nice touch of comedy is introduced by some of the more eccentric of the locals who are convinced that there are nazi spies around every corner and, for once, are proven right. It's a well woven story done by Jill Paton Walsh, using notes made by the late, great detective story writer, Dorothy L. Sayers, keeping to her same style and making her usual characters live for one last time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Presumption of Death","review":"Jill Patton Walsh's most recent attempt to add to the \\"Lord Peter Wimsey/Harriet Vane\\" collection might have been acceptable if one wasn't well acquainted with the original Dorothy Sayers works.The dialogue is awkward.

To be fair, there are some nice touches to the book. It's good to see the Bunters again, the background material on how WWII in England affected the daily life of the residents is excellent, and who can object to seeing Miss Twitterton finally married off - even if it is to an older Polish farmer.But the mystery is hardly mysterious. And the conversations between Lord and Lady Peter are painfully off key. Add a few improbable coincidences and some odd local color and the net result in not very satisfying, at least to this Sayers fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"a zombi book","review":"No wit, no sparkle, no elegance of style,thought and logic - in fact nothing that makes Dorothy Sayers books so attractive. Lord Peter and Harriet are talking in banalities! The plot is o'k but the book has nothing to do with Sayers or Lord Peter. There should be a law against creating walking dead out of some very dear literary heroes.I was reminded of a very old joke from musical world. It says that when Rossini died, his relative wrote a requiem to his memory and offered it to a director of some musical theater. The response was brilliant:\\"It is not that bad but it would have been much better if you late uncle had written a requiem to YOUR memory.\\" I am afraid I share the feeling when it comes to Jill Walsh \\"version\\" of Lord Peter.If you are a real Lord Peter fan, better stay away from that book to avoid some rather painful experience.

It is full of allusions to moments from other books, as if Walsh is trying to say \\"See? I read then and know them! Trust me, I'm a fan!\\" But Sayers hardly ever repeated herself. The book has more dialogue and less intelligent introspection and analysis than any Sayers book. The scene in which Harriet puts an exhausted Bunter to bed would NEVER happen that way; Harriet wouldn't violate the social contract. Bunter would never be that familar with Ruddle. Trapp is not likely to tolerate Ruddle. In a late scene, Bunter appears in two places at once. There is no attempt to use dialect or idiom to distinguish people from different backgrounds. Poorly written, and VERY poorly edited. Looks like a rush job. I hope she does not write another novel using Sayers' characters. It is a disservice to the fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presumption of Death","review":"I wish that Dorothy Sayers had written more Wimsey novels.

I got it as a gift from a freind of mine, and I must say, it is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line was okay, a somewhat far fetched thought of what might have been had Kenneddy lived. However, the script was juvenille and poorly acted. The scenes jumped about and were hard to follow when watching for the first time.

The closest is the woman playing Jackie Kennedy.Time travel is such a strange subject to try to guess what would happen. Personally, I see events happening or not happening on a more micro level. That even one \\"insignificant\\" soul missing can make a huge difference in the world. Think on a small level. One person can make a ripple effect on the world.

The movie is terrible, with jerky, illogical, and hard-to-follow scene changes, laughable dialogue that wasn't intended to be laughable - all intermixed between otherwise boring filmmaking. The acting is mixed as well, with most of it achieving a level of mediocrity and no higher. One of the most hilarious scenes is with the \\"man from the future\\" who wears one of the most ridiculous \\"space suits\\" I've ever seen. No lie - it looked like a piece of crap.

Its main pluses are that it is very realistic about what may have happened if JFK lived-it shows the power exerted by major players and doesn't present any sugar-coated hollywood fantasy. It does have some drawbacks to some people in that it skips around in time a bit, and is not very action-driven, but is rather plot-driven and character-driven, but i view this as a big plus.It is one of the best and most grittily realistic time travel movies that I have seen.

Charming and memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would pass next time","review":"The chapters in this book run long. I thought it would be funnier or sweeter. It does not keep me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!!!","review":"This was such an entertaining book. The narratives on the various crushes and loves in the character's life were incredibly real. She goes through so many intimate feelings about men, career, and body image that were described so well. This is a great book for women to read. It made me feel like many of my own past experiences and feelings weren't so weird. I'm definetly sharing this one with my sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh . . . the memories!","review":"What She Saw ... is a fun read that is light and humorous. Although some of the stories can go on a little too long, the majority of the book is filled with quirky anecdotes that all females can relate to starting with the fifth grade \\"coolkid\\" and working towards adulthood. Following the narrator as she tries to find meaning behind her unsuccessful love affairs reminds us of the neroses shared by women everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This and That","review":"I decided, after reading Lucinda Rosenfeld's hatchet job on Molly Jong-Fast's 'Normal Girl,' in the New York Times, to check out 'What She Saw.' Surprisingly, the books weren't all that different. Why is it everyone writes like they're from Southern California?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what I saw - I didn't like","review":"I hated this book so those in search of objective viewpoints should look elsewhere. I'm a twentysomething woman who could not \\"identify\\" with the protagonist at all. I know plenty of women for whom having a romantic relationship is important, but none my age for whom it is the only source of self-esteem. I'm tired of this Reviving Ophelia assumption all young women are bundles of insecurity, afraid to take control of their lives, and hopelessly reliant on other people to define them.Some happen to be using their talents and achieving career success rather than waiting for the phone to ring. When will we see more books about them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"This is probably the most boring book I have ever read . I could however relate with some amusement the secret thoughts of her adolesccent Psyche. I don't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a pretty involving book","review":"The first time I heard about this book was when I read an excerpt in a magazine. The excerpt was very amusing so I eventually bought the book itself. I practically couldn't put it down. The beginning started out great but there were certain points in the book that lagged for what seemed liked forever. I don't know why a couple of chapters are 2-3 pages long, when others drone on and on. The only not-so-good comment I have about this book is that there was no definite ending. Lucinda Rosenfeld's first book is a great one and I look forward to her next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty and funny!","review":"Loved Phoebe Fine, the good-girl hosebag! A fast-moving and very funny book. Smart, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, cheap, but on the small side","review":"This unit does the job but is somewhat smaller than would be ideal. It is well made with flaws or defects. This was quite inexpensive so I can't complain, and it does look nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenience is fabulous!","review":"I bought this carrier in my never-ending quest for the PERFECT baby carrier. In terms of comfort, it's OK. However, it is extremely convenient while running short errands, as it keeps my hands free. The raincoat attachment that is located inside one of the pockets was a nuisance, so I cut it out in order to free up some space. I can now carry 2 diapers, some wipes, and a small changing pad in that pocket. I can also carry my wallet and cell phone in the outer pocket. It's very handy and my daughter loves being close to me. I recommend it to people all the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pain in the neck","review":"I love the look and the function of this carrier but it hurts my neck and back. If you are in shape and muscular on top this would work great for you but if your idea of working out is chasing kids around and are carrying around a \\"few\\" extra pounds like me, you should stick to a stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"My baby was not comforatble at all. I felt like it was jabbing right through my shoulder and I couldn't wait to take it off. And though I'm not a big girl, I found it totally unflattering. My Bjorn is a million times more comfortable...and looks great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Yes, the show is great even if the sound is muddy from high-generation tapes of a radio broadcast. However, this is NOT a legal release in the US and is considered a BOOTLEG. It would be nice if the original pre-broadcast tapes could be located and released, but given PF's track record on releasing rare material, it seems unlikely.And just so you know, the songs may have titles that are unfamiliar, but that's only because they were renamed when this concept was abandoned. Google and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book meant a lot to me","review":"The thing that I like most about THE ANGELS CUP is the bond between Maggy and her late Grandmother. It reminds me so much of the wonderful relationship I had with my own maternal Grandmother. I just bought this book for my daughter for Mother's day. Reading it made me recommit myself to building that kind of bond with my own Granddaughter. This is a wonderful book that will leave you with a smile on your face. And it makes a wonderful gift for a Grandma!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recent Experience","review":"I had an interesting experience recently. Suggesting that we tour Hearst Castle as we drove from Santa Barbara north to Silicon Valley, we took that long leisurely ride up the hill to the Castle. Having read The Angel's Cup about two years earlier, I was struck by the memories evoked of the charming characters from the story. I found myself visualizing Maggie and the spirit at the pool and images of characters on the terraces and in the parlors. To my delight I found myself engaged in my own fantasy at the Castle. Although fiction, The Angel's Cup had in some obscure way carried forward to enrich my personal experience. Worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable mystery","review":"I just finished reading Angel's Cup and I found it to be a very enjoyable mystery. I picked it up after hearing it was a good book on a daytime talk show.The characters are well written and the story flows nicely. I love books like this in the wintertime; a good novel you can get lost in makes the cold days go by so much faster! All in all well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Angel's Cup","review":"This is a great mystery romance. It's so wonderfully written that you get pulled right in and won't want to put it down and can't wait to see what happens. Plus she has a style about her writing that you have no problems visualizing the scenes, the characters and just what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was fun....","review":"It was fun to watch them carry on the series. It is a little jarring from the original but all in all its not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds hot!","review":"This film is... different. The directors took a bunch of clips from several well-known silent films (Nosferatu, Dr. Caligari, The Golem, Phantom of the Opera, etc.) and re-edited them into a single narrative. It has a Monty Python-esque vibe running throughout; the story is at times a little hard to follow, and there are numerous asides that tie into the overall story. There are LOTS of jokes and sight gags, almost too many to take in in a single viewing. This film isn't for kids, as there is a fair amount of questionable content (hooray for questionable content!). I laughed out loud many times, and Nosferatu's remake into a Christopher Walken soundalike is definitely the high point of the film. This film won't be for everyone, but if you're into the \\"Kentucky Fried Movie\\" school of cinema, you should pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this film 0 stars, I would.","review":"Lame. What a horrible waste of time. I kept waiting for it to get interesting. With a film of this type, it could be really funny and clever, but it falls flat. Too much nothing. Too much stupid. Really. I love \\"Kids in the Hall\\" humor, I totally love South Park, and Monty Python is engrained in the lifestyle where I live. This film, however, is painful. It could have been good, but it totally missed the mark. Ouch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you buy...","review":"Before you buy a Kitchen Aid food processor, price the bowl replacement part online and reconsider. The handle is made of multiple plastic moving parts used to secure the top and provide safety interlock. Handle top broke after only 3 years during routine cabbage shredding. (Last food processor lasted 20+.) Best price for replacement bowl online I could find $59.95.Other problem I noted is location and design of the chute through which food is fed. Tends to allow food to clog between chute and edge of lid. Hard to clean. Again prior food processors at lesser price had no such problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kithchaid food processor gets 5 stars","review":"It is so easy to use if you have trouble with you hands. The size is right for everyday use.I have had the other big brand and find this one is so much better to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work Bowl Handle Fatal Flaw","review":"The handle of the work bowl is poorly designed and cheaply manufactured. Water gets trapped inside making it almost impossible to keep clean. Beyond that, the plastic construction cracks a falls apart. With the handle broken, you can't engage the safety release and the whole unit is worthless. Our handle cracked early on, but waited 18 months to completely fall apart. Too bad for us because the warranty is only 12 months and beyond that Kitchen Aid's only suggestion is to purchase another faulty part at $40 a pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"Perfect for what I was looking for. It came to me on time and was a flawless transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it so well, I bought a second one!","review":"I love this food processor. I read reviews on less expensive models, and decided that it would be a waste of money to buy one of them instead. I have always been impressed with KitchenAid products, so I decided to buy this brand. The processor works quietly and efficiently. The size is perfect for my small family. I have put all of the removable parts in the dishwasher for cleaning, and have had absolutely no problem with them getting perfectly clean. If I had a complaint, it would be that there are only 2 speeds....\\"on\\" and \\"pulse\\". Overall, I am very satisfied. In fact, I just purchased a second one as a gift for my mother (who in the past had a larger Cuisinart brand, but said that she likes my KitchenAid just as well!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money!!","review":"i bought this cd rom mainly for the lung sounds. i am very disappointed in this software! it contains terrible recordings of lung sounds and poor explainations. it does not even contain the correct auscultation sites, only rudimentary pictures. i was hoping for good examples of wheezing, stridor, crackles and rhonchi, but the only good recording was of the normal lung sounds. if all i needed was a good example of normal lungs, i would listen to my cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the Core","review":"I do thing over the top.

May be too hard for beginers some of the exercises at the back of the book but there are plenity in the first half of the book to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Organized, not very helpful","review":"I had high hopes for this book. The book has good pictures, which illustrate the exercises well. However, it is very unorganized, with chapters that don't go in any particular order. Additionally, the routines that are recommended are very poorly worded, and don't give specifics about time to hold a position, or how many reps/sets to do. All in all, I was very disappointed with this book. To add insult to injury, the binding fell apart, and the pages are now everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I found that this book was very hard to follow. The exercises are good to incorporate into other workouts but this book overall is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it for the Price","review":"I was really excited when I bought this book, eager to improve my core workouts. This book was a big let down. The book itself is poorly organized. The first 75 pages are complete filler, so characteristic of poorly written workout literature. To clarify, this book is lined with encyclopedic coverage of many aspects of training such as diet, weight training... basically a topical review of stuff anyone but the complete novice would already know. The workouts outlined in the book are simply listed without pictures... what gives! Furthermore in the pictured section on core exercises, the authors simply cluster core exercises together into broad sections without explaining which muscles the exercises are targeting. Finally, the models in this book are all old and ugly. I wish I could return this book.

It cleans my huge kitchen floor. BUT one day it will just die in the middle of a job. I erroneously thought it was just a couple of bad units. I think we have bought 3. They only last a couple of months. The last one has lasted for several years because it started out as my mother's unit. We have used it for about a year until it died this weekend. I won't buy another one from Shark. I will buy another steamer mopper but not SHARK. We have also had the battery charged floor sweeper and it has broken within a month. Maybe it is the company like others say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"This is an amazing steamer. It's worth getting! I highly recommend it. These are the only glitches that I could tell so far . . . . Storage is a little difficult. It is not a retracting cord and the extra pieces (the ones that don't fit in the storage compartment) are large. (Not a major problem though.) Also, it does take about 8 or so minutes to heat up. Once you start cleaning, the steam only lasts for 10 minutes or so then you have to let it heat up again to continue steaming. One container did clean A LOT OF surface area, but I did have to let it re-heat 3 or 4 times in one cleaning. Still not enough of a drawback to not get it. The cleaning job it does is superior to anything else I have tried. Overall . . . THUMBS UP!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sanitizer","review":"Absolutely the best way to clean and sanitize almost everything in your personal environment without using chemicals. There are no miracles. You still have to wipe up the dirt and germs you blast loose from surfaces. But instead of being trapped in a room full of bleach or ammonia vapors you are sanitizing with steam, getting the room very clean and have healthy sinuses as a bonus. Many helpful attachments. Easy to use. Sturdy. I have a small on also, which comes in handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic for fans","review":"I suggest for this album that you buy there other ones before this one.

I guess groups have to start somewhere. This is a somewhat half-decent album but subsequent albums showed what dc Talk was truly capable of. This album is not horrible enough to get a 1-star rating, but it isn't very good either.All the songs sound so similar, because Toby keeps on rapping the same way over and over again. And poor Kevin and Tait don't even get to do that much in this album. No wonder they started to ask for more input on the albums -- they barely have a role here except to be background vocalists.Props need to go to dc Talk for being one of Christian music's premiere rap groups, but this album is nothing to get excited over."},{"rating":"1","title":"They definitely improved.","review":"Over the years, DC Talk has improved and matured. All the songs on this CD have great lyrics, but Toby needs to let somebody else sing every once in awhile. His voice is annoying after eight songs. My favorite tracks are &#65533;Time ta Jam,&#65533; &#65533;Spinnin&#65533; Round,&#65533; and &#65533;Allelujah.&#65533; The lyrics of &#65533;Time ta Jam&#65533; are very creative. &#65533;Spinnin&#65533; Round&#65533; and &#65533;Allelujah&#65533; have good vocals by Kevin.

This was made when they got out of college, and you can hear the youngness in their voices. This is great album. They announce their faith wonderful. My favorite song is the first track Heavenbound.

Remember that first low budget demo you ever recorded? Remember how proud you were at first because you'd finally recorded something, but then when you play it for a friend you wind up explaining how much better it would be if you had better equipment, or how \\"this is just a rough demo\\", etc, etc... That's kinda how I think the Toby, Mike and Kevin all feel about this album. No shame in it (although I can't believe a record company could see DC Talk's talent somewhere in this putrid mess)...it takes guts to take that first step and make that first awful recording, and these guys are proof that working hard and developing your talent will eventually pay off. Only buy this album if you are really really curious about how these guys sounded as raw (and I mean RAW), inexperienced young musicians, and only if you can appreciate the guts in bearing your soul on tape for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"dc talk -- Supernatural!","review":"My first album of dc talks was Jesus Freak.

Tobymac, Tait, And K-max all made their first statement to the world as musicians on this pretty much forgettable album. Instead of the challenging and enduring power of their music that's found on their later releases, We instead get 8 tracks of mostly outdated and very cheesy 80s hip-hop. On this album, DC Talk sounds like a cross between Early MC Hammer, Run DMC, And Kool Moe Dee. If you must have this album, You will at least enjoy 2 tracks, Which are ''Spinnin Round'' [By far the greatest song on this album] and ''Final Days''. This is pretty much an embarrassment for DC Talk considering how far they've come in the albums that've followed this release, But hey, Everyone's got a past..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, what a joke!","review":"You can't get worse than three people trying to rap and be hardcore that are real life kittens.

It's not like no one has written about this problem yet.I'm 6'2\\" and under 200lbs. This watch suits my frame very well. The watch is proportional on a man's wrist and would probably look a little out of place if worn by a WOMAN. And yet, the WRIST STRAP is obviously sized for a WOMAN'S WRIST!I can only wear this strap on the very last notch. Curiously, the notches begin just one inch away from the bezel. This provides excellent adjustment if your wrist is the size of a child's wrist.Citizen...are you out there? Anybody home? Hello?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch for a great price.","review":"Purchased the watch last year mostly for use with jeans/casual-wear and also for use at work when I'm on-call... I love the way the watch looks and feels. I love the way the canvas belt looks, although it does still feel a little rigid in spite of having used it for several months now. The watch looks and feels sturdy and the weight seems just right on my wrist. One of the main reasons I bought it was the eco-drive feature. Haven't had any problems with charging even though I usually end up wearing it indoors a lot- seems to charge easily with whatever exposure it gets to the indoor lighting and a little bit of sunlight when I wear it outdoors. Keeps perfect time and for its price, I think its a great deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"I have always wanted a Citizen Eco Drive Chronograph.

I think substituting this feature for a 12 (or 24)hour 'stop watch' dial would be so much better, and can't see where this would adversely effect the cost of the unit.If you offer this watch with this feature, PLEASE ADVISE, and I may get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful watch!","review":"I was searching for a vintage looking budget watch and my first search was in the NIXON brand, but looking video reviews I found that NIXON watches are hugely big.

Great watch for the price.If Citizen wants some feedback on improving the watch, they could: make the date window slightly larger because it is hard to see in ceratin light and at a certain angle, replace the 24hr dial with a day of the week dial, add an alarm function, and offer the watch with white background with dark numerals."},{"rating":"2","title":"great watch, lousy watch band.","review":"The Citizen Men's Eco-drive chrono watch with a canvas band is a great watch. It's sporty but can be worn business casual with no problem. It seems to keep time well and the chronograph feature works well. BUT, the watch band is skimpy on material.

This is my first Citizen Eco-Drive and my first chronograph. I have quartz and automatic watches and was excited to own a solar-powered timepiece. I play drums in a band and needed to time our sets, but needed a watch light and small enough not to be cumbersome while playing. Other reviewers felt this watch was too big, but compared to an Invicta or Fossil chronograph (47, 50+ mm), this is conveniently sized. I do agree with the criticisms of the length, color, and texture of the band, but it is easily removable. I also agree that the minute counter subdial is difficult to read, given the size of the dial. However, I generally don't need to use the stopwatch, so this is a small concern. I love the look of the watch, but will probably switch to a leather band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Watch, Straight Forward, Nothing Fancy","review":"I bought this watch because I was looking for a Citizen watch that had Eco-Drive but I didn't want to spend a lot of money. It is a very straight forward, military-inspired design, reminding me of something G.I. Joe might wear. :) The Eco-Drive works great and it is a fairly light-weight watch. As other reviewers have noted, the band is a bit flimsy but the watch itself is solid quality. I particularly enjoy the large, clear numbers. Some analog watches can be a pain to pick out the hands from the mess going on around them but not with this watch.

After I switched the strap, I felt the watch looked really good, and was a good alternative to the timex they sold at jcrew, which cost significantly more. I was able to wear the watch for 2 weeks, and I really enjoyed it. However, the only problem with the watch is that the crystal is really cheap. One day at dinner, a friend accidentally banged a mug lightly against the crystal. The crystal shattered, and I brought it into various shops to try to get it repaired. All shops quoted me repair costs of $300+, and Citizen said it was not covered by warranty. Thus, 2 weeks with the watch, it broke, and became unusable.DO NOT BUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real chronograph","review":"Minuses:It measures only seconds,and minutes; not tenths of seconds.The design is very simple, the dial is not sophisticated, just a classic, military design.The red indicator is too thin to be easily seen.

It holds a charge a lot longer, so it's not a problem to leave it unworn for a day or two. I didn't like the green military style band on this one, but it was easy to swap for a leather 20mm band. The stock band was a tad small for my wrist. I would expect a lot of men would need to swap it. The numbers look big in the picture, and they're big on the watch. I like the big numbers, others might not.May 2008 Update:I still like this watch as much as the day it arrived! It works perfectly, never runs out of battery and looks good. For those of you who haven't paid for a decent watch, you might not realize you're missing out on a good quality glass / crystal face. Mine still is scratch free.

I am wearing the watch in a deployed location. It looks great with ABU's, BDU's, DCU's, (USAF uniforms)etc. It keeps good time. It's really inexpensive and Amazon will ship to most APO's. I recieved it (in the desert) in about 9 days. Only possible problem is the band.

If you have small wrists then this strap may work for you. Otherwise you'll need to replace it. A 20mm strap from ebay fit perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was really excited when I received this watch as a gift from my wife. The style is exactly what I was looking for, and the Eco-Drive is great. I have to admit though, after only two weeks of use, I am fairly disappointed. I replaced the strap almost immediately, which I found to be very stiff and uncomfortable. Also, the chronograph controls feel \\"sticky\\" and cheap. I can only describe the button feel as rough. Finally, my biggest problem with this watch is the face. After 2 weeks, there are scratches all over it. The crystal is unacceptable for a watch with a list price over $200.00. I really wanted to love this watch, but the quality is below acceptable, so I had to give 2 stars.Citizen Men's AT0200-05E Eco-Drive Chronograph Canvas Watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch.","review":"Well I have been wearing this watch for about a month now and I'm very happy with it. I was a little worried about the band but it is actually very nice. Well constructed and its comfortable. Face is easy to read but the date window is a waste of time. I have good vision and I can't read it. That's the only reason I did not give this watch 5 stars. The fact that its solar powered is nice also. No changing batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly built, accurate wristwatch","review":"I love this product. I bought the lesser expensive model (without a chronograph) several years ago, and finally bought this one because it just looks so nice. It's great. I get compliments on it frequently. It's certainly not something I'd wear with a suit, but it's perfect for wearing around the house. I wear the other model for working around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good watch","review":"I've had this watch for a few months now. It's attractive, rugged, and keeps good time. Drawbacks are that the band is crazy-short. Nowhere near long enough for a grown man. I replaced it with a maratac NATO strap, and have been happy with that. The chronograph sweep hand does not index well with the second markers, and the three small dials are too small to read easily. Still, it's a good watch and I'm happy I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I have had this watch for several months now. I am very happy with it. It is handsome, practical, and tough. I have banged it into many things, car doors, railings, walls, etc, and there is NO scratching on the crystal whatsoever, and the hairline scratching on the steal case is only visible if you know what you are looking for. The glow in the dark elements are just bright enough to read in the dark, and last a long time. Believe what many other reviewers say, the stock band is very, very small. I have small wrists and it only fit me on the second to last hole. I quickly replaced the band with a black leather one (around $20), and now it works great. It is casual enough for daily use, but also looks great when the occasion calls for something more dressy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming more of a fan of citizen","review":"After owning the Citizen Nighthawk (which I highly recommend) for the past few years and seeing how durable it is, I wanted to get another Citizen Eco-drive watch. The Nighthawk is still running and, despite some minor scratches, is still a fantastic watch.The AT0200 Canvas is a great addition to my growing watch collection. The canvas strap is casual but if I ever need something fancier, I'll just get a new strap. The only reason why I rate it a four is the display could be a little bigger but I biased towards large watch displays like the Nighthawk.I definitely recommend this watch for anyone who wants a great looking watch for a great price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"Awesome watch. Strap is too military like, but if the exact same strap was black, it would be perfect 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second citizen eco-drive watch, second failure.","review":"This watch failed to hold a charge after about 2 months, if that. I left it out to charge in direct sunlight and it would , on a good day, work for a few more hours. I returned it to the factory under warranty,ALONG WITH MY OTHER ECO-DRIVE watch that STOPPED WORKING and they sent it back to me \\"FIXED\\" and the same thing happened after one WEEK. I left it out in the sunlight and to my astonishment it worked for about half an hour before dying on me again. Upon leaving it out for almost my entire work day I forgot about it and someone stole it. End of story, never buying another citizen (piece of crap) watch again. My original eco-drive has begun working again but I wouldnt reccomend these watches to anyone who wants a working timekeeper. Not a bad bracelet though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Functional Chronograph","review":"This watch, like most if not all chronograph models offered by Citizen, is more designed for style than function. The 60 minute dial at 10:00 is too small to adequately time anything over a minute and the hand moves in a sweep rather than clicking fashion, which further confuses the user. I'm surprised that Citizen even put his series on the market. Check out the two Swiss Army watch companies and you'll notice they have a 30 minute dial and the hand clicks from one minute to the next. If you want an Eco-Drive watch save the money and get the plain watch, if you want a chronograph buy another brand. I have used chronographs for work, recreation, and pleasure for over 20 years and have used several brands and this one is by far the hardest to read and consequently in my opinion is not functional when accurately timing an event is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Watch, but fragile","review":"Amending my review to reflect reality. This watch works as promised and is great as a chronometer. But I dropped it from about chest level and not only did the dial crack and chip, the watch hands got jammed with one another such that the watch didn't run.So its a decent watch, but you have to be careful with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ayden's toy","review":"This product viewing window is too small.

The chest plate, shin guards, and cod piece are all made out of flimsy foam and were completely bent out of shape from the way they were packaged. I thought they would at least be cheap solid plastic. I ended up hacking/modifying this costume with other accessories that I've bought and personally fabricated to make it slightly usable.Another design flaw is the sizing. The belt seems to be made for someone with a 60\\" waist while the suit itself is so tight I felt like I was getting a wedgie the whole time I wore it.The only higher quality suit i can find is the $800 version.

I ordered the Deluxe Darth Vader - Standard - Chest Size 36-40, and I received a regular Darth Vader costume. I will say that the price was surprisingly low compared to the other \\"Deluxe\\" costumes, which is why I bought it, but little did I know, it wasn't even the costume I wanted, and nor did it match the picture... In addition some of the product that did come, came ripped, and torn! I'm very dissatisfied, and annoyed that I had to settle with this incorrectly labeled product for my costume, since it was not what I ordered.

There were a few interesting tidbits, but generally I felt this book was boring, uninformative and often strayed from the topic. Chapter 7 alone was spent taking a swipe at a portion of the population and nothing to do with a dead body. When reading this I could tell that Roach reads a lot of Bill Bryson. Unfortunately, she was unable to come close his humor. One smile from me while reading this would have earned her an extra star."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"I decided to read this book becasue of its acclaim and an ongoing interest in death/afterlife situations. Like very few of the other reviewers I found this book to not be very funny and even had trouble understanding some of the humor. Some of the chapters were very interesting, while others I felt I was dragging myself through them. All in all, if you are interested in a subject addressed by Roach in this book I would recommmend finding a better source, i.e. if you want to know about \\"The BOdy Farm\\" read Bass' Death's Acre. I think any interested reader would be happy reading the entire book than Roach's chapter on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective prints","review":"I ordered this item for my child. The first book arrived was the front cover was not aligned with inside pages. I claimed and requested replacement. The second book I received had the same problem. I tried to request replacment on internet, but the system did not accept the action. I tried to understand the fact the unalignment might be a part of design, which was still hard to believe. I borrowed the same book from the library, and the front cover aligns the front cover. I could not find other way to complain about the problem that amazon sent the defective prints twice and closed a channel to complain except here. I am dissapointed about their customer care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose the flippant descriptions of animal experimentation","review":"A friend lent me Stiff, and I had high hopes for it since she said it was so clever and interesting, and usually our tastes run very much in tandem. I was really turned off by the (I felt) gratuitous descriptions of how animals were used in experimentation. I don't know if I would have found her treatment of the subject matter disrespectful regardless, but that certainly cast things in a negative tone for me, and I ended up unable to finish it because I was so disturbed. The subject matter was interesting, I just didn't find her humor funny enough to distract me from the disrespect."},{"rating":"1","title":"STIFF writing","review":"This book started out with a bang and by midway had dragged itself out to a barely audible wimper. The subject matter is very interesting but the execution is tedious, with the morgue humor sprinkled throughout more groan worthy than chuckle inducing. Overall, this book was long and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable resources","review":"I bought this book and was amazed at the sort of historical things described. And so, like any enthusiast, I did research. And very sadly I discovered that a good deal of the historical background does not exist. I mention especially the description of \\"Mellification\\" in Chapter 10. The author didn't make any of it up herself, but simply used many poor and unreliable sources as her basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only slightly entertaining/informative","review":"While the idea of this book is quite a hook, the contents and writing style are mediocre at best. Maybe a long article for a magazine like People, but the book is another one of those with lots of filler, lots of space between lines and virtually no meaningful content. I definitely would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks worse than a 30 day old cadaver!!!","review":"In years past, I have read Mary Roach in Readers Digest and found her pretty funny!! I did not find anything she wrote in this book to be funny. In this book, she writes like an adolescent boy who is determined to shock his adolescent friends at every turn of the page. If I could take away her computer until she grows up, I believe that would be a fitting punishment. The best I can do for this book is to put it in the recycle bin and hope the paper will be used for a better cause in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Cut Off Heads!","review":"Good idea, but a bit draggy and long-winded.

I zoomed through it faster than fiction. And boy was I the highlight of several cocktail parties, as I tossed out descriptions of going through a windshield. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"no longer in the dark about the dead","review":"I enjoyed this book. The irreverent, offbeat writing keeps the book moving, and prevents stray tangents into maudlin. It brought back memories of gross anatomy lab. I vividly remember being told I had to pull the lungs out of the chest, because I had the smallest hands. I still have memories of holding the lungs as fluid that looked and felt like, but sure didn't smell like barbeque sauce dripped over my hands and into my gloves. I bet, to Mary Roach, this would just be another foray into getting closer to the recently departed, and nothing to think twice about, other than worrying about prions; I hope that will be covered in another book she'll write, I'll at least be worried and laughing! GREAT book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating read","review":"I actually learned a lot more than I ever thought I would like to about the lives of corpses.

The author's sense of humor makes this book very pleasant to read... And the life after death of these dead people is much more thrilling than what I expected!!! I never considered donating my body to the science before, but now I realize that I can do so many interesting things after I'm dead... It's worth a second guess, isn't it? ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Death. It doesn't have to be boring.\\"","review":"Did you know?1) That necrophilia was not a crime in the United States until 1965.2) In twelfth-century Arabia, men volunteered to eat nothing but honey until they died (about a month). Then their body would be placed in a stone coffin full of honey and there the body would macerate for 100 years. Then the seals are broken and the remains used for medicine, some of it taken internally.3) In the 1950's Vladimir Demikhov performed many head transplants on dogs. One dog lived for 29 days with two heads.Well if you found any of those facts interesting then you should do yourself a favor and check out Mary Roach's \\"Stiff\\". The same subject matter in a lesser writer's hands would have come off boring and well stiff, kinda like a textbook, but luckily for us readers with short attention spans Mary's writing is engaging and a lot of fun to read.Highly recommended for the morbidly curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting - But make sure you have a strong stomach","review":"I found this book really interesting. Roach's sense of humor is evident throughout. The beginning started out really strong, but towards the end started drifting. I have a strong stomach, but I started finding some things (especially the live animal testing) very disturbing. Very interesting facts, but more gruesome than the average person could handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"FACINATINGLY FUNNY!","review":"Roach is a phenominal writer. She kept me interested with an off-beat subject that I found humerous and facinating. I recommend it highly!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not for the faint of heart","review":"Stiff is a very funny, well researched and well written examination of a really gross subject. Like a car accident on the freeway, the content is repulsive, but you can't help looking at it anyway. A very good read, if your stomach is strong enough to avoid vommiting between chapters. Do not read this book one hour before or after eating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out-loud funny?","review":"Yep. Mary Roach's writing style is wonderful. Anyone who has ever considered donating their remains after death should read this book. Ms. Roach maintains respect for the \\"stars\\" of her book and gets her laughs at the expense of the living. This is an incredibly unique read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly comforting","review":"Being unconvinced of an afterlife, at least of the harps and mansions variety, I find death pretty unnerving. The only time I ever felt positive about the coming end was while reading Mary Roach's wonderful book. Humorous and conversational, yet NEVER disrespectful or flippant, Stiff is a wonderful journey through a topic we may rather not think about, but all wonder about. Fascinating, heart-warming, informative and reassuring are not adjectives you would expect to apply to a book about death, but they all apply to Stiff.....can't recommend this enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned a bit, that's all I ask.","review":"Several reviewers commented on author Mary Roach's humor, either for or against. I am neutral.The information was sometime distressing, especially in her chapter about the decompostion of cadavers. I had wanted to donate my body to science, but maybe not that kind of science. (Seems kind of lonely, even for something dead.)STIFF is a worthwhile read. Try it, you'll learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Read than Expected","review":"This book was amazing. Mary Roach's knowledge mixed with humor make this book interesting. I couldn't put it down after I started reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read of corpse!","review":"Ever wondered what happens after you're gone? Just what donating your body to science really means? Ms. Roach presents the facts in a very entertaining *and yes tasteful* narrative.The author's tongue in cheek sense of humor shows throughout the book & she is a wonderful guide into the \\"life\\" of cadavers in their various roles as teachers and test subjects.I will be the first to say that 'Stiff' is not for everyone, but if you like science/natural history reads or are just intrigued by all things medical then this is a book for you. Passing it by would be a grave mistake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I died laughing!","review":"This book was not only informative - I learned a great deal, but it had me smiling and laughing all the way through. A terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll die laughing!","review":"This is, undeniably, one of the funniest, most fascinating books I've ever read.

It is cleverly written, with a blend of humor and science that makes it a quick yet educating read. Roach has a way of presenting the subject without sounding like a college lecture, and is very respectful to the dead. I was highly impressed, and my friends are all waiting to brrow the book from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing to Death","review":"This book is a rare gem: it informs, it challenges the way we think about death, and it is just plain funny. Mary Roach does what an author about death should do: she removes the wall between the living and the dead and she encourages us to accept the inevitable. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny as well as informative.","review":"After reading a review of the book in People, I thought, \\"This book should be right up my alley!\\" If you skip the contents and just read, you will probably find, as I did, that every chapter contains another topic you may have been curious about but have never researched. A little morbid surprise in each chapter! ;) I will still fly in an airplane even after reading the investigation into a crash. (You know you've wondered about such things too!) Death doesn't seem as scary anymore.... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative. Disturbing. Charming.","review":"The title is a good litmus test to weed out the weak stomachs out there, but it is merely a hint of what the book uncovers. Overall it is an informative, interesting look at a subject most people completely avoid. I was thrilled that Roach was able to successfully mix humor with the ugly truth, and still come across as respectful and somewhat sensitive. On the other hand, I did find the parts containing animal abuse/cruely inflicted on live animals hard to get through. Unlike most of the human subjects in the book, the animals never had the opportunity to make the choice on the fate of their bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny and interesting take on a morbid subject","review":"When you tell people that you're reading a book about cadavers, it may lead to some raised eyebrows...but man, it's worth it.

She manages to be humorous and yet respectful of the dead at the same time. Really funny, easyreading and informative all in one, which is no easy feat. I never felt grossed out. For example, I have been to the Koerperwelten (Body Worlds) exhibit she mentions in her book, and I felt really uncomfortable, but her descriptions never bothered me. The one issue I had was similar to what another reviewer mentioned, the references to animal experiments. Although I am not an extreme animal rights person, the references just bothered me, but hey, she can't please everybody all the time. She mentions writing for [...], so I look forward to reading more of her books and articles."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fun fun","review":"this is an awesome book i had alot of fun reading it, and even more fun talking about it at work. thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"Thought provoking and interestingly morbid, Stiff will have you contemplating the destiny of your own body after life.I'm a huge fan of shows such as CSI and Fringe where you get to cross that line (just a little) between healthy curiosity and morbid fascination when it comes to death, how the body responds and what happens during the after.Stiff takes a look at at what happens to us after death occurs. It was amazing to me how many different ways our bodies can help others after they are no longer good to us. From organ donation to scientific research to compost, Roach approaches this morbid subject with humor and backs up her work with extensive research. She gives us insider information and a behind the scenes look at how our organs are harvested, how bodies are prepared for burial, embalming and cremation, and what options we may have as a stiff in the future.An excellent and informative book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual book, to say the least","review":"Not for the squeamish. Well written, informative, macabre humor with a political twist and more than you ever wanted or needed to know about the fate of human remains. The author walks on grounds soaked with the fluids of human decay, visits funeral parlors to learn the tricks of the trade, and travels to China in search of cannibalism.

I did want to keep it down, after all.I just wanted to comment on the Audio Book reader: very good choice. She handles the dry humor well, with the right intonation and inflection. I good story can be ruined by a bad reader, and Shelly Frasier is excellent.If you are in the habit of listening to books on the drive home, get this one for sure. Your drive will go quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I am absolutely terrified of dead bodies. I have been since I was a little girl and my grandfather died and I couldn't make myself go seem him to say goodbye. That being said, I have a facination with death, no matter how much it scares me, I want to know more about it. This book is what ignited my facination with it. I would avoid anything having to do with death, and I read \\"Stiff\\" and it made it not only less scary, but absolutely facinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat morbid..but entertaining","review":"This book to me is like a car wreck, you want to look away but you find yourself looking closer. I don't know for sure what I expected, but I do feel like it lived up to or maybe even exceeded my expectations. I found myself not wanting to read, yet I couldn't put it down. I have questioned why that is. I think because on some level we all have a fear of death. To look in in the eye through this book can be somewhat scary, yet sometimes quite comedic. I believe that most people will find this book repulsive..but will find themselves being drawn in and mesmerized at the same time. It is very well written with, what I consider to be, laughable lines here and there thrown in by the author in order to break some of the tension. I have to admit that I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"why do we do this?","review":"tThis is a most detailed book on how we treat bodies.

I laughed out loud and kept on laughing. Not to give anything away, but the whole Rice Krispies & chicken soup thing out of chapter 3 was a scream. I did not know non-fiction could be so entertaining. It's not often that a book inspires me to read aloud to my roommate (who probably wishes I wouldn't), but this one did. I can't give it enough praise. Way to go Mary!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, Funny, Fearless","review":"I thought this book might be too morbid or gross for my fairly delicate sensibilities. It is neither. Roach is funny but never at the expense of her subjects or topic. This is a smart ride through a world that we fear to look at. She proves there is no subject so grave that it can't be disarmed with a little humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn....","review":"This book's title suggests an interesting read, but I promise if you know anything about forensic pathology, this book is incredibly boring. If you watch TV shows like CSI and think you know about forensic pathology, you probably would like this book. I work in a forensic pathology department and I found this book hard to read, as the author veers off topic quite a bit. I found myself skipping entire sections (especially when she goes into talking about ballistics gel for what seemed like eternity). If you have a higher level of education, I recommend reading some of the books she uses in her bibilography. I found this book was written for someone who knew absolutely nothing about decendents. I recommend reading Death's Acre if you would like a more professional description. Most of the material in Stiff is general knowledge to people who have a background in pathology and anatomy. I found this book quite dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gory for shock value...","review":"I started this book when it was chosen for my book club. I tried to keep an open mind, however after the first two chapters, I could not convince myself to pick it back up.I found that while some of the historical context information behind the use of cadavers for medical training was interesting, some of the imagery she used was gory beyond what was needed to make her point-- perhaps looking for shock value.My only comment upon reading the opening of the book was... why continue? For those with an honest interest in this topic it may be a fine overview, but I found her mix of humor with explicit detail less than a good match, and her level of detail disturbing and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Me to Death","review":"I had been dieing to read this one, but the subject turned out to be too grave for my tastes.

BIG disappointment.While the subject matter is interesting and well-researched, the writing style has made it almost impossible for me to drag myself through this book. I'm giving up half way through after deciding that I just can't face another day of \\"one page at a time\\" drudgery.Aside from the occasional quip or aside this book is written in the short, choppy, dull, dry style of the dreaded textbook. Even some of the most intriguing topics have been rendered lifeless.

I would not waste time reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Title!","review":"The title tells it all........you will be bored STIFF! Not very entertaining and little information that you haven't already seen on the History Channel. I had looked forward to this book and was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not THAT funny","review":"Overall did not think the book was funny. A few cute one liners but not much else. Was fairly well researched, but do you really want to know this stuff,even for a laugh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Death is something we all must face and knowing what happens to your body afterward is what this book is all about. Some of it is gruesome, but this is an informative and fascinating look at death. The author's sense of humor mekes death and what happens to dead bodies entertaining. If you don't have a strong stomach, you may not want to read about the \\"Body Farm\\" over lunch as I did, but be sure to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death and Corpses","review":"Stiff is a totally fun book that gives the science and odder than odd facts about death and corpses (sounds like an HBO series). Even if you don't like the book it's worth buying just to leave on your coffee table. Quite the conversation starter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stiff","review":"Yep, it's about the many uses for cadavers. Written with all the wit, respect, and information that all the reviewers claim it is. I love it.(And don't you love a short review? Hey, I figure you'll click the link if you're interested, and I can't tell you anything it doesn't.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"gross!!!... cool...","review":"It's kinda hard to say this is a recommendation for people to read, it's GROSS, unsettling and repulsive. Yet, I enjoyed this book. The humor is... off, but I laughed, a lot more than maybe I should have, but it was funny. It's certainly researched, it's informative, we all will suffer from it, so why not read about it. I've read horror books and true crime and other genres, but this is the only book that I read that made my shudder, but then, afterwards, wow, that's interesting. I had to read it for the \\"see how much I can take\\" kinda thing, but the humor off set it enough to be ok. Not that I'm overly squimish, but still, with things likee 30 heads on trays was kinda unsettling"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Six It","review":"Given that I'm a medical examiner, so maybe it's me, but I have to say that I didn't enjoy this book. I'd bought it for a friend after seeing it on a re-run of Six Feet Under. The author's descriptions seem stilted to me and she never got close to her subject nor did she seem to bother to delve beyond the surface. I kept waiting for the much touted hilarity and it never came (and trust me, morgue rats are a jokey bunch).In addition, Roach seemed to have some kind of running feud with Catholics which kept surfacing inexplicably--maybe she could save that for another overwhelmingly hilarious book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different look at death","review":"I had always avoided the subject of death, my main motive being that I don't want to think about my beloved ones dying, but this book made me think differently. Although Roach's and my sense of humour are different, I appreciate the fact that she tackled the subject in a light-hearted way. In fact, I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. I can be squeamish, but I had no problems reading this book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked \\"Stiff\\"","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Stiff\\". It was recommended by a friend and is a \\"must read\\" as far as I am concerned. Humorous, tasteful and well-researched all apply this epic. Just don't try to make this one into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time.","review":"I had no idea the dead were so useful! This one is full of information, gore and humor. You should pick it up; it is a quick read and it will make you look at the world a little differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff","review":"I thought this book would interst me as I am donating my body after death. What it did was to make me wonder if I really want to do this. Some of the graphic details of cadavers was too much as was the history of what has been done with bodies.I hardly ever quit reading a book, but I did with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"She sees dead people","review":"The author lends a great sense of humanity and humor to what could be a distasteful, or depressing, subject. This book also contains some great reporting and journalistic writing. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the composting chapter is the weakest part of the book. The rest of it is a real page-turner.After I read this book, I realized it had lessened my fears surrounding death and dying. Once one understands the biological processes surrounding death, there is a lot less to be scared of. The book's upbeat and optimistic tone helps and I think it will encourage a lot more people to be organ donors. This book also made me infinitely glad that surgeons practice on cadavers before taking the scalpel to me!I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Patricia Cornwell books or TV shows like CSI. Overall, a very educational piece of nonfiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious Indeed","review":"In \\"Stiff\\" Mary Roach achieves the delicate balance between the ghoulish macabre and the fate that awaits us all while never losing her sense of honest curiosity, reverence, and gallows humor throughout.This book was highly recommended to me and I was initially skeptical as to whether it was worthy of all of the high praise. I needn't have worried. The book is both educational and fun, yes fun. Of course I'd heard of body snatchers, but had no idea that they referred to themselves as 'resurrectionists'. Guess I know who Karl Rove was spinning for in the 18th Century, yes?I believe that anyone with an interest in life, death, and especially the genesis for so many tales of horror and the like should do themselves a favor and pick up a copy of this book, draw the curtains, pour a 'stiff' drink and turn the page. Oh, and you might want to light a candle and turn that bust of Poe toward the wall...at least for a day or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers","review":"Excellent book . . . I would have liked her to have vocused MORE on her personal experiences (which was humerous and informative). Used \\"to muchtime\\" on explanations of the history of the feild . . . Which lost myinterest at several points in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterically Informative","review":"I laughed out loud more times than I can remember. This was a quick read with a deffinate quirky style of humor. I would love to see another volume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"life after death never sounded so good...","review":"Salon columnist Mary Roach describes cadavers as \\"superheroes\\" and goes on to explain why in this fascinating look at life after death. She treats her subjects with tact and care, but is refreshingly unsentimental in disscussing their many uses. You'll be able to unnerve your dinner guests for years to come with the anecdotes you take from here. Covering everything from recycling programs to the supposed weight of the human soul, this book is a charming read... just try to ignore the odd looks you may get from anyone who sees you with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and still informative","review":"Interesting read with abundant facts. Writing is engaging and entertaining without being mundane or macabre.A truly fascinating account of the author's delve into our bodies post-mortem.The jokes are tasteful. The facts are informative. The voice of the book is light and playful.I would certainly recommend this read to others who are looking for a book that falls outside the norm."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"This is a throughly engaging book. I couldn't put it down! I read the book cover to cover in a day and was wanting more! Mary Roach is a wonderful writer. She is able to clearly talk about what does happen to a person after death, in a way that anyone can understand. The book was funny, insightful, and educational.Excellent read, you will find yourself bringing up information from the book in conversation more often than you might like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Read!","review":"This really is a thought provoking read! As Mary Roach relates experience after experience with the dead, I am left with a different feeling about the \\"life\\" of my body after I'm done with it. Her experiences are written in an interesting and often humorous manner. After reading only half the book, I'm thinking I might want to leave my remains to science. The idea of a plastic surgeon practicing on me is somewhat appealing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about corpses: an aquired taste.","review":"I fully enjoyed this book. Everybody dies, the things she describes in this book (the stages of rotting) will one day happen to me and you. It's absolutely captivating, shocking, and she writes with a quirky scenes of humor. It isn't too dark or depressing, but it's honest and real. You'll learn things you never knew about the exciting life of the human corpse."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, yet touching","review":"i've only read two chapters of this book, yet it has gotten my interest so much, i'm sure i'll finish it tonight.in the first chapter, i was grinning and laughing out loud at Mary's slightly sarcastic humour; then, in the second chapter, my eyes filled with tears as she described the students who benefit from donated cadavers as they held services for their cadavers and even read poetry for them.to those of you who have been shocked and appalled by this book, you must not've read past a few pages. Mary treats the subject with respect and laughter. she does not make fun. have you never heard \\"laughing WITH you, not AT you\\"? i would like to think that the souls who were thoughtful enough to give their bodies up, not only for the betterment of the medical profession, but for others to benefit from their donated organs, are looking over the readers' shoulders as we enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Humorous","review":"I was not expecting this book to be as entertaining as it was informative. Mary Roach combines fascinating details with both humor and empathy. It may seem an odd combination, but it works. She explores many facets of dead bodies from autopsies to forensics and more.Roach not only shares what she has learned through her research, but her personal insights and perspective as she explores the many facets of dead bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!","review":"\\"Stiff\\" by Mary Roach was an awesome read. What an interesting subject to write about. This book was truly fascinating and it covered a topic I think a lot of people are curious about: What becomes of our bodies once we died. I didn't realize there were so many rituals and options available once we pass away.Mary Roach's style of writing is so smart and witty. I like being able to learn and laugh at the same time. She has a terrific sense of humour that is appropriate for the subject matter. She's apparently written other books, which I plan to check out. I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious about what happens to dead bodies or to anyone who just wants something interesting and entertaining to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too awesome","review":"I got this as a book on tape during a road trip and was fascinated the entire time. From mummies to science cadavers, she covers it all. A really interesting subject anyway, and then she asks great questions and goes further than I would think to. Wonderful wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"death can be fun","review":"I bought this book a while ago at a used book sale, thinking it was the type of read I'd want to explore, but would never get around to. I spotted a friend reading it who shrugged and said \\"yeah\\" when I asked her if it was any good. Not a rave review, but pushed my curiosity into actually pursuing the text myself.I'm glad I foraged through my piles of to-reads to find it, because it is enjoyable and educational. Some chapter/essays are more attention-grabbing than others, such as Holy Cadaver and Eat Me, which makes the over-all read choppy. But the life of cadavers is full of humor and life-living insights. A worthwhile endeavor for anyone who's curious about what's going on under their skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and Insightful","review":"I was curious when I first read the title of this book in a local book store. I'm very interested in forensics and death. Stiff was great and I learned so much from it. I could barely put it down. My son even loved it. I was amazed how Roach mixed humor with the subject of death and never was disrespectful. At times I felt like I was listening to a close friend telling me about her extremely exciting day. Five stars for a fantastic book and author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I read this book while my wife was napping and she woke up from me laughing so much. It's not that death is an especially comedic occurrence, but Roach's often wry commentary, in the form of footnotes to her text are funny observations on the circumlocutions we humans have surrounding death.A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"Though I think by most standards I took a bit longer to finish the book, I did finish it within about 5 days reading a few hours a night. If you're fascinated by the morbid and unsettling draw of forensics, this is the book to read. I have to say, after reading \\"Stiff\\", I now have a different view of what death ultimately holds for us all. It doesn't have to be the end. The book itself is very easy to read and is quite enthralling - to the point that I lost sleep those 5 nights I was reading it.I gave it 4 stars mainly because there were sections in the book that were a bit dry and slow, but I tend to enjoy the more morbid details when it comes to this topic. Regardless, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff","review":"This book becomes boring after awhile. It is interesting but not for the faint hearted or anyone who has nightmares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"Why read: I loved Roach's other novel, Bonk.What impressed me: Roach really researches the hell out of her subjects, always shocking readers with the depth of information she comes up with. Stiff is no different, informing of every conceivable aspect of the body after death, peppered with sick moments, funny moments and more often a combination of the two.What disappointed me: There was a little more of a historical aspect to Stiff than I would have been interested in, but given the subject matter there really is only so much you can learn about today without taking a good long look at history.Recommended: Yes. While cadavers weren't as entertaining to me as sex, this was still an amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"necessary reading","review":"what an absolute marvel this book is.horrible, wonderful, hilarious and informative. most importantly it gets us acquainted with an uncomfortable reality in as light a way as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appealing, for a book about death","review":"What happens when you die? Literally - to your body. What if your plane blows up and your body falls to the ground. What. Literally. Happens. To. It.Hope you have the stomach to read all about it.This book is funny and appealing, for a book about death!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than you knew you wanted to know","review":"This book is both funny and fascinating. As someone who works in the medical field and has been at cadaver labs, I am maybe not as squeamish as other people. But even those people who are will find the stories of head-transplant studies and accident reconstruction more interesting than \\"gross\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left much to be desired.","review":"My book club chose this book and I was intrigued. It sounded like an interesting read, and certainly a topic about which I knew little. And while the book delivered on the interesting, Roach decided to waylay an appropriate tackling of the subject with numerous asides, jokes and puns, all of which were grating and many of which were groan-inducing. Additionally, any insight into her journalistic integrity made me embarrassed for her, as she seemed most interested in probing her subjects for pedestrian or off topic information. After finishing the book, I learned that some of her facts were wrong, which isn't surprising, as she constantly mentions simply \\"skimming\\" academic articles or even being distracted by more sensational information. While it held my interest, I wouldn't recommend this book, and feel there are probably better works on the subject for anyone looking to find out about the world of cadavers and the death industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unprofessional!","review":"This book has so many spelling errors, It forgets to list a lot of information, bad pictures, not organized! I hated it so much, I returned it! Don't but Bond fans! Buy a DVD, not this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Facts were not Researched Enough","review":"Although impressive in scope, this is not the first time an author has attempted an A-Z listing of all things \\"Bondian.\\" Although the authors do score with some interesting compilations, such as number of men Bond's killed per movie, or a concise summary of the movie and book locations, time is also spent rehashing movie and book plots, several of which were laden with errors which makes one wonder if they watched the movie or just wrote the book from memory. Overall, not an impressive volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's . . . really bad","review":"I'm a fan of Christina Ricci and dark comedies, yet I found this film damn near unwatchable. The only things intriguing about it are why the actors agreed to do it, why it was made, and why, after the backers presumably saw the finished product, it was released. The film itself gets no stars; my one star is for Ricci's presence.For Ricci completists only, and then I recommend it be viewed with the sound off so that no one need listen to the dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT NOIR.","review":"This is a light humorous romance movie. It is obviously not meant to be taken seriously. Yes, the plot is weak and the script could have been better but it is still an entertaining little film."},{"rating":"1","title":"So funny...but it's not supposed to be.","review":"The owner of the local video store gave us this movie. We had low expectations but would never have guessed this film would be so unintentionally hilarious. This is because this film has an the intoxicating mixture of being a toilet of a script AND it takes itself so seriously. As the lines escape the actor's mouths, my wife and I would fall off of the couch laughing while we begged them (in vain) to stop.File under \\"gin movie\\" ie: a film that one watches with no expectation of quality - on the contrary, the perceived poor quality requires imbibing in alcoholic beverages before hand in order to laugh the terrible experience off (and to loosen the lips so that peanut gallery comments can flow freely). If Mystery Science Theater 3000 should ever look to include relatively modern films, this would be a strong contender (not to mention a rich vein for comedy).I don't know how any of the participants could deliver these lines with a straight face."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Monkeytot\\"...?!","review":"I know, this is not really a review, sorry about that. I just have to ask: That guy who calls himself \\"Monkeytot\\" and who writes these completely grotesque reviews - he is joking, right? He thinks it's funny to get people all confused (or all riled up) by writing these reviews which are either insulting or completely, utterly moronic...right?I'm serious, check out his other reviews! That has got to be a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing exciting at all...","review":"I am probably the biggest Ricci fan you'll ever meet, but even that couldn't get me interested in this film. I bought it but ended up giving it away. The storyline was a-typical, nothing great at all. Sometimes I honestly forgot this was Ricci in the movie, because I kept losing interest. But nonetheless, she was the only good thing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused","review":"i am completely and utterly baffled by this movie, but more so by the people who are giving it five stars. once again, it is proven that amazon reviewers only review things that they like. and for some reason, there are people who liked this. i'll admit that the movie has its good qualities - christina ricci is one of my favorite actresses and this film wasn't bad enough that i will hold it against her, some of the acting was charming, it had a few clever scenes and i just liked the look of a lot of it. BUT as for the important traits of a good movie - the plot was incredibly under-developed as was the script and the transitions just didn't seem to fit, almost too the point of my asking \\"are they TRYING to make this not make sense?\\" and it's overall just unrealistic. i'd watch it again, sure, but that says nothing about the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I loved this movie, even though it seemed a bit cliché at times, it made me want to watch it over and over again after it ended, something not many movies do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs captioning","review":"Captioning is a valuable service to provide for those of us who need it. In the film \\"Miranda\\" there is no English closed-captioning track, and the only concession to captions at all is the track in Spanish. I have noticed that British efforts are frequently released without captions, and in \\"Miranda\\" there are the usual modern faults: nearly inaudible whispering, inadequate separation between dramatic lines and accompanying music, British terms and pronounciations which Americans need to hear more accurately, and so forth. The use of Spanish subtitles does NOT help whatever in these matters. Otherwise, I do believe Christina Ricci is suitably admired by the photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for Bible Study Group","review":"I purchased multiple copies of this book for use in a Bible Study Group. The group found the book helpful in focusing them on the material being studied, with questions that often opened up discussion about what was happening and what that means for us today. I did find other questions too schoolbookish, straight factual answers which did not increase our understanding of the intent of the stories, though they did make us take a second look at what was actually happening in the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute -too bad it was damaged","review":"Very cute photo album.

Here, the Scorpions render an amazing performance, while showing off a different acoustical variation of many of their very best songs. The performances are amazing, as is the sound quality. I feel that this is one of the best recordings of a musical performance ever made. Today, the Scorpions are still performing on a much more limited basis. The band members are indeed getting \\"up there\\" in years, and this is evident on the video of the \\"Acoustica\\" performances. But these guys are living legends, who always perform at a very high calibur. If you really like or love the Scorpions, then you will certainly enjoy this album. I say \\"Buy It!!!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bonus for an album","review":"It has a great bonus CD. I wish it had shown the same special features as the Acoustica DVD, but it's still okay. I wanted to see the music video edits of the songs, but I still enjoyed the interview. I wish Klause was there too, and all the other people that was performing with the Scorpions on Acoustica. I liked the short part of the rehearsals throughout the VCD which contained a little rehearsal for The Zoo, When Love Kills Love, Dust in the Wind, and Life is too short. It's still a great album. I recommend this album if you are a true scorpions fan. You would still be able to hear some songs from other bands that the Scorpions covere such as Dust in the Wind from Kansas, Love of my Life from Queens, and Drive from the Cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"Unlike other acoustic albums by great bands that enhance their reputations, Acoustica does nothing of the sort.

PHP & MySQL for Dummies seems to think I'm a programmer who doesn't know html instead of the reverse, which I am. The author spends pages, pages and chapters telling the reader how to format syntax and characters without running through examples for the reader to replicate. I'm about halfway through the book now and hope to eventually run into those examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Book with Incomplete Information","review":"This is the first book I have ever felt the need to review. I am writing this because I am back on amazon to try to find a book that actually teaches me what I am trying to learn. The book has halfass examples with incomplete information to work from. When you do run into a snag during part of the examples, there is no guidance on how to resolve common errors. In short the book sucks and makes me not want to ever buy another book from the \\"for dummies\\" series. If you buy this book, you truly are a dummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Helpful Book Ever","review":"I had a little experience with both PHP and MySQL before I bought this book. While the first few chapters make it seem easy enough, I found that using most of the information in the book - even copied letter for letter - led to error after error.

Again, confusing.The book has numerous errors, one which left me reading the same page for about half an hour. Rather than approaching the topic for beginners, she does assume some programming knowledge at time.After reading the explanations of object oriented programming (classes), I nearly gave up.The author is not a good teacher. There are scripts on her own web site with corrections."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but confusing...","review":"Unfortunately the author of this book is so engrossed in her knowledge she isn't able to step back and tell the beginner (after all this is the Dummies guide) what to do step by step. She informs you 'about' PHP and MySQL with little comprehensive instruction on how to build a database website in a logical clear step by step order.Overall in my opinion this book is far from 'even a dummy can do it if they follow the steps' guide but more of a poor attempt by an expert to teach people a complex topic without the understanding of what is means to be a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend it.","review":"I own this book, personally I think its awful. The way it is structured doesn't seem to work too well for the purpose. I read the entire thing once and still felt like I knew nothing. I found some tutorials online easier to follow and the lack of working examples didn't help either. Perhaps if it we're written by a programmer and not a professional author it would have been easier to follow.

Thats all well and good. But I had no need to make these projects. I wanted to make my own specific project. Thats why I was learning php.As a result I had a hard time using this book. Specific stuff that is not important to the above projects was left out. Thus I had a hard time finishing my own project.

I suggest it to anyone serious or curious about this subject!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure what to think.","review":"The subtitle of this book is \\"Scholarship, Policy, and Practice\\" and this feels like something that is part-social work, part-therapy, and part-public policy. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing. Are too many cooks spoiling the soup? Perhaps this book is best for directors of Latino non-profits or governmental agencies in Latino communities. I particularly like the section of the book that focuses on specific populations; namely Latino fathers, and Central American refugee families. Too many books on Latinos stress the same old stuff (Latinos are diverse; their numbers are increasing; language and immigration will be an issue unlike with most blacks or whites, etc.). So this book was definitely trying to do something special. I just don't know if they effectively acheived their goal(s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brilliant Album from Trio Mocoto","review":"A classic and unique blend of Braziilian Jazz funk.

I tried all kinds of remedies, but nothing worked, not even Cortisone. Then I discovered CalaGel, and my Poison Ivy cleared up in a week. The funny thing is I'd tried the two active ingredients, Calamine Lotion and Benadryl, separately, but they didn't help.I remain highly sensitized to it since that initial exposure. The dogs seem to find it wherever it is, and they give it to me over and over. But at the first sign of discomfort, I wash the affected site with the Tecnu (included in this package) and then apply a bit of the CalaGel. If I haven't caught it fast enough, I sometimes need a second dose of CalaGel several hours later. But that's it. This stuff is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish","review":"I've given a rating of 1 star for this book only because negative numbers are not an option.

This man should be in jail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Yanomami are FUNNY AS ALL HELL!!!!","review":"This book is an anthropological case study of a group of south american indians. Not only is it interesting from a scientific standpoint, it is also hilarious. The Yanomami are highly sexual. I had no idea there were so many creative activities a person could engage in with the penis (masterbation in the mouth of a river fish was a new one on me). They are also a fascinatingly brutal culture. For instance, its perfectly ok in the Yanomami culture to bonk someone over the head with a heavy club in an argument. Overall, a very entertaining read about a culture as foreign as one could imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing piece of work","review":"This record is really amazing - - it takes a great deal of talent and judgement to make a record as effortless (sounding) and timeless as this.

This is Kellerman's best novel, in my opinion (unlike others, I actually enjoyed \\"The Web\\"). Very enjoyable and a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linear, Misogynistic, Anticlimactic","review":"Kellerman has written a very shallow book. It is unfortunate, given his implied medical and clinical background, that he has invested such time and energy into such a typical and unoriginal story. The descriptions of the scenes and characters are mundane and transparent. His treatment of the women characters exploits the madonna/whore dyad which has been overplayed since the time of Homer. I was looking forward to a crystallized and entertaining relaxation book, more in the style of Crichton. Overall this book delivers very little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not His Best","review":"I liked the way this one started, but then things slowed down. Too much analyzing the possibilities.

I was expecting a page turning, exciting and mysterious book, but instead I found that the parts of the book that were meant to be exciting and mysterious, would be boring and found myself dosing off. A good book makes you stay up, regardless of how tired you actually are. I will give Mr. Kellerman the benefit of the doubt and will read another book by him, but I definately cannot say I loved this book. It was a very dry read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Jonathan Kellerman's mysteries sell well and he's gotten some good reviews, at least that is what I recalled when my daughter gave me \\"The Clinic\\" recently. Unfortunately, the reputation does not translate for me into an enjoyable read. Lots and lots of talk, some of which could have been cut or put into exposition, bogs down the narrative. Some interesting psychological insights from Dr. Alex Delaware about the characters involved, but although some suspense is generated, the overall effect is more like a thud, rather than a splash. Kellerman apparently believes that each character must be described in considerable detail, but without providing any insights into the character through dialogue and action, the descriptions are useless. He also describes with some detail some of the settings. But again the writing is so, well, pedestrian that there is no evocative rush from the descriptions. Maybe Kellerman is better in other books. One hopes so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've read two Delaware books and both I've had to skip several chapters in order to get to the end and FINISH the darn thing!I tried to skip to the last page, and I still have no idea who did it.

(Somehow the writer believes this will make his story both exciting and believable.) Yet it makes for a completely unbelievable and completely boring story.If you're looking for detective fiction I have two recommendations from either side of the spectrum. First F Paul Wilson's Repair Man Jack series (This is Self Appointed officer of Justice-actually an outlaw in New York City fighting for his own ideals of justice.) If you don't like the dark intensity then try the other side of the spectrum: Sir Arthur Conan Doyal's Sherlock Holmes series. This is very loose and detatched put it down and pick it up whenever you want; the joy of this is just watching the brilliant observations unfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and without any suspense","review":"The Clinic features Alexander Delaware, who endlessly inverviews victims and possible suspects. Being slow and boring, the Clinic makes great bed-time reading if you normally have a hard time getting to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-crafted","review":"This novel is atrocious. The characters are shallow and drawn poorly, the plot is choppy and badly paced, the exposition ill-described, and the denouement lacks excitement. It's like going on a boring date with an ugly girl. If this novel is representative of Kellerman's work - which my friends who are Alex Delaware fans assure me it is - then I recommend you skip his novels altogether and head straight for the Agatha Christie section. Her novels are much more tightly written and come to taut, gripping conclusions.Long live the dame of detective fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.....","review":"I simply love the Alex Delaware series by Jonathan Kellerman. I usually read a book in 2-3 days. This books was different for me. The pacing seemed off and I really just never got into the story. Early on it was clear I really didn't care about the main victim. I soon became bored enough that I had trouble remembering who was who because I wasn't involved enough to pay attention. Milo always amuses me so the book got 2 stars. I'm hoping the next book is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take My Breath Away","review":"This was the 5th Delaware book I read and I am more hooked then ever. This book is a total mind bogler. When I was done reading it, it reminded me of trying to untangle a rope. You get the little knots done along the way and when you think you have it under control and know what you are doing you get to the huge, many knots in one to untangle. This book makes your mind think constantly, you are reading along and then here comes another clue on a person that you had read about earlier and you have to think back on which one it was. Warning, there are a lot of suspects in this book and you need to keep each of their stories connected with their name. The resoning behind why the person committed the murder just blew my mind, I had no idea. You will enjoy this book to the fullest.

The characters arent fleshed out well, theres the usual tough guy with problems and the vunerable female who (as usual) get together.

Alba fights to save humanity.This anime is pretty boring. I realized about 7 episodes into the series that all these battles that took place for no reason. There is no clear enemy. It's like a child playing with with toy soldiers. There is no point to anything that happens in this series. The good guys and bad guys have no goals or allegiances. It seems like they have a simple code: \\"Wow! Another mecha, lets blow it up!\\" They simply fight for the hell of it. The animation is average, the voice acting is pretty good, and the soundtrack is okay. Nothing important happens in this series. It just kinda exists. I can't recommend it. It's a serious bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Booty-licious!","review":"I loved this book and read it a few hours. It gives a very quick biography or a dozen or so female pirates throughout history, accompanied with some great, colorful illustrations. I really like the pictures. It is not a serious or scholary book on the subject, but rather a fun and campy look at a bit of history. I'm not so sure how accurate the accounts are, but it is an entertaining read none the less. I would recommend this book for highschoolers as a way to introduce them to and spark some interest in interesting characters from the past. The author includes a list of further reading at the end of the book if you find your are further interested in reading up on pirates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read before buying this book for a preteen!","review":"The title, including the word \\"girl\\" and the artwork led me to think this would be a great present for my eleven-year-old granddaughter who lives in Australia.

But from a practical perspective where one would want to expose students to the thought processes of a master filmmaker practicing his craft, this film was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old pocket watches explained","review":"The focus is on antique European pocket watches, especially British ones, this being a British publication. The technical history of watches is thoroughly covered, the various outdated watch mechanisms--verge, fusee, cylinder escapement--are explained, and interesting footnotes are included, like the wage records from a 19th century watch shop. A chapter on repair will get you started, and even tell you how to restore the blueing on the watch hands (heat them in a tray over an alcohol lamp). The author has spent much of his life studying and collecting old watches, and has produced an easy-to-read guide filled with interesting and useful information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful product","review":"I purchased this from another company in a foot care kit. I absolutely love this cream! A little goes a long way and after using it, your skin stays smooth and supple for hours---even after showering. It says it has real topaz gemstones in it which you'd think would make it a bit abrasive. It's not, however, just very smooth and silky. It also has lemon in it and the smell reminds me vaguely of key lime pie, so it smells as good as it feels. :) Now that I know I can get it in larger jars and by itself, I'll definitely be purchasing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Quick Erotic Read.","review":"I really liked this book.

The sex scenes, though kinky are not sensual. The heroine talks like she's uneducated. The writer kept on and on with the taboos of interracial dating that after a while, it became uncomfortable.

I can't recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money..","review":"I purchased this e-book after someone's glowing review. I was highly dissapointed. The concept was OK, a talisman being passed on to 2 descendants of long-ago lovers and now they are both having eroic feelings about each other. The heroine is black and the hero is white which makes their relationship more complicated. Sounds good? Maybe - except that the writing is mediocre and the sex scenes not sensual or erotic at all. The heroine is not likeable and the secondary characters are just as shallow. Can't recommend this to anybody. If you like to read good quality romantica , try all of Jaid Black's book from EC.

It is solid as a rock, and the display is beautiful. As far as speed is concerned, it is comparable to my Dell P4 2.8 ghz desktop. The best part of all is the OS X operating system. I've upgraded to Tiger (10.4.1) and have had no problems. The OS is so smooth and easy to use, that Windows XP now seems very crude in comparison. I currently run two Dell desktops at my house on a wireless network, and the PB links up w/o a problem. And, with OS X, file sharing between the computers is ridiculously easy.

They are the exact same pumps but are painted gold. I'm not sure what that is about.I developed a slow leak in a tire so I bought two of them; one for my car and one for my wife's. Right out of the box, mine showed a wildly inaccurate tire pressure. On a good tire it hovered around 5psi whereas two trusty stick gauges that I have used for years both showed 30psi. It did however inflate the tire about as well as any other $20 pump I have owned, and the lights worked (but were very dim). I went and checked my wife's and it had the exact same problem but on hers you could hear hissing as air was escaping somewhere in the pump. Both were brand spanking new. Give me a break! What a bunch of junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High performance at a Low cost","review":"I went through 3 cheap portable compressors (made in CHINA..... go figure) before I decided to spend a few extra bucks on this one. I use it to inflate the air shocks on my El Camino (20 to 200 PSI range) And it tops them off in less than 2 minutes. Granted, the volume of air needed is small, but the pressure is significant and this unit's up to the task!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Noisy, as Expected - But Works!","review":"Simply put : it works and nicely, though noisily, so. And it's powerful as well, inflating tires pretty fast.Even the somewhat cheesy analog tire pressure gauge is quite accurate. I have a different digital tire gauge in each of our two cars and their readings quite match the readings of this 'Slime'The only issue I have with this product is the part connecting to the tire is lined with cheap rubber that sometimes get stuck while attempting to disconnect from the tire and causes the loss of some pressure. I just compensate by filling 1-2 PSI above the recommended pressure...In short: worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This Slime COMP03 air compressor should not be listed on your website. It run for 18 min.to go from 30psi to 35psi on one tire. The noise level was unbearable. The light was just ok, not bright, but air came on the light when dead.

The first one ran for a whole 2 seconds before it started smoking. The cable to the 12v plug was very hot. Good thing I was watching it or it might have caused a fire. I did not try the other one and returned both of them. I have used the Campbell Hausfeld ($50 on Amazon) for several years. The only problem with the CH was that the 12v internal battery did not last long. But that's no problem since I use the 12v adapter. I'll stick with the CH.

If you will lay the unit flat on the ground with the gauge and controls facing up, like it is designned to be used, \\"walking\\" is not a problem. Even though the gauge itself is hard to read, it is accurate and will inflate tires much quicker than most inflators at this price. I actually paid a mere $15 at my local Walmart.

This literally take 10 minutes to adjust 10# in a 225 60/17 tire, while vibrating all over and making a huge racket. Pain to repack the cord/hose into the body of the thing. Not enough room.

However, there are 2 problems with the device - 1. After adding air to 2 tires the rubber inside the nozzle was already ripping and becoming unattached so that it would get in the way when trying to connect it to the valve stem, after 4 tires it was very ripped up. 2. The compressor vibrates so much that you can't put it onthe ground while running or it falls over. I guess that's the price you pay for the light weight of the compressor. While the rubber seal is a concern, it's not enough for me to return the compressor because it did work. I only hope the seal doesn't get so bad that the nozzle won't keep a good connection with the valve stem."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Piece Of Junk!","review":"I may have used this thing 2 to 3 times at best since I bought it back in May 2008 and the inside of the seal has already ripped up so that I cannot even get it to attach to the tire valve.

I had use it about 5 time since then. The unit is now useless... it will not air up my tires anymore. It will start, then make all the pump noise like it use to, but no increase in tire pressure. I had to use my old beatup walmart $10 12v air pump to finish it off. I had that pump for about 10yrs now, and it's still working today. The only reason why I bought this slime air compressor, because it had a pressure guage and light. If not for these features I would not have bought this crap. My mistake was assuming that this would last as long as my old compressor.. wrong! Do not waste your money on this junk. Not very reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handy compact design, but poor quality.","review":"Pros: Handy and compact design: cable and pump fit into a compartment, the light is handy.Cons:- Pump was dead on arrival, the overall quality is quite poor and flimsy.- No adapter for bike valveI am returning this for a different pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud Noise!

I am very impressed!I own the Sennheiser HD580, and I have been disappointed with how they sound. The frequency response of the HD580 is almost \\"perfectly\\" flat, but that kind of frequency response just comes off sounding unnatural to my ears.I have had the opportunity to listen and compare the Ultrasone HFI-700 to many popular and renowned sets, and I think these are superior. The other sets I've tried are the Sennheiser HD580, AKG 240S, Sony MDR-V600, and Sony MDR-7506. My main gripe with all the others is that the music just doesn't sound nearly the same as it does when listening using speakers.The cable on the Ultrasone HFI-700 is thick and seems very durable (as opposed to my Sennheiser HD580s), they are comfortable to wear, and the closed design means others in close proximity won't hear your music so easily. If you're in the market for high-end headphones, I highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST HEADPHONES EVER","review":"Ok. so your sceptical about some 250 dollar headphones.

They also are EXTREMELY comfortable over long periods of time aka don't hurt your ears even after 6+ hours of listening. Can also be quite compact if u need to transport. These are worth your money if u are lookin for some great sounding but not 600 dollar senheissers. Oh are also perfect for movie listening. Theres a reason it has surround sound in the name. I would recommend buying to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound POOR QUALITY","review":"I puchased about a year ago. They have only been used by an adult and they were pampered as the cost of these headphones is high. They sound great but the plastic keeps breaking away and now are held together with black tape. Now one of the ear pieces doesnt work at all so great sound is only half as good. I wouldnt highly recommend these because of the craftsmanship while good, the way they are constructed and materials used is not so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Headphones","review":"After a lot of research and looking at Bose and Sennheiser headphones, I found the Ultrasone HFI-700s. The S-logic surround sound produces a fuller and much more enveloping sound than both Bose and Sennheiser. I never knew my music and DVD's could sound so good. While a little bit of break in time was needed, I now feel like I am at the concert or in the movie. While Ultrasone has not yet made a name in America comparable to Bose, the quality of their product easily surpasses every other headphone I heave heard. These are overall outstanding headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with outcome","review":"I am a parent and I operate a school clinic.

They don't prove to be effective, and research has shown the risk of using those products.I have used this product personnally (thanks to summer camp and daughters with long hair). The ease of the product when used as directed, and the comb that comes with the kit was dramatic. The nits were loosened and removed easier than I have ever found. I highly recommend this product to parents, I was not disappointed. Note: The only effective way to completely \\"cure\\" a case of headlice is to remove ALL of the nits.

I was going crazy finding eggs and nymphs, and then I found Licefreee! I left it on for 90 minutes (it recommends at least an hour, but since it isn't a pesticide, I decided to leave it on longer). When I started combing through, I found dead lice which reassured me it worked. (after rinsing the Rid shampoo, lice were still crawling around). It's been 2 days now, and no sign of lice. I am still using the Robi comb ($30 at Walgreens which I also highly recommend- it detects live lice and kills them instantly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergies Beware","review":"I bought this for a family member and here is the thing; did it work, yes WITH and only WITH the ROBI COMB (worth the money) now that thing is awesome.

The best episode involves a town that warmly welcomes Kino and she befriends a little girl, I won't ruin it but that was a great episode.

But I had difficulty believing Sarah as a love interest for Coalhouse.Unfortunately, the movie only held my family's interest because we had seen the play and maybe that's part of the problem.

She also tends to blame husbands for the problems that these woman had. They seem to be examples of \\"throwing out the baby with the bath water.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A life saver...","review":"This book has truly been a life-saver to me. Not only did it detail the reasons for leaving and the steps to leaving, it explained the emotions and shared wonderful examples / stories. It also gave me a great deal of hope for a happy and fulfilling (single) life.Whenever I started feeling down or questioned whether divorcing my husband was the right choice, I came back to this book. In a matter of minutes, I was back on track and feeling confident in my decision.This book was a hand-me-down from a friend who read it during her divorce. I have now passed it on to another friend and highly recommend it to any woman in the process of separating or even contemplating a separation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent -- not to be missed by the divorcing woman","review":"When I found this book, I had read so many others since my divorce a year ago -- what I was NOT looking for was yet another book full of anecdotes and others' experiences with 'un-coupling', or about the inspiration of change/divorce/mid-life evolution, etc. Instead, this work is refreshingly frank, research-based information about the realities of women on their own. I felt uplifted by facts and actuality, rather than boosted on the wings of another 'self-help' book. I felt as though this book validated my situation and fueled my aspirations. At the time, I was feeling 'haunted' by the past and daunted by the future as well -- I plan to re-read it very soon -- and pass it along to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivialization of the romantic condition and love","review":"It is unfortunate that the author has not had a decent relationship in her life, otherwise she would know that some things are worth working for and not to just give up and strike out on one's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"More information than expected.....","review":"I expected a small paperback and was surprised how much information was in a book I just happened to stumble upon on Amazon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Candy","review":"This book presents men in various settings that are sepia toned, many of whom are in an aroused state.

Of all of the male figure study books I've collected, this would be my least favorite. To me, it seems far less about art and more about the photographer's obsession with very well-hung men and hangs closer to porn than art. I don't have a problem with porn, but it's not what I was shopping for and I probably won't be holding on to this book.That said, there are a handful of creative and intriguing photos in here. But not many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Big or Go Home!","review":"If you like em big then you'll like this one! I was however not pleased with the clarity of the photos.

At several points I was laughing so hard I was in tears; a tissue was necessary first for the tears, then for the nose blow because I just couldn't stop laughing. But it's not all uproariously funny -- much of the humor is gentle and subtle, a lot like our lives. I was amazed at how much Vicky hit home with my own life experiences. I plan to give this book as a gift to my closest girlfriends, passing on the humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and encouraging","review":"In this memoir, the author tells a creatively written and humorous story of his life as his parents divorce and then he finds divorce in his life. The presence of his wanting desire to be a dad is touching while he eludes to the life and memories of his own father's effect on his life. It's a journey of reflection to further understand his roles and example to his children. This author is certainly a man of his passion, character and effort to be involved as a father. I've known many other fathers who are just as concerned and wanting to be a good father after a divorce. This memoir provides the reader with an emotional tale of a father's love and difficulties with this divorce arena we all have been touched by in some way. I certainly suggest this for everyone to read on a cold winter day, because when your through you'll want to get out and enjoy the warmth of the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride through the life of a divorced father!","review":"This book was an astonishing view into the life and heart of an American boy becoming a man in the shine of a culture of divorce. I was captured and riveted through the trials of this man's life, then released and set free into the sun of his faith and courage to recreate his life and recreate his focus on \\"the way it has to be\\" all for the benefit of his children. I was inspired and touched by the sheer ability to see past all the doom and gloom of a difficult life and put his energies into being a good example, a man of character, and a man of faith for his children to see. This is certainly a call for all parents to aspire beyond the past of our parent's faults and envision a future for our children with hope, forgiveness, acceptance and faith in the true meaning of being a parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Es increible","review":"En este album podemos ver la cuatro faces de la voz de camilo.

I have not seen around company put a mixer on the market close to the quality of this.They do make bigger sizes, but how often do you really need to make more than this? Its just not worth it in my opinion. On Amazon its another $70 for only an extra 1/2 qt of bowl space. No thank you.We love this mixer so much, we recently picked up a second one to keep at our vacation house. I shopped around a lot and its amazing how much cheaper Amazon sells this for.

I can now hear Dr. King anytime I want to at work. I feel like I'm right there, listening with his audience. If this product is any indication of what to expect from future Audio CD's by other great orators such as JFK, FDR, and even Winston Churchill, then count me in!

If I simply want erotica without much story I can frankly read ... forums. C. Tan should have read some more L.K. Hamilton's work and only let shorts that had somewhere close to that level of plot in to this collection (as I said there were a couple that really had potential). All in all, if you can find it cheap enough it would be worth it just for the few shorts that make the rest of the muck bearable.

After hearing all the ridiculous pontification of these nobodys, I was beginning to question my own allegiance to this band.

I swear the authors made up some accronyms because they're not listed on whatis.com.The number one thing that told me this book sucked was the section devoted to comparing an OOUI to a GUI. ...OOUI...is an Object Oriented User Interface. Oh, wait a sec, that would be a GUI wouldn't it!? OOUI is a neologism folks.The list goes on. The author thinks that a client must have a GUI in order to be a client. Go to DOS and type 'ftp'.

Obviously, it's impractical for anyone to carry these heavy resources, and therefore it is lucky that there is a skillful synopsis available by Stephen Bezruchka. Dr. Bezruchka has spent a lot of his adult life in developing countries, mostly Nepal. He has distilled the most basic information that might confront the international traveller into a book that is the same size as your passport. The tone is reassuring and authoratative.

His basic thesis is that the Christian faith is based on forgery and lies. He also singles out a few Popes who were flawed and makes claims about church documents which he claims were forged uses that to convince us that the Catholic Church is about to sink into oblivion. Curiously he claims that the prophecies of St Malachy were forged in the 16th century then admits that the forger was a great prophet because the prophecies are very accurate even after the date of the supposed forgery. At the end of the book he states that he thinks the Holy Roman Catholic Church is demonically possessed and he is happy to face the lake of fire for saying so. I feel sorry for the man because he has called eternal damnation on himself. If you are curious about the Prophecies of St Malachy please look elsewhere because this man is trying to lead people astray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectualy Insulting","review":"I did not go fifteen pages into this book before realizing that something was truly wrong. The author's attempt at convincing the reader that Simon Peter (the first Pope)was actually Simeon the Zealot (who died in Asia years after the crucifixion of Peter in Rome) would have been laughable, were it not presented as serious scholarship.

If you're a church history buff, the book an interesting interpretation of the papal line of succession since the 12th century. In the end one must conclude that St. Malachy did not really prophesy about these popes, but another seer with pretty fair accuracy did.Mr. Hogue evidently completed the book in early 1998, and in later chapters he expounds about the present pope, John Paul II, and his two future successors. In trying to interpret the future as forseen by \\"St. Malachy,\\" Nostradamus, and others Mr. Hogue falls flat. Luckily for us, many of the things \\"predicted\\" for 1998, 1999, and 2000 have not come true!Mr. Hogue does approach the reputation of almost every pope since 1143 with emphasis on the worst.

But I was soon to learn that this was not so. Big O was practically invincible, and the battles were pretty boring. Dorothy didn't have much personality, and was quite annoying. And The city's people were all insecure cowards. The series was just plain stupid. I know I cannot help those who have a low IQ and have actually bought the first DVD and liked it, but for those who are smart and read about all the consecutive DVDs (or VHSs) in the series, DON'T BUY THIS SERIES! For a much better alternative (along with a halfway-decent plot) I suggest any of the gundam series, preferably gundam wing-incredible plot, great action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your father's Anime","review":"Those seeking average Anime action (big blocky robots, scantily clad \\"women\\", more action, less words) should look elsewhere.The Big O (ok the title may induce a chuckle or 2) is all about Film Noir and Retropunk. Those liking the movie Dark City, or Batman: TAS should pick all DVD's from this series as soon as they are available.Even though the series is named after its 50+ ft Action Star, its really about Roger Smith, and his cohorts Dorothy and Norman (his all too 'Alfred'-like butler).I am quite sad to hear the series was only 13 episodes though (however, Patrick McGoohan's the Prisoner was just as short and as sweet).That, and the fact that there are only 3 episodes on this DVD (and Im assuming the last two as well), forcing those who get hooked to the first DVD to shell out the same (or maybe more) for 3 episodes instead of 4.That should have reduced the rating to really 4.5 instead of 5 stars, but since I love the series so much, I'll round up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for projects or home crafters","review":"this self healing mat works great!as a graphic design major in college i do alot of cutting with razor blades. to this point i have been doing it on a piece of plastic which would break the tips off my blades after a few use's and dull the blade which is bad when you are cutting paper alot for projects... seeing it could cause the paper to rip instead of cut.the mat is a very large 18x24 in size with measurements on the sides and a nice grid for keeping cuts straight.this mat will be with me untill it needs to be replaced... but after using it for a year now i think it will be many more years till that has to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This mat has been perfect for my use so far. I use it to roll out duct tape and cut the tape on the measured lines with either a blade or a rotary cutter. The mat really does heal up the way it promises, and there are no jagged edges left anywhere. At times it's hard to even find the old cutting lines.The mat is heavy and has a great solid feel to it. The light gray color isn't too jarring on the eyes and the lines on it are very easy to see. A feature I really like is the 45 degree angles I can line up my duct tape sheet with to cut perfectly angled flaps.The 18x24 mat is sized well for most of the projects I come up with. It fits well at the end of the kitchen island or on a card table.Overall, I love the mat and I'm glad I picked it over others I looked at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cutting mat","review":"This is my first cutting mat and I love it!

It seems to be the same material as the topside.I will come back and do a real review after I have used the mat.

He also uses a lot of technical jargon and technical descriptions in place of solid action plotting and dialog that has a real ring to it instead of words that sound like they came off any dozen action flicks. The plot and action scenes are what make or break a book of this type but five guys who are real-life versions of the characters in the story flung the book at the wall before they finished the first twenty pages.

However, it's exactly the same as the movie, so don't expect any different plot twists.If you like sing-alongs and remember the tunes, you will be happy to see the lyrics here in the book. It won't be a spoiler to tell you that this has a happy ending, which is not the real-life story of Diana Ross and the Supremes. But the twist of having Deena take over as lead singer is clearly taken from the idea that Flo Ballard was supposed to be the lead singer of the Supremes (and had the best voice) until Diana Ross grabbed opportunity by the hand (specifically, Berry Gordy's hand) and took the lead spot.Light, easy, fun reading for the plane as you travel for the holidays or relax after too much partying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I really enjoyed this novelization and it was a quick read.

It is super light weight and low density. When you press your hand into the cushion, instead of leaving an imprint of your hand, the foam fluffs back up right away. I've purchased a much cheaper 2\\" memory foam that weighed about twice as much as this one, and it provided much more support and cushion.One thing people seem to leave out in their review is that this mattress pad has several small holes for \\"ventilation\\" throughout the entire body. Beware!The quality of the foam is cheap, but I must admit it was comfortable. Unfortunately, this comfort only lasted a few months. So with everything considered, this is a very overpriced memory foam pad with a ridiculous original price tag.

We took it off this morning and put the old one back on.Tempur-pedic's density is 5.3lbs.I came up with about 3.05 lbs/cubic ft. for this pad.

I'm only 33, but I have not slept well in a long time, and I often wake up with sore muscles on my six-year-old pillow top mattress. I am usually so tired by noon that I take a nap when my three kids do.We got our mattress in the mail yesterday. It was rolled up tight like the other reviews said, and took a few hours to plump up. I let it plump up all day, then put it under my fitted sheet at bedtime. I used the pillow that came with it just to try it out. I woke up this morning about an hour before I usually do, feeling like I got a full night's sleep. I was absolutely rested! I can't tell you what a difference this mattress made. I had forgotten how good it feels to be completely rested in the morning. I absolutely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"I managed to get this on sale, so it was quite a bit cheaper than the retail, but I have to say I love it. It was a great improvement over my mattress alone, which has started to grow a little too old. But new mattresses are far too expensive to replace this one. And just recently I had one of my children share the bed as well. He slept peacefully over my arm, but my arm just sunk a little more into the mattress. I haven't had a body part fall asleep yet. Sleep has also been easier, and I don't wake up with the old aches and pains anymore.

So I say it is important you get the quality you deserve from it.I am an athlete, so I do a lot of deadlifts, power cleans, and exercises that put a lot of stress on my body, especially the lower back. These foams are great. When you lie down, it completely molds your body, so there is not so much rigidness and tension working against your body, which make you feel sore and unrested waking up in the morning. And let's all be honest, these are much price friendly than tempurpedic. They are also great if you have over night guests. Rather than putting people on the couch, put these on the floor. They make a great bed just themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was worth it","review":"I have a very stiff mattress. This foam pad worked really well with my stiff mattress.

A friend of mine bought one for his wife while she was pregnant and really made a difference for her (and him.) We got the pad and my wife immediately began to sleep better, and continued to do so for the rest of the pregnancy.As good as it was to begin with, after my wife came home it was almost too good. Having little strength, it was a little too hard to push out of the foam and was also difficult to nurse, so since then the pad has been been in the basement, occassionally being thrown on the floor as an extra mattress when we have guests.

For the price, its a decent buy with the two pillows but I intend to replace it soon with a denser model.

The first night, I threw the pillow on the floor because my face was sweating. I live in Florida, but always have the AC blasting. My body was also very hot and I twisted and turned all night.

However, for a fraction of the price, this is a great bed accessory. I am experiencing less back pain, and just enjoying a more luxe sleeping experience, as I do feel somewhat cushioned in a focused, body-conforming way (tho, again, not nearly the same as with a whole memory foam mattress). Also, the pillows are a nice touch, and they've provided some nice neck relief and support.Although the pad is comfortable to sleep on, I've found that I appreciate it best for sitting up in bed for reading or watching TV. It makes a good sleeping surface, but an even better sitting foundation.

I did splurge on the tempurpedic pillows. I've had mine for almost 7 years and I'm just now wanting a bigger size. Needless to say, we didn't use the pillows that came with this mattress topper. I wasn't a fan of how dramatic the shape was or how it felt. My husband and I are both relatively small people, so for someone with a larger frame the pillow might not be so over the top. I watched the price of the mattress pad and got it for 80 dollars. I'm not sure I would've paid over 100 for it, but I'm cheap!

This little compressor has worked in all types of weather conditions and has been extremely reliable, and it's pumped up a lot of tires. It says not to run it more than 7 minutes at a time, but I would say that's a VERY conservative time limit set by the manufacturer because I've exceeded that by quite a lot on several occasions and it hasn't caused any problems. The hard case does a great job keeping everything contained and has held up well even though it bangs around inside the front hard box on my ATV.

About six weeks ago, a low tire pressure light came on in car, so I checked air pressure which was about 5 psi low in all tires, and used inflator. Took 2-3 minutes to boost pressure just 1 pound. Called Slime and was told that could happen, because the higher the pressure in the tire, the more resistance to the inflator, which they told me is not that powerful. I called a week later, was told that that rate was too slow, unit was probably defective so they agreed to send replacement at no cost. Just received yesterday so have not yet used.

Chi buys Hideki a present (a porno magazine that he doesn't have yet, lol), and then when Hideki gets freaked out by a spooky murder story, he begins to think that a murderous spirit is downstairs in the apartment below him. Which makes for a very entertaining episode. Then there's the virtual reality game Hideki borrows so he can play with Chi, and because he's never played a game like this before, he has no idea what he's doing, so Shinbo and Sumomo come help him out.

Nevertheless, he does a masterful job of recreating the stories of four separate clam boat disasters in the early part of 1999. He also does an excellent job of describing the work of clam boats, as well as the problems encountered by those working in the profession.

If I had not seen the History Channel's The Men Who Killed Kennedy: The Guilty Men, I might have gotten lost in the myriad of names and dates.

Only one person stood immovable between LBJ and the White House--John F.

The fingerpring of LBJ's evil associate only definitively confirms what is laid out in the book.The silence, as to the salient facts of this book, from doubters is deafening.The \\"readers,\\" who attack the author, obviously cannot attack the truth and the clear chronlogy contained in this book.This book should be a must read for every history and political science class in America.We must never forget--the Truth sets us free and keeps us free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An opportunity missed","review":"Strange book; it starts off promisingly but then moves from factual data to 'faction' and at that point becomes riddled with errors and unnecessary speculation.

Even he admits his book relies mostly on something he refers to as \\"faction.\\" The book is practically unreadable in terms of style, and the \\"evidence\\" he offers would never be allowed in a court of law. His history is undocumented and unverifiable. His proof for LBJ's murder of Kennedy more often than not is a glance, or a look, or an unspoken admission, that apparently only McClellan can decode.Readers would be better off picking up Doris Kearns Goodwin's \\"Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream\\" or they might even try the Warren Commission Report (available for ten bucks), which few conspiracy theorists have actually bothered to read and the major analysis of which has never been conclusively rebutted.Barr McClellan certainly hasn't with this forgettable piece of flotsam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, rambling nonsense... but interesting?","review":"Listening to the Audible version, I want to yell, \\"Get to the point!!\\" McClellan seems to have a particular grudge against his ex-boss Clark, and it detracts from the credibility of everything he says. Were they lovers? He also seems to be trying very hard to stretch his limited facts out into a book-length story. The result is rambling nonesense. Maybe he really knows something, but it's hard to tell. It all keeps coming back to how evil his former boss is.Stop wasting my time, Barr. Perhaps your son Scott McClellan could evade the point for a living as the White House Press Secretary, but we are paying you to get to the point.Oh well. My fault for expecting more.

If you just can't accept the idea that a loser like Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK, have some guts and read Bugliosi's \\"Reclaiming History.\\" On the other hand, rubes who believe LBJ is a killer probably believe that Bugliosi is just another member of the conspiracy and will refuse to read him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinko!","review":"Who could make head or tail out of this mess?

Whether you choose to believe, or not, there is no better answer and the proof is there when honest and unfearful authority is in place.More importantly, reading between the lines, this telling and forthright unburdening by Barr exposes the birthing of the Texas Republican party. It is obvious from reading this book that the dirty business and politics that is Texas tradition, the oil-garchy and modus operandi that put LBJ in Washington, is the SOP of today's GOP. If you get nothing else from this book, you must recognize LBJ as the Godfather of today's Republican party."},{"rating":"2","title":"McClellan's View Correlates With LBJ's Mistress: Madeline Duncan Brown","review":"Simply search online for \\"LBJ's Mistress\\" and watch the 80 minute interview with LBJ's former mistress of 20 plus years.

Barr McClellan's access to critical evidence makes him amply qualified to share a unique perspective into one of the darkest conspiracies of the twentieth century. Truly a page-turner, McClellan's BLOOD, MONEY AND POWER reads like a novel as the author takes the reader through every detail of the unspeakable crime. He also provides background information on the main characters which, to me, makes them three-dimensional and helps to establish motive for their actions. It is an excellent book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did LBJ Kill JFK?","review":"Barr McClellan joined the Clark, Thomas firm just after I left. It's hard to believe Edward Clark participated in the assassination of Johnson. Less so for others. Johnson was a bad man. I never understood why. He sucked the oxygen out of any room he entered. World Class Ego. I left the firm because I couldn't stand Johnson - even though I had nothing to do with the firm's representation of him.Barr has done a service here. I recommend the book.

It should be on Amazon.com JimK"},{"rating":"2","title":"The dark side of a demented man","review":"McLellan convinces you that LBJ was a key player in the assisnation. He convinces you that LBJ did it because he had to do it or his empire would crumble. Lyndon Johnson was a monster. Once he ordered the killing of one government employee he had to keep going. The impact of the book is blunted by the fact that Johnson is dead. There is no one alive to prosecute. Neither is anyone alive who could sue McLellan for slander. The thin part of the book is a lack of accounting for what went on in Washington before the murder. I can accept LBJ as a kingpin in the plot but I have trouble accepting that Oswald was a actually Marxist fool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overdue information from a Johnson insider","review":"This is a superbly written and researched secret history by a Johnson Administration insider who had the courage to take the risk of violating attorney client priveledge to give us the truth about Johnson.

I don't think Smart's opinions are as passe as the other reviewer did, though they would have been uncontroversial so long ago. Smart's basic concern seems to be to avoid any kind of controversy. His perspectives are so mundane that they're boring. Further, his train of thought often amounts to hesitant implications rather than arguments.I think he misunderstands Theravada Buddhism very badly. I wouldn't have thought he was in Eliade's tradition. I've read a lot of Eliade books, but I don't know why the other reviewer said that he was. At any rate, Eliade's books are all much better than this. In short, I can't imagine why anyone would want to read this book. Instead, I recommend books by Mircea Eliade, Huston Smith, Solomon Nigosian, William James, Karen Armstrong, Evelyn Underhill, Levi-Strauss, Rudolph Otto, Mary Douglas, Clifford Geertz... nearly anyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghhhh","review":"By the time I write this, the book seems to be tough to come by, but a warning nonetheless.Being forced to read it for a theory of religion class, I must warn that while it breaks down the categories of religion in an interesting fashion, it fails to build them back up into any sort of recognizable order... there's nothing to study, just anecdotes.The theistic v non-theistic thing is pretty irritating as well, as previously noted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for some balance","review":"There are two very big minuses with this series:1.

It will be better for those who watch in the original Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Series","review":"The English dub is decent, but they make a lot of pop culture references. When some random elf starts talking about Celine Dion it kinda takes you out of the fantasy.

(That's where mine came from) I am somewhat dissapointed at what this book offers:1. The verbs aren't in kanji or kanas. They are in romaji only (a variant system. i.e. si for shi, ti for chi etc.)2. It goes in alphabetical order, not Japanese kana order. This makes it quite confusing and frustrating for the more advanced student who's used to looking up Japanese words in a Japanese dictionary.3. The verb list (espcially in the back) aren't clear in some places. (i.e., there's 3 translations for \\"to change\\", but it doesn't say what each one is used for)4. The grammer definitions in the beginning of the book are also confusing, and doesn't give a clear sentence example.It still gives a good listing of verb conjugations, but that's about the only good point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other 2 star Reviewer said it best","review":"I completely agree with the reviewer who gave this book a 2 star - I should have paid a little more and bought the updated version by Barron's - the updated version only has Kanji at the top of each page for the main word - but that is better than this one that has absolutely no Kanji (nor Kana) at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was so looking forward to this live concert - especially after reading that any DVD of Marvin Gaye was rare, and virtually non-existent.This was a disaster.

The format of the book is to have a short chapter on each of the major aspects of anthropology such as: culture, religion, politics, economics, kinship, marriage, and capitalism.Each subject is given a few pages of discussion (around ten) and then a bibliography for further reading. In these few pages, the reader will grasp the central ideas that represent the current thinking in the field.It has been successfully used as a textbook by making this the cental theme of the class, but then supplementing the study with a significant amount of outside reading.

This would be a great cook book for empty nesters who have plenty of time and money to spend on food preparation. Frankly, I am surprised it has been reviewed so highly. A word about me; I have been cooking American and ethnic foods since my teenage years, and bake extensively. This book is not useful for families, as virtually none of the recipes would suit the tastes of my children, or most American children for that matter. Examples: dishes calling for organic egg whites, several exotic types of soy sauce I've never heard of, soy cream cheese, exotic mushrooms, and so on.

There is no \\"one diet fits all\\" solution. Different people have different trigger foods. This author seems to writing for people with IBS-D and using one data point, herself. People who suffer from IBS-C and IBS-A may not find this book helpful. Get this book from the library before wasting your money. Read About.com for the lastest information on IBS for free. They have an entire section on trigger foods. Let's hope that some better books come out about IBS in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best approach","review":"Sadly, this book assumes that most folks will have similar reactions to similar foods. That just isn't the case and if you are also saddled with a gluten or lactose intolerance, this book is even less helpful. Better to experiment with what foods do and do not work for you personally, and then take a look at different approaches to reducing stress and anxiety, which seem to affect almost all sufferers."},{"rating":"1","title":"At first glance","review":"At first glance, and judging from all the reviews, this book seemed like the answer to my problems. Upon opening it and reading, I felt like I was getting a huge 'YOU HAVE TO BECOME A VEGAN TO GET OVER THIS' message. Some of the claims behind certain foods having NO nutritional value and being linked to some diseases seemed like a stretch that I myself want to look into just to see if there's really any claim to it. I'm very skeptical about a lot of the claims.However, I have found that several foods in here are listed as trigger foods that I am prone to, and it's good to be aware of what not to eat, and when not to eat it. I can be more aware of it in the future, but I'm not sure I'm going to give this book another look after feeling like I'm being preached to about becoming a vegetarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us","review":"True to its title, this book contains almost two hundred low-fat and low-residue recipes. If that's what you are after, then this book will serve you well.Alas, everyone is different. As the husband of a (constipated) IBS sufferer, I must point out that these wheat flour, rice, and other complex carbohydrate laden recipes would completely, painfully block up my wife!! In that respect, this book is not what I would recommend to people with IBS.However, the author does actually follow her own diet, which serves her quite well (the diarrhea type of IBS sufferer?). I did like some of the author's points about looking at a change of diet not as a penalty but as a relief, as well as her use suggestion to \\"substitute ingredients\\" instead of eliminating your favorite foods altogether. Lastly, the nutritional summaries of each recipe add a valuable touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T DELIVER THE GOODS","review":"I decided to write this review when I ssw that another amateur reviewer had given this book 5 Stars and a different book about IBS only One Star. (I haven't read the other book yet, but I plan to order it today.) \\"Eating for IBS\\" promises a lot, but doesn't deliver. Though I will say this for it, the cover is stylish and appealing. In the first part of the book there is a great deal of information about IBS, but nothing one could not find elsewhere. The author's premise that artificial sweeteners contribute to the symptoms of IBS turned out to be totally without merit IN MY CASE. I can't speak for anyone else, maybe others would benefit from the elimination of artificial sweeteners from their diet. All that happened to me was that I gained weight! As for the recipes - many are complicated and call for esoteric ingredients not found in the average kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasty Recipes","review":"I like this book.

It contradicts the dietary changes that have been very helpful to me in treating my IBS. While I'm not willing to say that this book doesn't work, I am able to say that for me and my particular symptoms and struggles with IBS, this book would have increased the problems. As many IBS sufferers know, the systems are all over the place and vary from individual to individual so for me, Sorry... I had to just throw the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this book.

WE had read many articles and searched the internet. Even the doctor wasn't much help. Then I happened on this book. My husband has suffered from IBS for a long time. This book provided a simple guide and understanding of the condition, its symptoms, what to eat and not eat and best of all the recipes and diet he needed to turn his IBS around. Its easy reading and recipes are easy to use and taste wonderful. My husband's IBS no longer controls our lives, we control the IBS. Would recommend this book to anyone who suffers this condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Free advice...","review":"I bought the book Eating for IBS and it was just another cookbook in a long line of 'health-related cookbooks.\\" The only difference I really saw in the recipes was the ommission of milk and egg yolks in the recipes. I do suffer from IBS and I followed Heather's book for 2 months. All my meals were recipes from the book. I really disciplined myself when it came to eating. Two months later I had little relief and the only thing that did happen was I gained 15 lbs from all the starches (french bread, white rice, pasta, etc.). I tossed the book. I now have relief from my symptoms by cutting out the white rice, etc. because they are of no nutritional value. I do enjoy a hamburger and steak from time to time but don't over do it.

The book title reads: \\"Eating for IBS.....plus Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, and other digestive disorders\\". NOT TRUE! The book is ALL about IBS. I went to the the index and found the terms Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis appear on 2 pages of this 279 page book. They say do not confuse IBS with these digestive disorders.Maybe this book is a great tool for IBS Heather Van Vorous, but my wife who suffers from daily pain due to Ulcerative Colitis doesn't appreciate your marketing trick and neither do I.

How about some more buying advice. What can I buy at the supermarket? Which fruits and vegetable are OK and which not so much.

After giving up those things I was still a mes. Because of this book I was able to go on a road trip this summer and an amusement park!!!Buy this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes not for Full-Time Workers -- Too Time Consuming","review":"I bought this book a while ago hoping to find some tasty, easy-to-make recipes for my touchy stomach. However, after reading through the recipes, I was disappointed because the recipes all require a great deal of preparation, and a large variety of ingredients that I don't stock in my kitchen. It would have been costly and time consuming to follow these recipes. Also, the author doesn't include calorie information or how much each recipe yields like other cookbooks do.Furthermore, like another reviewer said, these recipes may be good for those who suffer from diarrhea, but they're not for those who suffer from constipation. You wouldn't want to make the rice dishes if you suffer from constipation, because rice is binding.I think the author had the right intent when she wrote this book; however, the recipes should have been made more simple, and more fitting to all life styles. Definitely not for the full-time worker--too time consuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for IBS, NOT for Chrohn's","review":"Good read, interesting. I have Crohn's Disease, and this is decidedly NOT a book for the type of Crohn's I have. Many of the recipes are not low residue, which is helpful for me. A word of caution--my doctor keeps insisting that I have to figure out what I can and can't eat, and in what quantities. Everyone's digestive disorder is different--at least no one in my CCFA group can eat some things I can, and I can eat some things they can't. I found the low residue information online much more helpful than this book, and IMHO I do not recommend it for anyone with a Crohn's stricture."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY IBS IS GONE!!

For example, the section on announcing your engagement (which one might expect to be in the first chapter) isn't until Chapter 4. Setting the date is in Chapter 3, after you've already read about selecting your wedding party in Chapter 2. It doesn't make much sense to choose your attendants before you even have a date, so why organize the book that way? There also wasn't much new information in the book that I hadn't read somewhere else before. However, the checklists seem somewhat useful; I've only used the budget checklist so far. There are no pockets to hold business cards or contracts or notes, a definite drawback. If you have State Farm insurance, you can get a special edition of this book for free through your insurance agent. It sure beats paying 20 bucks for a mostly useless planner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Traditional","review":"I found this planner to be way too traditional.

I got the baby white, the baby yellow, and the ladyfinger. Using 1/2 cup of corn and 2 tablespoons of oil in the whirley, both the ladyfinger and the baby yellow would pop up fluffy enough to fill the entire whirley. The white consistently only fills about halfway...it just doesn't taste as light and crisp either. Recommend going for the ladyfinger (tastes the best and the least hulls by far, but it's so tiny it's almost hard to eat without dropping a lot) or yellow if you're trying this brand. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior product","review":"So not worth the price. The people who run this company must have spent too much time working the fields in the hot sun and lost their minds. The popcorn I received was stale and tough. There are no freshness dates anywhere on the bag and it's not even sealed. It comes in a plastic bag with a wire tie, like a loaf of bread. Obviously it's been on the shelf too long and dried out.

It was lacking in taste, too - better off buying regular grocery store popcorn for the taste (if you don't mind the hulls).

Love him or hate him you have to admit that Harlan Ellison is always entertaining, a heck of a good storyteller and an angry driver. The only complaint I have is that the DVD is much to short. Its all very well to hear about the author's childhood but I was much more interested in his career as an author. That's not to say that what is here is not excellent far from it you get Ellison opinion on politics, copyright infringement, writers, television, the general dumbing down of entertainment and a host of other issues. It was also hilarious that the only one that seemed to care about Ellison being Jewish was Robin Williams.The DVD extras are also not to missed especially the melodramatic way in which Ellison reads his stories.

The atmosphere, the charactors, the set (Greystone mansion), all of it was very intriguing. I was appalled to hear that the show was to be discontinued after 12 episodes. I wrote to NBC several times, knowing all and well that my words were just a waste, one person or even 100 couldn't change the minds of the production.

The plot is very easy to follow and the characters are all very believeable. Paul Bishop is a veteran homicide cop in Los Angeles (at least he was at the time of this book). The book revolves around the death of a woman who's fingerprints identify her as someone who was murdered 18 years before. The woman's ex- husband may or may not have done the deed. Fey Croaker the lead investergator on the case is one tough cop. The book has a lot of twists and is a pretty quick read.

Normally cop thrillers aren't my thing, but I found myself completely engrossed in the story, finishing it up around 2:00 am and still thinking about it well after.The characters are a lot of fun to read about, especially Fey who is extremely complex in her own personal life (coming from horrific abuse) and her entangled relationships. The pace is at a good clip, taking the reader through a thrilling adventure.

As a guitar player of 2 years, I can safely say that there is NOTHING original about the music itself, and the lyrics are passable, at best. I had high hopes for this album after hearing Heart Transplant, but after two listens, I was bored and ready to move on. Another problem w/ \\"Action\\" (besides the music and lyrics) is that it seems to drag on endlessly, and while the songs are only 3 or 4 minutes in length, they seem to go on for a lifetime. I will give them credit for track 8 tho, they ripped a page right out of New FOund Glory's playbook and managed to pull it off pretty well. Overall, Punchline's \\"action\\" is just another lame attempt to ripoff other, more popular bands like brand new and Jimmy eat world.

You don't make the rules about what one should expect from another's labelmate). Anyway, I felt like this album was a piece of s**t, and after two or three listens, i threw it in the trash.

Jumping from style to style, Carman attempts story songs, ballads, hip hop, and traditional gospel without doing any of them well.The lyrics are utterly juvenile, asking listeners to get \\"alive with God- addicted to Jesus\\" and dance the \\"holy ghost hop\\". His song \\"Satan Bite the Dust\\" reveals his black/white thinking- he evidently believes the alcoholism is caused by demons. How does he attempt to defeat such \\"demons\\"?

I was actually looking for a DVD of the performance and found this CD rating. First, I love the Messiah in the original. It is the ONLY church cantata or music performance I have ever wept over. The Messiah is a very moving piece of work. When a friend asked me to go to the Young Messiah I was quite interested yet shocked after the interlude by the difference between the traditional and this work. While I would mention that there are two songs that I believe do not do justice to the original and are not well done, It would be notable to point out that the rest of the songs are done quite well. Anyone who is familiar with gospel artists Sandi Patti and Steve Green will find them both in this recording as well as other well-known artists. Mr. Green's song, Refiner's Fire, will move you as does Steven Curtis Chapman's rendition of Who Shall Stand. Nice CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Production","review":"Having sung Handel's original work and this one, I'm blessed to have found both to be in praise of the Messiah. For those who find any interpretation other than the composer's original sacriledge, I'd skip The Young Messiah. But for those of us who find beauty in music based in scripture, this should not disappoint. It's upbeat, moving and clearly still tells the greatest story ever told.

In this movie we get a deeper look into the lives of Greg , Amira, and Jay.We also meet some very interesting new characters that add to the drama and excitement. Some people complained about the ending, but i actually lied it. Like with the first movie , writer director Roger Omeus left the audience with the feeling that there is more to come. I know I would want to see how Greg juggles fatherhood and his wandering sexuality, how Faybien and Lonnie adapt to a relationship, and if Amira actually ept her man past the final credits.The one missing element of coursr would be Jay, but eerily and ironically, the last image we saw of him in the film would lead us to believe that he met a bad end.Finding Me Truth is worth watching and owning.

There were WAY too many story lines going on and once, and when they all came to a head nothing made sense. \\"Finding Me: Truth\\" did have great potential.

It's a story that shows its characters flaws and really gets the reader into their hearts. Sure, the story meanders at times, and Jessie is obsessed with her own problems (tell me someone who isn't at times because life's problems can be overwhelming -- just watch any talk show on tv and you'll see more whining there than anywhere in this novel), but if you've gone through a midlife crisis (I sure did), you'll relate to Jessie's worries about her \\"perfect\\" life and \\"perfect\\" good husband, and whether that's really what she wants out of life.

Now the heat from your computer can go nowhere other than the laptop stand. And as it is a type of plastic is starts to smell after using it for a longer time. So it is certainly not a a laptop cooler.Also i would have appreciated it when the bottom material would have been able to mould more around your legs. Now it is just something hard on top of your legs that is quite unstable.

I was a bit concerned that it might look a little weird or if it would be too bulky at first, but its curve actually makes writing in my laptop easier -- the fact that it keeps my legs nice and cool is a big plus also. :)As far as storing goes, you can only put very thin things in there... my mouse won't fit in there unless I force it (but then taking it out is kind of annoying) and my big bulky AC adapter won't fit in there either. But if cables bother you, the \\"storing space\\" is definitively convenient because you just let them pass underneath you; it's like they're not even there. Actually, the main purpose of the storage space I've given it is for easier handling as I carry it around...Anyway, YES.

We killed the only indigenous democracy back in 1953. The coup is part of the history, but another important fact pointed out by the author is true to date and should be a major national security concern to every US citizen. As smart as we think our government is, it is constantly and successfully being manipulated to act in the interest of foreign governments and enterprises. Next time you hear the representative of a foreign government claiming \\"we share common values\\", watch out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceedingly partial report on the Mossadeq era","review":"Kinzer is a journalist in the worst sense of the word: unfortunately, his report is exceedingly one-sided as he relies only on the reports of one or two instensely pro-Mossadeq scholars, completely ignoring other sources and especially Royalist people, some of whom are still alive and could have been reached for comment. Kinzer doesnt even speak Farsi (Persian), and thus did not have any access to authentic Iranian sources, except through his two pro-Mossadeq helpers.This book is actually a tragedy, as the material is very sensetive and it being treated in such a frivolous manner is rather insulting.I would wholeheartedly recommend James Bill's \\"The Eagle and the Lion\\" instead of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure and a cynical book","review":"This book is written thru a leftist prespective and is full of resentment for the late Shah of Iran and the United States of America. The author thinks the entire terrorism thing is a result of 1953 coup against PM Mossadeq but the truth to the matter is that the hatred for the west existed hundreds of years before the events of 1953 or even 1979 for that matter. Radical Islamic terrorists hated the western way of life way before the 1953 coup. And the author fails to grab this fact. Yes, the coup was a mistake but when we put it in Iranian historical context it was a wise and important decision. Shah put PM Mossadeq in power in 1951 and when he asked Mossadeq to resign, he resisted and it resulted in the ugly events of 1953. Had Mossadeq resigned, there wouldn't be any coup and there would not be any problem at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance may be bliss when Iran is concerned","review":"While I respect Mr.Kinzer's points regarding the coup and Mossadegh, but once again comes another book that demonizes the Shah. Although he was not an ideal leader, why is it that the US condemned the Shah's SAVAK and human rights conditions when many countries in the West, as well as Turkey, have committed worse? Why does the US and other human rights organizations not fully condemn the Iranian government? It is frustrating to read another account by someone on the outside who had no insider's view of the real events. It is no woder that most Iranians believe in conspiracy theories that the US/Britain had a hand in establishing the Islamic government in Iran. It is a true tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the shah's men","review":"A bunch of lies, just para-phrasing Kermit roosvel't account of the situation in Iran during mossadegh's premiership. Mossadegh has hurt Iran like no other by not accepting the best offers regarding oil when he could. Our country is still paying for his mistakes. The writter Is obviously not an expert on iran's history but I understand this was a profitable issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good synopsis of the 20th century","review":"Kinzer's work reads well and presents good scholarship on the historical background behind the current Iranian regime. It puts in light the actions of the great powers in nations after World War One and exposes the \\"meddling\\" of nation / companies and their arrogance in dealing with citizens of a nation. While you will not find the \\"roots\\" of middle eastern terrorism in this book, you will discover the origins of our present animosity with Iran.The political bravery of Mohammed Mosedegh is particularly moving as are the various machiniations of the political parties within Iran. The present dominance fo the mullahs may not be long for this world if (as of Spring 2007) their economy continues to sputter. Pick up this book as a great adjunct to Persian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borrowed time","review":"Very good book, well worth reading, that shows conclusively that too many people have, do and will sell out their own blood for their own selfish short term gains at a much greater cost long term to themselves and to too many others. Education + Enlightenment x Circumstances - Pathetic mere mortal human baseness = Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happend to Mossadegh?","review":"The topline in this book is quite simple, how does Kermit Roosevelt, working for the CIA, execute the role model regime change operation in Iran in 1953, replacing the Time Man of the Year, Mohammed Mossadegh, with Mohammed Reza Shah.I usually like Kinzer's writing style, having read his columns for years in the New York Times. He uses the same Graham Greene model of fast narration, time shifts and strong characterization to build the suspense in this novel.The couple of negative points are that he has not drawn much inference from this episode to other geopolitical events of the world and what are the cause-effects of this incident. Hopefully, we will wait for the sequel.All in all, well worth a read.Fred G. Sanford"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced and engaging, but occasionally shallow view","review":"I found this an engaging and entertaining read, although at times it really felt (1) like Kinzer was glossing over what I thought were events important enough to warrant more details (like the legislative maneuvering between the Shah and Mossadegh, etc.) and (2) that Kinzer was writing a hagiography of Mossadegh, and a rather undetailed one at that. The period when Mossadegh was in retreat was barely mentioned other than in passing via a quote, describing his behavior as mostly \\"carping\\" - I think more of what shaped his views during this period would have helped give a more rounded view of the man.But the book is a good read, and it's an important series of events for Americans to understand, and on the whole, I thought this an excellent account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strips the Empires Bare","review":"This book is a great read if you want a solid background to Western involvement in Iran and how oil has guided imperialism since the early 20th century. It shines a not-so-favorable light on some big political names(Churchhill, Eisenhower, the Dulles brothers) and provides insight to shortsighted foreign policy. The domino effect of decisions made by the political players and western oil are clearly laid bare. Anyone truly interested in the current Middle East situation should have this book on their short list. There is a lot of food for thought here."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening!","review":"fascinating read. great intro to Iranian history from ancient times to modern. Very in-depth and enlightening as well. British colonial arrogance and American tunnel vision lead to overthrow of the first democratic government in the Middle East.

Kezner describes not only the overthrow concocted by CIA, but the previous events of early Iranian history, British colonialism, corrupt oil deals, and the future ramifications of the overthrow.This book is a very concise history book. Out of the 200 pages, only about fifty concern the actual overthrow. It's much less a description of the overthrow than a sociological and psychological description and analysis of how the revolution occurred and whether it was a viable option to combat communism, or just an excuse to exploit a small country.All in all, it's a very concise, informative, insightful read which strangely mirrors many of today's current events. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"Book shows Persian (Iranian) had a nice recovered democracy in 1950's then British&American wanted to have a pro-country and regime therefore they screw it up.

I must confess being completely ignorant of Middle East history prior to reading this. This was a very enlightening book, written in a way that is almost like reading a novel. I read it in 2 days.As an American, this book helps me to understand why many in the Middle East hold us in such poor esteem, and how we ourselves have contributed to this sorry state of affairs.This book should be suggested reading in high school or college history classes. It has certainly made me want to learn more about Iran and about the Middle East in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important History","review":"Both of Kinzer's books about US covert actions in the 50's (his other is Bitter Fruit, all about how the CIA engineered the downfall of the democratically elected government there that was threatening the monopolies and virtual feudal control of the United Fruit Company) cover moments in history that are coming back to haunt us. Two of today's big 'issues,' the tumult in the Middle East and Immigration, are deeply affected by these events. I highly recommend both books to anyone willing to take a warts-and-all view of American foreign policy and how the zeal to defeat Communism helped corporate interests co-op patriots and government agencies to do their dirty work."},{"rating":"2","title":"explains the tension between Iran and the US","review":"The CIA's 1953 coup of the democratically inclined Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh sets up the roots for Iran's current distrust of the U.S.For more on the relationship between Iran and the U.S., check out the memoirIran Awakening: One Woman's Journey to Reclaim Her Life and Country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Job Well Done.","review":"Mr Kinzer has done a great job of writing a book that describes the events surronding the coup. While it would have been nice to have a deeper analysis of the events from today's perspective I can understand that it would have all been speculation. No one knows what lead to what. However, in Mr Kinzer's book it is clear that greed destroyed the dream of democracy and self determination.I have read many books on Iranian history and have researched the coup in depth, I noticed that Mr Kinzer had used some of the same resources and that was reassuring. As I read his book I was happy with his historical facts.An excellent book for today's world leaders as they deal with the huge humber of problems we have in the world.Well done Mr. Kinzer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled,","review":"was convincing the world he didn't exist.This book haunts me. Here we are in an age where we're made to believe that the Evil ones are those terrorists against us. While I agree with the evils of terrorism, I can't help but notice the obviousness of anti-American and anti-British sentiments. Its like we've been bullying around the entire world for the sake of keeping 'Commies' at bay, and expect no blowback in return. I love my country and I love my government, and would never want to see it go. Instead, I want to see it get stronger in heart.

After the WWII, The British lost their power to engage in the world affairs directly, but with the help of the newly emerged power of the United States they pursued their old ways and lured the Americans into carrying out their dirty tricks. Unfortunatley, it is us Americans that have to pay the price, it is our flag being burned in every single Middle Eastern capital, it's our servicemen and women being killed daily in Iraq and Afghanistan. I hope that our politicians take a note of this historic event and read into the British hidden agendas in dealing with world affairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding book","review":"Outstanding book.

I feel that I have a better understanding of our relationship with the Middle East due to a better sense of the historical perspective beginning in the 1950's. Fear of the large Soviet superpower was the underlying theme to get our action- however the root cause was Western greed for Iran's oil resources and our inability to get Britain to offer them a fair compensatory arrangement. Mossadegh seems to have been a good leader despite his stubborn nature and thick headed actions.

Ask Iranians if they prefer to go back to the 1970s rather then live in an Islamofascist society where women are crushed and everyone is poor and people were used like cattle in the war with Iraq. This book is wrong. The Shah helped his people and it was necceary for us to support his maintaining his throne. Moossedeq was a brutal monster who wanted to abuse human rights as much if not more so then the shah and steal the money foriegners ahd invested in the country.

Well, something went wrong with the motor in our 8250 around Christmas time and it became very noisy. We sent it in to BenQ January 29. It has been in the shop for a month now! This is inexcusable, considering they advertise a warranty that guarantees a replacement within 48 hours if there are problems in the first year.

The one we use more (now has 1000 hours on it) complained that its air filter needed cleaning, but still worked fine.The one annoying thing about this model is that the only way to switch inputs is to put up with a blue screen while it rotates through all the inputs (there are about a half dozen). If you switch to a second input, and then back, you see all six inputs. If you have more than two signals coming in, it gets worse, because you have to wait until it finds a signal you don't want, displays the picture, and then press the 'Source' button on the remote TWICE before it starts looking for another input.I would buy this unit again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money","review":"Battery died fast - within about 6 weeks, won't accept a charge anymore.

It did more to cause me to have to relive the pain again than heal the grief. I was so upset by this book I wrote the organization that recommended the book and requested the local bookstore I purchased it from take it off the shelf in fear of the damage it might do to someone else.

I build computers and you out there with all that tech squak, give me a break. 10 stars to the builders of this game you guys are the best hands down, keep up the good work and look forward to everything you do, Quake Wars is looking sweet. Oh by the way Fear was supose to be a system hog Not! My system flys on high settings,keep your system clean and have a great Power Supply Lots of ram great hard drives and you should be able to run anything out there. If your a FPS Fan get this game it will blow you away, its huge Fear was short this game is long, and can play it again and again on easy norm and hard setting.Major2much"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't Bought It","review":"I had to reboot twice to get this installed. 'Way too much work for a so-so game. Pretty graphics, boring gameplay. Shoot-it-up, fine. I started shoot-em-ups with the original Wolfenstein. It was immeasurably better than this. I wish that it was the old 'try-before-you-buy' days. I wouldn't have bought. Find another...better would be easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game as awaited.","review":"Hi,I was waiting for Quake 4 for quite a time and followed the stages of development to release, and what i was excpecting was wooooooooooo.The game is so interactive and much fun having a squad with you making it so real, the game resulution is wonderfull such as D-III and the game play is YEAH !!!.Believe me prepare your PC for this Game to get the best of it, as im playing with a LogitTech MX1000 and a VGA Nvidia FX 5200 and a 5.1 sound system.To me little money is worth it for this game.The same thing i said on Doom III review is \\"Great Job ID Software\\";)"},{"rating":"1","title":"From classic to atractive","review":"La saga Quake siempre a sido de las mejores y a pesar de ke fue saturada con la 3ra entrega, esta 4ta entrega concluye la trama original ke se vio en Quake 2. Esta vez no estara uno solo, sino ke la potente AI de los NPC te ayudaran a sobrevivir y revelar la trama del juego hasta su \\"final\\". Con las mismas graficas ke relucieron en Doom3, Quake 4 se ve mejor aun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality.","review":"The sound quality of these CD's is so poor, I listened to them once and ended up throwing them out in the garbage. Sure, they're cheap-but you get what you pay for. It's a shame too because the material is so good. BUYER BEWARE-STAY AWAY from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inferior to the first \\"Scanners\\", but an overall solid sci-fi sequel.","review":"A scanner is hired to use his psychic powers to influance the government officials of a city on order for unscrupulous authorities to take control, and hopefully to assist in the creation of a new order of scanners.\\"Scanners II\\" has a solid, simple plot, though a few elements are recycled from the first (namely the good scanner vs bad scanner sub-plot), but it's main problem is the pacing. Several scenes are slow and a few even screech to a halt. But overall there's a fair amount of entertaining action set pieces to go along with the plot, not to mention a pleasing amount of graphic violence for gorehounds.Despite some slow spots and a slightly muddled plot, this is otherwise worth every minute for a look, for fans of the first \\"Scanners\\" and sci-fi fans in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in its own right","review":"Not as good as the original and a tad lacking in FX even by the standards of the period the film was very watchable, my second time in recent times, and has that feel good feel from the 80s and 90s. The original was better by far, as is the case with most sequels, but still recommended here even by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"For some reason this computer is Extremely slow. It takes about 6 minutes to boot, 1 minute to shut down, 90 seconds to open ITunes, 30 seconds to open Firefox browser, 15 seconds to open a file, and it hangs up constantly!If anyone knows why, I'd like to find out.This is my first Vista, although my 9th laptop, and I own another 20 desktops. Definitely considered throwing out the window at times. Frustrating!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After changing Vista for XP, works fine","review":"I included an extra memory order to be able to use this computer, nevertheless, Vista exasperated me soon. I downgraded to XP just to realize that it was almost impossible to get all the required drivers. A search over the internet for the drivers revealed that it was a common practice to downgrade and there are places offering the full set on packages, since Toshiba is not supporting downgrades.I'm rating this as 4 star since, after the downgrade, it has been working just fine, fast, silent, reliable, with a great antenna for wifi, brilliant display and giving a great user experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem with BIOS, customer service is HORRIBLE","review":"While trying to boot up my laptop one day, it came upon a black screen with a box that said 'enter password'. Turns out this model and many other Toshiba models has a problem with its BIOS resetting the password. The only way to fix it is to take it to an authorized repair center, or to send it into Toshiba. The ONLY repair center in my area would not take it, so I had to send it into Toshiba. The UPS store charged me to ship it, as well.When I got my laptop back, none of the USB ports worked! I was told over the phone that the only way to fix this was to completely re-install Windows, thereby losing all of my files and programs.The Toshiba customer service and tech support never offered any solutions or trouble shooting. This laptop is low in price, but if anything ever goes wrong with it, YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},R={key:1};function C(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",W,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-302f80f1"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/12.md","filePath":"quotesmag/12.md"}'),N={name:"quotesmag/12.md"},G=Object.assign(N,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
