It is fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book brings history TO LIFE!!!","review":"I have learned more about this part of English history from this book, than I ever learned in school. The book is well written, interesting and portrays a believable account of the life of Henry VIII. The story starts from when Henry was a boy,and goes up until a little after his death. The detail in the book and the way it was written make it difficult to forget the history. Do not be swayed by the length of the book, it is enthralling and interesting in its entirety. Ms. George has given me a new perspective on King Henry VIII and all his wives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of George's 3 books","review":"This was definately the best of Margaret George's books (followed by Cleopatra and then Mary). It took a little while to get into, but it was worth it overall. A good book that brought Henry and his wives to life. If you don't like long books, then don't even start this one just to complain later that it was way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry VIII","review":"Probably the best book I have read about Henry VIII and I have read many fiction and nonfiction. The author includes almost everything that Henry VIII did. It is a fascinating book. I couldn't put it down which mean I didn't do my housework or sleep at night. Told so much about his castles, Hampton Court, tournaments, wives, political leaders like Cromwell and Cranmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sympathetic take of Henry VIII","review":"Henry VIII, known for chopping off a number of his wives' heads, gets a sympathetic reading from Ms. George, and in the meantime, we get another look at what made Henry tick. He was mean and selfish and obviously let his \\"heart\\" rule his head, and thereby hangs the tale since divorce is/was frowned upon by the Catholic Church, which he wound up dismantling in order to have his way. The rule of the Tudors altered present-day history, which is what makes this royal family so interesting since their origins were so plebian (to royal folk.) I highly recommend this historical fiction novel to anyone who loves English history; this book is in my own library and I've read it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry really DID write this book!","review":"This was a wonderful book. Margaret George knows how to make you feel as though you were right there. It felt like I was actually reading his diary. It was very interesting and sad to see how Henry changed over the years.I have never read a historical novel before, and it made me want to read more of this type of novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read!","review":"This is a very good read which Amazon sent me in excellent condition!

After reading multiple books on the wives, from their perspectives as well as omnipotent perspectives, I decided to take a look at what Henry himself might have been thinking. Wow! It was amazing. I love that Margaret George tore apart the most common myths about this king, and revealed what was probably a very accurate picture of his thoughts.Margaret George is an amazing author, all of her books are marvelous. Read them all, but start with Henry VIII!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"In my opinion, I found this novel to be enlightening, thought provoking, and interesting. My mother has always been a Tudor fanatic, and I presume she passed it on to me. I found this to be a book rich with good information about this era, and would highly recommend it to others fascinated by the House of Tudor.This book is compromised of works written by Henry himself, and fillings by Margaret George where the story does not match up. READ THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry VIII with notes...","review":"This is, by far, was the best historical fiction book that I have ever read! I read Philippa Gregory books before this book and it was so much fun to tie the entire time period and characters together. If you have ever had any interest in the life of King Henry VIII this book is definitely for you! You won't want it to end even though it is over 900 pages. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This excellent, although very long, book is a must read if you enjoy historical fiction. Written in the form of Henry's diary - with asides from his fool, you get a possible glimpse of the man, trapped in his destiny. I ended up with a degree of empathy for him (although rather more for his headless wives).It it beautifully written, engrossing, sometimes gross, thoroughly entertaining. Perfect fodder for a rainy weekend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Point of View","review":"This is an excellent book that honestly presents the culture and thoughts of the time of Henry VIII. The author admits that she must take some liberties, but she has done thorough research.

I encourage anyone, who likes Englisih History, to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love this book. I am still reading it and have trouble putting it down. It gives you an overview of the times without feeling like a history book (which it is not, of course). I am living in Germany right now and am fascinated with this era. This book makes me want to travel to the UK and investigate all of the areas mentioned. Learning about the religious movement as well as all of the wives is wonderful. Thank you Ms. George! I will buy your other books soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"Not being a historical reader, I mainly focus my reading in the fantasy genre, I got this book as a gift. At first the thickness overwhelmed me but as soon as I started reading I found it hard to put down. Whether historically accurate or not, I leave that up to the professionals, I definately enjoyed Henry and Will telling their story with embellishments and all, for who am I to say what actually happened for I wasn't there. I marvel at the amount of research that Margaret George put into the work and praise her for the unique perspective into the world of early 16th century English Royal Court. Even for casual readers like myself this was a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best novel I've read in a long time","review":"I've been reading my law textbooks for so long that I feel guilty to read anything \\"fun.\\" With this book, I liked that I was actually learning while enjoying the story - and the story was amazing. Henry VIII had such an amazing and interesting life, and the author is very talented. I've been reading quite a bit of the history now that I've finished with the book, and I'm very happy to find that there were no liberties taken with the history from what I can tell. I'm no Tudor historian, but the hours I've spent studying the period since finishing the book haven't turned up any differences (except perhaps with the nature of his relationship with his last wife, but that seems to be up for debate anyway).I can't say enough good things about this book. If you're like me and have a hard time enjoying a novel guilt free, then this may be a good book for you - justification through education!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel so far","review":"I am loving this novel. After reading 'The Other Boleyn Girl', which was so badly written and poorly researched, this one is far superior. It has detail in abundance and the narrative feels very real and true. The characters live. After seeing some of 'The Tudors' on TV, a mix of good and trashy, I read some academic research into the period and this imagined autobiography of Henry XIII brings the historical facts to life in a very convincing and entertaining way. I am still at Henry's youth but so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Autobiography of Henry VIII","review":"I am very much enjoying this book. I was a little concerned since it is somewhat of a history book but feel it is well written. I am enjoying learning about the 1500's and his life.

But the book is well written, easy to read and have been very glad I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

It has an automatic shutoff when the register is not being used continuously (to save your batteries) and cannot be turned on again unless you remove the \\"c\\" batteries and reinstall them. Also, the on/off switch is beneath the paper tape cover which makes it inconvenient because you have to rethread the paper tape through the cover opening.

It was more sex and physical attraction more than romance and just having the two of them alone drove me mad, and I had to ask, where's everybody? where's the emotion? Michelle acted at impulses and by sleeping with Jake just because made me lose my respect for her as a mother in the quest to find her child. She was too FORWARD. Kind of making woman look bad.

However, this DVD has been poorly edited together and omits key plot moments that are sure to leave those unfamiliar with the storyline bewildered. And, in all honesty, new viewers are the only ones who this release would appeal to. Fans of \\"Dark Shadows\\" will more than likely already own the episodes, and there's simply no reason to waste money on something like this.

Lots of pics and intelligent texts make a very important catalogue of new insights in art history.

I was greatly disappointed after the reviews I had read. The characters were two-dimmensional and lacked believability. By telling the story from the Dollmage's point of view, Leavitt had an opportunity to use hindsight in her description of characters. However, the narrator and the characters bumble along in their own self-pity (the Dollmage) or in their all too frequently stated faults. In a good novel, the characters are three-dimensional and their actions can be mostly understood in regards to their character. Martine Leavitt rushes past the developement of her characters and therefore leaves the readers behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give it 6 stars?","review":"Ok, I have read a lot of good books on MS tech.

Most guest singers were sad and cannot be compared to him so this review might not be fair. Andrea Bocelli was superb. Laura Pausini sang off key, so did Sting and some others. The floutist was truly superb however. Zucchero was terrific while singing a duet with the Maestro and another piano solo. It was spiritual and quite a surprise that Christian songs were chosen in Muslim ruled Jordan. Sherril Milnes sang a couple Christian songs at the beginning the program.....also very nice.

Skil currently makes less then par products, but with this exception. This saw is the industry standard. I see the MAG77 and the regular HD77 on every construction site. I like the HD77 because it is a little smoother then the MAG77 due to the heavier steel casing, which means no kickback and a stonger, more solid feel.

My old circ saw wasn't great, and I used my miter saw or table saw much more than my circ saw.The first replacement tool I bought was this - a friend has the DeWalt version of it, which I like, but after looking around I chose this over it. I made the right choice. As soon as I got it home I tested it by ripping some 2\\" thick hickory and oak scraps into chunks for grilling and it cut through them without a problem (I used to only use my table saw for this sort of thing). This is a great saw, and even though it is heavier than sidewinder saws the increased torque make it much easier to handle, and to me the weight of it helps it track accurately. Last weekend I was ripping a lot of 2 X 10s to a 35 degree angle and ended up just following the pencil line instead of clamping a fence onto the joists - the saw just feels right, and that makes it so much easier to make a good cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"a painful tale","review":"This story of from a mother's point of view of her son dying of AIDS is painful to read.

But Ferrell's Harold Krick shows a level of intelligence and maturity you'd never expect him to have. He's not some crass, overgrown child pretending to be a grown-up. He is a grown-up. A real, sympathetic, and still serious role.Krick lives a controlled, but drab life as an IRS auditor. Until one day he hears a narration voice in his head. He discovers he's a character in a novel, one which will eventually kill him. Emma Thompson is the neuorotic author Kay Eiffel and Queen Latifah is her somewhat protective assistant. Added into the mix are a delightful Dustin Hoffman, and a less delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal. All still put on a tremendous effort. I also enjoyed the continual phantom numbers and calculations, interesting touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and thoughtful film","review":"Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah and Dustin Hoffman are perfectly cast in this story of a man who discovers he's a fictional character whose creator is about to kill him off.

I'm still not sure if the others around him were all fictional too, but in the end, it's not a flaw in the story. Just something to ponder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I was pleasantly surspised by this movie! Will Ferell did a wonderful job. He was shickingly serious but still commical.

Harold finds challenge between learning to live and to love, while also seeking out an answer for who is responsible for the voice in his head, and ultimately, his imminent death.Your heart will truly be warmed in this unique take on theinterconnectedness between us all, so if you don't like Will Ferrell, then set your prejudices aside temporarily.This is not just a waylay from Will's usual typecast, it's undoubtedly his best acting role to date and he's supported by an unusual, but equally effective and enjoyable ensemble of costars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Low-Key Performance By Ferrell","review":"Most times, I find it interesting to watch a comedian pay a dramatic role.

The highlight involves the purchase of a guitar, and the performance of a song (one that i prayed when spoken of would be \\"Fred's Slacks\\", but was not).

There were superb acting from all supporting actors -- the luminous Maggie Gyllenhaal, the always excellent Emma Thompson, and to a degree, Hoffman.

And the acting? Wonderful turns by all. Tony Hale...great supporting character. Queen Latifah...did her best with a limited role. Maggie Gyllenhaal...radiated sincerity and a funky integrity. Dustin Hoffman...earnestly professorial and as deadpan as you get. Emma Thompson...perfect voice for this film as she poured herself entirely into her character.

Yes, it is a bit weird. I liked that. And the characters are beyond great. They are all quirky in entirely different ways. Emma Thompson, as the tortured author, was, to me, astounding. Will Ferrell's understated performance (SO unlike most of his stuff!) made his emotions - when they finally surfaced - just that much more aching. And Dustin Hoffman, with his matter-of-fact (okay - ruthless) assessment of Ferrell's plight was almost shocking in its coldness.This is a movie where people change, because their lives touch. An emotional thriller, a comedy, a drama, a rollercoaster - all rolled into a movie that is content to appear unassuming. A true feel-good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably Will's Best Work","review":"The statement above can be argued, but Stranger Than Fiction is for sure one of Will Ferrel's best films. Like what the Truman Show did for Jim Carrey, Stranger Than Fiction has taken an actor who is mainly known for comedy and has proven that he can also be believable in serious drama roles as well. Not to say that this film doesn't have its funny moments, but there is also a lot of depth in the story and it is easy to feel for the characters.Needless to say because of the star power in the film, the acting was equally as impressive. Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifa and the list goes on from there. There were moments in the movie that had me laughing a while after the jokes was done, and there are scenes that are so emotional, it made me want to tear up and cry.

This unusual story about a man who discovers he is a character in a novel being written by the Emma Thompson character was sweet, tender and dare I say, heartwarming. Love Maggie Gyllenhaal too.

Really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Ferrell is normal this time","review":"In his past movies, Will Ferrell has taken up roles which portray him as a wild and sarcastic funny character, such as in Elf and Anchorman. However, this time he actually pretends to be a normal person with unusual problems. Although the film is categorized under \\"comedy\\", I did not see that many jokes being made or find myself laughing that much. But the humor that is included here is more of a subtle type, where other people act weird and the audience can relate to Will's reactions. Overall the movie was enjoyable to watch, with both Maggie Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman giving great performances. It's not award-winning material, but at least you can be entertained while seeing Will in a different light than before. The cookie scene was hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreal! ( =art)","review":"There are only a handful of movies that I can watch over and over. And this is one of them, very close to the top of the list. (Others that come to mind are the 1st Back to the Future and Matrix episodes, Hitchcock's Rear Window, Mary Popins (sans the animated bit) and The Fifth Element.)These films are not diminished by multiple viewing, in fact, it enhances them.Everything works in this film: Will Ferrell's understated acting is in delicious counterpoint to the warmth, and girlish spikishness of Gyllenhaal. Likewise Thompson and Latifah. The dialogue is quirky and quick so that it still surprises even at the 10th sitting. One is constantly being tempted to draw metaphysical conclusions along the way, only to be brought back into the zany reality of the film by the gentle humor of the script.Get it. Unlike many others, it keeps on giving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Suess type of movie","review":"The movie was like watching a Dr. Suess movie for the first hour until he visits the actual writer of the book.This movie is woth the watching time ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"It is rare that a film comes along which not only appeals to my fascination for the surreal but can also be watched by my mother-in-law. This is one of those.Will Ferrell is not in bizarre comic mode like in many of his other films. In this he plays a boring guy reacting to strange situations like pretty much everyone else would, and he does it brilliantly.My only criticism is that the humour is mostly reserved for a few laugh our loud moments and is absent for much of the rest. Plus Queen Latifa's character is pretty redundant and adds nothing to the film other than to get the writer to talk about what she is thinking.All in all, a great film"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to pass a couple of hours","review":"If you think about movies that have been classified as \\"quirky,\\" some recent ones that might come to mind are Garden State and Little Miss Sunshine. Stranger Than Fiction is in a category all its own, though no less quirky than the aforementioned, and if you liked either or both of those, then you'll probably have a great time with this. Maggie Gyllenhaal was terrific and well cast; and as other reviewers have mentioned, even if you're not much a Will Ferrell fan, you'll probably enjoy Stranger Than Fiction. And if you do, be sure to check out his SNL video, just the audition part. Truly hilarious, and 'quirky' doesn't even begin to do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Delight","review":"This film brilliantly navigated questions about life, death, and the reason we're here. The excellent acting, fresh plotline and witty dialogue (and monologue) made for a wonderful time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie.","review":"This is truly a great movie.At the beginning of the film I was starting to get rather bored and bogged down with all the talks of numbers and the personification of Harold Crick (Will Ferrell)'s wristwatch, but as the movie progressed I found it very touching and entertaining. Ferrell, Hoffman and Gyllenhaal do an amazing acting job, and they really make you feel as if you know them. Queen Latifa and Emma Thompson presented pretty much run of the mill throw away roles, and I really would have been happy with a lot less of them in the movie. The extra features really weren't that great either, and the deleted scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor, but when the ending credits came up, I really did leave with the feeling of \\"that was an awesome movie.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start, but worth watching","review":"The first twenty minutes of this film had me somewhat bored but i hung in there and was pleasantly surprised. will farrell is impressive and it's nice to see a side of his abilities that does not scream slapstick. emma t could polish shoes and make it entertaining, so that goes w/o saying. the relationship between maggie g's baker character and farrell's harold is off-beat and believable. look for an almost unrecognizable tom hulce as harold's useless IRS in house shrink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Grade Acting, Wonderfully Different Story","review":"With a cast like this, who cares about the story? Fortunately, the story also works well enough to keep us more than interested. \\"Harold\\" hears the author of his own story in his head. We follow him on his quest to find the source of the voice. Emma Thompson is brilliant as the tortured writer who feels she has killed her characters and ergo, guilty of murder. Very quirky and full of surprises, I found Stanger than Fiction a real gem. Will Ferrell is brilliant as well. Great DVD to pick up when you're not quite sure what to see but wish for something surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Funny . . . And Odd","review":"I loved this movie. It is funny and odd, but it has a lot of heart to it. The writing is so good that my friends and I thought at first that it must be adapted from a larger work, such as a book. The characters are that well crafted and the story that unique. These are not things most comedies bother with at present. Now, I'm calling this a comedy, but it will pull on your emotions a bit. Its all worth it though. The acting is great, which is not unexpected given the cast. If you love movies and are looking for something kind of different and original this is a good way to go. A really fun film to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Farrell's best work so far","review":"I am not a fan of little movies that have a weak plot and clobber you over the head with a message, which I assumed this movie would be. However, I am a fan of Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah. The strange thing is (no pun intended), while they are both as good as ever, the actor who is stunning is Will Ferrell. He pulls you in almost immediately and you follow along because you care about him (and 'watch', lest we forget). I don't think this movie would work at all without him or that anyone else I can think of could have played Harold. (DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE.) That said, I also have to disagree with the reviewers who have had a problem with the ending. The ending is exactly right because everyone's priorities finally get straightened out and because the ending fits with the point of the story. The ending is the message. I loved it, watched it immediately a second time to notice things I'd missed the first time and will buy a copy to keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost gem","review":"Whar a marvelous little movie! It's literate and thoughtful: a dangerous cobination for Hollywood box office returns. Similar to \\"Little Miss Sunshine,\\" it doesn't go into any preconceived directions. We think we know where it's headed but we don't.Emma Thompson looks absolutely awful--and that's a compliment! She's not afraid to go without makeup and take on the character's ragged appearance. I loved the scenes between Dustin Hoffman and Farrell.Sometimes the smartest people just get it all wrong.My guess is that Will Farrell's name was enough to keep many people away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken by Sony Copy Protection","review":"The movie itself was pretty good - however, there is a good chance this movie will not play in your DVD player.Sony added a new copy protection scheme to this DVD which causes the movie to be unplayable in many DVD players. Many different players from different manufacturers are affected. I learned of this problem after it did not work in my RCA DVD player, and searched on the internet and found many others with the same problem.So, there is a good chance that this movie will not be playable, and I don't recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been great.","review":"I loved this movie right up to the end. It could have been great. It worked hard to deliver a profound message, but then it wimped out and decided the audience would prefer a warm-fuzzy, narcissistic, clich�� and ultimately empty happy ending. The 4 stars are because I enjoyed the movie so much up to that point, and it's easy to stop the movie early and pretend I had been given something to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT - considering the film stars Wil Ferrel and Dustin Hoffman. The plot revolves around a single IRS man who one days starts hearing a voice and realises she is an author who is writing a book which is actually his life, in all this he also falls for a chick he is doing a tax audit, but once he realises that the author is going to kill him off he goes about to try and stop it - no prizes for how it ends - the laughs are few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"SONY MAKING NON-PLAYABLE DVD'S","review":"As did Mr. Bob Dobolina in his review, I got ZILCH when I attempted to play this dvd. Assuming it was a defective disc, I took it back to the video store and got another one. It wouldn't play either. I recently tried a third time with a third dvd. I'll be avoiding Sony dvd's as well as it seems their product has a design flaw. CONSUMER ALERT- SONY SELLING DEFECTIVE DVD's WITH DESIGN FLAWS="},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"That's exactly how this movie left me feeling. Separately, all the actors in this movie are gifted, and I enjoy them, but put them together and all you get is a slow, left of center movie that at the end of the day, just doesn't work. It's a shame too because this movie had nothing but possibilities, yet failed to live up to any of them. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stranger Than Fiction","review":"This video played to a crucial point and then IT QUIT. This was a birthday present for my daughter. We had to drive to the video store and rent it so she could see the end. The seller did reimburse us for the video, but we had to pay for the shipping. I will never buy a used video from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snooze fest!","review":"I rented this movie last night and was so bored. But I kept watching in hopes that it would get better. It didn't.I rated this movie as a one star, but that is being far too generous. It would've only gotten half a star, if that were an option, but only because I was stupid enough to rent it.Harold should have been hit by the bus at the beginning of the movie to put me (and others who felt the same as myself) out of my/our misery.Will Ferrell is admitted not one of my favorite actors, but his talents were put to waste on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mmmh... thanks, but no.","review":"Vacuous, pretentious and annoyingly predictable. You can tell how and when this movie is going to end looong before the end actually comes. To top it all, Will Ferrel just can't play dramatic roles... but is this a drama? I guess Marc Forster and Zach Helm just invented a new genre: the 'feelgood' artsy film. I only wish i'd spent fictitious money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a used copy.","review":"I was worried about ordering a used movie but this was in very good condition, almost like new. I could tell that it had barely been used so it was a great bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"Stranger Than Fiction is one of my favorite movies. It is sweet and poignant and hilarious. Must see if you haven't yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A meditation on life, art, and romance","review":"Stranger Than Fiction is about Harold, a tax auditor who has no close relationships and compulsively lives by the clock, counting the number of times he brushes his teeth and the steps he takes to the bus. He begins to hear a voice in his head narrating his life as it is happening. He seeks counsel from a shrink and a literature professor and discovers that the author whose voice he hears always kills her heroes. But life is just getting interesting for Harold, who is falling in love with Ana, a baker he is auditing. So he seeks out the author to negotiate with her to let him live. Stranger Than Fiction is a meditation on life, art and romance, and on waking up to life and the kinds of responsibility we have. Will Ferrel is perfect for the role of Harold and gets great support from the cast, including Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Stranger The Fiction is a change. I don't know of any other movie like this. It has its funny points. I like the scenes with Maggie Gyllenhaal in it. I think her acting was great. I like her personalty in the movie. I'm not too crazy about Emma Thompson. She looks really bad in this movie. I know that is the way she is suppose to look, but I think she needs to grow her hair long again and throw out the lesbian look. She looked really nice in Junior."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite","review":"This is the first Miles Davis album I bought. It's very enjoyable. I have most of his albums, and I like them all.

Having said that however it is still a great composition with many pleasant passages particularly in the excellent third movement.

As others have pointed out it is almost impossible to get 100 percent accurate cuts from this saw. Tightening the lock down knob does push the blade out of alignment. The only thing you can do to improve this is to not over tighten the knob, but keeping the blade from shifting is still problematic. There is also some play in the blade which allows it to deflect slightly from the work piece, no matter how expensive or stiff a blade you use (worse when cutting hardwoods). But I've discovered that miter saws by their nature aren't accurate enough for fine work. To get extremely accurate crosscuts you need to use an accurately tuned table saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAFETY ALERT!!!! SAFETY ALERT!!!!","review":"I got my Bosch 3912 saw two months ago.

I don't overwork this saw, so I do not even know how this is possible with a left-hand thread screw.3) The blade guard assembly sticks very badly. The only remedy I have found for this is to replace the rubber gasket with a thicker one.I want to qualify my remarks by saying that Bosch is an excellent company.

Whether this was my fault or not shouldn't matter, the fact that the blade could come loose like that at all is not a good or safe design in my opinion. Another fault is the safety switch, it is difficult to push while operating. I also found the table slide to be very stiff, like metal grinding, when making adjustments on miter.

I bought the Bosch 3912B because it had every feature that I was looking for. As a cabinet and furniture maker, the extra cutting capacity and the tall fence seemed to outshine all of the competition. All of the features on this saw are mechanically sound and the quality and design meet and exceed my high expectations. I added a premium quality 80 tooth finishing blade and I must say that my mitre cuts are now smooth as glass. This is a fine machine and it is a strong contender as one of the best chopsaws on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miter Saw","review":"Great product for the price. Used to install a T&G ceiling and trim. Not sure if it would hold up to a contractors use but for a home hobbyist it should last a lifetime. Dust collection collects about 50% that is generated. Adding a shop vac instead of the bag greatly improves performance. Holding toggle clamp works great. No need to repeatidly screw in and out, saves wrist fatigue and holds well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch 3912 compound miter saw","review":"The saw seems to be of rugged construction and needed only slight adjustments. My first test cuts were very disappointing using the blade supplied. After borrowing a much better blade from a friend and professional hardwood installer the next tests cuts were much, much better. I suggest that Bosch not ship such a cheap blade with the product. That is a disservice to the overall quality of the saw. I only gave a four star rating because I have not had the opportunity to use the saw much yet. I bought it to replace interior railings and trim in my house.

Possibly the only book on the subject to seriously examine what popular interest in this subject actually says about our world. This book is not about arcana; if you're looking for new tales of crashed saucers or big-eyed Pleadians, look elsewhere. Instead, the author sheds light on questions of evidence, real government conspiracies, \\"plausible denial\\", perceptions of reality, witness veracity, televisuality, UFOs, etc., and challenges the reader to define exactly what is the \\"consensus reality\\". The chapter on the role of women during the U.S. space program and the \\"citizen witness\\" is by itself worth the price of admission. The freshest look at this topic in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important and Provocative Book","review":"This book analyses critically the implications of mediated America for democracy in America. Dean complements her earlier work on the theory of discursive democracy by starting with contemporary society, rather than theory, and then considering the theoretical implications for democracy in light of her survey of media culture. Dean finds that contemporary conditions of proliferating standards of value make it difficult to come to democratic agreement. Thus, while liberal and democratic thinkers value rational inquiry as the foundation for truth, Dean finds faith, force, and prejudice the predominant basis for accepting some claims rather than others under these current conditions. In light of some rather unfair and indeed highly ideological reviews of her work recently (the NY Rev of Books comes to mind), I am left wondering, upon completion of the book,whether such reviewers have sought to kill the messenger for daring to utter her (critical) message."},{"rating":"1","title":"cultural studies at its worst","review":"This book only incites those who have bashed the work of postmodernists and cultural studies scholars.

It seems she should have spent more time with Turabian's Manual for Writers, than surfing the web or watching Sienfeld."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful","review":"This book, quite simply, represents everything that is wrong today with the liberal arts. Dean, a political science professor, has succeeded in authoring a whole book without actually saying anything useful. One need only skip to the book's conclusory pages to realize the depths Dean has plunged in her attempted deconstruction of civilization. Yet, from her positive reviewers, we the shapeless victims of culture are told that our problems with the book stem either from our misunderstanding of its gargantuan truths, or our realization that Dean is a post-modern prophet who must be silenced. I suggest nothing so high-minded; rather, we dissenters simply know a bad book when we see one. I fear the effect of books like this, and the classes that \\"teach\\" them, on the reputation of a liberal arts education."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad commentary on the state of academic scholarship","review":"That this poor book was published by what I thought was a respectable press is bad enough, but then to see the effect that this book has had on some other academics and students (be sure to read the laughable defense of the book by one of Dean's unfortunate students above)who are willing to defend and praise it as \\"ground-breaking\\" or \\"daring\\" makes we weep for the future of the academy.

It does produce high-quality scans, but for basic word-processing printing needs, it is the worst printer I have ever owned.The biggest problem is that it doesn't take paper from the feeder properly (and I do use the kind of paper specified by the manufacturer), and as a result often jams. It consumes ink voraciously (even though I have it at the lowest ink-use setting). And (at the risk of anthropomorphizing) it is finicky: it inexplicably always wants to print test sheets and alignment sheets instead of the pages of writing that I want it to print, and it takes a very long time (and uses a lot of ink) to do so.Do not buy this printer.

Pressing the OK button on the printer somehow clears the carriage with lots of loud noises.The worst of it is that it only happens after I print, and if I don't catch it, the carriage never parks and the ink cartridges dry out.

First, They are not user friendly and are difficult to follow or get help within the program (or online). Second, it runs 2 seperate programs in order to scan and save your images to your PC. Even now, we are only able to save the images we scan about 25% of the time. My wife has asked me to reinstall our old Lexmark printer so we can sell/trash this one.I would recomend that HP review the software for this item see if someone can create a more user friendly version.

The print output looks good and is quick enough for individual use. Simple copying is easy - push one button for B&W; or one for color. I don't know how well it will last, as we just started using it.Downside - There is no separate output tray, so it is easy for printed papers to spit into the paper tray and get jumbled and possibly cause a jam.

Even after I resorted to taking PICTURES of my files and sticking the SD card into the printer, it still didn't work! The printer simply could not access my files, and it constantly screwed up my computer. If it didn't misalign my printing pages, it jammed my paper. In fact, I began counting it luck if my printer ever worked normally. And a couple of times during printing, some TINY metal gears and parts came out! I was shocked at the quality of my new printer.

The printer spams the heck out of you with ink level pop-ups, trying to get you to buy more ink. The popups aren't even accurate. The memory card slots took over the F: drive position, which was already in use on both systems. On both systems, we've experiences enormous slowdowns with MS apps. There is a 15 second delay in Excel when printing or changing print settings, and Word sometimes won't print at all. We've taken to printing to a PDF file and then sending the document to the printer because it's faster. HP support was no help. Multiple e-mails resulted in solutions that either killed the ability to scan or that directed us to options in the \\"solutions center\\" that didn't exist.

The C4280 tries to reinstall the software every single time I plug in the USB cable.

One day the printer decided it had a paper jam even though there was no paper anywhere inside it. I followed every solution provided by HP, spent hours Googling it, and alas, the paper jam message would not go away. Eventually I had to throw it out.

At first it works fine. After about 4-6 months, it suddenly died. It no longer scanned. I called up HP and they sent me another one. However, the second one also died suddenly after a few months. I was just changing the color cartridge. Afterwards I was prompted to align the cartridges. I placed the alignment page onto the scanner bed and it could not detect it after a dozen tries in every conceivable paper position possible.

I've been looking for a way to change this setting for half an hour.I'm sure there's some setting or button that will cause this scanner to scan and 8 x 10 piece of paper, and if using my printer was my full time job I'd be happy to look for it some more.

Little did I know, IT'S NOT. Beware, it took me 4 hours to install this printer on my network. This should've taken me 45 minutes tops! The main reason being that the installation CD that came WITH the printer, did not have the drivers for this printer (it had it for some other HP printer). My other 2 options were to call HP for the CORRECT cd, or download it for free online. I did the latter, which took ages because the files were huge! Then, this morning it took me an hour to print a 40 page document because this printer kept getting jammed, then I had to feed the paper manually! So all in all, I've spent 5 hours trying to maneuver this printer, and I bought it for the sole reason of convenience (aka spend little time on this thing and move on).

The songs themselves are full of musical interest. If you played them for a non-english speaking friend he'd probably think this was an excellent folk album. Then if you translated the lyrics, he'd be appalled--which is why this album is so funny. It's the interaction of the sweet (and dangerously singable) melodies and the grotesque and socially objectionable content of the lyrics that make these songs screemingly funny.

He relied moslty on bathroom-type humor which I found lacking and just not that funny. I don't know, maybe Wierd Al spoiled me. He was able to use humor without having it be crude. Not that a little coarseness is bad... but in this case, it seems like Lynch is just using it as a gimmic, as a means unto itself.My favorite tracks were, to be frank, the NON-offensive ones- like \\"Jim Henson's Dead\\" (if you hear the track, you'll know what I mean.)Lullaby has a catchy tune and isn't TOO bad... but a lot of the other songs on this CD are just plain sick!(One thing though- the MELODIES themselves are quite good; Lynch is very talented... but maybe next time he can work his way down to PG-13 or NC-17, as opposed to XXXXX-893?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical CD","review":"I bought this album in November '00 and haven't stopped listening to it yet.

Without the audience feedback, be it delighted laughter or shocked amazement, the songs have to stand on their own merit. As they are recorded in a studio, you will quickly notice an amazing similarity in song after song, the gentle falsetto, the hummable but forgettable melodies, and the incredibly inappropriate lyrics, are all repeated time after time. The songs lose their ability to shock when lumped together like this. They become predictable and repetitive. I like Lynch's rather bizarre contribution to the world of comedy, but in this setting, without the immediacy of a live performance, the songs themselves don't really hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievably wrong and funny at the same time","review":"i really can't get enough of stephen lynch. all of his songs, unfortunately, make you want to sing along. just hope you're not around certain people during certain songs, or you might get rocks thrown at you, but around friends it great!!! the lyrics are catchy and, if you get nothing else from this cd (which is impossible), at least you'll have a way to make people give you weird looks (like if you walk down the street singing about having one ball or your girlfriend that's a guy, that's a girl...that's a guy...). anyway, if you're cool, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definatly sick and twisted","review":"I assume no one will even think about purchasing any of Stephen's work unless they had already seen one of his shows. So I will say if you like his other stuff you will certainly like this as well. The CD isn't as great as watching him perform, but for those that are not in his list of tour cities, this is the only way to hear his songs. He is very clever and definatly sick and twisted."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny","review":"not for the faint of heart, but if you're open minded, you'll get a real kick out of Stephen Lynch. Lyrics are very clever and very funny. You'll feel guilty for laughing so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have CD","review":"Sometimes it's filled with satire, other times sheer perversity. Sometimes it's even surprisingly touching (see \\"Jim Henson's Dead\\"). However, \\"A Little Bit Special\\" is always hysterical. Lynch's lyrics are riotous, and yet couched in catchy tunes and sung with a voice that is much better than you would expect from a comedian. If you need a bit of irreverent humor, this CD is the way to go. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without A Doubt!","review":"This CD was, without a doubt, one of the FUNNIEST CDs I have ever heard! Immediately after watching Stephen Lynch's special on Comedy Central for the first time, I logged on the the Comedy Central website to see who the heck this guy was that had me crying from laughing so hard. I ordered his CD that same night, and I haven't stopped laughing since! I tried to make my friends listen to the CD so they could experience what I found to be incredible genius humor, but they were a little skeptical as they read the titles to some of the songs and and lyrics printed inside the cover. :) But after listening to just the first few lines to some of the songs, they were asking me how I heard about this guy and where they could get their hands on their own CD! Next thing you knew, we were all checking his tour schedule to see when we could go see him live! This CD is DEFINATELY a FIVE STAR one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen is da MAN!","review":"Hello all! I just have to write a little something to say that cd is a treasured item in any home! It is vital to the soul that everyone must buy this cd! Next to my Yanni cd this has to be the funniest cd of comical music ever! All the songs are classics that you can sing along wiht your mom and dad and pet rat next to the fire while drinking some warm cocoa! MMMMMMMMMMMM! To be honest....I adore this cd. Stephen is really a funny dude and really cool! I've seen him live like 20 times (and just seeing that face alone would make you buy the cd!)! All the songs are great and sometimes you can't help with hum \\"Gerbil\\" or try your best Walken impression! I do have to thank Stephen for putting \\"Tall Glass O' Water\\" on his cd! That is the most awesome song ever! You rock Stephen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's only one thing better than listening to this CD...","review":"...and that is watching Stephen Lynch sing these outrageous songs. If you have the opportunity, go see him. In the meantime - BUY THIS CD. His songs will have you cracking up long after you turn off your CD player. You'll find yourself singing along, completely caught up in his mental mania. His sweet and beguiling style with it's ambush attacking humor make a perfect combination. You'll have to agree he's more than \\"A Little Bit Special\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"As a father of a young daughter, I must object","review":"Here's why I object: How can I possibly tell my teenager that this CD I bought for her (at her request) is objectionable when I cannot stop laughing? Tears rolled down my cheeks the first time I heard it.This CD is the funniest thing I have heard in years. Yes, it relies on shock value for some of the laughs (you'll find yourself saying OH MY GAWD HE DIDN'T JUST SAY THAT at least a dozen times) but Lynch mixes clever lyrics with a sophisticated musical style. Far from a simple potty humor comedy album, it truly entertains, even the tenth time you hear it.Not for the easily offended or for the very young, but for those who can roll with a joke this is a wonderfully spent hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"vulgar, disgusting, and hysterical!","review":"definately not for the timid or sensative listener. i love his music! he is funny as anything and has a great voice. hes unafraid to sing about the twisted and bizare. it also doesnt hurt that he is sooo good looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen Lynch is hilarious!!!!!","review":"I haven't laughed this hard since I saw his Comedy Central special!The hidden track is worth the purchase alone! :) I love the last minute!!!!I love the \\"Have you seen my...\\" tracks. Stephen, you make me cry laughing! \\"Hey Lynch!\\"Besides the humor, Stephen's voice is very clean and fluid. I'd love to hear you sing some of the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked On Lynch","review":"Once you hear any of Stephen Lynch's songs, you will be hooked. He is addictive. 'A Little Bit Special' is the funniest CD I've heard in years. Only a true genius like Lynch could write songs such as Lullaby and Hermaphrodite. I highly recommend 'A Little Bit Special'. This review received 5 stars only because I could not give more. A word of advise: Don't buy just one CD, buy two. You will need one for home and for your car. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Introduction to Stephen Lynch","review":"Many people have never heard of Stephen Lynch, and they are really missing out. Stephen Lynch combines witty rhymes with sometimes disgusting imagery to create a hilarious song. He also has guitar skills that match some of the rockers today. I urge people to listen to Stephen if they are not easily offended. If you are easily offended then run away as fast as you can. This is not his best album,though. In my opinion he is much better live like on Superhero and The Craig Machine but this is still a good starter. I hope this encourages people to buy this album where they can tell other people about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"Do not buy this!!! I bought this for my 65 Chevy truck. Its got a Muncie m20, a Hurst Comp Plus Shifter and a brand new McLeod Clutch. It looks the same as the Hurst super-boot in the package, but its not. The dimensions are exactly the same and looks as if though it may have come from an identical mold. But the rubber compound is very, very, very hard, making shifting impossible. it will actually pull your shifter out of gear because the rubber doesn't stretch. I thought something was wrong with the transmission because it kept popping out of 2nd and 4th. It turned out to be this very hard boot that does not flex. Save yourself a lot of healing and spend the twenty bucks extra for the real Hurst Super-Boot. The Hurst rubber is way softer and more elastic.. It makes shifting nice and smooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectre Large Shift Boot","review":"This is the first Spectre product I've been disappointed in. I expected it to be an inexpensive knock off, with the same mounting dimensions as the Hurst Super Boot. The mounting pattern does not match and will only work if new mounting holes are drilled. Also, the rubber is so thick and stiff it doesn't work very well as a shift boot. I do not recommend this product.Spectre 6284 Universal Rectangular Large Shift Boot"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure????","review":"I'm not sure how good the work-out is the dvd is scratched.

It's difficult to find the size locally, and I never know what I'm going to get when I order sight unseen. However, this looks good. It's cushy, and soft and no mesh sides, which is a definite plus because they always tear. Fits my thick mattress so well, I've recommended it to my daughter who is looking for a pad for her king size. I don't know how it will wash, but I am certainly satisfied with the look, feel, and fit right now. I've washed other pads with the same backing, and I don't put them in the dryer. I probably will do the same with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as expected, only faster!","review":"It appears to be better than good quality, I'd say excellent. Came in one day, as promised. Cotton looks durable and of quality on the top, and the material for the sides also looks durable.

The ends hug just right (I have a 13\\" mattress, and it would definitely work for larger, or smaller). It stays fairly smooth. It washes easily in my XL capacity washer. It doesn't cause me to sweat, and I have been very comfortable on it. A thumbs up for me!Up-date - it won't let me leave a review for another size, so I will put it here. I ordered another one of these in a different size, and it had a tear in it after the first washing. Amazon did make it easy to return (I printed out a label - my post man picked it up with my mail - after I left him a note in the mail-box, and a new one is already on it's way). It is kind of a bummer after washing the first one, and having to wait another week. Otherwise the quality looked to be as good as the first one, just a bad seam job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality pad","review":"This mattress pad seems to be pretty high quality for the price.

It fits great, like a fitted sheet, and had plenty of room to fit over the memory foam topper that's on the mattress too. I washed it and it didn't fall apart at all or pill or any of the other things that could happen when you wash things like this. It fit in my washer and dryer very easily and dried quick enough (I put it on the bed still a little damp after an hour of drying it on low heat). It seemed to add a little bit of extra comfort to the mattress as well if you ask me, but my boyfriend didn't notice any extra cushion."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a nice one, but shrinks after I washed it","review":"It's is a very good quality pad.

I wasn't looking for fancy, and had I spent more money I may have found one that was a little more \\"fluffy\\", but this is very functional and in my price range.

I wash my sheets and bedding on hot, and throw everything in the dryer. We have two young boys, so we do a lot of laundry. It is beyond me why a mattress pad wouldn't be COMPLETELY washable and dryable on hot and/or warm settings. I like the top of the pad, which seems like nice quality cotton, and it fits the bed nicely. My complaint is that the backing is poor quality. I didn't order or expect anything waterproof. In fact, I would prefer all cotton. I really don't have time to pack this up and send it back at this point. I am not satisfied and would not buy this type of product online again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full size in queen size packaging.","review":"I ordered 2 of these as a present and was embarrassed that when they opened the plasticand removed the pad that it was a full size pad.

You have to removefrom the package to see the tag on the pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"Well, it fits a king sized mattress. Other than that it is not especially soft or comfortable. If you have thin or nice sheets you would want to get a higher quality one. If you sprung for a king sized bed you might as well get a decent mattress pad, which this isn't. The quality and comfort of this pad is more suited for a kids bed or a guest bed that you hope people don't want to use often. The comfort of this item is really unimpressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COVER, not a PAD","review":"The price seems great, and is great- if you're looking for a mattress cover to help protect you mattress. If, however, you were looking for a mattress PAD to add softness and comfort to your original mattress, this is not the correct product. I mistakenly bought this, thinking because it was a \\"pad\\" it would add padding. It does not. This product is very thin and flat. I'm returning it, and I bought a fiberbed instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lookout! Covered in Mold","review":"Received this bed cover and was all excited to put it on. Opened the beat up shipping package and discovered mold all over the INSIDE of the mattress cover.

First disappointment was this is primarily polyester so it doesn't insulate at all. It's the hottest mattress pad I've owned. Second disappointment was the dismal gray color it turned the first time I washed it. I washed it alone with detergent and a little chlorine-free bleach and it turned gray! It looks awful. One of the upsides of this pad was it was pretty but not any more. The only remaining upside is the sides are really deep. It's a joy to put on because I don't have to struggle and stretch to get it over my deep mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit","review":"I purchased this mattress cover hoping it would be the right fit and comfortable.

I used the lowest heat setting on my drier both times. This item is extremely poor quality and I would recommend everyone to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't I trust the reviews?","review":"Well...it's my own fault really...I didn't read the reviews and bought this mattress pad anyway. It arrived quickly and seemed like a really nice mattress pad. As with any bedding...I always wash it before using it on my bed. I washed the mattress pad on cool wash/cold rinse, then dried it for about 15 minutes on low-heat. Pulled it out of the dryer to discover that the entire back was melted. It's completely destroyed and I haven't even used it yet. I'm in the process of returning it. I knew the low price was too good to be true.I've now taken the time to read more of the reviews on this product. What I don't understand is why Amazon continues to sell this product? In all the years I've been shopping with Amazon, this is the first time I've experienced a poorly constructed product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Material!","review":"Plenty of stretch and material to fit all the way around the bed.

I figured that if I followed the washing instructions, I would be fine. I purchased the pad, LOVED how it fit and felt on my bed... and then washed it about a week later. I followed the directions and used low heat. However, when I took the mattress pad out of the dryer, the backing had melted the whole thing into a ball! When I tried to pull it apart, tiny melted pieces dropped all over my floor. I'm trying to return the item now, but it's a hassle. On top of all that frustration, my Eqyption Cotton sheets were in the dryer at the time and are sporadically covered in patches of tiny melted plastic, also. SO, it's fits and feels great... but if you dry it, do not use ANY heat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Standard Quality","review":"Do not under any circumstance put this pad in the dryer the linner will melt even on the lowest setting. It is not 100% cotton as claimed. The backing is of the poorest quality poly something? I took the chance on the cool down setting for only 15 minutes at a time and it melted in several places with only 1 washing so far. Still usable but will most likely fall apart with next washingVery Dissapointed in Montana"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melts When Dried According to Instructions","review":"As reported in other reviews, mine melted the first time I tried to dry it, even following the instructions on the tag. The plastic particles ruined set of sheets in the same load and even a shirt in the next load. Given that the tag on it even provides dryer instuctions, I just can't recommend this mattress pad to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"be carefull when you wash it","review":"i took it out of the package and carefully followed the care nstrcutions for washing it.

My mattress is X-long twin and 14 inches deep, which includes the pillow top. I've measured the mattress several times, so I'm absolutely certain of its depth. This brand new and purportedly wonderful pad is extremely tight on the mattress, and I'm floored at the claims that it would, in anyone's wildest imagination, fit up to a 22 inch deep mattress. It was quite difficult for two of us to even get the wretched thing on the bed initially, and the bottom of the pad skirt doesn't reach to the lower edge of the mattress. Heaven forbid I'd wash and dry it -- the shrinkage would be ridiculous. Altogether, this was a huge disappointment and I'm sending it back as soon as I can get my return label printed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick, soft, comfortable mattress pad","review":"This is an extremely nice mattress pad, especially for its price. It is made of cotton damask fabric which is attractive enough to be on display, rather than hidden away under the sheets! The padding is luxuriously thick, and it is made to fit even the deepest mattresses, which is a big plus. The part that wraps around the mattress (versus the padded top) is unusually strong as mattress pads go. One I recently purchased ripped apart putting it on the mattress. It also doesn't have an awful chemical smell, which so many such products seem to do these days.All in all, I'm so pleased with this product, I'm considering getting more of them to give as Christmas presents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"This product fits my deep mattress well.

This is on par with pads you see in department stores for $30-$40. It's very sturdy, and the pockets are deep and don't slip off the mattress. It's not as \\"fluffy\\" as some other pads I've had, but that's not important to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY unless you never intend to wash it !","review":"I read the reviews and noted that there had been some problems with the underside batting melting in the dryer after washing. The item arrived and looked very promising. As I do all fabric that I wear or sleep on, I promptly washed it on a gentle cycle. Then placed it (by itself) in the dryer under VERY LOW HEAT for DELICATE fabric. Guess what ? It still MELTED !! Returned for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT 100% COTTON!!!!","review":"Perhaps the very top layer is cotton, I don't know, but the filler and backing is some wierd, synthetic material that MELTED when washed and dried per instructions on tag! It ruined other stuff in the dryer, too. I ordered this because it SPECIFICALLY stated it was 100% cotton. I can't IMAGINE who all these people are who are giving it good reviews, they must not have tried to wash it yet! This is HORRIBLE! I am a long-time Amazon shopper, but the VERY POOR quality of this product will make me think twice about ordering certain types of items from them in the future. This has been a HORRIBLE experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"Not nearly as cushy as the picture / description appears. I was really hoping it had a bit more fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value at High Quality","review":"I've purchased other mattress pads on Amazon before in a similar price range and this one is by far my favorite in terms of bang for buck. It's a high quality product. I was so happy with my first purchase after using for 6 months that I just recently bought a second one as backup. Fits well, washes well and top layer has a satiny quality, unlike some others that fray over use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mattress Pad for the Money","review":"Ordered this to fit our RV sleep number king mattress. The pad is very plush and did not lose it's shape when washed. The only problem I saw was the stiching securing the pad to the side material had large loops in places, like the bobbin on the sewing machine was out of adjustment, but the material was secure and the stiching has not unraveled, yet. This is the reason I gave the product a 4 star. The mattress pad fit the sleep number mattress (72\\" x 80\\") perfect! Also, Washed in cool water and dryed on low setting as directions indicated. I had to increase heat a little the last 10 min. as it had not dried on low setting after an hour. I have had the mattress pad for a week and so far am very pleased with it. I would definitely recommend it to others and would purchase another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit 18\\" deep","review":"The product claims to fit mattresses up to 22\\" deep. My mattress is around 16\\"-18\\" deep and it doesn't tuck under on the sides. There is about 2 inches of mattress exposed on the sides and about 1\\" on the ends where it won't reach to even go under the edge! And this is before I've even laid down on it which will pull it up even more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value","review":"This pad is a terrific value for the price. I was not expecting much because of the low cost, but I was pleasantly surprised by the padding. I have seen many pads made of very thin, cheap filling. These not super insulated, but are sufficiently padded for everyday use. I bought several. They are better than pads I've seen costing twice as much. Well sewn of decent materials. The twin size fit my bed well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cotton Damask Strip Mattress Pad Twin XL","review":"Very, very satisfied with this product. It is very soft to the touch and the padding is quite full. The sides are not that hard fabric but more like micro fiber. Very easy to cover the mattress. I even put memory foam on top of the mattress, two layers totaling three inches, and the mattress pad covers everything with no problem. Thank you for a wonderful product. Well worth the money, even it is not on sale.JoyceFlagler Beach, FL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mattress Pads","review":"These mattress pads are wonderful!

The mattress pad is so thin and lightweight that it's almost like putting a blanket beneath the sheet. I am disappointed with the flimsy pad but kept it anyway. I'll buy the next item like this in a store where I can actually feel the quality instead of just assume it's a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending back - melted after laundering per instructions","review":"After one washing (low temp settings, per instructions), the under-side of the quilted top melted! I am very disappointed and sending this back."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was a good deal...","review":"but really, this was a great deal! I can't believe the quality in this material. I usually never buy mattress pads because the fabric is so-so and the stretchy side material threads, gets holes in it, etc.This product is not like that. I use it to cover the futon I use as a bed and it doesn't tear, rip or stretch too thin and it is really soft to the touch. Not soft like a nice set of sheets, but better than plastic-feeling pads I've used in the past.I'm very happy with this product. It is thick enough that the plastic lining I have under the pad doesn't crinkle loudly nor can I feel it through the material, meaning I can line my futon to protect it, and sleep on it comfortably. Very nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fit the bed but not comfortable","review":"I ordered the queen version of the mattress pad. It fit the bed just fine no problems. As soon as I laid down on it I felt the difference that it was much softer. After about 10 minutes my lower back started to hurt and I didn't have that problem before I put it on. So far I've slept on it for three nights and my lower back has been a bit sore each morning. I will probably put it on the guest bed so at least I wont lose my money on the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I bought this mattress pad because of the high reviews.

There was a little problem in the material stitching, the quilting was incomplete in some areas but compared to what I've previously got for the same price, $20 or more, i was very pleased.

The artwork is charming--the 'forever cat' has a star at the tip of its tail, and a halo after it has crossed the angel bridge.The idea that one day we will be reunited with all of our beloved animals is a valuable part of this book, and it would be a very compassionate and caring gift to someone who has lost a cat friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"As the parent of a dyspraxic pre-teen, I have found that while there is an increasing amount of information available about dyspraxia (a.k.a. apraxia), there is not much out there about dyspraxia in older kids and young adults.

I paid only $24 for mine and it arrived in mint condition. It contains everything the larger size contain, except it appears to be missing some appendencies. The text will make references to them but they are not there. This became an issue when looking up a culture-based condition. What IS intact is priceless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One minor issue","review":"I received the product very quickly and in mint condition. It was even re-wrapped in air tight plastic cellophane. The only issue I have is that the product was advertised as having a spiral bound, which is what I wanted specifically, but this was not the case once it arrived. For that, I could have picked the book up anywhere instead of ordering it online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what it was advertised","review":"The book came one day sooner than the seller said it would.

It's like the big fat one without all the unnecessary weight. I used it mainly for looking up mental disorder criteria while on rounds or during morning report. It also fits nicely in your pocket and impresses the attendings and residents. Anything to show them your commitment goes a long way towards a good evaluation at the end of the rotation. I mainly used this and the pocket pharmacopoeia on the wards and studied from NMS Psych at home, though I'm told First Aid for Psych is much better for home study.I've never really been interested in psych so take my recommendation with a grain of salt. On the other hand I got great evals on the rotation with this and other materials.I'd probably buy this book again if I hadn't already completed my psych rotation. It'll serve me well on other rotations when I need to refer to psych for something. It's worth the slightly high dollar amount ascribed to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"This \\"mini\\" version of the DSM-IV makes it much easier to look up things quickly for those busy Social Workers/Therapists/Counselors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book fell apart","review":"I chose to purchase this book for one of my classes and the first time that I opened it, the book ripped in half.

I was fascinated by the quality of the production and the shear extravagance of the sets and costumes. How much of the story is factual I don't know; probably very little. How much interaction there was between Louis XIV, Lully and Moli��re can only be guessed. However, treated as fiction this film is a wondrous tale of how a working-class musician (Lully) gets involved with the King of France and will do almost anything to keep in his good gracesHaving visited the Palace of Versailles myself, I was a little disappointed that the only views of the completed building are of the Galerie des Glaces as the principal performers walk into the credits at the very end of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous sets, powerful music & acting","review":"If you like baroque, appreciate art & ballet, you will probably like this movie. It is not a love story. I wish it was. But it tells the story about the Jean-Baptiste Lully & his friendship with Louis XIV. The visuals are stunning & the music is powerful.

I wish there were more movies as beautiful as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual movie however well worth watching","review":"I saw preview on YouTube and found it interesting.

Louis XIV's mother was Anne of Austria (married to Louis XIII). She was a Spanish Hapsburg, not a Medici. His wife was Marie-Th��r��se, also a Spanish Hapsburg and niece to Anne of Austria. Henri IV was married to Marie de Medici (Louis' grandmother and mother to Louis XIII) and Catherine de Medici's was Henri II's wife (mother of 3 kings, and mother-in-law for a time of Henri IV).This may have been changed to fiction for purposes of the DVD, but I am just now ordering it, so do not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like college freshmen corousing","review":"We previously got the sound track, which was wonderful.We were hoping to see some dancing, but there was very little and very strange.

No manner how talented they were.There are many unbelievable things. For example, female singing roles were still played by young men with high voices.

The Op. 53 (\\"Silhouetten\\") are seven shorter pieces of varying mood and contrast. Of particular beauty is the contemplative \\"Langsam, schwermutig.\\" The Op. 58 (\\"Blatter und Bluten\\") are twelve pieces very reminiscent of Schumann's \\"Albumblatter,\\" but no less charming despite the occasional whimsy.Pianist Jean Martin is the ideal advocate: He is inside Reger completely and at home with the composer's attractive, if idiosyncratic, writing. Martin, as well, is given glorious, full-bodied, realistic sound.[Running time: 79:19]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby, I Love You!","review":"Those of us who were fortunate enough to grow up in urban America in the late-1950s and 1960s will no doubt remember Baby Washington's records as mainstays on the radio.

The movie was about the Brookside Coal Miners going on strike in Harlan County, Kentucky. The coal miners held the strike for safety, better housing, and benefits.

I would recommend this movie to everyone. ---- Jessica Bryant and Ashley Perdue (Cantrell students)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glimpse of human spirit","review":"Loved this movie, although I understand from reading the other reviews that it's not completely accurate. Most things aren't, and we often don't perceive truth clearly no matter how it's presented. But this work does present a fascinating character, played by Holly, who starts off (I would say) passive and becomes activated by her situation, to the benefit of her community. I thought the interchange between her and her husband after her violence was especially great - wish more entertainment would explore such moments of true struggle. This has a very particular flavor. It leaves a particular impression - and the knowledge that the bad guys don't *always* win!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile--not good for a toy","review":"Our son loves Mater so I bought two of these after reading the reviews. Within two days both had lost a wheel and the teeth detached from one of them. The side mirrors and hook are flimsy plastic and will probably break soon too. They had been knocked off a coffee table, or dropped accidentally, but every other kid toy seems to be built with this eventuality in mind and holds up. I would not recommend this toy for a child that is in any way rough on toys. I only hope the super glue holds them together long enough for him to move on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Wheels, they're not!","review":"Good as collectables, not so good as actual toys that you play with.My daugter has broken the hook off of Mater (bought her a new one), broken the wheel off of Dynaco McQueen, and broken the front axle off of the tractor. Mater's tow equipment is made with a softer cheaper plastic than the rest of the toy, and I expect the new one to break any day now.Without being too sexist, I want to point out that my 4 year old daughter is probably more gentle on them than the average boy playing with them. They have never entered a sandbox. They have not been stood on, nor thrown, nor been monster-trucked by a bicycle.While I will still probably buy more, as my daughter loves the Cars movie and wants to own them all, (including Frank, which they do not make) I would say to all: buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I'm very upset with the quality of these Disney Cars toy cars!

The manufacturer dropped the ball a little with Mater. The color isn't right. The actual Mater in the movie has that worn rustic look, this Mater looks like new rust brown colored paint. They should have also made the hook so it can be played with the other cars. Toys should be built as toys to be played with rather than the intention of people buying them only as intended collectors items being the goal.Better than your average cheap toy, these have some weight to them and feel like quality products. My local retail stores have these for less money, even before any additional shipping cost is added on, however trying to obtain specific cars for my 3 year olds collection that he wanted were easier to find on Amazon so the $1 or $2 extra I paid I probably saved in gas from driving around store to store looking for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Polycarbonate","review":"Got this for my skill jigsaw to cut down some polycarbonate sheets.

The villianess is the archetype of the false accuser that men focus on in my training sessions. In practice, in every case I've been able to investigate (some reports I hear about I can't investigate, e.g., because the accuser just wants to vent in confidence) the complainant's accusation has been supported. I'm sure there are some Merediths out there, but they are few and far between. Given that this may be the only knowledge many people have about sexual harassment it is a shame there wasn't at least a subplot that was more typical. Re the writing,as usual MC can really move it along. All the more shame the message wasn't more proactive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly Crichton doesn't know any actual people who work.","review":"Grammar and spelling ok. Crichton's frustrations and fear are everywhere, but the story doesn't fly with anyone I know who's ever been an executive. Or, come to think of it, anyone who works outside the home. I assume it was the only way he could cash in on harassment publicity, but his talents would have been more on display if he had had the courage to write a villian he knows about (a la Lolita).

Let's all pay attention to the (almost non-existent) female to male harrassment, and ignore the all-too-common male to female variety. Don't we all feel bad for Michael Douglas? Yeah, harrassment isn't really an issue of violence against women. Don't we all feel better now?What a load of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Page Turner","review":"I can't remember ever having lost a night's sleep by having to keep reading a book, but I lost two nights back to back with this one. It is so well written that you grieve that Crichton is no longer with us. Although it was written in 1993 at really the beginning of sexual harassment litigation, it is right on the money on the law as it applies to these cases.You marvel at the twists and turns that mirror what really happens in a litigated matter.And then there is the epilogue - which is so droll, I had to go back to Kindle to make sure I got it right - and more importantly that I cared enough to want to get it straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last...","review":"..a book about a sexually harrassed man! I wonder how many men have actually been sexually harrassed out in the business world but have been too embarrassed to step forward for fear of ridicule from their fellow employee's? Michael Crichton handled this situation wonderfully showing how one man's world is knocked upside down because of such a happening. My simple review for this book is, whether you're a man or woman who's had a similar problem, read this book!!! It's exceptionally written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"An amazing book, I never expected to hear much from women sexually harassing men, which a lot of people think would never happen. But this book did not only prove it to me that stereotypes play roles in our society which usually aren't true, it also made me think I was in the characters on skin, trying to fight agains that stereotype. I would really recomend it, it's a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting point of view about sexual harrasement...","review":"Let's start with the things I DIDN'T like about the book: the characters are one dimensional, and the fact that the book deals with a sexually harrased man (even though that has a positive side too) tends to look down at the fact most sexual harrasements occur against women.On the other hand, the 2nd points does raise some important issues: the man is usually regarded as the guilty party, even in situations he isn't. Is the fact some men are just TOO careful (like in aa situation men won't pick up or help a crying child so it won't look suspicious) means we've taken this too far sometimes? On the other hand, there are still quite a lot of people out there, especially men, who don't know where to draw the line, and too many people who are afraid to complain... Even with these questions, this is a fun book to read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"If you are looking for a good Michael Crichton novel I would stay clear of this one. I found the plot line was very boring, which seemed only to develop significantly in the last quarter of the book. I feel I was waiting for things to happen the whole time I was reading and nothing ever really did. The characters were boring and not too bright. I guessed what the ending was at the beginning of the book. This is nothing like his other books which are very good, and being a big Michael Crichton fan I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disclosure","review":"I found it difficult to follow the technical part of this book.

In doing so, Michael Crichton not only tells a compelling story, but also gets the reader to think long and hard about the issue of sexual harassment and male/female relations in the work place.The story moves at a break neck pace, through many twists and turns to an exciting conclusion.The book is much better then the movie which wasn't able to convey all the subtleties and nuances in the plot.A very enjoyable and thought provoking book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who has the power?","review":"Amazing story. Even if it was written 7 years ago, we still have the same question, in the companies who has the power? The answer is not the men nor the women, the power is in the position of the company whether is a man or a woman who is the president, and when that president want something he or she will do whatever he/she has to do to get it, it doesn't matter if is his secretary or her personal adviser, it doesn't matter if nobody want to do this or that thing, if the boss say something they will do it.The story of the book is different because is a man who make charges to a woman of sexual harassment, it is difficult to believe, but it can be real. The book will keep you reading all the time, but has a little mistake, you know exactly what happened in the first chapter and you know who is guilty, may be it will be more interesting if you didn't know exactly what happened until the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Graphic and Very Grim","review":"I'm a big fan of Michael Crichton and know going into any book of his that intense language and violent deaths are part and parcel of his writing style. However, \\"Disclosure\\" absolutely disgusted me. With it's detailed description of a death by rape scene, and the whole novel revolving around this scene, I hated this book. I nearly quit reading it when I read this part of the book, but plugged onwards because I thought it would get better. There were really no characters that I cared about in the book, nor did I feel satisfied with how the plot ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget the film adaptation","review":"I read this book after watching the movie.

It reinforces one of the main themes of this book regarding abuse of power. It doesn't make any difference if the abuser is male or female it's how their authority is used."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dialogue made this novel.","review":"After the dialogue, it's hard to say what I like best about this novel. The movie (which I watched last night) seems to follow the storyline to a \\"T\\". Tom Sanders is E.W.M. (Every White Male), no doubt. However, I got lost in the sheer entertainment value of the book and somewhat disregarded Crichton's didactics, you know about sexual harassment and stuff. As well, I seemed to forget whether a scene occurred just in the novel and not in the movie, and vice versa. I mean, the script was followed that closely to the novel! I sometimes find it a little unnerving that Crighton seems to be writing a screenplay as well as a novel at the same time. I guess I basically read his novels for better explanations for scenes that I saw in his movies and, I think most importantly, for the sheer entertainment value of his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book","review":"This book was very captivating. I really felt sorry for Sanders, because he was going through some terrible times at home and at work; a REALLY hard time at work. Right from the start, I knew that Meredith was up to no good, and I grew to despise her. She was very deceitful and I agree with others that she got what she deserved.mstrish1969@netscape.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"When I first starting readin this book I was sceptical because it wasn't science fiction like most of Crichton's other books. But, reluctantly, I sat down and started reading, the first ten pages were pretty boring then it got up pace and I started to really enjoy this book, I was hooked around page 25 and couldn't stop reading, and at page 100 I was deeply lost in this wonderful novel. I read the next 400 pages quickly and loved every single minute of it. The characters were interesting and enjoyable to read about. And after I was done I noticed that no one else really wrote about sexual harassment and the man be the victim and I then saw how Crichton told the truth about sexual harassment, that the man is always blamed no matter what. I advise everybody to go out to your local book store and pick this book up, I promise you'll love it like I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DisCLOSEure","review":"This was the first book which I had read by Crichton, and I must say that it was very interesting. This author showed his ability to relate his main character with the reader. This is a marvelous book about the way business works on the inside, and is a book which I would recommend to all, the only flaw in this book was a weak ending, it almost seemed as if Crichton hadn't though of how he was going to end this book. Although the ending was less than impressive, I still believe that its previous content made up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended. :<","review":"I love Star Trek Voyager.

The author takes liberties with the characters of Seven and Torres that are simply uncalled for, creating bitter conflict between the two for the sake of his story. Sure there might be some friendly rivalry between those two, but this author has them practically at each other's throats. In fact, he's got all the Voyager character's acting very out-of-character, supposedly because they've been psychologically affected by subspace radiation, but even if that explanation were plausible, it makes for a very frustrating and unsatisfying read.I hope that the 2nd book in this \\"String Theory\\" series will be better since its got a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Out of Character!","review":"I loved the storyline and the plot, it was extremely interesting and sounded like something that would've been in a Voyager episode. However, the main characters didn't sound at all like themselves. There were some moments when it sounded true to character but most of the time, the dialogue was absurd and all I could think was, \\"Janeway never would've said that!\\", or \\"No way that sounds like Seven!\\", etc.After reading the book I came to write a review and see what some others said. I agree with JensTenebrea's review and they gave great examples of things that were said that didn't sound like the Voyager crew. There are many more throughout the book but that gives you a good idea.I think it's still a good read but if you use to watch Voyager and know the characters, be prepared to be thrown off a little by what's said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I'm writing this after having read all three books in this series many times. I have to say that each time I read them, I love them more. Jeffrey Lang (Heather Jarman wrote ONLY the third book in the series) does a great job with the charcters, really seeming to understand them. I like the little J/C hints and the good relationships the characters have. The storyline seems a little confusing at first, but it is tied up well, and is probably the most tightly woven of the three. It also sets into motion the events for the next two books, and thereby the 5th season as well. Overall, great book, and a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Cliff Notes","review":"This commentary has just the right amount of information, in my opinion, for the average bible student. Not too little and not overload of information. It is not just a commentary of the books of the Bible, but of each chapter in each book. It is short and concise, like the Cliff notes I used in high school. This commentary does not take the place of reading the Bible, but it gives you a short summary of the chapter. It also gives you extra Scriptures to help your study go deeper than just the chapter you are reading. Very helpful, to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not everybody buys the doc hype","review":"I refuse to try to show how clever I am, but when someone said that most scholars buy into the documentary hypothesis, I had to laugh. This isn't forty years ago and only liberal scholars and closet liberals buy into it now. I won't boor you with scholar's names, but many of the current conservatives have refuted this. You find it in scholar's books and classroom whose scholars have locked theirselves up for fifty years.I bought this commentary for a college library. It is well written and provides a simple to understand interpretation of the whole Bible. If you just want a one book commentary, this is one of the best. Simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & enjoyable read","review":"I loved this book - Jancee Dunn is a great comedic writer, even when she's not intending to be. It takes something pretty funny to make me laugh (out loud, no less)but I found myself laughing throughout this book. Intermitently throughout are chapters about some of her most classic and memorable interviews - it's interesting to see how celebs/musicians can be behind closed doors. This book is a great, quick read - mostly because you won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jancee, I love you!","review":"You do not need to be from Jersey to love this book. Anyone who spent their adolescence cultivating a thin, fragile veneer of coolness to cover an inner dork will relate to Jancee. I did not want this book to end. I can't wait for the follow-up on the rest of Jancee's life. Funny, touching, and entirely real. (Just like a true Jersey girl!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Memoir","review":"A great read that made me laugh out loud several times. The narrative of Jancee's life is interspersed with brief descriptions of interviewing celebrities, which helps keep the pace snappy. Near the end, her narrative seems to flag a bit, as if she was unsure how to end it, but overall it was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly well written and very touching story.","review":"Jancee Dunn tells us a little bit about her childhood and how she ended up at Rolling Stone and MTV. The chapters alternate between her memoirs and amusing anecdotes about interviewing celebrities. While the celebrity encounters are interesting, it is her own life story that will completely mesmerize you. She is a gifted story teller and brings all her characters to life in a way that makes you remember them long after you have finished the book.I highly recommend this book for a light, fun read that will capture your heart when you least expect it.I would read anything else by this author eagerly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to save for the beach","review":"I picked up \\"But Enough About Me,\\" figuring I'd read it down the shore on my family vacation. Only, I didn't get that far. Instead, I read it in three nights at home, giggling out loud and living vicariously through Jancee Dunn's very entertaining memoir of a \\"Rock Chick.\\"If, like me, you're a Jersey Girl and a writer, you'll especially appreciate Dunn's humor and well crafted stories. Yet this gem of a book is a great summer read for anyone who loves good writing, self depricating humor and an inside look at the lives of celebrities -- even if it never makes it into your beach bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANYTHING rich mullins wrote is shear gold","review":"the man was one of a kind, a true christian.i highly suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap re-release","review":"I gave this one star cause its a cheap re-release of a book called \\"Home\\" that came out in 1999. \\"Home\\" features color pictures and is a much larger book.

The only problem I had with it, is that it's essentially the same as \\"Home\\", a collection of articles that was published years ago in magazine format. There is nothing in this book itself, or in the publishers comments on the Amazon.com page, to indicate that fact.

Both are wonderfully acted films and that I hadn't seen in years. Basil Rathbone was the perfect choice to play Holmes and it is hard for me to watch anyone else in that role. The are older films, made during the late 1930's and early 1940's and are black and white. Having said that, I would stand them up against any of today's films. They didn't need the technology and F/X of modern films, rather they let one use their imagination and for that reason will always stand the test of time. I whole heartedly recommend both films to anyone who loves a good mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherlock Holmes","review":"I have read the above reviews and found errors in both. I realize that the films that Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce did together deviated from the original material quite a bit. Once the pair moved to Universal the films showed poor quality in production and appeared to be just churned out. However, the final film that Both Rathbone and Bruce did together was not Pursuit to Algiers but Dressed to Kill. Personally I think Rathbone was the perfect Holmes. Jeremy Brett is also very good and my third place pick would go to Robert Stephens who gave only one film contribution but a brilliant one....alas if he could only have done a few more. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is witty and intriguing and I would urge any Holmesian fan to watch it. Of course one could not forget the contributions of Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing. As for Robert D. Jr....I'm sorry sir but your version of Holmes is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nest book I've read on how to actually start and run a successful bakery","review":"As a retired management consultant, I was especially impressed with usefulness of the information in this book.

This book will dramatically improve the odds of being sucessful if the bakery owner will just follow the instructions. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I have BA in business, so this book is just a joke! I don't need someone to tell me what should I need to open a bakery..but how!

I too am a huge Victoria Holt fan and after reading the reviews, decided to give Ms. Tyrrel's book a try.But whenever Brand and Stacy came together for one of those mysterious kisses / stares / hugs, I found myself laughing instead of becoming more intrigued with the characters. Why in the world would Brand believe everything Alana was saying about Stacy without asking Stacy herself and vice versa? They both acted like spoiled brats throughout much of the book.I agree with others that Saul was not very well developed; he could have almost been written out of the book.Overall, the plot dragged and when I thought some juicy bit of information was about to be revealed, it was a total letdown because it had nothing to do with why Stacy was being harassed. Very disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail the New Queen of Gothic Romance!","review":"I grew up reading authors like Victoria Holt, Mary Stewart and later Barbara Michaels.

The spontaneity of these recordings is a quality that is sometimes lacking in later Miles efforts. The \\"one-off\\" feel of \\"Salt Peanuts\\" is particularly fresh (though I miss Dizzy Gillespie's chant of \\"salt peanuts, salt peanuts\\" in his original recording). And Coltrane's couple of flubbed notes will make you smile; here is an emerging genius before he is fully formed. And, as always, the rhythm section of Garland, Chambers, and Jones is brilliant. In short, this disc will have you swingin' every time you put it in your player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointed at first, but a decent collection of songs","review":"I must admit that I purchased this expecting to find a heavily \\"cajunified\\" cover of Dire Straits \\"Walk of Life\\". Instead, it sounds like Mann is being backed by a single accordion player and a karaoke machine. I found this to be disappointing so I put the CD away for awhile.Recently I played the entire CD and found it to contain a number of hidden gems. He actually makes \\"Red Red Wine\\" his own (although I'm more familiar with the UB40 cover than the original). \\"Keep Your Arms Around Me\\" is a classic. Also, \\"Borderline\\" is a great up-tempo number to break up what are a number of slower tunes.Overall, I'd say that this is a good, but not great CD. Mann has a great voice, but he needs a better backup band (or a band period) for the recordings. If you are a big fan of Charles Mann himself, you will probably have a higher opinion, but for general fans of swamp pop and blue-eyed soul it will probably rate just average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing music for the soul","review":"I first heard Dama and D'Gary on independant radio, with their track \\"Be Cool.\\" After that night, I made it my mission to discover the writers of that amazing song.

So imagine my joy to discover his voice on the radio. He does not try to imitate an \\"Indian\\" voice (whatever that is), which sounds more honest to my ear.

Apparently, someone at the video transfer house actually sat down and spent considerable amount of time deciding (incorrectly most of the time) what is real and what is not real in the film, and italicizing the titles accordingly. This becomes especially nonsensical when one considers that Bunuel has stated many times that he didn't always know himself how to separate the scenes. To him the ending, for example, is real.

Until I discover something made better than \\"The Image\\" or \\"The Story of O\\", I'd save your money and don't waste any time on this slow moving, farce of a picture.If you enjoy an \\"artsy-fartsy\\" film with no nudity or S/M scenes...then this IS your film. Its certainly not worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring de jour....","review":"Horrible example of passe erotica...PG-13 by today's standards. Not in the same league as The Story of O, Emmanuel, or The Image.This films fails at every level to excite the viewer. I saw this in the theatre a few years ago and it put my wife to sleep. If another woman doesn't get excited by what's transpiring in an erotic film...why would it be worth anything?I can't find one reason to recommend this boring, less than erotic story about a housewife turned hooker. A hooker that never has sex on camera or anyplace else!Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"\\"Belle de Jour\\" is widely acclaimed as a masterpiece. I would like to know: by whom? Certainly by nobody with high self-esteem. If art's highest purpose is to project life as it ought to be, then, according to this film's creators, life ought to be seen as dispensable, drab, meaningless, and amoral. What is virtue? \\"Belle de Jour\\" doesn't know and doesn't care. What is coherent plot and characterization? \\"Belle de Jour\\" puts on a blindfold and pins a tale on neither. What sort of role best suits a stunningly beautiful actress? \\"Belle de Jour\\" says let's stick Catherine Deneuve in a pillory of an ugly, thankless role and spit at her as a self-loathing, self-deluded prostitute. What is \\"Belle de Jour\\"? Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prostitution in the Afternoon","review":"A rather dated and arguably misogynous film about a beautiful upper middle class housewife who has everything but prostitution in the afternoon. Those who \\"understand\\" the picture may marvel at how it ridicules the hypocrisy of society (how shocking!) and other brilliant ideas, but most people probably enjoy this film because of Catherine Deneuve, who went on to bigger and better things playing a call girl opposite Burt Reynolds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of academic interest only.","review":"This film is typical of movies made is the 60's, the pace is slow and the characters two dimensional.

Poor plot & ok acting.Worthit just ti look @ Denueve She was a beauty!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, boring and noninspiring","review":"Although this movie is an all-time favorite, I'd attribute it to the beauty of Catherine Deneuve alone. The whole plot is unreal or at least it's not done very convincingly. If the movie is still being watched for promised and advertised erotism, I wonder if it satisfies the viewers. The sex scenes are pathetic and definitely dated, not that it's because of the lack of crude scenes but actors look very awkward and lost, and the whole impression is of an embarrassment. Perhaps such scenes titilated the audiences 30 years ago. It's disappointing in many ways and it is quite boring indeed. There are better films by Bunuel and I fail to understand why this one is called masterpiece. See for yourself, though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent something else","review":"Your being persuaded by the praise written above largely depends on your already knowing and admiring Bunuel and Deneuve.

You can get it from Amazon UK. For those of you who aren't happy with the Region 1 version.As for the movie itself, I just have to say I love Bunuel's dialogues. I have Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie as well and it follows along the same lines. Witty dialogue, very amusing how he manages to make the characters stand out but at the same time they're very comical and heavy topics are lightened up somewhat through the way he works around them.Brilliant filmmaker.

So the movie had to undergo a range of cuts depending on the countries where it was to be shown (usually in adult theaters). For the VHS version it seems the producers cut out all of the scenes that had once been censored and added some cuts of their own to make it acceptable everywhere, even on TV.Of course in this way the viewer misses much of the sense of the movie. For instance, does anybody who saw the VHS (or the DVD) version know why Severine smiles after her meeting with the china man with his musical box?Further it's true that the DVD looks like it originated from a much abused VHS copy with nothing apparently done to improve its quality. But to restore the movie close to the director's first intent you'd have to dig out what's left of the original materials (after so many years there might be a lot missing) and do a full re-editing job. Would it be worth it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best brush ever!","review":"Wow,When my cat sees this brush he follows me all over the house!(you would think I had a treat for him to eat!)

The Rubba Scrubba \\"bristles\\" are longer and thinner (probably softer on her back.) She will sit for that for maybe 10 minutes.

The Kodaly quartet seems to know their Bartok very well and, exerting their technical skills, do a good deal of justice to Bartok in their performance. They do fall a little off on the rhythm a few places, but the overall performance is very decent considering the challenge that these compositions put forth.The folk rhapsodies are charming, and similar themes based on them run throughout Bartok's career (heavily influenced by the folk music of his native area). They aren't as impressive as the more well-known Bartok pieces, but they are interesting to hear.The piano quintet is the real jewel on the crown. Its more developed than the other pieces and resembles, stylistically, the mature Bartok pieces we all know and love.I would recommend this to anyone interested in Bartok's music though it isn't essential to anyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesser-known Bartok but still great Bartok","review":"Why I bought this disc: the price was right, and I love Bartok.

I did work in art direction & set construction on films at that time.I'm right handed so I love having the blade on the left for visibility of the cut. Be sure to keep your left hand clear!! Saws intended for homeowners have the blade on the right for greater safety.I found the motor housing to be in the way when using a guide to rip or crosscut plywood sheets. This was also mentioned by a previous reviewer.My major complaint is that this saw is very LOUD compared to the equivalent Porter Cable model. (I don't know if it's just my saw - there aren't that many hours on it. ) I would probably choose the P-C if I had to do it again.

This saw has more power than the Porter Cable Saw Boss, and is lightweight and easy to use. Most of the time I don't need the power of a 7 1/4\\" worm drive, so I grab the 5 1/2\\" skilsaw. I use it in my shop mostly for cutting sheets of plywood down to size, and occasionally to cut a 2 x 4 or a 2 x 6. It has plenty of power and is so convenient to use.

But if you're not careful you can spin the blade on the shaft. I did on a job rough cutting some 1\\" hardwood planks. Didn't really notice till the end of the day that the saw blade was running out of round. When I took the blade off I found the blade had cut a grove on the shaft. This should never have happened, the shaft should've been hardened.I will probably buy another and be more careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw has design flaw.","review":"While the saw works great as I used it to cut through some interior doors I was replacing but it has a big design flaw! There is a guide plate that has about an inch on one side of the blade and over three inches on the other. If you were making a cross cut and wanted to slide this guide against a straight edge you would want to use the 3+ inch side to have more support for the saw, right? The makers of this saw built the motor so low to the guide plate that it cannot slide against anything more than an 1/8 tall. This is really stupid. The saw works with the guild plate if you are cutting something thin like plywood, because you can raise the saw up (making the cut less deep) to clear your straight edge. The solution: for cutting something thick like interior doors, where you might want to use a straight edge - you have to use the one inch side. Not great support for the saw - but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic of a saw. You won't regret buying this saw!","review":"I've owned one of these for over 20 years.

The blade that came with the saw was poor, Chinese made, not carbide tipped, and I used it for one cut before changing to a quality blade. Saw is light weight and well balanced, will cut a 2X easily, should come with a sliding guide for the price. Otherwise a great saw and welcome replacement for my other 5.5 inch saw which I finally wore out in over 18 years use.

I was able to find blades at Home Depot. The power is more than adequate, far more powerful and comfortable than a battery saw. That said, I wouldn't use this tool to cut 2 X 12s all day. I think that would stress it. But I've been using it on 1X, plywood (where it really excels, and 2x. It has no trouble plowing through a 2 X 4. I just used it yesterday to cut slots for 2 x 4s into a 4X post that was in the ground. I used to do this with my 18 pound skilsaw. With this little guy, its a breeze.I've seen people complain that it won't cut a 2X at 45 degrees.

I use this saw to cut siding back and interior trim to allow for the new windows or doors to fit properly. This saw is perfect for this. It is light weight and the right size to get into those tight spaces. It hasn't lacked in power to do any of this. The one disappointing shortcoming of this saw however is it will not cut all the way through a 1 3/4\\" door. It lacks an 1/8\\" at the most to be able to do it. I have to pull my 7 1/4\\" saw out for that. You should also be careful of the base. My saw fell from 3 feet onto carpet and the base bent on the corner.

Not to be stereotypical of women but I find that I can't safely use the saw with one hand the way some people with stronger forearms might. The saw is missing a forward grip so you can use two hands to stabilize it. I had to make a piece with plumbing parts and attach it myself. The little 5inch cordless Ryobi has this grip - so should this one. Also there is no place to store the little blade wrench which should be kept with the saw itself. I had to duck tape mine to the saw because otherwise when you need it you might have a hard time finding it.

The blade is cheap and says made in china. From the look of it the casting has rough edges ground down on a grinder and poorly applied labels. If this was made in the USA then the poor quality control of China is rubbing off on US manufacturing. Or else it was made by former UAW people from Detroit and Dearborn. The blades advertised next to the item do not fit. Its not a 10mm arbor. It is a 1/2 inch arbor. And you have to attach the blade with the writing facing the inside as this is for a left hander. Or else the saw blade will turn the wrong way. The $29 Chinese saw from sears seems better constructed. In about six months harbor Freight will be selling these under their name for $39."},{"rating":"1","title":"[price] item","review":"Well, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this saw. For what they cost, I figured it would be good quality. It's cheaply made stamped guides and adjusting mechanisms were out of adjustment and the saw would not square up. It won't cut straight following the guide, you must watch the blade only.The first thing I did was get a decent carbide blade and that didn't help.The 6.5 amp motor struggles on 2X4 cross cuts.1/2\\"-3/4\\" plywood better be all you try it on.

In fact, I found that turning up the volume mostly just increased the volume of the static.Another problem with the phone is its ergonomics.

The base doesn't take up much space, and the phone supports both regular Caller ID and Call Waiting Caller ID. The memory function would be better if you could see the list while you're already on a call (to enter your voicemail or long distance code, etc.), but it serves its purpose. In other words, as a basic cordless phone, its feature set is just what it should be.My biggest complaint is with the sound quality. The sound generally is muffled, difficult to hear, and quite low-volume. Because of that, I wouldn't really recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding Cinema!","review":"I love Mr. Harris's exciting camerawork and editing!

Discussion of design is very basic and only helpful as the most basic of an introduction to aircraft design. You will certainly not know how to design an airplane after reading this book. Nor will you gain the insight needed to build with composites. I would only recommend this to an absolute beginner in the field. Even then, I think there is just too little good knowledge to be gain.

She seems to have come up with a facinating plot and then proceeds to mess it up almost beyond belief.Her main character never seems to dominate the novel. She constantly tells us how smart and formidable her heros are and then they prove her wrong by not being able to find or figure out anything. She has no sense of drama or suspense. She constantly changes the people driving the book, we go from Monk, to his wife, to Rathbone and if it doesn't fall in their lap they would never get there. One thought illustrates this point to a tee, she tells us Rathbone is the greatest barrister in the relm, then at the start of the trial she tells us Tobias defeats him as often as not, from the way it goes from there that is an understatement. Sometimes I give things a second chance but not this time thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monk and Wife Struggle With Wedded Bliss and Solve a Mystery","review":"I have been a fan of Anne Perry's detectives [and formerly one wife -- now two wives] for many years. The plot of this novel is intriguing and complex as is customary in Perry's works, and, in addition, we get to see the jockeying for position in their newly-combined home between the amnesiac investigator William Monk and the opinionated nurse Hester Latterly Monk. These scenes are fascinating and show that Perry not only knows her Victorians but is also knowledgeable about the human heart, regardless of time. All in all, this was an excellent read. From the moment a young woman mysteriously disappears from a croquet game at one of Britian's grand country estates in the company of one of the family's male servants, there is seldom a dull moment.I thoroughly enjoyed the book. May the author provide us with many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, as usual!","review":"This book was gripping until the end - though without the usual tension between Hester and Monk to add that extra bite we've been used to in this series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual twist","review":"One of the better ones as I did not guess the end! Working my way through the whole series - love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent examination of Victorian morality","review":"The newly married Mr. Mrs. Monk become embroiled in a nicely complex mystery, steeped in Victorian morality. a missing bride-to-be, a nurse taking her belief in healing outside of the confines of her hospital's notions of what constitutes proper medical care, and the struggle of Perry's newlyweds adjusting to their new lives together combine to create an intriguing and thought provoking adventure. Perry's ability to capture the time period is exceptional; she not only creates a proper setting but her presentation of Victorian morality, particularly in the medical establishment's attitude toward the nursing profession, is exceptional. It serves as an interesting history lesson as well as and good mystery.While the mystery itself is sufficiently complex to interest a reader, the ending is a bit rushed after the long set-up. But all in all, this was a good read and a nice addition to Perry's series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and engrossing","review":"While the story itself was perhaps not that remarkable, I found the characters well-drawn out and perfectly believable.

But instead, I found it tedious and hard to \\"get into.\\" The characters were not all that likeable, and the mother's death (normally something I would cry or at least feel some remorse over) was, seriously, the most interesting part.

All natural deodorants fade away after time during the day, especially if you're sweating a lot or changing clothes, and I've been wearing natural deodorants for years, you just learn your limits and reapply as needed. The beauty of this one is the patchouli oil, which seems to remain fragrant longer than other deodorants I've tried. Another reviewer mentioned it being hard to apply, and to that I agree to a point, but it depends on the room temperature due to the ingredients in the base of the formula.

Ironically, the Church is not a church nor is there ANY science behind any of their malicious claims and attacks. It may be true that there are abuses within psychiatry, medicine or the mental health fields, AS THERE ARE IN EVERY OTHER PROFESSION INCLUDING THE CLERGY.

Astaire and Skelton play things pretty low-key in this straightforward potboiler; Skelton is particularly likeable with his big-lug interpretation of Ruby's personality and Astaire... Well, he's just Astaire, which is to say he's great -- wish maybe he'd danced a bit more in this one. The music is nice too, especially when they sing as a duet; the movie's only downside is the drab female leads, Arlene Dahl and Vera-Ellen, both of whom are a bit dull, and don't sing that well.

He hones right in on the essence of the character's lives and spares the reader any gratuitous drama. The result is a feeling of undeniable bleakness. Yet, similar to Hemmingway's style, the strong characters find their strength in a certain type of resignation.What I liked most about this book is how I found myself clearly wanting to distance myself from the bleakness of these character's lives, yet, I was maddeningly unable to. That's the beauty of Carver's minimalist style; he hones the truth down to its barest form, so that a reader can't avoid finding a sliver of it within. And that's the true scare-factor of this book; Carver demonstrates beautifully the fine line all of our lives traverse, and how we must be vigilant, aware, and beware in every moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another short-story collection I'm glad I read","review":"And afterwards, I went back and noted in the blank space at the end of each story the setting, main characters, conflict and conclusion.

Even so, why criticize a young author for being influenced -- even molded -- by an editor? The author/editor relationship is complex, contentious, controversial -- and, in this case, extremely rewarding. If Gottlieb shares any credit for shaping Carver into a short story writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Chekov and Hemingway, then I say, \\"Thanks a lot, Bob!\\" Nothing happens in the stories? C'mon, LA reader. Carver captures that unique American disconnection and emotional emptiness as well as any author imaginable. And he still manages to be funny! (Similarly, the movie \\"American Beauty\\" does a better job of being Carveresque than Altman's \\"Short Cuts\\" did.) This book is essential reading -- although \\"Where I'm Calling From\\" offers a more complete look at his entire career."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHORT BUT NOT REALLY SWEET","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I cut my first writing teeth on short stories and I clearly realize Raymond Carver's brilliance. All of his collections are excellent. WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOVE is among his best. Carver can pour more felt life into a few thousand words than most of us other writers can do in tens of thousands of words. These stories--some odd, some simple, all minimalist--showcase Carver's talent as well as those in any other collection. If I could have ever learned to write short stories as powerful as Carver's, I likely would have never begun my successful career as a novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"After every story in the book I just ask myself \\"why?\\" What a bunch of pointless stories.

I would bet anything most of the people praising this book below are writing students, writers, or professors. It's incestuous writing, with all the meta-fiction cliches for the coverted. Hemingway--to his eternal credit--in a letter to a publisher, said, \\"My stories are intended to appeal to high brows and low brows BOTH.\\" Hemingway, of course, wrote brilliant stories.

Here are some of my recomendations...1. The first thing I recommend is to get a new high quality stone cutting blade. This is a must. The provided blade is ok, but after a few cuts, you notice the dullness coming out.2. Purchase an additional extension for the water pump. The provided tubes are a little short. Clean water for the pump is a must!3. Lastly, I dumped the little white tub and used a tall kitchen trash can and set the saw on top. I got tired of dumping the old water all the time :).The motor on this little guy, is awesome. Another gentlemen complained about the rip guide fence, I found that making a line on my actual tile, was better. And the bubbled table top, well, turn the tile upside down and it glides very smoothly. making your cut line with a good carpenters pencil on the bottom side of the tile, will usually not come off when the water hits it anyways.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective - Crooked blade","review":"Judging from the reviews so far I think I might have had a defective product. As I took it out of the box and put everything together I thought it was decent but after wasting a couple of expensive tiles I realized it was the blade causing issues, not the fence or operator error. The blade was off 1/4\\" from one end to the other. The motor assembly mount of the holding bracket looks to be welded crooked. I would give this another try but I don't have time to return this and wait for a new one.Just make sure to check that the blade is straight before you get into a tile project!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Screws Stripped","review":"Saw arrived with stripped screw holes where saw attaches to base.

But this movie wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it was worth a watch and it had a few suprises that I didn't expect. And it did have enough martial arts to keep a fan of the genre interested without driving off other people who don't get an instant erection from two guys doing their 'Matrix' act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie!","review":"Horrible script and fight scenes! Would have expected more from these two action stars! Rented it and it wasn't worth the $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Jet Li's WORST Movies Ever","review":"Before continuing with the review, I would like to note that I am a huge fan of Jet Li and Jason Stratham. However, I am not a fan of crappy movies with a horrible plot and storyline that doesn't make sense. If this were Jet Li's first English speaking movie, maybe I could excuse his horrible lines and limited character development. However, this is like his 20th movie in America and this is several steps down from where he should beI saw this movie when it initially came back, so most of it is a blur. But I do remember my negative feelings about itand I'm certain this movie is not worth buying or watchingDO NOT RECOMMEND"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Jet Li fans. So so for others","review":"I strongly agree with the majority of reviewers here that this movie cant satisfy most of the target audience who expect violent confrontations between Li and Statham. However, as a fan of Li, I like the movie much for its extremely stylish depiction of Li as the very intelligent and nearly invincible assasin who knows strategy. I like the plot, too, but I wont ruin your interest by disclosing it. Despite the not so promising ratings here, I suggest you to rent it for a good entertainment after dinner. The rental and your valuable time will be well paid back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok, not what I expected!","review":"Any opportunity to watch Jet Li and Jason Statham I take it, although I was not willing to pay to see it in the theater. Why do that when I can watch it on By Demand! Anyway, I find Jason Statham extremely sexy and looked forward to him dueling the ever talented Jet Li (who I simply love in most of his action adventure/epic movies). I also liked them in The One, which was a decent movie. But the big showdown that I was waiting for just never materialized.Statham, a federal agent is out for vengeance after his partner was killed following a bust. The story picks up three years later when Statham finds evidence that the elusive killer is still alive. The story is predictable and the showdown between the \\"good guy and bad guy\\" never materializes. I kept waiting for some really good martial arts scenes, and although there were a few they were far and inbetween.This movie a lot of potential, I am just not sure if it delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"One major problem","review":"The problem with this movie is that you take two FANTASTIC martial arts stars, put them in a movie together ...

Messy plot. Bad script. Poor acting. And sad to say it comes from Jet Li, who has just won Best Actor for Warriors in Hong Kong. Jet should stick to Mandarin films... Hero was an Oscar nominee, Fearless was critically acclaimed and Warriors winning accolades.For John Lone, I really miss him in the Last Emperor.For Davon Aoki, even the playing a bikini clad samurai princess in DOA was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I usually like films which star either Jason Stratham or Jet Li, but I found this one virtually unwatchable. The story is really mediocre and can't be carried by the action sequences. In the very first scene of the movie you can't even make out what the characters are saying since they are mumbling almost unintelligibly. What was the director thinking?Stratham has recently had a string of poor films and this continues the trend. Not sure if it is his problem (just looking for quick bucks after some successful films) or screenwriters and directors.I can't recommend it even to Jet Li fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"This disc refuses to play in either of the bluray players in the house.This one convinced me to stop buying them until they fix the technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected a lot and got very little","review":"This poorly directed movie is also a big letdown as the viewer is looking for an epic fight between the two biggest martial arts stars that never really happens (they fight uninspired for about 30 seconds). There was also the possibility of either star taking on the female martial artist from Sin City and that never happens either.In this one Statham is an FBI Agent who is hunting Rogue (Li), an assassin who supposedly killed his partner and partner's family. Rogue seems to switch sides between the Yakuza and the Triads and also seems to have ample opportunities to kill Statham but never does. When all is explained in the end, you will leave the movie shaking your head.Statham is not the likeable character that he was in the Transporter films and that also really detracts from any enjoyment I may have gotten out of this movie. Better to wait for this to end up on cable than to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible horrible and little action","review":"I enjoy action movies and have liked Jet Li and Jason Statham in movies in the past, but this was terrible acting and not enough good action to make up for it. We got this as a treat for our teenage son who'd just gotten off of a grounding, and we feel that we did him an injustice by having this be the first movie he'd seen in two months. It was bad enough that the acting was terrible and the plot predictable and stupid, but the cookie cutter shootout, car chase, cycle chase and, considering the abilities of two of the stars, boring and too-few fight scenes made this one of my least favorite movies of all time. We apologized to our son for having this be the first movie that he'd watched in two months.

Only thing interesting in the movie was the car Jet Li was driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"the camera sucks","review":"I hated this movie, I almost always love movies with Jet Li or Jason Stathamin them but I hated this one, why? you may ask, here's why: the camera. the camera jumped & jiggled so much during the fights you couldn't tell what was going on, & it's an action movie which you watch for the fighting, right? well if you aren't able to see what happened it's basically just an action movie without action. when the cops were held at gun point in the restaurant (I think it was a restaurant) & they started to fight their way out & the women stabbed 1 of the bad guys it looked to me like she was the one who got stabbed, so in my opinion the movie sucks, just like Bourne Supremacy"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WAR is OVER","review":"I went to this movie with high expectation.

In my opinion, closely miced Bach is the best way to record it, since a great level of transparency is achieved--ideal for appreciating the music's tonic progressions and letting each note be heard. In many ways Gould was achieving a more harpsichord-like sound (remember the harpsipiano?) with his recording techniques. All in all, this recording, along with Vol. 2, presents Gould in his consistant excellence.

You're better off buying a different brand of CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The (...)thing is plastic!","review":"Not only is it plastic, it is engraved with metric units of measure. I realize Bosch is a european sounding name, but if they are selling product in the USA they could at least warn you that this is a metric tool. If I wanted to learn the metric system, I would have asked to be born in Germany. If you commonly use inches, you will not enjoy using this accessory. Don't get me wrong, I really like plastic for toys and tupperwear. I think for the money this guide should be of a substantial metal construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need this for the clamp - generics don't fit Bosch!","review":"This product is short and pricey compared to the generic which included 4 blades to fit a variety of different brand jig saws. If you have a Bosch jig saw, buy it because it's likely the only guide you'll find that includes a clamp that works with your saw.The big box stores' generic guide does fit this saw, but the clamp (which the literature inside the box admits) is made for the Skil. (Brands other than Bosch and Skil supposedly have a clamp built into the foot of the saw itself.) You need the clamp to hold the guide in place. Otherwise, the guide is worthless. So, unfortunately, if you have a Bosch jig saw, you need the Bosch guide even though it's 50% more expensive than the generic, even on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME","review":"When using this cheap piece of plastic junk I ruined the hardboard I tried to cut circular pieces out of.

This means that if you drill the recommended size pilot hole, you get a very sloppy fit. Even with a smaller hole, you have to hold down the point quite firmly, bending the metal arm. I'll be using a 3/32 or smaller hole, rather than the recommended 13/64.2) The scale doesn't make sense. Cutting a 140mm hole, the 170mm mark was centered on the blade. The 140mm mark wasn't aligned with anything in particular.3) It just doesn't have the solid quality of the Bosch power tools I have bought recently.Tip: Cut very slowly, and you can get a good circle. The manual mentions cutting slowly, but the required speed is slower than I would have guessed. It works fine once you find the right pace, but practice on a scrap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"See Bosch Jigsaw Manual for Instruction","review":"For some reason, package of the cutting guide does not show how to use it.

My only problem is that mine seems to be slow on almost every setting but I would much rather have it slow than fast so that baby doesn't fly across the room.

At first I thought he was too young to use it, so I tried him in it every month. The same thing happened repeatedly. He kept falling over to the side and his head would hit the blue bar while the swing was in motion. (the belt was appropriately fitted) Fortunately, we were there to get him out of it as soon as it happened.It seems that the seat sits too upright letting him fall over. I even tried holding him up with rolled up hand towels to the side of him, but that didn't work. Not to mention that the dangling objects also hit him in the head. The last time we tried the swing we taped those to the side, but once again he fell over hitting his head.I will not put my son in this swing again, ever let anyone borrow it, and never donate it to any organization."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish We Would Have Gotten A Regular Swing Instead","review":"DS doesn't seem to like it too much, yet he loves the regular swing at day care. I think it's because of the shape of the seat. It's more like a boucey chair and I think he doesn't feel safe in it. Also, the low speed isn't much different then the high speed. It's way to fast. He also doesn't care for the lights. About the only thing he does like about it is the toys, fish, and music. At most, he'll only stay in it for about 20 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy, dangerous!!","review":"I just returned this swing because it is not suitable for a newborn.

It seemed too reclined even when he was only two months old and the fast swinging motion along with the bright flashing lights is too much for an alert baby! He cries the minute we place him in it and even more if I turn anything on. Plus there really isn't much to play with besides the two oddly angled hanging fish on each side. We use it as a seat for him to sit and hold his rattles in, but it's pretty expensive just for that. We have the entire Ocean Wonders set of equipment and this piece is the worst. Also, what is with those repetitive songs? Every Ocean Wonders item plays the same awful wannabe classical songs. My baby is not impressed and neither am I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Lifesaver!","review":"My main reason for purchasing this swing was so I can put my baby in it while I am in the shower and I can watch her. She has been swinging in it since she was 2 weeks old and only weighed 6 pounds so it is functional for small babies and she sits very comfortably in it. I have found that it is easy to take up and down the stairs also so she usually sits in it while we eat dinner. I only use it on the slowest speed and that seems pretty fast to me. She is still too small for the big swing I have (Baby Trend) so this has been a lifesaver for me. I highly recomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for newborns","review":"i got four swings as gifts for my baby and i returned all but kept this one because i thought it was the cutest. big mistake. i dont like to put my baby in it and he doesnt like it either. he is 2 months old now and still too small for it (he's 11lbs). it does not have good support for the back and he just looks looks so curled up in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective model","review":"I guess I got a defective model, because it turns on by itself even when it is switched off.

We got this Take Along swing as a gift at our baby shower and we were excited in putting it to use with our baby, but I was disappointed when it would just turn on by itself and the motor was LOUD.

I guess it has to go back to the store, hopefully they'll allow me to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young babies","review":"My baby's head falls to the side in this swing!

When they tip to the side, the little hanging fish hit them in the face. There are also delightful little fish swimming on the sides of this device. When your child leans over to explore, their little heads get stuck between the fixed post and the swinging arm and get banged over and over. The only nice, safe feature is the lights. Do not buy this Swing. Buy something safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible swing.","review":"I would give this swing zero stars if I could. My mom bought this for her house. My infant loved to swing. Not in this one, however. The swinging motion is very erratic. The seat does not look comfortable. The music and lights were not effective. The toys could not be removed and were very distracting. It did not transport well. For the price, buy a full-size swing and find the room. You will not regret it. Buy this one, you probably will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dissapointed customer","review":"The full size version of this swing is amazing and wonderful and I would recommend it without reservation. This smaller version however was horrible. Take the safety advice of the manufacturer to heart; if the baby is mobile it's going to hurt itself. In addition to the often mentioned toys hitting the head, my daughter, who is quite squirmy managed to hit her head with the support bars. I could envision her getting her head caught in between them. We've had this since my daughter was born seven months ago. And have used it periodically hoping that she would grow in to it. She never did and after the support bar incident she will never get in to it again. After the phenomenal success with the larger swing I was more than disappointed by this one. My Wife is in the process of asking Fischer Price directly for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much going on","review":"My son loves to stare at the orange fish and the lights and the music... but gets over stimulated and gets upset.

I wish I had just gotten an open top full sized swing instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"My son started using this swing after he was 3 weeks old. He also has the Ocean Wonders Full size swing but had move temporarily and didn't want to lug the full size one with us for two months. We had tons of trouble with this swing because he would get hit in the head with the toys that hung down so I had to remove them. Then I always had to bend him awkwardly to pick him up out of the seat so he wouldn't hit his head on the top bar which would always make him cry. His head and body slides left and right which is very uncomfortable looking-he never looked at the lights up top until he was two months old and he still doesn't like the seat. It's suppose to have different speeds but they are pretty much all the same speed. I am taking this back to the store because it was a waste of $50.00. Take your money and get yourself a bouncer or a full size."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS, purchase with caution","review":"We bought the Graco Swingomatic fold up swing (Jackpot print)after returning the Ocean Wonders Take along swing.

Graco redesigned their swing and put in a 5 point harness A MUST, and some come with a baby head support- reccomended for young infants. Graco travel swings have mesh on the sides to prevent such injuries. ***(Fisher Price- please follow suit- Ocean Wonder is a wonderful line but NOT the Take along swing)*** You can see my review under the Graco swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"I tried this swing at a friend's house and my baby loved it. I rushed out and bought one. It is the only thing that keeps baby happy enough for me to get some things done, including taking a shower (LOL).

If you assemble it following the directions, there should be no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, disappointing","review":"Newborn cannot be placed in the seat, it will not recline enough for him to lay down and it is slouched just so that it's even hard to prop the baby up with blankets and such.

Also when you do try to rig it so baby can be propped in it, it's still horrible because the hanging sea animals hit him in the head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"Our 14 week old daughter loves this swing! Even at 13 pounds on the low settings (4/5) she is moving very well. It is wonderful to take to her grandparents.

I always take it with me when we are gone for long periods of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible safety issue. Don't buy","review":"I originally had the deluxe swing and my baby loved it, so much so he wore it out. I immediately went to purchase another and found only the Aquarium Take Along was avaliable. I am concerned about it's safety, as it pushes his chin to his chest and also allows his head to lean to each side to the point it rests on his shoulder!

I will be returning this item and will not purchase another Fisher Price product with the same seat design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"My daughter was almost 3 months when we needed this swing and about 16 pounds.

I am surprized though how long the batteries lasted. Overall I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment...","review":"The idea of taking a swing with you is a nice thought, but this sure does need some improvements.This swing worked only marginally well until my son weighed about 15 pounds. After that, his weight seemed to be too much for the swing to handle. No matter which speed we set it on, each yielded the same results (\\"7\\" worked the same as \\"4\\")The seat is very wide, and in my opinion, there is not much lateral support. Even though he was properly strapped in, I noticed that my son would start to lean to the side while in this swing. He even leaned so much that I worried his head would get wedged between the bars of the swing and the stand. It wasn't worth the risk to me.I was disappointed with this product and my son did not enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for younger babies that can't support their head.","review":"Very cute swing and a great idea, however my daughter who is 3 months old keeps falling over and she was caught between the bar and swing.

The lights, music and \\"swimming\\" fish are great...it's just that she prefers me holding her while she stares at them! I feel the lowest speed is still too fast for a little one and my baby prefers the cradle motion to the forward backward motion. (thanks to her Fisher Price Papasan Cradle Swing!)There is no strap to hold the swing in place when you \\"take-it-along\\" anywhere and the toys hanging down almost hit her in the face when shes sits in it!

He hated the regular swings (I have no idea why other then they where too fast, or too high.), so I picked this one out because it was close to the ground like the bouncer. It swings slower then other swings on the first setting (which is great) and he LOVES the lights. I think the swing is also made very well. It is very stable and holds up to 25lbs. My little guy is only a month old, so the reclining seat is great for him. It seems more comfortable to him. I highly recommend this swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I thought I was going to love this swing because I have the larger version of this one and the bouncer, but to my disappointment, the moment I put my baby in it, he got very upset. I thought he was just being colicky or fussy, but EVERY single time I put him in it, he would react the same way. He loves his Ocean Wonders cradle swing and bouncer, but somehow, he just didn't like this model. I figured it was the lights above, it seemed a little overwhelming. The toys kept hitting him in the head as it swung and worst of all, it was VERY HARD to store! Every time I folded it and set it aside somewhere, it would just open up again and collapse. I returned mine and bought the Linkadoos travel swing, we'll see how well that goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN UNKNOWN DANGER","review":"My daughter got her head caught between the two side rails (the white plastic & blue metal), so the swing was swinging hitting her head, causing her to cry. She was only 4 1/2 months when this happened.

My infant tilted to the side and her head/neck was caught between the swing's base frame and the swing arm. Had I not been a few feet away to hear her cry, she could have been seriously injured. Obviously, that was the last time we used this swing.

The Graco Travel Lite swing has already been recalled so please also report anyone still selling it, as I have seen on several websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"This is an excellent example of a horrible design. It is supposed to be suitable for newborns, but our 2 1/2 month old has yet to fit in it properly. Moreover, the upright seat angle makes her head slouch forward or to the side at dangerous angles and seem to compromise her breathing, at which point the hanging fish continually bang her head as it swings. It's real cute, but leave this thing behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this swing!","review":"I thought havng this swing would be wonderful because i can move it easly from room to rom and take it along with we when i go places.

She loved the lights and she didn't hunch over at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support for baby","review":"I own the larger version and my daughter has loved it since day one. I purchased this swing with travel in mind. I agree with many of the other reviews. The big problems: the handlebar over the seat makes it difficult to get baby in and out without hitting her head and the seat is at a 90 degree angle which causes my 4 month old to slide off to the sides. My daughter has not had her head caught between the side and the back while swinging yet, but I can see how it would happen. Also, since she's always slumping in it the dangling fish on the sides hit her in the head/face while she's swinging. I took twist-ties and secured the fish to the side rail to prevent this and she can still pull them.Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous and ridiculous","review":"We recieved this as a gift at a baby shower and I was tempted to take it back. I really should've followed my instinct.My 3.5 month old is not supported in this, and when I attempt to prop him with a blanket, the animals hit him in the head. To make matters worse, his head got caught between the white bar and the aquamarine bar and he was being hit in the head. This could lead to serious injury that I don't believe fisher price considered upon making this product.Save your money and go buy something else. It's not worth the risk of your baby being hurt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I loved this swing until my 4 month old son's head slipped out the side and he hit his head on the bar. Luckily, I was in the room. The mesh on the side does not offer enough protection to keep a child from falling sideways. I complained to Fisherprice and Target. I am taking it back. Do not leave your child alone in this swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!!","review":"I bought this swing because it was moblie and did not take up as much room as the larger, full sized swings. The first time I put my son in the swing, he hit his head on the metal bars - I thought maybe he was too young for the swing. I have been trying to use the swing for 6 months now, and everytime I put him in it his head is hit by the bars. There was even a few times when his neck was stuck in between the swing and the metal bar. If you ask me, this swing is poorly designed and a hazard to the babies who use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!","review":"This swing is awful! My baby squirms and has no back support. The bar on top also makes getting her in and out cumbersome, and I usually wind up hitting her head on it! Stick with a full size or another travel swing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not practical","review":"I already had a full size Graco Swing for my 2 month old but I needed a travel swing to take to Grandmas for frequent visiting. It worked well for the first two weeks and my baby really like the hanging toys but then the batteries died. After finally figuring out to replace them (takes a bit of a trick to get the battery compartment back in its slot)the Duracell batteries died again in another two weeks. Overall the swing is cute and my baby liked it for a while but he only used for 1 month tops and he much prefers the full size swing. Not really worth the extra expense, stick with the full size or another travel model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both my children used it and loved it","review":"I bought this swing used at a consignment shop. I love it because it doesn't take up much space and both of my children (now 4 months and 21 months) used it and loved it. I agree with what somebody said about the bar in the way, but I guess that's just part of using such a compact swing. Very easy to travel with."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Both Worlds","review":"This swing is not good as a travel swing nor as a regular swing. The seat doesn't support my baby at all (chronic slumping!) and it rocks much too slow, especially compared to a full-sized swing. My son is not soothed in it at all - it is just an expensive chair. It also doesn't travel very well and is difficult to carry with one hand. And the overhead bar makes lifting him out a very tricky maneuver. My son likes the lights/fish/music but we could have got those features on the bouncy chair for much cheaper. Don't waste your money on this one - either get a full size swing or one of the other travel swing models. I'm taking mine to a consignment shop today to hopefully get a least a few bucks back so I can purchase a useful swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its soo cute but baby cant sit in it","review":"I have the whole ocean wonders set!!! and I love it! but this swing is just horrible!! my daughter is now 4 months and still doesnt get in it. It sits to high. I wonder what they were thinking when they mad it??? the others lay back, I DO NOT reccomend this swing for anything"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS...","review":"We purchased this for our daughter when she was around 2 months old to take to Grandma's and other travel. She was not happy with the reclined seat. She wanted to sit upright more and the seat is not adjustable. After taking it to Grandma's in the stored position, it quit working. New batteries were tried and nothing worked. It is expensive for an item that will not work after it only being a month old. Use your money wisely and get something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Issues","review":"I purchased this swing less than a month ago for my son, and already I feel like this product is entirely unsafe. When I placed him in the swing, he slid to the side and hit his head on the side bar. There appears to be some type of balancing issue. Frankly, one star is giving this product too much credit. I have concerns over the saftey of the swing -- it should not be on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst thing I have ever bought in my life","review":"We decided to buy this swing thinking it would be a great deal, especially coming from Fisher Price. The first one that we bought had the volume control broken. Then, we changed it for a new one. This one has the volume working very well, however, the speed control was not working. It was swinging very, very fast in ALL the speeds. Definetely it was the worst shopping experience of our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor quality","review":"I have this swing. I LOVED the concept. I have the cradel swing and bouncy seat as well, and both work GREAT. But, I've owned the swing for 6 weeks and it just up and died on me. No explanation. When I called the store about it, the mgr. told me what the prob. was w/o even talking to me or seeing the swing. That told me this swing has known problems, and I'd encourage everyone to spend that $60 on another product (like putting it towards the cradle swing). JMO"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY VERY CHEAP","review":"I HATE IT!! THIS SWING IS VERY FLIMSY!!! THE TOP BAR FALLS DOWN AND DEPENDING ON HOW BIG YOUR BABY IS COULD HIT YOUR BABY IN THE HEAD.. DOES NOT REALLY RECLINE. MY DAUGHTER LIKES TO RECLINE AND THIS DOES NOT. VERY CHEAPLY MADE NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Swing!!","review":"I brought this swing for my 2 month old daughter, and she loves it. She likes to look at the lights and she can also pull on the toys. She likes to look at the fish. She even falls to sleep in it! What I dislike about the swing is the bar do not raise up, so when you take your baby out the swing be careful not to hit his/her head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very comfortable","review":"I liked the idea that the swing was compact and didn't take up so much room. However, the seat is at such a tough angle my baby has yet to be comfortable sitting in it. His head is put at position where he has to look straight out but head control is an issue. Plus the lights under the handle is such an attraction that he winds up slumped over to look at them and then the toys that hand down hit him in the head. I had to tie one up so he could lay sideways. We do much better w/bouncy seats and the old fashion big clunky swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great swing for travel","review":"This is a great swing to have if you plan on traveling to visit family or vacation. I have taken it on vacation and even to the babysitters. The only complaint is that when my daughter was a newborn the hanging fish were always in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad the music doesn't loop","review":"I have been using this swing for about 3 weeks and I'm not overly pleased or disappointed with it. The only thing I feel strongly about is that I wish the music looped and played continuosly instead of needing turned on after it's done with a 'once through'."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but try new version","review":"i got this because i thought it was cute and loved the ocean wonders. it was really cute, but my baby's head would always look like it was going to fall forward. I bought the new version wiht the pivot 'n play handle (still ocean wonders) and it is much better. she is much more comfortable and the bar moves making it easier to take the baby out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing","review":"My son loved this swing! The only problem was he grew out of it too soon, but as a young infant 1-3 months it really served it's purpose. I do however agree that it was somewhat difficult to get my son in and out of the swing because of the bar at the top, but on a travel swing I do not see how you can get around that. He loved pulling on the toys to make the music and lights come on and was always entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DANGEROUS","review":"I bought this swing for my 3mth old. After 10 minutes first time using it, he started crying and screaming. I ran to him, and his head was stuck between the bars! His head was hitting the bar each time the swing moved. There is NO support what so ever for baby! This swing is very dangerous! I am currently working w/ the company for a full refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for newborns!","review":"When I originally bought this, I thought it was great! Music, lights, and a toy and swing combo with great colors. However, I soon found out that it is NOT SAFE for babies that cannot hold up their head! My 7 week old started leaning, and within 30 seconds was in a position where his head was between the frame and light stand over the net area of one side. Fortunately, it was only for a split second and he is o.k. This may be fine for older infants, but I would not take the chance! I brought this one back immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUR SON WAS ALMOST KILLED!!!","review":"Please beware of this product!! We have two other swings and thought that this would be GREAT to take in the van with us.. Was I wrong!! Although our son loved the lights, I ran after our 1 1/5 year old, was out of the room LESS than 5 minutes.. our 4 month old was strapped in correctly (you should be able to leave a 4 month old in a swing..this is our 3rd in 3 years) when we returned, he was PURPLE, hanging by his neck, his head was jammed between the seat and the bar.. this is EXTREMELY unsafe.. I agree with several of the other parents.. nice idea but the seat just pops up. A 4 month old cannot even sit up by themselves (which is when you are supposed to take them out so they don't flip forward)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy putting baby in and out of the swing","review":"I had purchased this swing a few months and I'm not ALL that pleased with it. It's great for traveling around with. But I felt that the bar that goes across and above the baby's head was in the way. Everytime I would put her in or put her out- that bar was right smack in the middle and the seat kept swinging forward. So you have to watch out for the overhead bar. Other than that, great for traveling and easy to store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to \\"Take Along\\"","review":"This swing does not stay folded up when you try to carry it somewhere. The seat unfolds and when you try to stand it somewhere (like putting it down when coming thru the door with an armload of stuff) it won't stay propped up against anything, it just falls on the floor. The toys hit the baby in the head and the bar is too low to try to get baby out without hitting head. I do not think this is a good swing to \\"take along\\". It is bulky. The lights do not stay on to keep baby entertained. Only good thing......it is very sturdy and does swing very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrable","review":"I bought this swing for my newborn. I tried to put her in it and the seat sat up so high that she fell over . We would out a blanket around her to prop her up but if she was anywhere but right in the middle the toys hanging down hit her in the face. I put it away for a couple of months and tried it again now that she is three months. the toys still hit her in the face and the seat is still up so high that she has to turn her head up tp even see the lights on the top. This toy was a TOTAL waste of money even for a part time wing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling","review":"This swing is great for traveling. We keep it at my mom's, but take it with us when we travel to my inlaws. We even took it to my son's baptism reception. It's small, stays out of the way, and keeps my 3 month old son entertained for long periods of time.In my opinion, this swing shouldn't replace the bigger swings that you'd have at home... This is a take-a-long swing. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for travelers!","review":"We bought this swing on a recent vacation to see our family. We knew our son loved the full size swing at home, but it was WAY too bulky to pack in the car. This travel swing folds up relatively small and is easy to cart around. It is also extremely easy to fold and unfold. My 8 yr old nephew did it in seconds without even being shown how to do it! My only complaints are that the seat doesn't lock into place when in use, and it does not have any kind of lock to help it stay folded when packed up. Oh, and the music is really strange. I guess it's supposed to be aquatic sounding, but it just sounds like a muffled mess. That said, my son seems to like the music, even if I don't! I would highly recommend this to anyone who travels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SWING","review":"I RECEIVED THIS SWING AS A BABY SHOWER GIFT.

OTHER THAN THAT A MUST HAVE PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful swing","review":"This swing is very useful to have when going places. My son likes to watch the light show but he can't watch it when he is swinging and also the swing swings a little faster when they are small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs improvement","review":"This swing is a great purchase. My 3 month young daughter absolutely loves holding onto the stars and fish while she looks up at the lights and swings back and forth. The only negative things are that the swing seems to not work at the lowest speed so we have to give it a push, and also it is a little hard to carry it while she's in the swing. I'm glad I get to keep this and save it for our next child!"},{"rating":"1","title":"from NJ","review":"we got this as a gift when our daughter was 6 weeks old. It now sits in a corner, as it makes her cry more. The lights are too bright & make her squint. There's nothing for her to play with. She ignores the 2 \\"swimming\\" fish, and the haning plastic ones annoy her, as the swinging brings them too close to her face. And the music turns off automatically after a few minutes. She's much more content in her hard car seat! i gave it 2 stars, due to its size, and the fact that without lights & music on, we have gotten her to sleep in it on rare occasions."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SWING IS A DANGER TO YOUR INFANT","review":"I received this swing as a shower gift. I do have many of the Ocean Wonders line of products and have been very happy with them, but this item needs to be taken off the market. My son is almost 8 months old now and I have probably used it two times since I brought him home from the hosptial. Everytime I have put my son in the swing his head has always fell to the side and almost got wedged between the bars. THIS SWING IS A SERIOUS SAFTEY HAZARD TO ANY INFANT. Also the seat sits to straight up for a new born, if any thing this swing should be for an infant at least 6 months or older. I THINK THEY SHOULD RECALL THIS SWING AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SWING TO ANY MOTHER OR FATHER!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like F-P, but not this","review":"My daughter loves her swing, so I wanted to try one that was portable. NO WAY! I tried a friend's swing and she hated it. She is use to a swing with a hard back and this one is softer than her bouncy seat. I'm glad I tried it before wasting my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS PLEASED AS I THOUGHT I'D BE","review":"I received this item as a gift at my shower. I loved the theme and bright colors. I liked the portability, but was not pleased when I put my 2mo. old in the swing. I did not like the fact that it cannot recline to suit a newborn. Also while my son is very active (even at a young age), he managed to slide sideways and got his head caught between the side bars. I was devasted to see my baby lying there with his head against the netting. Needless to say, he has not been in it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"You know, with a little more work, this could've been a pretty good thriller. Watch it and you'll see what I mean--all the pieces are there, they just don't get used quite right. It's like watching the rough draft of a better movie.

I find it difficult to believe that such an elegant person would use inpolite gutter language....It appeared that the author did not have any love or like for Ralph Lauren...I would love to read a well written book about Ralph Lauren....I don't believe that he talks in that manner and would like to read the elegant approach. I would love a book about his style and creations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super summer dinosaur read!","review":"I loved the whole story line and the characters involved. Just the idea of having a time-quilt effect bring the past(millions of years ago) exist with the present was interesting to see what consequences resulted. I loved the New York City portion of the story with the old lady and the Iguanadon, she just took the whole situation in stride with life. The author writes very descriptive of what the country looks like after the quilting happens, I was able to see the steamy jungle like swamp next to the towering New York apartments. I had a great time with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life will never be the same again...","review":"The whole world goes back to a wilder time when dinosaurs appear on earth. While the President tries to figure out how the fix an unfixable problem, people throughout the world are forced to cope with some perplexing and unexplainable...guests.James F. David skillfully introduces the reader to several scenarios where people are faced with finding ways to survive often in their own backyards, while a plethora of animals from another time move in.\\"Footprints of Thunder\\" will entertain you as well as challenge your assumptions about the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost World, It Isn't","review":"At 500+ pages, Footprints Of Thunder is not for those lookingfor a quick 'dino on the rampage' read. As the past is thrown intothe future and vice versa, this book follows the aftershocks of several groups of people dealing with dinosaurs grazing outside their windows (and sometimes reaching in to graze on them). While starting off promisingly enough, FOT loses its way about 200 pages in, and wanders aimlessly from subplot to suplot, while truly developing none of them. This is dissapointing, as the premise is truly original. Characters intended to be heroes are written in a way that makes the reader unsympathetic to their plight, while those most interesting are lost early on. While revolving plot lines are enough to keep ones interest through the bulk, a stunningly unsatisfying ending makes it all a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted this to be good..","review":"...but it simply wasn't. Not only did the author choose one of the least swallowable plots I've come across in the past many years, but he tried to present it in about 1/2 the number of pages it would have needed to be meaningful. Too many characters, too many shifts in perspective, too many sub-plots, and very little satisfyingly wrapped up. There were a few bright points - Granny and her pet dinosaur were cute and diverting, for instance, and some of the other characters were amusingly drawn - but these are not enough for me to recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atypical dinosaur adventure","review":"David's book is a better than average first novel that shouldplease most readers. Better than Lost World, and as good asJurassic Park, David's book brings dinosaurs to the present in a creative way. His fictional interpretation of real physical events is clever, although it takes a stretch of the imagination, but after all, that's why we read this stuff. The beginning catches your attention, but it's better to read the middle in large chunks becuase the action jumps around. The characters work, with the bad guys bad, the good guys good, and the lovable lovable. The ending isn't your usual Hollywood ending and may not satisfy the tv generation, but it leaves you guessing until the last page. The world painted by the last scene leaves a lasting image that is intriquing and even haunting. Overall a good read that will leave you hoping for a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Enough Teeth But Pretty Entertaining Nonetheless","review":"Dinosaurs are great literary tools when used to rouse wonder, speculation or even terror. But as this novel showed, if a solid plot is not present or if the narrator tries to appeal to every possible reader, dinosaurs alone cannot carry a story. Don't misunderstand: the storyteller here entertained and made me think. It's simply unfortunate that the novel, with all of its worthy parts, could not congeal into something transcending those individual pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thunders of Boredom","review":"I hate to do this, because I know the effort that takes to write a book, but this book was BAD.

Unfortunately this one really just lacked any \\"wow\\" power.The plot really seemed a little weak, but even worse, was what I felt poor character development. There were quiet a few characters to follow and I never really empathized with any of them even when they were devoured or maimed.It wasn't the book I was hoping for and was by no means a Jurassic Park (not the greatest book but better than this).

This is not Jennifer Jason Leigh's best movie. In fact I would bet that she would rather forget this film shot twenty years ago, as would most who worked on it. The best thing about it is its name. Oh, but there are no martial arts in the movie. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Reluctant Dragon","review":"Having seen this feature in the movies when I was a child, I always remembered the delightful dragon and his fear of violence, and the fierce loyalty of the boy. Not only is the story theme a bit novel, and also a bit silly, about the dragon being forced to fight when he did not want to, it is resolved so delightfully that children will remember it well as I. I wish it would be available as children are always so curious about Dragons and this film has no real violence in it, except the \\"pretend\\" fight between the knight and the dragon. We need this happy film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reluctant Dragon is not the 1941 movie","review":"Like the most recent review I was mislead by the icon and other information.THIS IS NOT THE FULL LENGHT MOVIE with Robert Benchley as touted but a 20 odd minute cartoon which formed just a third Of the actual movie.Amazon should immediately move to clarify the issue and remove the misleading icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION","review":"Buyers BEWARE: I just purchased this film and it is NOT the full Robert Benchley version as pictured (which I believe is very deceiving).This is nothing more than the animated segment (AKA: Reluctant Dragon), not to be mistaken with the full movie version, The Reluctant Dragon (as pictured), which was a mix of both live-action and animation.The only reason I ever enjoyed The Reluctant Dragon so much was for Benchley's magically funny tour of the original Walt Disney Studios in California where he goes to plug the idea to get the cartoon made. Not only was the Disney tour a learning experience, but Benchley overcomes several hilarious obsticles on his way to pitch his ideas to Walt. The film was golden.Unfortunately, this video is NOT it. It is just the animated dragon short followed by another animated short about a moose.So, if the animated feature is all you want to see--this is perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful!","review":"This CD is a favorite of mine...

I did not care at all what happened to these vampires/ghouls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus","review":"Frankly, I normally like books that are part of a series, but this one just had way too many references to what may have been other books in a series about this vampire clan...and set ups for future books. Umpteen backstories that had nothing to do with the plot of this book. Rather than wanting to buy the other books, it just scared me off. And using the same jokes over and over...ghoulish...girlish. Enough! And then with all these backstories, there are references to things that happened to the main characters that are just jumped over. It will mention when something or other happened, but never described the actual thing happening. Dump the backstories and focus! Could have been a good story if the author had focused, but instead I found myself thinking that the book was just way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the book","review":"I don't think this was made to be a \\"stand alone\\" book, it was obviously part of a series. I read the first two books and really wanted to know what happened to Jane and Angela, I liked them. I know one of the reviewers complained that this was the first book in the series that she'd read and there were too many references to past events. I believe that is the same in any book series. If you don't start from the beginning you have a difficult time understanding the characters and their backgrounds. I personally dislike books in a series that go on and on explaining past events and taking up book space with that. I'd rather just get into the new book in the series and go on from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I read the first two books of this series, I loved the first book. The second was okay, and the third..I was just truely disappointed. Every book seemed the same..each vampire who has never fallen inlove with a mortal finds a women they simply cannot resist. The first one had an interesting story to it, and honestly the series should have just followed Kit and the women(can't remember her name}. I got maybe half way through the book, and have yet to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"First of all I want to say this book was just all over the place!

I would not recommened this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bosch Mini-sander belts","review":"This is a situation where you have yo buy a poorly designed product because there is no alternative. Don't get me wrong the sander itself is fast, great for removing old paint from tight places like shutters. But the seam on the belts almost always breaks before the grit even starts to wear out. I suspect the glue is affected by temperature as the plate gets very hot at higher speeds. Only at the lowest speeds does it seem to last. I wish I could buy a sanding sleeve and cut it down, but the Bosch belts are metric. Bosch should obviously redesign their seam , maybe in a zig-zag rather than plain diagonal, and absolutely change to a glue or tape that is unaffected by heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shara- Fantastic read!","review":"I purchased this book and started reading. The introduction set my standards pretty high on the story's quality. I was not dissapointed. In fact, the story was so fantastic I couldn't put it down until I finished the book. The book is full of sorrows and twists and turns that made it reserve its permanent place on my bookshelf. Its a great read and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fantastic, standout, outside the box kind of werewolf novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to read text","review":"This review refers to the actual text of the paperback book, not the content. I found the font so difficult to read that it hurt my eyes more than it was worth to get through, even though the story sounds interesting. Some people may say that it's not fair to leave a negative review of a book I haven't read, but this is a serious problem that will impair some people's enjoyment of it. I am in my 20's and have no vision problems - maybe it's just my copy, since no one else mentioned it, but the letters are so thin and wavering that it's just annoying to concentrate on. Sure, I can sit there and make out the words, but it ruins the experience of reading taking that much trouble.

Many books dealing with recurrent pregnancy loss are outdated. This book provides the latest scientific studies and theories relating to miscarriage.

Maybe the book turns around at the end, but thus far the science outweighs the hope and the sad case studies about women losing their babies feel relentless. Maybe I am wrong, but somehow I feel that if a woman wrote this book it would offer empathetic insights that a man is simply not capable of when it comes to this topic.If you have recently suffered a miscarriage and are still grieving, then this may not be the book that meets the most sensitive needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and flawed logic","review":"Clearly written by someone who has not read all the studies and has a grudge against \\"Beer Babies\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read.

I have no children (yet!).After reading reviews of this book, I thought that it would be worth a read. And it was. I had little or no hope that I'd ever carry a child to term. I wanted to move on to adoption, while my husband wants to continue trying to conceive, through in vitro fertilization.Well, this book has given me hope again. I learned that it's not just \\"a miracle\\" when a woman with repeat miscarriages has a healthy kid.It's a well-written and compassionately written book.

That said, he doesn't oversimplify what medical science knows and doesn't--this book is like having a very knowledgable doctor who's sifted through so many studies and can present all the alternatives and ask all the right, difficult questions. It's tempting after a miscarriage to try _anything_ to prevent the next one, given how powerless you feel; Cohen makes a convincing case about why some current methods might well not be worth pursuing at all and creates a clear picture about what we know and don't. This is a book, then, that made me feel stronger because I felt like I had knowledge of my own. His own experience as a husband whose wife experienced multiple losses is brought to bear here, and his wide range of interviews and ability to capture women's stories along with the \\"hard\\" science makes this an important book that I'm thankful is out there in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deal of the Century","review":"This movie is a classic and hard to find in stores.

This movie aged surprisingly well, a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"hey, it was funny back then and it's still funny now","review":"I have read the reviews of some others, and yeah, it was a relatively low budget movie. And this was during Chevy Chase' hayday of movies that had genius, but unrealized; much like modern problems. It's something about his quiet wit, like his Ty Cobb character in Caddyshack. Maybe I'm just being nostalgic. But didn't you laugh when he was demonstrating the machine gun with the bottle opener to the guerilla fighters? Wasn't it funny when he held up the mugger when he was being held up? Wasn't it funny when he got shot in the foot AGAIN?! Wasn't it funny when the Luck-up team was more concerned about the air-conditioner over the drone?!\\"What's a place like this doing around a girl like you?\\"\\"Do you mind, I just lost my husband\\"\\"Well, we have a few minutes, we could look for him.\\"\\"I like your flame job...I'm just gonna give it a little touch up!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie worth every penny","review":"i highly recommend this movie.

They may have the same \\"art work\\" (though that's not guaranteed), but they do NOT have the notes that accompanied the original Naxos releases - and nowhere does Amazon mention that (the Naxos website seems silent on the issue, too).

This album is a masterpiece and is what Children of Bodom wants to sound like but could never achieve.For those of you who don't know,this is melodic death metal. Not Trivium, not Shadows Fall, and nowadays not even In Flames.This cd reminds of Carcass's \\"Heartwork\\" but has an identity all it's own.

So much passion in the vocals and the rest of the band is unreal. Every time I play this album I hear something new, it just doesn't get old. This is a very technical band so it's recommended you listen to them with some good speakers or headphones. If you're looking for something new this will open up a whole new world for you. The melodies (especially from their early work) will blow you away. If you like Damage Done I would then move onto \\"The Gallery\\" and \\"Mind Eye\\" which are two classics.

After all, they were the creators of the Gothenberg style, along with close associates In Flames. Damage Done is a very good album. The bonus track, \\"I, Deception\\" is definitely the highlight. All of the songs are at least worthy of three stars, and averaged out, it's probably on the same playing field, if not a little better, than In Flames' newest offering. The major difference is that Dark Tranquillity has stuck to the melodic death metal formula, while In Flames has taken a more... I don't want to use the 'n-word' (nu-metal) because that denotes lack of talent and creativity... but not melodic death. Basically, lovers of the old Gothenberg metal scene should stick to Dark Tranquillity.

He is most successful in Partitas 1 and 4. But his overall playing is uneven, and the recording sound itself is uneven, too. His Sinfonia in Partia 2 is ugly. His Praeambulum in Partita 5 is too fast; Toccata in Partita 6 is too slow and ponderous. For modern interpretations of Bach Partitas on piano, those by Craig Sheppard and Sharon Mann are good. (Sharon Mann's playing sounds somehwat Gouldish, even though she was once a student of Rosalyn Tureck.) For partial Partitas, Arrau(1,2,3,5), Argerich(2), Tomsic(1) are very good.

Uttal is an Indian who has settled in the USA, someone who has studied classical Indian music, only to pervert the form and develop his own style. This is an album of Hindu devotional song presented as reggae, I suppose, with the instrumentation including Western, Indian, electric and acoustic instruments, a new synthesis for the end of the Twentieth Century. Three of the eleven tracks are in English, the others in Indian languages. One song includes a sample of a field recording of the Bauls, the minstrel Gypsies of India.

The writer spends a good part of the book in laying the groundwork for the story. A reader who is impatient might have difficulties getting int the story. When the book takes off, it becomes a real page turner and os a most satisfying read. The protagonists are very well developed, though this is not the case with many of the secondary and tertiary characters.

My spindle looks like it was thrown together - the disks do not align properly. A few disks had specs on the outer edges which decreased the burn quality significantly with my Benq1620, as check by the CD Speed tool in Nero. The rating dropped down to 85% after reading 96-97% throughout the disk. Most disks also develop shadows/dark patches, usually on the inner tracks, visible after burning the disks.

He's more than welcome to bury every copy of this CD under Mount Crumpit for all eternity. Still, Christmas is a time to count one's blessings, so count this one: \\"Christmas With The Brady Bunch\\" is over in just under 21 minutes.

Marsha was the only one who could come close to carrying a tune at this point. To be fair to them, they worked hard and later became better singers. But at this point in their show biz careers, listening to them sing was unbearable. Greg's singing on \\"O Holy Night\\" is particularly painful.

Cicero was an impressive figure living in an interesting time and it is important and necessary to have a biography such as this one come out to allow readers not steeped in classical studies, particularly Cicero's own writings, a chance to escape to this distant time which often has a resonance in our own difficult period. The author does a good job of hitting all the hot spots and smoothing out some of the political complexities for the general reader while still providing a feel for ancient Rome as Republicanism writhed toward its end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for lawyers.","review":"Good book, but hard to get through all the trials that are detailed in this book.

Everitt's strength is in translating the Latin into simple, modern English. But 'Cicero' is no scholarly work, it's more an exposition on the man's life - little more than a book report. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worse biographies of all times","review":"I have been reading a number of \\"Bestseller\\" biographies (Lincoln, Washington etc). This version of Cicero by Everitt is one of the poorest written bios I read so far. The only good thing going is that it is thin (p325), but unfortunately I am having problems completing even this thin volume. I am now at page 160 and debating on whether I should continue or not.To be fair, the first 50 or so pages introduces the reader to ancient Rome. Being unfamiliar to that era, I was able to keep up engaged. However, I was expecting to learn about Cicero as a person but I am getting more of a \\"history of Rome\\" when Cicero was around. Boring...This book is only useful for those who want to recite some tid-bits of Cicero/Ceasar/Pompei etc; you might as well Google it. One lesson I learned from this book is that if you want to write a 'bestseller', get a publisher who will aggressively do marketing for you. This book is definitely overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay with","review":"Cicero was an extremely bright lawyer and great politician.

Cicero is displayed in all his greatness and timidity (especially his well-known fear of physical harm). It's remarkable how much Cicero wrote about his life and times. Besides completing his political and philosophical books, Cicero found - it seems - an enormous amount of time to write personal letters to friends. The majority of the facts around this time in Roman history is transmitted through Cicero.This history is highly recommended for the beginner and intermediate Roman history buff. Many of that time period's famous historical figures, incluing Caesar and Antony, are vividly brought to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"cicero","review":"Very impressed with the speed at which the item managed to get delivered to me here in the antipodes.

This is a brilliant introduction to the topic for people who know little of Ancient Rome, and a fun read for someone who has already read alot about the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Res Publica","review":"This charming and quite haunting biography of Cicero highlights one of the great moments of historical transition. As the last survivor of the Axial Age's political breakthrough to a first democracy in the Greek world, the Roman Republic, hardly a democracy, endured, and then endured some additional time, and then passed away in the ruin of empire and the oblivion of human freedom. Cicero's resistance and opposition is the most classic gesture of defiance, and this account of the great master of rhetoric going down with the ship is well done, on a subject forever topical, check the news. As the author notes the founders of the American, yes, republic, were steeped in Cicero, and seemed to have picked up where Cicero left off. Excellent tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great biography","review":"This is the third book written by Everitt I've read.

They are fine with no problems until, they find that they are without a skill, job, or anything to make a living in the demanding upcoming years of adulthood. But when an old friend of their mother's, Caleb, offers to bring them to the city of Krondor to find jobs their lives become much more than they expected. On their way they are attacked and Caleb is brutally injured. They're not only put up to the challenge of bringing Caleb back to safety without getting killed, but to find out what this secret organization Caleb works for is doing, and stopping an evil magician from taking the emperor's body and throwing the world into chaos. In this exciting adventure of magic, mystery and treacherous situations you'll find hours of suspense.

Jommy, Tad and Zane make for a nice new trio!Despite the limitations of the digital format, I am really enjoying these books! And this book also ends on a cliffhanger, making it nearly impossible to stop reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saga Continues","review":"I am a Feist fan, and as such this book is an automatic choice. It is not Feist's best work, but it is a worthwhile addition, and it does present some changes in that the conclave is the center of this book (and probably the series) and the magicians play a major role.The book is set mostly in Kesh, which is a pleasing surprise. The creation of Midkemia is by now so well developed I was so far a little disapointed at not having all major nations covered by the plot. The previous series covered the region of Roldem and this one takes us further away, with possible extensions to Kelewan in the next installment.It's certainly not a book I would recommend for new readers of Feist, but if you reached this far in the Midkemia series, it's a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"continuing story","review":"Holds up to the rest of the body of work for Feist.

His books tend to focus around the creation of young male characters and how they develop their talents to move the world in there own ways. Feist continues the adventures in the fantasy world of Midkemia with visits from some original characters and various other characters that have appeared in his other works. Pug makes another appearance as well as Nakor to continue Feist's exploration into the balance of good and evil.This book is just a plain fun fantasy book. If you have liked Feist's other works you will most probably like this one as well. I did find this one to be less worthy of praise than his others works. Magician was by the best of the books produced and the Serpentwar Saga was probably the best series, this just doesn't stand in the same league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flight of the Nighthawks","review":"Engrossing story that follows on from the Conclave of Shadows Triology and continues with the impending incursion of the Dasati on the world of Midkemia, and the return of the insidious Nighthawks in Kesh, as well as portray the evolution of all the favourite characters from the series.

He was the first fantasy author that captured my attention and imagination. However, since I have grown and begun to read new and better authors such as Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind I have found the works of Feist to be short, the characters under-developed and recycled, and overall disappointing. Maybe it's just that I prefer epic fantasy books which take more than a few hours to read and actually take the time to familiarize the reader with the characters and their struggles towards a resolution of the problem, but now I laugh at myself for being such a fan of Raymond Feist. If he is going to make his books less than 400 pages long he needs to come out with them more frequently. Why wait around for a year for a short and disappointing afternoon of reading? If you want to be entertained, I suggest you read the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan or the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"embodies the potential to escort you in your journey","review":"I bought this CD after having read the book of same title.

He takes a deep look at a phenomenon that incorporates so much disinformation from the 'spin-doctors' in order to send us on wild goose chases and make a mockery of anyone who attempts to get close to the truth. The book is well researched and documented. The author's style is not dogmatic and presents a style of questioning that allows the reader to consider the possibilities. Having done much research personally into this field, I believe Paul Christopher has come closer to the truth than any other book on the market so far to date.

Sharon Stone snarls. \\"I'll let you know.\\" I died laughing.Looking at all the four and five star reviews, I have concluded I must have been watching a different movie. I have just watched it again......it's a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"In one word... Stupid!","review":"This has to be THE WORST western movie ever. I do believe the actors that appeared in this movie did it just to have the chance to work together, because honestly I can't find a logical reason why someone like Gene Hackman would actually appear in such a ridiculous flick. Follow my advice on this one DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I remember why this film isn't remembered.","review":"I went to movies once this film came out so many years ago. I've use to chase Gene Hackman's films, on that moment nor Crowe even less Dicaprio were reconognized actors. Once I saw the Blu Ray's movie version I thought \\"What an awesome casting for this movie!\\", so I get it. I am still thinking it is a some great performances on the movie, but I think it has a really bad director. I have to say that this movie's director could not took advantage of a great casting. What a pitty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than your Average Western","review":"I've seen this movie twice and I only watched it a second time because I wanted to be extra fair in forming an opinion about it. The story is pretty simple: Bloodsport with revolvers. The actors are mostly there to pick up their paychecks (except for Russell, he does a decent job but that is far from enough to save the movie), and the screenwriter is 4. In a previous review someone mentioned that Hackman gave a good performance...that is not true as far as I can tell. He is in his default \\"yelling old dude\\" mode and it isn't all that interesting. He didn't want to do Westerns anymore...even to the point that when Eastwood approached him with Unforgiven he refused...multiple times. His lack of enthusiasm shows. If you're feeling the need for some good Western action then check out Unforgiven, High Noon, Stagecoach, The Searchers, The Wild Bunch, Shane, High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, or any number of other quality Westerns. Put this one low on your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cropped","review":"WARNING: This is a shortened/censored version of the film (at least compared to the one we have seen in Europe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome special effects, plus Leo dies!","review":"Right off the bat you have two reasons to watch this. Leo DiCaprio DIES, YES! And the special effects are awesome. Not your typical western by any means, but the story is very entertaining. The cast is full of all stars. And Sharon Stone is hot as hell as always. This is perfect for the casual fan of westerns because it is a modern day action flick just set in that time period.

A thoughtless, gratuitously violent movie that unsuccessfully recycles Hackman's great turn in Unforgiven and leaves DiCaprio's undeniable charm and brightness flapping in the void of Sharon Stone's vapid presence. Fans of this film: raise your standards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I watch this movie and it was terrible. Leonardo character was always trying to please his dad.

I love a good western and I love Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman and Russell Crowe. But as I sat through this video I kept hoping I'd see something good. There was some good action at times, but I was still left hangin' because this movie could have been better. The background of Stone's character was ugly enough to make her hard, cold attitude understandable. But everything else was weak. Maybe with a different director or writer it would have been better.

Sure, the plot is thin, sure its ripped straight from westerns that came before it. Sam wanted to entertain and that he does. He uses all his usual stylings: cameral angles, over-the-top characters, and unusual special effects; nothing is held back here. Sharon Stone is an amazingly strong female lead: my hats off to her for such a wonderful performance. My favorite though in all these was Lance Henricksen who plays Ace: the man-in-black, mysterious drifter who comes to town for the shootout. Even though Im not a Leonardo fan, he does a really neat job as they young smart alec shootist. Its just a good time and worth watching more than once. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the West","review":"I have watch this movie at less 10 times. The actors are very good and Stone is at her best.

However, if you hope to find good drama, better-than-formulaic acting, and quiky surprises, forget this. In my view, there is nothing to this whatsoever that makes it any better than a waste of time. And not a good waste of time at that.Not recommended. It is nothing but stereotypes, indifferenct acting, and utterly predicatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry,","review":"but this was one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.

Come on, wouldn't there be blood? Seeing a bullet hole through a man's head? Still corny because you have no blood, no brains, and th guys stands there for a while. But someone gets shot in the eye and they do flips? Dicrapio *****, Stone is a wanna-be Clint \\"the man\\" Eastwood, and Hackman is unbelivable.

One of my many orders from Amazon. Good price..Good condition as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for what it is","review":"If you take this as a serious western, you'll be disappointed. But if you approach it as a nicely crafted, almost satirical hommage to the spaghetti westerns ( especially \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\"; if you are not familiar with this film, you won't get a lot of the references),this is a lot of fun to watch. Of course the story is predictable and vacuous; but Hackman is great (the man is incapable of bad acting), diCaprio is adequate, and Crowe turns in a nice, understated performance. The only miscast is Stone, who acts as if she doesn't know what the heck she is doing in this movie. The music is good, the camera work very nicely done, and the shootouts well-staged. This isn't great movie-making, but I think Sergio Leone would consider this film a compliment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video and Audio Quality. Great Movie.","review":"If you are going to review a Blu-Ray movie, please describe the audio/video quality.I really like this movie, and am entertained every time I watch it. This is the first time I have seen it on Blu-Ray.At first I was disappointed, because the first scenes had grain, and I thought \\"here's another Blu-Ray movie with bad video quality\\". But then it got better - a lot better. Most of the movie had excellent video quality, with great detail. But, there were a couple of scenes that had grain. I don't know if it was a different camera, or what.

It is actually a collection of things he wrote in the early eighties. The most important section is pages 47-72, where he lays out the key insights of people in Re-evaluation Counseling.Never has someone written so well about liberation and oppression. While there has been much written in Re-evaluation Counseling in the last twenty years, these twenty-five pages still get to the heart of what we need to hear each day.I refer to this book more than any other on my shelf, not because it has unique wisdom. But because it reminds me of what I think. Societies tend to pull us away from ourselves. Jackins maps the way back.

I was expecting some fantastic insight and in reality, the Art is, like most brilliant strategies, very simple and basic steps to follow. The trick is to not overlook the basics and keeping the discipline to always follow them.The book itself was set up into a very long and rambling prologue, then quotes from Sun Tzu followed by quotes from other Chinese leaders and/or philosophers. There is no discussion about the meaning or intent of Sun Tzu beyond the quotes from the supporting cast. In short, the book is written with quotes supported by other quotes without any context. If you read books to get the full story and context behind a subject, go elsewhere. If you are content with sound bytes and 10 second clips, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a good read with many proverbs and sayings that are still applicable to modern times.

The content of his original work pertains to military strategy, yet in this copy I feel like a 3 year old when I read it. You would think a book called The Art of War, read by military and business leaders from around the world, would look more impressive. It is a small book with glossy pages, nothing authentic. Each page has about one sentence, like reading a children's book, with simple commentary below to help nudge you along. I am unimpressed with this and have returned it, opting instead for this book --> 1934255122 (copy/paste in Amazon search bar) which is separated into original Chinese text, English translation, and English translation with commentary.

Mr. R��bsam continually disrupts the natural flow of the music with overly \\"romanticized\\" hesitations, at times purposely causing the counterpoint to sound out of sync, and substituting his own rhythms which undermine the architectural unity of the music. The stuff he does with trills at times just sounds wierd. Bach infused all his music with an air of sacred contemplation (even his secular works like the inventions), so it's often easy to tell wether a performer is trying to communicate Bach's intentions or their own. R��bsam sounds as though he simply doesn't get it. At least he has good technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me dizzy","review":"Now don't get me wrong, I am not against rubato in Baroque music and am not a purist who wants the Inventions played in a \\"correct\\", textbook fashion, but Rubsam really murders these pieces. Ok, use some rubato in the slower ones, but in #8? This is the liveliest of the set and to hear rubato and beats stretched out in every measure makes me seasick. It's not just in #8, but all of them! Rubsam has a nice sound, but also a terrible rubato habit that becomes so predictable that it's a farce. Also, #15 is so slow it's ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offbeat Performance","review":"If you enjoy Bach served up like something from a 20th Century French impressionist, then you might like this.I tried to keep an open mind, but couldn't stomach the wild variations in tempo, the liberties from steady rhythm, the ad lib flourishes. I am all for bringing out the lyricism in baroque music, but this goes too far.The slower pieces were too sweet and syrupy; those in minor key were overly melodramatic. Ultimately the impression is of a performer trying to transform the music into something far beyond what was written. So instead of harmony and counterpoint, we get sturm and schmaltz.While listening to the #8 invention in F major, that warhorse imposed on generations of piano students, I thought I could hear the moaning and displeasure of my piano teacher in the background, pleading, \\"Stick to the music!\\" But unfortunately, these performances don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien performances of Bach study pieces.","review":"Even for a budget label, this recording just does not cut it. Wolfgang Rubsam's interpretations of the Two-Part and Three-Part Inventions are very slow and very--surprisingly--rubato for a set of Baroque compositions. The joy goes out of Invention no. 8, the fun goes out of no. 13, and the trills are strangely performed like crescendos in no. 4. Even though this is one of the few albums that has both versions of the Two-Part Invention no. 1, which makes the number of pieces played thirty-one, Bach's Inventions when played should not require more sixty-six minutes of playing time. The slow interpretations plus the horrible ten- to fifteen-second pauses in between each track make this CD something one can do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying","review":"This CD is perhaps the most appalling one I've purchased. By no means should you consider buying this. I bought it because it was the first cheap and complete set of two-part inventions I found. Go for Glenn Gould and you won't go wrong, trust me.The only fathomable way Rubsam could have some dignity in recording such an atrocious set is if he was sight-reading these pieces. That is what it sounds like. Specifically, he plays No. 13 (A Minor) about one minute too slow, and in a one-minute piece . . .To say it is a Romantic interpretation would be a disgrace to the Romantic Period, but. Rubsam uses rubato EXCESSIVELY. As in, every measure. Totally unacceptable.

A wonderful, and funny, and touching book about love within a family.

Forget this movie and get something else that will really entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"dry Ice is more like it","review":"John Cusack seemed like he would have a thriving acting career. in truth his name should be mentioned with Edward Norton&Robert Downey Jr in terms of pulling off certain type of roles&making them work,but this Film is a clunker. John Cusack in this role feels like he got a Left-Over ROle intended for John Travolta which He wouldn't have any parts of&rightfully so. something about Cusack in this role makes me think of one of Travolta's 90's action type films.Billy Bob Thornton is just kinda there in this film. this film never clicks at all.very dry&bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICE BURG VICTIM OF GLOBAL WARMING:-(","review":"THIS FILM HAD POTENTIAL TO DELIVER BUT IT IS NOT WORTH BUYING. RENT OR BUY FOR MY TWO .02 CENTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cinematheque of Babylon","review":"Watching this movie and wondering why it was made and for whom. I cannot escape the thought that perhaps since all the plots have been exhausted and all the movies were made, all that Hollywood has to offer is this. For a while, I was watching thinking that perhaps at some point it will add up to something, but in the end there's nothing, just the waste of brain cells so graphically depicted in what is perhaps the only 'memorable' scene. I may be exagerating a bit, I just remembered there were also a couple of vomit scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely entertaining with good special features","review":"Gruesomely funny film noir is not my favorite genre (though I enjoy Jim Thompson, to whose novels this story owes a lot); but I am a John Cusack fan, which prompted me to see this. Pleasantly surprised, I not only watched the whole film with full attention and the occasional laugh-out-loud, but also watched both alternative endings and all the other special features. Director Harold Ramis has some interesting things to say about independent films and directing in general. As Billy Bob Thornton says in one of the special features, this film isn't about to change anyone's life; it's about entertainment. And it accomplishes that objective with plenty of existential anti-holiday angst to spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very dark humor","review":"In Wichita Kansas, John Cusack is a lawyer and Billy Bob Thornton a strip club owner who both work for a criminal played by Randy Quaid. Cusack figures out a way for them to steal 2 million dollars from Quaid. It's Christmas eve and they are about to get away with their money until Quaid's muscle shows up looking for them. Cusack is panicking a little, but Thornton assures him everything is all right which of course it isn't. Cusack eventually meets up with Thornton to take care of everything and that's when the twists and turns begin. There are also some funny scenes with Oliver Platt as a drunken, depressed friend of Cusack's and Connie Neilsen plays a woman Cusack would like to be with.You can see some of the movie's twists coming a mile away but the very dark humor and great performances keep you hooked to the Ice Harvest. This is a beautiful looking movie, very nicely shot and directed. Cusack adds his usual depth to his character and Thornton always plays a slick lowlife well."},{"rating":"1","title":"How BB Thornton stole Xmas Again..","review":"For the 2nd time in as many years scrooge Billy Bob Thornton spoils a Christmas movie. This one is thoroughy unoriginal and pointless, about 2 mobsters who rip off their boss on Christmas Eve, and spend the night playing cat and mouse with the boss (Randy Quaid) and his hitman. All the humor is about sex, drunkenness, and violence, mostly dark. John Cusack and Oliver Platt carry the movie for a while, Platt playing a drunk entertainingly, but it's all been done before. If you want something more meaningful for Christmas than topless dancers and trite violence, check out \\"The Kid and I\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY CRAP HOW DID I MISS THIS?","review":"I saw this mentioned somewhere - Kindle Boards or Good Reads? Anyway, I rented the DVD (based on people saying the book was just as good as the movie)and am now buying the movie also and the book (to see if it really is as good.) I loved the fast paced action, the humor, what great humor. A great dark Christmas flick. I don't buy many movies. So that I'm actually adding it to my limited collection says something. Also Cusack and Thorton played brilliantly off each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enjoyable... at all","review":"First off if you like watching John Cusack be charming and funny and basically what his roles usually consist of, you won't like him in this movie. I found his performance hard to watch. Billy bob Thorton was the funniest person in this movie. But not in his typical way, he wasn't the drunk dirty SOB that he usually is, John Cusack was the DRUNK and unfunny guy. There's a lot of drinking and driving which I found was overkill and not really looked at in a laughing manner. The first 45 minutes of this movie were really really hard to watch. It's slow, and boring. The last 10 minutes were the most thrilling part of the movie and that's not what you want to see when watching a movie you want a build up, climax, and conclusion. This movie had a good concept of robbery and moral struggles but it fell flat on its face."},{"rating":"1","title":"no lighting budget","review":"OK, I get the movie is a bit of a film noir meets Simple Plan but what was up with the majority of scenes being so dark.

He and Billy Bob Thornton are great together! They could have done a better job of casting the female lead in this one though...she was definitely not up to par with Cusack and Thornton. Still I thoroughly enjoyed it. I prefer Cusack in his later years and performances, although when he held the radio up for his love to hear in Say Anything; I was ready to run to him myself! He's a real talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mislabeled as a comedy","review":"I guess because Richard Russo cowrote the screenplay, someone figured this should be labeled a comedy. There are no laughs. It's a dark Christmas movie with a Mob theme, several murders and a $2 million heist that goes awry. I enjoyed the atmosphere, but some won't. The dialogue is high quality. The alternate endings don't work, though, unless you want this to end even more darkly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grosse Pointe Blank'ish...Not","review":"I am a huge fan of both Cusack and Billy Bob, however Analyze this and that writer/director Ramis had a pretty shallow script to work with. The movie is entertaining, so it is rentable, but if I were to have seen it at the theaters, I would of come out dissapointed. Cusack and Thorntan play pretty much their regular characters in their movies, Cusack, charming, warm and whitty, whereas Thorntan pretty out there and a little more ecentric. There is a twist at the end, I really didn't see it coming, because it really did not make any real sense. There were no clues that the character involved in the twist had any real relationship until a kind of flashback sequence at the end. I would recommend renting, but I'm not going to buy which is saying a lot because I have a pretty extensive DVD library and again big fans of both lead actors. Their chemistry was much better in Pushing Tin and Cusack tried to pull off a Grosse Pointe Blank (great movie), which didn't work here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cusack Catching Up with Cage","review":"I can't say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen because hollywood churns those kinds out by the day.

However, somebody designed this dvd to GIVE AWAY MOST OF THE SURPRISES AND PLOT TWISTS by showing a 30 second abridgement of the film- including the ending!- before giving the viewer a chance to press PLAY! How STUPID is that?Even if the movie were better and didn't rob it's viewers of any possible element of suspense of surprise, I'd still have to recommend you to the source novel by Scott Phillips. ICE HARVEST is a great read, and excellent period piece that is thrillingly nasty, horrifically violent and dangerously funny if you're bent that way.

The key they say is to healthy eating and exercise as well as spiritual health. We all know that. Here they address some ways in how you can restrict calories yet feel satisfied and eat foods that will make you healthier. The recipes in general are great but I have found a few that I will not do again. The most important thing is that you can take the concepts from the book and apply it. You don't need to follow their plan exactly. There is even room for 1-3 \\"sweets\\" a week. To find better health one needs to look at diet, activity level, and mental health.

Indeed, his intolerance of other ideas is much more akin to the totalitarian basis of Fascism than is the exaltation of freedom of the individual and the diminution of the Government (the antithesis of Fascism) that is espoused in Mrs. Sommers work.Mrs. Sommers does an excellent job of debunking the myths about the need to feminize young men. She clearly points out the negative consequences of feminists attempts to emasculate young men and helps us to understand their real needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War is being lost","review":"I read this book having two boys and two girls.

This book is dealing with an important topic but in a very conservative fashion.

If you have any progressive ideas at all and like writers like Theodore Sizer (Horace's Compromise), Alfie Kohn (The Schools Our Children Deserve) or God forbid, Rousseau!, be aware that she is not only blasting feminists in her book but progressive thinkers throughout history. She even goes so far as to blame my old friend John Tinker (Tinker vs. Des Moines School District) for \\"the beginning of the end of effective school discipline.\\"If you want a better understanding of boys growing up today, I would stick with William Pollack's \\"Real Boys\\" or Kindlon & Thompson's \\"Raising Cain\\".

Consequently, she has written the sort of book that will not be understood, much less be acceptable, for at least another fifty years. These days, too many \\"authorities\\" devoted to the romantic, counterintuitive dogmas which flourish within the educational establishment either will ignore her or unite, as dunces, in confederacy against her. In actuality, she is like one of those prisoners released from Plato's Cave who have seen the truths outside and returned to their darkened former abode to set others free. As a disturber of complacency, she can hardly expect a friendlier welcome than such types normally receive. In actuality, though, she deserves the highest praise for being so gloriously free of our age's cant and selective indignation in educational matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what I call Speaking Truth to Power","review":"Sommers will get nothing but trouble from the dominant media culture for daring to expose the war against boys (and against truth, facts, and reason) certain hyperfeminists waged throughout the nineties.

This book is for every man and boy who has felt pigeon-holed and maligned by over-aggressive feminists who claim that they want equality when they really want to give women the advantage. This book may seem biased to those who support the so-called \\"equality for women\\" movements, but as someone who has little bias, I can say that this is definitely good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"After just graduating with a degree in elementary education, I was surprised how much of how I was told to teach is actually the result of this \\"misguided feminism.\\" (To be honest, the book made me feel a little validated--I thought the teaching techniques all sounded a bit hokey!) Sommers makes legitimate points with good supports. I found it well paced and very involving. The only thing I wish she would have done differently is to give us perhaps an ending chapter with specific things that we can do to actively make things more equal for boys. Books like these certainly encourage me to be more aware of the spin the media and special interest groups put on the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamental Problem","review":"Christina Hoff Sommers identifies the fundamental problem that boys in America face today. While there is a vocal, well funded lobbying group for girls, there is no organization that is willing to speak out for boys. Ms. Sommers concentrates on education, however her book would have been enhanced if she had also focused on what is happening in the nonprofit, public service community. For example the United Way of Massachusetts Bay in Boston provides $11 million to 33 organizations to support programs specifically for girls. The only funding they provided to organizations dedicated to helping boys is $230,000 to the Big Brothers. This funding disparity is perhaps the reason that Boston boys are doing worse than girls in every area from education to life expectancy.While an analysis of this problem is missing from her current book, perhaps she will address this situation in a future work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly enough, I enjoyed this book","review":"If you knew me at all, you'd be shocked to discover that this book is on my shelf. I am not the type to read Christina Hoff Sommers. Now, I have been known to buy up copies of \\"Babywise\\" and \\"The Nurture Assumption\\" (different authors) just to keep other parents from accidentally stumbling across what I deem to be harmful nonsense, but I bought this book because I actually agreed with it.That's not to say that everything in this book is good or accurate, but a lot of what Sommers said in this book made sense, even while other parts of it made me cringe. The fact is, women are NOT fragile, gentle creatures and feminism is about equality, not superiority. While Sommers is not always accurate in her research, the basic sentiment of this book, as I read it, was that one need not crush boys to empower women.I happen to agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"I found this book used.I was raised with feminists beliefs.I was raised to believe all of societies problems came from men.I was convinced everything male was wrong or dirty.This book was my first step to correcting these belifs.Christina's work tells a truth.

While critics have claimed that some of her (plentiful) statistics are incorrect, I've yet to come across a documented discrepancy. According to the book, our sons are currently paying dearly for the sins of their ancestors, and Ms. Sommers again presents her case clearly, concisely and convincingly. But the real reason I'm recommending this book is because of my five-year-old son. Having watched several commercials for various games, he asked me \\"If a boy and a girl are playing a game, does the girl always win?\\" The issue at hand is no longer avoidable, and anyone who either has a son or knows someone who does ought to read this compelling book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched using half-truths and misleading data","review":"As a proud, married American male, I find this female author's book insulting to men (and women). The mere thought that we can blame issues such as child abandonment (by Fathers) on feminism is stupid. Women through the centuries who have had the nerve to stand up for their equal rights are not to blame ...We as REAL MEN need to face up to OUR shortcomings and fix them. Being a strong man & having a strong woman as your lifepartner (or friend, or sister, or mother) is a sign of your comfort with your masculinity --not a weakness. The kind of thinking that went into this book gives wifebeaters and the like the weapon they need to further insult & hold down our sisters, wives and daughters.

The problem is that she overlooks the basic components of feminism: the quest for equality. Sure, more women go to college and do their homework... why are women getting lower standardized test scores? Her arguments jump from point A to C without concidering point B as a factor.And feminism does acknowledge the problems that are facing the boys in this country. The culture of violence and machoism is one of the things that causes men to die (on average) younger than women. That is something that true feminists address. Fix the violence and sexism and we'll all be smarter and live longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is garbage","review":"For anyone that cares about achieving true gender equality, read this book only to learn more about what you're up against.

But the plot stumbles after the boat crashes into the dock. The story veers into contrived and, by the end, absurd plot developments (the final scene inexplicably has James Earl Jones walking on water). I think the makers of this movie tried too hard to jam too many liberal dogmas about race relations into one movie. James Earl Jones walked on water, I suppose, because black people are Jesus-like saviors of white people. Curiously, Jones is a light-skinned black, but the part seemed to call for a dark-skinned black -- the flashback scenes draw viewers' attention to this discrepancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Very Professional","review":"This CD is probably my very favorite right now.

I found the whole insight into the SCA culture quite fascinating. But I found the best part of this book to be the following of one SCA member from his beginning in the SCA, to him becoming a well rounded person. It was a very interesting, very human story. Being from Australia the SCA movement is no where near as big here, so it was nice to see how the yanks do it.In the last few chapters the author covers some groups from England.

I don't know what is, but this book doesn't really do what the title says. I have some other H.Davidson books and they are not that helpful. There seems to be a bag of tricks you can try when repairing things. i.e. ESR meter, flowcharts, curve tracer, overheating chip, call the manufacture, etc. But when those don't work I think you have to study how the circuit works and understand what is happening and what happens when certain parts fail.

The author is from England so you might want to consult other books to see if a particular rose will grow well in your region. However, the advice this author gives is highly worthwhile. He covers over 200 roses (arranged as \\"Bush\\" roses and \\"Climbing\\" roses) and devotes 2 lengthy paragraphs to each one. The descriptions are poetic and the author also suggests ways of using the rose in the garden (color schemes, etc.) Lists are included at the back of the book which notes roses by categories (colors, good foliage, shade, small gardens, scent, informal gardens, structures). Hardiness zone maps cover both the U.S. and Europe.

One could enjoy this movie for his direction alone. The sharp edits and distortions against his fluid camera style enspire new depths of fear in this film. Needless to say, character depth (aside from the crazed mind of the main character) is not his movies strong point. But you're sure to enjoy the surprises and twists as you watch the clever inspector try and figure out who is behind the murder spree. Some may find it a little light on gore (especially if you're a Fulci fanatic ;), but Bava doesn't disapoint in this twisted story where a psychotic's only relief comes from hacking up virginal brides (et al.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide coverage, good reference application","review":"I too saw many editing errors, but these did not bother me. I've always kept a reference application working using different technologies. This book gave my existing reference application a real boost. I was able to easily integrate many more technologies using the combination of the JavaEdge application as well as the patterns discussed in the book. I thought the authors did a pretty darn good job discussing the patterns/antipatterns. Once I completed the read, I had a good enough overview of each of the technologies to do more in-depth study of each. The approach the authors took by bringing in all these technologies, which I feel work well together is a usefull 'pattern' for books these days; I encourage more like this. Had some challenges with getting the JavaEdge application to deploy/work, but was not too tough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I returned this book.

However, I was sorely disappointed in the disproportion of the areas of bed and breakfasts referenced. The book is almost 400 pages long; nearly 300 of these pages are for England, but only 20 pages are for Scotland and another 20 are for Wales. In total there are only 60 B&Bs listed for Scotland; many regions aren't represented at all, and the major cities have only a few listed (Glasgow, the largest city in the country, only has one listing!). I'm highly disappointed that a broader sample of B&Bs couldn't be listed, and will not be taking this book with me on vacation. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one was because of the large number of entries for England, which may be helpful to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious","review":"Gary's Grampa recently died.

The adventure book Trapped in a Death Cave by Bill Wallace is about two friends Gary and Brian, are trying to find Gary's Grandfather's killer. I think this is a good book because it keeps you on your toes the whole time. There were obvious clues throughout the book that were easy to notice for the reader but hard to find for the two boys. I liked the book because it makes you think about who the people you are with and the time you spend with them because in a blink of an eye they could be gone or could go against you. I also thought it was interesting that the main character goes against his best friend. I like the end of this book because it has a dramatic ending that will put you on the edge of your seat.

It is a great tool, and I'm headed out to the lumber yard today to buy some wood to build sutff with my hot new Bosch. My only gripe is that the kit comes with ten or so blades, but with no explanation about what material they are designed to cut. The manual's full instruction about how to choose speed, cut type, and blade amounts to, \\"you'll figure it out.\\" I sure would appreciate more \\"how to cut\\" advice, as I have so far been unable to get a square cut with curves on a treated pine 2 X 6.

I dont know how Bosch does it but there is something about this jig saw that makes it cut better than all the others. Throw in the quick change option and WHOA! it's unbelievable.

Opening the blade lock the 3 turns as the manual directed would not allow the blade/shaft to rotate at all.The trick was to open the lock 5 turns and then the blade/shaft rotated easily and then Click-locked as expected. After the first blade exchange, blades could be inserted and locked with only 3 turns. Now the quick release works first time-every time. I gave the Bosch 4 stars due to the flimsy locking lever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome- but could use a couple improvements","review":"Smooth, powerful, relatively quiet. Clic system takes some getting used to- but is plenty fast once you memorize the sequence and don't forget to set at max orbital setting. Also, it helps to pull down on the blade with your left hand as you turn the Clic switch/knob/lever (what do you call that thing?)with your right to mount the blade. It would be 5-stars perfect if it had detent settings at the blade angles- it takes a little trial and error to get it where you need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best jig saw I know of","review":"this is a smooth cutting saw. I do have to say the blade changing takes a little getting used to, I own a cabinet and countertop company so my saw is used most days. we have used it on sheet stainless steel,alluminium, wood and plastics as well as the laminate countertops it makes a straight cut through the material( no side to side wander of the blade) because of the blade support bearing in the rear of the blade. the only bad thing I have to say is the blade tensioning handle keeps coming off the saw when I am changing blades. That is why I only give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could only have one saw this would be it","review":"Very nicely designed and built tool the only thing that could be improved is the table accessory -- should be included in the kit.

I couldn't believe how smooth and accurate the Bosch cut. I was ready for the vibration to start and it never did! On my lunch hour I went and bought my own. This tool is a joy to use, and handles woods and metals with ease. I have had this saw for almost 4 years and she still cuts sweeeeet. The only gripe I found was the blade release, which is a little finiky and gets pulled off once in a while if I pull a little too hard. The saw cuts so good that you can overlook the release though.

I broke out the manual and follow the instructions to the letter and no luck and no \\"CLIC\\" either. Maybe I got a lemon, not sure. I thought the BOSCH would be a winner, but I have a bad taste in my mouth with this thing. I also have my own tool policy, if it doesn't work I get rid of it.

The blade changing system is very awkward. Every other jig saw made (even cheap ones) have much more convenient ways to get a blade in and out. This saw requires you to pull up on the black thing on top of the handle, turn it three times CCW, insert the blade sideways, rotate the blade straight, turn handle three times CW until is snaps (it sounds like it's broken). Now even this might be tolerable, except that the black thing on the handle does not snap down good and spins around while you'r trying to use the saw. It also is prone to just breaking off (seen several). Go somewhere else for a saw. This one is not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong piece delivered to me","review":"I ordered 1587avsp but i got a 1587avs. Also, the blades were everywhere in the box.After looking through all reviews here, i am pretty sure the tool is great.

What a Nice Power Tool!","review":"I absolutely love this jigsaw, so much that I actually try to come up with projects requiring its use. Plenty of power, rock solid cutting, easy-enough blade changes, and with the Progressor blades, amazing cutting speed with great smoothness. I was, like many people moving up to this kind of tool, replacing a older Ryobi-Craftsman -- one that I thought was pretty decent -- but there's just no comparison. The Craftsman got sold at a yard sale for $4. The newer Bosch 1590 model has gotten some wishy-washy reviews, so I went with the proven performer and I don't regret it a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me, a novice, look like a pro!","review":"This is an absolutely fantastic saw. I purchased it to replace a not-so-old Skil that repeatedly chewed up trim I'm installing. The Bosch saw, by stark contrast, cuts smoothly and solidly. No shaking or vibration, even with the thickest and most intricate cutting. I feel in control of the Bosch; there's no question that the Skil model controlled me. Now I need to replace all the trim I installed using the Skil - there's that much of a difference.Like other reviewers I was a little surprised at how (1) easy it is to change the blade and (2) how tight the blade locking process is. You can't miss the click...so keep cranking 'til you get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't own one, you're missing alot!","review":"I have a small cabinet shop and recentely purchased this saw to replace a Sears. This is one sweet saw. It's quit, and flat out cuts...in a straight line. Blades are easy to change. It just plain feels good in your hands.I'd recomend it to anyone, and you can't beat Amazon's pricing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy any other jigsaw!!!","review":"I bought this saw after trying two others and I have to say I am impressed. The blade change although tricky, holds the blade perfectly and the saw has very little vibration. It is the perfect weight, and best of all I can make a straight line free hand because it cuts so well, and doesn't pull to one side or bind in the material. The progressive blades are excellent and there is a pamphlet that tells you the proper application for use. It cut through 3/4\\" plywood like butter and through a sheet of Lexan plastic without any difficulties. This saw is a pleasure to use!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why purchase the Bosch?","review":"This is my second Bosch Jig Saw. I purchased the first in Hawaii to finish the boat I was building. Only reason to replace that one is I am giving it to my son. Even better then the quality is that currently it is priced at $6.00 over my cost in 1989. This is a life time tool. Use it and you will never pick up any other brand of saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"No tone or bass controls","review":"This is at best an inconvenient system to use and at worst it is unmanagable. I should have investigated this system more closely prior to purchase, but for the price I assumed it would have bass and treble controls. It has none and the bass is often times overwhelming. The display is inadequate and to see \\"normal\\" info (track, time, etc) displayed you need to have your TV on.It also has major input/output deficiences. For example the only other audio output is the headphone jack which silences the rest of the system.This is my first Samsung product and I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO HDMI INPUT","review":"I bought this system from amazon because the product description said it had an HDMI Input and Output connection.There is No HDMI input!

They give a smooth cut with little or no tear-out, but they do deflect a little. I would definitely recommend them though, as the cut is really clean. I can't figure out why amazon raised their price to above what the retail big-box stores carry these for, makes no sense to me. Amazon's price went to double what I paid just 6 months ago at amazon, yet the Marketplace sellers still have it at half the price. The India-based customer service reps were of no help when I asked about the price change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean cut","review":"Blades work great.

On balance, this book probably does as much harm as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Super Advice","review":"The advice provided is outdated and demonstrates that the authors do not have a clear understanding of canine behavior. This book suggests, among other things, using \\"glycerine suppositories\\" to teach puppies how to \\"hurry up\\" and go potty. And encourages using isolation as a form of punishment. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great puppy starter book","review":"Good book for starting out, gives you all the ins and outs of choosing the right puppy for you and what is expected of you as a pet owner.

No rumbling bass at all, like some buyers heard. The only rumbling I heard was from the kettle drums at the beginning of Rhapsody in Blue and they were supposed to be there. Rhapsody is wonderfuly performed, with some inventive tempos taken by Maestro Bernstein on the piano. American in Paris is sublime, as usual. And Grand Canyon Suite is wonderful as always.

It would have been a real shame to have been discouraged or influenced by some of the negative comments. Ms. Prose's voice is unique, her stories well structured and interesting, her characters human. I don't want to spoil these stories for anyone who has yet to read them, so I won't go into the details of the plots. This is the second book by Ms. Prose I have read (Hunters and Gatherers was first) and I am pleased to have discovered her. Paris in the winter can be a gray place, but it is still Paris. Enough said. If you enjoy well crafted, serious fiction you will enjoy these stories (how is that for a loaded sentence?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sympathy or Empathy","review":"Unguided Tours of Hell is a winner. Prose's character exposition through the limited but insightful internal monologues is witty and poignant. She delivers the characters in less than ten pages and develops them in the remaining sixty. It was difficult at times for me to know whether the attraction to this book was its delectable prose or the reflection of some of my own character flaws. The sensitivity of the story's background heightens the tension built by their petty interactions. While most times I just wanted to sympathise with the characters, the truth is, I could actually empathize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"Half a step up from Danielle Steele, this soon-to-be mass market favorite (I'm sure) was an utter disappointment from the first several pages. Characters are as thin as rice paper, their conversations are trite, self-absorbed and adolescent. I expected much more of these two novellas, and the writing in them made me, on more than one occasion, want to fling the book across the room. I am aware of Ms. Prose's accolades and achievements, which makes this book that much more disappointing. Sort of a tragedy, really"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good, whatever David Lodge and co. say","review":"\\"Three pigs\\" in particular, with characters Leo and Nina, is really pretty bad. I don't know how Prose has established such a reputation, but I know I don't want to read any more. Her lack of conceptualizing a work at the beginning, of being unable to make fiction beyond the tiresome and hideously predictable musings of these characters, really attests to mediocrity, not brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In 'Guided Tours of Hell', Prose provokes disgust at Landau and annoyance with his unreal pettiness and insecurity, somewhat interesting on its own merit. She brings up much more compelling and disturbing concepts of sensationalism and exploitation of an event like the Holocaust, which, mixed with Landau's preoccupations, make for an interesting combination. The second story was a disappointment. Any interest lingering from 'Guided Tours of Hell' disappeared once I started 'Three Pigs in Five Days'. Prose, throw us a bone! The idea of a man messing with his woman's mind is interesting for a few pages, but our heroine is too abjectly pathetic. A joyless and tiresome read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and immature and wholly uninteresting characters.","review":"The one star goes to the first novella which at least built toward something. The second novella is so bad and the characters are so thin, it's no wonder every thought that enters the female character's head is followed by an exclamation point! Characters address each other by first names all the time ( apet peeve of mine), as if they've got severe mental lapses and need to say the name over and over again. There's not a serious intimate thought in this book! And the way she butchered the setting! How anyone can make Paris boring is beyond me, but Kudos to Prose for doing such! Kudos!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"Having eclectic tastes in music, I often will pick up something about which I know nothing. This usually involves ethnic styles from the world community. After learning the \\"Csardas\\" was a Hungarian folk style, I found this item on Amazon.com and bought it on spec, so to speak. To my horror, I found the lead violin to be lackluster at best, and the accompanying orchestration to be chaotically cacophonous. After listening to this CD twice - very attentively, I did something that I had never done before. I threw it in the trash. Considering that I have purchased around 300 CDs, mostly from Amazon.com, over the past decade or so, I would consider that an adequate expression of my revulsion.

Don't believe any of it - this cd completely lacks ANY depth or richness expected of traditional gypsy music - most songs are fully overwhelmed by a single instrument of extremely annoying high-pitched screeching clearly produced by some solo egomaniacal musician not interested in texture but inducing suicidal tendencies in the listener, not unlike being subjected to a full hour of screaming cats in heat in the alley. Luckily you can just throw the cd in your garbage instead of having to hurl garbage at stray cats to shut the gawdawful noise up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old fashioned Hungarian Gypsy Music","review":"I just loved this CD, It just reminds me of when I was a girl on Saturday mornings anticipating the hungarian music programs on the radio. It brings tears of joy to my eyes and a warmth to my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Actually 4 tracks on this disc are not Hungarian, but Romanian music played by Hungarians, though it doesn't explicitly say so (I'm speaking of tracks 4, 5, 9 and 10).Firstly, the Skylark (\\"Ciocrlia\\") is a famous traditional song composed by Romanian Gypsy musician Anghelus Dinicu in 1889, based on a Romanian folk tune. The song was later made popular by his grandson, virtuoso violinist Grigoras Dinicu and by violinist/composer George Enescu.As for the 'doinas' and 'horas':The 'doina' is a type of slow Romanian folk lyrical melody, expressing feelings of yearning, sadness or love. The 'hora' is a Romanian folk dance music found in all parts of the country.The doinas and horas on this CD are definitely Romanian music, with some slow parts thrown in, consisting of a waltzy-restaurant-style music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a beautiful book...","review":"that contains both gorgeous images and excellent writing.

It was not refreshing but was very well written and I was in love with Portia from the beginning. She was such a lost soul, tricking herself out like that but when she met Jay her entire life changed for the better. I loved it and poor Simone! I never ever saw that coming, but that goes to show you that you never really know what a man will do to you. If you have not read this please do. I loved the aids statistics that was included and the fact that there was a moral to this urban story made it a little bit better than the rest.

UPS lost it, but Webjeweller promptly sent out another one. After I got it, it was running too fast. I took it to an authorized service repair center (near me) and they fixed it at no cost. This is the first year of this model (automatic wind) and I expected some problems. It will only get more expensive if you wait. The watch itself is simply beautiful, without being gawdy, and the 3 year warranty is excellent for this class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting....","review":"Fans of Katatonia's last three records may have some difficulty disgesting this, as there is no clear singing and an abundance of growling. Reminiscent of early Opeth, except slower, more melancholy and less technical. The lyrics are pretty cheesy, but who listens to death metal for the lyrics anyway?

Samhain(pronounced Sow-en) is Celtic for Summers end, which Halloween is. It is the Celtic new Year. There is no Celtic God of the dead! Feralia was celebrated in February, if your going to write a book or spread around information it might do you well to actually research a bit on your chosen topic. Also going to the Catholic Herald to check on the dates of a PAGAN festival probably isn't the smartest idea in the world. They may have appropriated all of our holidays and twisted them into something Christian, but that doesn't mean theyknow anything about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining - but as fiction, not fact","review":"This book is well written and entertaining, but so erroneous it's almost fiction. It would be impossible to note all the historical errors here, but just a few examples: The author tells us the Roman festival of Feralia was celebrated in October (it was celebrated in February); that Pope Gregory added All Souls' Day to the calendar (he died more than 200 years before the first celebration of All Souls' Day); and of course that Samhain was dedicated to the \\"Celtic Lord of the Dead\\" (the Celts had no such god). The mistakes just go on and on. If you're buying this for decorating tips or sheer fun, it's fine - but if you want real history this isn't the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I liked this book. It's a popular history not an anthropological tract. The errors cited below were trivial--the Pope Gregory given has the wrong number, for example. As for the Celtic Lord of the Dead, there are two schools of thought. The older one, citing folktales, says yes while the newer one favored by neo-pagans says no. Since the Celts left no written records of their beliefs, an argument can be made for both sides. I prefer the folklore. As for the rest of the book, I enjoyed the section on ghosts and staging a haunted house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Source","review":"I read this book cover to cover and to be honest, I don't think I learned anything new. In fact there is surprisingly little time devoted to actually how/what to eat! It seems like most of the book is devoted to the idea that how you eat during pregnancy will affect your child's health later in life. So if you need motivation to reach for the veggies everyday, this would be a great book to read. But overall it's the same tips about what to avoid, eat from the food pyramid, etc. Having said that, I gave it four stars because even though the information isn't new, it feels good to get it from a reputable source since half the stuff you read, it's hard to tell if you can trust it. Additionally, there are some wonderful, easy, healthy recipes at the end of the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The bottom line: Get ready for baby!","review":"Kudos to Dr. Walker on the second publication (although I wish I had this one first!) on health and wellness for mothers and their babies.This 'easy-to-ingest' book is an excellent resource for information on what to eat, what to avoid, and even includes tips on exercise and creative recipes for snack and mealtimes.Take care of yourself, and take care of your baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thick!","review":"This product is so thick, I can't even get it out of the bottle!

Hanging one, not a problem but if you want to tile more than one on a large area, this board won't work.

I have never heard anything like it before, except, in your follow up album I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"jazz fans, look away","review":"If you are considering buying this album based on Jeff Beal's other more jazz-oriented work, prepare for a huge disappointment. The Gathering is more along the lines of Beal's film score work (Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion, for example), which may be plenty appropriate in that context, but as a stand-alone album, it's just nauseating. This album is full of cheesy production (lots of obnoxious synth pads pretty much drown what little else there is to be heard), quasi-exoticism and new age-y shlock. Not to say this album hasn't got its positive qualities, in fact some of the tunes are okay, and Joan Beal's singing isn't bad; at times her voice achieves a Norma Winstone-esque tone. To be fair, I would likely have given this a two-star rating, if it hadn't already gotten an exuberant five. If, like myself, you enjoyed albums like Alternate Route and Three Graces, don't get your hopes up for this one. If you get off on albums by Enya or John Tesh, there might be something for you here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young kids","review":"I was very disappointed the description and age guideline for this book did not match the contents.

Even then, this is one of his best from his earlier years. It's an all solo-instrumental set with no vocals (though another truly exceptional guitarist, John James, sits in on several tracks as well), featuring both originally composed material and adapted works by O'Carolan and others. I like this particular album by Renbourn because his treatment of the material does not fall victim to his one occasional weakness as a guitarist: a tendency toward repetition. If you listened much to NPR's program \\"All Things Considered\\" in the 1970s and 1980s you will recognize one of the cuts from this album, which was used for many years as a filler sequence on that program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful performances of fine music","review":"The Eder Quartet presents these quartets--as well as the others in their Naxos series--with an emphasis on the beauty of the music. While not lacking vigor or drive, they slightly soften the edge that often characterizes performances of Shostakovich's quartets. Both the 4th and 6th quartets have very beautiful slow movements. The slow movement of the 4th reminds me of the adagio of the composer's 5th symphony. The 4th, which is said to be a protest against Nazi treatment of the Jews, features, in addition to the marvelous slow movement, a striking opening, a swirling third and a dance-filled final movement of some intensity. The 6th quartet carries no weighty message, but seems to be simply good music. The 7th is a concise gem. These performances are very attractive, but I would prefer a bit more tension in the 4th quartet. All in all, I'd say that the CD merits the high praise given it by the Penguin reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not science.

For instance, although the book is over 600 pages long, it contains no footnotes, a red flag to a critical reader. Alas, the author looses all credibility when he asserts that mentally ill people may not be ill at all; rather, they have telepathic abilities beyond society's ken.

I assembled it all by myself at 38 weeks pregnant and had no difficulty at all. Everything slid into place and all the parts were VERY easy to put together.

At 3 months she's already looking to grab ahold of everything she can get her hands on and there's just not enough stimulation with this bouncer. She would probably enjoy it more if the toys were out in front of her instead of to the side where it's more difficult for her to reach them.

On the other hand, I was so excited to have it for my son (#2), but he would not sit still in it at all. So when they sit it in, it's fantastic. When they don't, they don't.

The toy's placement makes it very difficult for her to reach and bat her toys- which frustrates her to the point I don't bother putting her in it any longer. I also had a difficult time lifting her out of it once she got a bit longer- the canopy doesn't fold back, so you have to swing your child out from under it, which can be difficult- especially when they are asleep.

I can control the cut easily one-handed with either hand. I used it this weekend to cut basebords for two rooms---didn't want to get my mitre saw out of storage. Did outside corners flawlessly---much better than the chop saw. No splintering even with oscillating blade on.Small drawbacks---if you are cutting angles you need to check with a square or protractor, BUT there's a detent for 90 degrees and an edge for 45 degrees that seem on most of the time. It can be difficult to get a precise, precise angle as it is hard to hold the base in place and tighten the screw at the same time. Also, rip a long board on high speed and the metal housing can get hot---but use the right blade, speed, and oscillation, and this won't be a problem.Don't mess around with a lower-priced model---this is worth the investment! It's the best tool I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone who has lost their canine best friend","review":"By no means is this beautifully and simply written book for children only.

Those of us you don't have the luxury of a \\"normal\\" baby need all the help when can get with our little miracles! I wish this bouncer was available for my first preemie but unfortunately it was not. So my older son got stuck being put anywhere I could find when I need both of my hands. Now with two boys, I really need both hands. This bouncer allows me to put my new little guy down to help my big guy. Plus, it is on my older son's level. I don't have to worry about him pulling the baby down off the couch. He loves to be the big boy by turning on the bouncer. Even though it says maximum 20 pounds, my 40 pound 2 year old loves to sit in it. Another plus to this bouncer is it will put a fussy baby right to sleep. I agree the other bouncers are great for entertainment but sometimes a baby just needs to relax and not be over stimulated!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Support","review":"This papasan has the worst support for babies. When you put the baby in the papasan it sinks down and makes the baby's head go down to their chest. I had to put another pillow underneath her butt just so her head wouldn't hang. The fabric is great and soft just not enough support. Also where the head goes you cannot adjust the height. So my baby's head sat down alot lower then where it was suppost to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bounce","review":"My baby did not like this, you are not able to bounce this manually . All it does is vibrate and that is not enough sometimes for the newborn who enjoys bouncing movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT QUIET-TIME SEAT!","review":"This is one of the best bouncers I have used with my children. It is perfect when your baby is fussy and overstimulated from being held or having too much going on around them. Its not ideal if you want an activity seat, but since babies should be laid on their backs to go to sleep, they spend a great portion of time in that position and should be playing on their tummies anyway. I love the way the pillow cradles their head so it doesn't flop around when their kicking or for younger babies with little control of their neck muscles."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little over rated!!!","review":"I,like most parents,went by the look of this seat. I recieved this as a gift when my son was almost 2 months old, he was a big baby weighing 9 lbs. 6 oz. when he was born, so therfore this seat did not last long at all. The pillow, which is not removeable, was in the wrong place, it made my son's head lean forward. After all was said and done my son enjoyed the simple bouncy seat with the fish and lights. I guess if you have a very small infant, and you use it right away, you MAY get your monies worth. My son out grew it before he was 3 months old and he was 2 months when I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not practical","review":"I registered for this product because it looked comfy and wasn't as tacky as the other bright-colored, busy bouncers. This is a stationary seat, so there's no bouncing--but it does vibrate. There are no lights of course and nothing for your baby to look at---so it's pretty boring. I thought it would be great for a new born, but it was more work to put him in it b/c I had to entertain him even when I put him down. I put him in his cousin's bouncy seat (Kick and Play) and he loved it. We now have a real bouncy seat, with toys and lights---and I wish I had gotten that to begin with b/c now he's getting too big for it but he likes it. As for the papasan, it holds blankets or sits in our trunk just to use in emergencies when we are some where and I need a place to put the baby. Go with the tacky, wild colored bouncers that won't match your home decor but will definitely entertain and stimulate your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks are all it's got","review":"This chair was awful, the nice cooshy pillow on top was not in the right spot and you can't remove it or even move it out of the way. It made my son snore when he was breathing because it pushed his chin to his chest. To tell you the truth I brought it to my sister in law's house and he used it maybe a handfull of times then I left it there. He liked the 15 dollar kids II chair we got for my parents house better. I loved the looks of this too but it is really for bigger babies I think and by the time they fit comfortably they would be too old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"After reading some of the other reviews I felt like I had to comment on this chair. We borrowed this chair from a friend and our baby LOVES it. We don't use it like a bouncy chair or a swing, we use it more like a cradle. Our son has been using the chair since he was first home from the hospital and he is almost four months old now and we use it everyday. His first \\"sleep through the night\\" night was in this chair. It is so warm and cozy and the best thing is that it cradles the baby so that if your little one learns to roll over to his tummy like mine did, he won't be able to so he will stay safe on his back. This chair could easily replace the cradle in our room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves her baby papasan","review":"This is the only thing my 4 wk old daughter will let us put her in. She won't even stay in her crib without screaming. If we didn't have the papasan I'd never get anything done. She happily takes her naps in it. My husband wants one his size & we love that it's so portable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reese's mom","review":"The Baby Papasan is very nice for newborns, now that my daughter is 2 months + old, I wish that I would of picked a bouncer with more toys for her to interact with. The material is very nice and washes well. The attached blanket is a convienence. She seems indifferent to the music and vibration. The angle of the chair is nice for feeding her a bottle. Overall, this is a good quality product yet, lacks room for developmental growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy, not for active babies","review":"The Baby Papasan seat seems to be a very comfortable seat for small babies, but once the babies get beyond the newborn stage, they seem to be too long for it. It is also a very calm seat, nothing to entertain the baby. My daughter only used hers a few times, was very bored with it. The music is very loud, I put tape over the speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUTE BUT NOT GREAT","review":"This is very pretty but very plain, comfy for the small infant but once they get a few months old...It's boring! The music & vibration only amuse a 4 month old for so long. I did purchase the matching swing - I love that! My baby slept in that until almost 3 months old. I just bought a bright colored bouncy seat & my baby girl loves it. She stares at the colors & loves to bounce."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it","review":"I registered for this because I liked the comfy fabric and everyone said you need a bouncy seat. Unfortunately, the seat is too upright and the vibrations were so mild that it did nothing for my baby. I am much happier with the ducky cradle swing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I, like most everyone else, registered for this seat because it is nice looking and seemed like it would be exceptionally comfortable. My baby is now 5 months old and practically hangs in the harness. He also has ocassionally had these mysterious scratches on his left arm and we finally just figured out where they were coming from....the velcro strap on the seat that holds the little toy! There are sharp corners and edges on the very small velcro fastener. I will be taking mine back to the store tomorrow!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Overall Design","review":"I had registered for the Papasan when I was pregnant because it was so comfortable looking and had nice colors. After my son was born I tried to put him in it and the angle was way to steep, I had to prop two bed pillows under the front leg to recline it enough for him to sleep in it. The vibration and music did not stay on long enough (15 Min) for my son- every time it stopped he would cry. He only used it a few times before we gave up because it was just too much of a hassle. Now that he is a little older (3 mos) he is not even remotely interested in it because it has no toys hanging on it. We bought him a bouncy seat with bright colors and toys dangling over him and he loves it. I would not recommend the Papasan until they change the design to recline and play vibration longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"*** I say Not for small babies***","review":"The Baby papasan is wonderful. we love that it vibrates our baby to sleep and that it's VERY soft. The head rest seems very comfortable also. The Music seems like it's too loud, but it doesn't bother our baby one bit. I've heard it's best for small/infant babies, but I disagree. I have a premee and she would sink way down in it, Now that she's 8 pounds she still has trouble staying up in it. I fix this problem by propping it up with pillows to keep it at a level she's comfortable with. I also recommend that if you buy this for your baby to sleep in through-out the night, it's not such a good idea. Get something that lays flat. The papasan has a curved backing/seat that isn't too good for your baby devloping back posture. I DO RECOMMEND THIS. It's great to put your baby in when you have stuff to get done, and you can still see her/him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I had recieved this seat as a gift, but I had requested it. I have been very disappointed in it. My son didn't like it from the moment we brought him home from the hospital. I feel terrible that we can't get any use of it. It sits up to straight. Doesn't move. My son cries when I put him in it. It looks very comfortable. But apparently it is not for him. I am trying to put it to use to not feel bad that I requested it. But my son's happiness is more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"We just brought our newborn son home yesterday and today is the first time he's using the Baby Papasan (actually right now). He has jaundice so we have him in the Papasan in front of the window and he loves it. The only thing I dont like is that he slips down because of the incline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for about two weeks, then...","review":"Babies grow fast...so your baby will probably just grow right out of this Papasan just as fast...it's great for newborns because they really can't focus much on anything, but quickly after a few weeks, you will start noticing that your baby will just grow bored right out of their mind! Unless you have a play gym or some toys dangling within your baby's site, this chair will soon be collecting dust. I admit, it was a great idea and it's cute! But like many parents out there, I got all caught up in the excitement of all these new (and expensive) products, I failed to realize that this papasan would soon be outgrown! Our Papasan is folded up standing right next to our playard in hopes that it will be used again, but our Ocean Wonders aquarium has now taken it's place...if you have money to burn, this would be a good buy, otherwise, save your money and get a bouncer suitable for newborns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I get a bad one?","review":"I must be the only person out there that didn't like this. Actually, I liked it just fine, but my daughter hated it. She sat very upright in it, and the strap was the only thing keeping her from sliding right out. All of her weight was resting on her pelvic area. It was awful! She fussed every time I tried to put her in it, so it promptly went back to the store. When I returned it, the cashier said that my daughter may not have been heavy enough for the Papasan and that was why she sat so upright. I don't know about that... She was born weighing over ten pounds and this thing is marketed for newborns. Oh well, great concept, but the seat could be more reclined. We're sticking with our Fisher Price bouncer--love that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this thing stinks for longer newborns","review":"I read the reviews for this seat and thought it would be useful for my baby. When she arrived she was 21 1/2\\", then quickly grew to 24 1/2\\" within 2 months. Her active little legs hit the music box. And since the blanket is attached on the bottom, and not matter how tucked in you make them, those legs make it a constant nuisance to hover to make sure she's covered. Also, she never looked comfortable in this seat- it was way too high and flat of a seat that you hovered to see if she was going to tip over. I didn't want to add blankets to the top to keep her supported since thats dangerous in itself. We do have the matching swing- which is a Godsend with its giant bowl seat, but this thing isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO BETTER PRODUCT","review":"My son was diagnosed with Acid Reflux when he was 1 month old- what a nightmare! The Baby Papasan SAVED us! It is inclined just perfectly for a baby who has to sleep a bit elevated, but more importantly it offers SUPPORT which other seats DO NOT. There is no slumping over to the front or the side in the Papasan. I would love to have this company build a Papasan for toddlers so my son can grow up with it! I just saw that the company just put out a Papasan swing- I definitely would have registered for that if it was available at the time of my baby shower. LADIES- DO YOUR BABY A FAVOR AND BUY THE PAPASAN!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as comfortable as it looks","review":"I am a mother of 4, I have tried sooo many \\"cute and comfy\\" baby chairs of just about every sort, this Baby Papasan was the least of my favorites, first of all the cushion for the baby's head is too propped up, second my baby would slide down to where if he would kick, the back of his foot would hit the metal area where you turn the music on/off, which made it very uncomfortable for him. At the time of use, my son was about 1month, then tried it again around 4 months, both times unsuccessful. If you do decide to purchase this chair, I would recommend you to look at it first at a store."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very exciting","review":"We received this as a shower gift along with the swing that goes with this.

My princess used it a handful of times. It now takes up space in her closed, and she is only a few months old. I am debating on whether or not to even save it for our next baby. Personally, I would save the money and buy an extra swing for Grandma's house (or the office)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her second bouncer and well worth it!","review":"When I saw the Baby Papasan line, I just had to have this for our daughter. She has a perfectly good Ocean Wonders bouncer that she loves but something told me to get this one and I'm glad I did.She has a few minor breathing problems and sleeps better on her Boppy or in the bouncer or swing. Well, in her fishy bouncer her head would fall over but not in this one. This is more of a comfy sit back and relax bouncer. It is so soft and comfy and she loves to sleep in it. She naps in it most days.We still have the fishy bouncer and we use it for play, but when she wants to nap she wants her papasan. I will admit that when she wants to play, she wants out of this so it does have some flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish my baby liked it...","review":"This was my favorite thing on my registry...I was so excited that we received it as a present. My baby doesnt like it. We can only get her in it when we are standing in front of her entertaining her. Even when she was newborn she didnt appreciate it. I tried over and over...I finally bought her a Kick and Play by Fisher Price and she LOVES IT!!! I think the Papasan just bored her and the music is way too loud!I gave it a \\"**\\" because I think some babies might like it...it just doesnt have much staying power once they are out of the sleeps all the time phase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Awesome!","review":"Our little guy loves the baby papasan...and so does my husband. It plays music and vibrates, but even without those options it is a really neat chair. It has lots of soft textures up against the baby's skin and a wonderfully soft blanket to cover the baby. It's a great purchase! They now have a papasan swing too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will fall in love with this bouncer!","review":"This is a great bouncy seat for any infant. It is so soft and padded your child will love being snuggled in this seat. It vibrates and plays soothing music. It also is timed so that the seat will shut off if you forget, which is great for saving batteries. My son is soothed asleep quickly in this chair, I am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!!!","review":"The only good thing that I can say about the Papasan is that it is cozy, and sturdy. My 2 year old likes to climb in it, but the baby ( 2 Months) hates it. It is boring. No toys to look at, the vibration turns off too soon and is very minimal, and the music is loud and you can't turn it down! Don't waste your money. I thought that it looked so comfy, and it is, but that is it!!!!! Get something with toys to look at, and a volume control!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outgrow quickly","review":"I loved this bouncer for the first 2 months but now that my daughter is 23\\" long her feet hit the battery pack. Im afraid that it will hurt her heels because she kicks it, and the padding doesn't cover it adequately.The vibration didn't do anything for her either, she was just as happy with it off as she was with it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"So far, this chair has been the only thing to soothe my son. He was a 4 lb. preemie and has been home for a month. Since then he has developed reflux and has been gassy, refusing to sleep in his cradle or crib. He would only sleep in his car seat but looked slumped and uncomfortable surrounded by buckles. This seat nestles him in and he looks so comfortable. He loves the vibrating--it puts him right out! In addition, the fabric part comes off easily and holds up well in the wash. If you ask me, $50 is a small price to pay to get your baby to sleep peacefully and to get some rest yourself. But do understand, this does not replace a bouncy seat as it does not bounce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very soft but not comfortable for my baby","review":"I bought this chair for my newborn daughter. I thought it looked very cozy and was so soft. It is very stiff when you seat baby in it, it doesn't conform to their shape like it is supposed to. I put it away for a few months and tried it again. She was 9 pounds at the time and 23 inches and her feet dangled off onto the floor. We tried rearranging her but she just couldn't get comfortable. I ended up giving it away. What a waste of money it was!! She hated it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for newborns","review":"I loved having this bouncer. I bought it when my son was 2 days old. He loved to sleep in it because it was like a cozy little nest and it was great to have something portable to take around the house and put him on. He is now 3 months old and i use it during meals so he can sit on the table and watch us eat. He also uses it daily to go to the bathroom in the mornings while i have breakfast. Great child seat when the baby is young, well worth every penny, AND CUTE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"My little baby spends a lot of time sleeping in the family room in her Papasan. I didn't put her in it until she was about three weeks old, but it put her right to sleep. She despised it for the next several days, and now (at 5 1/2 weeks) she seems to love it. It is nice that you can pick it up with the baby in it and get a shower for yourself!It is also easy to give her a bottle in it.I gave it 4 stars because what works for my baby, may not be for everyone and I read and consider these reviews before I buy. I will say that ours was a gift and came from another store, and it was $5 more there than here on amazon.comHope it helps :) Best of luck to all the new Moms!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Live Without it","review":"When my son was born we went in search of a place for him to \\"relax\\" that wasn't in his crib or on the floor. he had a one year old sister and that could have been a disaster. My son loved the papasan. he spent much of his day in it and even slept in it at night. it is easily washed and easy to put the cover back on. i dont know what i would have done with out it. it was a great investment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK seat for maybe the 1st month","review":"Like an idiot, i registered for this because i liked the way it looked and i was getting the matching swing (which is great by the way). Iwish I had talked to other moms and chosen a good bouncer... first off, it does not even bounce! It is stationary and has nothing stimulating about it. The head cushion props the baby up in an uncomfortable position and as soon as my daughter started to grow, she could not stand the seat for 2 seconds. It is virtually impossibe to travel with because it does not compact and is oddly shaped. I ended up just getting the Ocean Wonders Bouncer, which is fun and relaxing for my daughter and I haven't touched the Papasan since she was 1 month old. To sum it up: Ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loved this item","review":"Great for my son from the day he came home until he figured out that there was nothing to play with on it at about 4 months. Very comfortable, music is quite nice for the baby too. My son would fall asleep in this chair too. I would get another one for the later months that has toys like the aquarium bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish baby liked it better!","review":"I would actually give this fewer stars because we've gotten NO use out of it... but I think it's one of those personal preference things. My son just doesn't like it. We really thought he would - it's so soft and snugly. Thank goodness my mom also bought us the Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer. He LOVES it. I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much. Wish I could give the papasan a better review - but my son gave it a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decor friendly, but small and boring","review":"I loved the neutral colors since it was going to sit in our living room. And the music was pleasant to listen to. Unfortunately, it didn't recline enough to support our newborn and now, at 2 and 1/2 months of age, the chair is too small for his average-sized body. Even when we managed to prop him up in it, there was nothing to keep his attention (which was something I didn't think would be an issue at this early age). I gave up and bought the Kick 'n Play Bouncer, which not only fits him better, but keeps him entertained enough to forget about his colic spells!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for reflux!","review":"My daughter was diagnosed with reflux when she was 10 days old. We have had her sleeping in this ever since (she is now almost 5 months). It has been wonderful for us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"momof2","review":"My little guy liked this seat okay if he was already really sleepy and I propped it so that he didn't slide down so much, but the vibrating feature died several weeks ago and he is only 11 weeks. We changed the battery to no avail. A rather disappointing performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product -- Too Bad It's for Dolls, not actual children","review":"My husband and I bought this product for our son (our second large child). This is a wonderful product, however, I wish that the manufacturer would make it more likely to hold the \\"average\\" size child. We loved everything about this product -- except the size. Our son at 23\\" and 14 lbs. at 10 wks. barely fits into this bouncer seat. We also discovered that the vibration will shut itself off which is great to have as an option but a pain when you have to continually restart it.I recommend this product for premies only. For average sized or larger infants, you're wasting your money because you'll be out buying a new bouncer in a few weeks.Note to Fischer-Price: MAKE IT BIGGER AND YOU'LL HAVE A HOME RUN ON THIS ONE! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I was so excited to buy this seat for my daughter - but every time we have tried to use it she gets very upset. She cries the entire time she is in the chair.. Some of the downsides are that it only vibrates and the music function is very loud and can not be adjusted. Also it appears to be super comfy but when you put it together you realize th fabric where the baby sits does not have much give. Overall - I would recommend looking at other bouncers that have more functions to them. We will be returning this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the little babies","review":"My son was born a month early so he fits in this seat really well. He likes the vibration and soft music now, but as he gets older I think he will want more to keep him entertained. Right now he just likes to sleep in it,(and everything else we put him in!) It is really very nice and comfortable just won't be very entertaining after he gets out of his sleepy faze."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Okay","review":"I enjoy this chair but it's really nothing special. My son doesn't seem to really care for the music or the vibrations but it's nice for him to have somewhere to sit when I need a little break. The only thing is that he likes to kick and his feet always wind up hitting on the music box. He's only two months old and already seems too big for it. But it is a real comfortable chair. And they look so adorable when the fall asleep in it :0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute only goes so far.","review":"I absolutely fell in love with the Baby Papasan before my son was born. I had to have one because I thought it was soooooo cute. Well, cute only goes so far. I put my son in this seat the day he came home from the hospital and he slept so peacefully in it. After that he used it for about 2 or 3 weeks and that was the end of that. It doesn't bounce like most bouncey seats so he just sits in it for about 10 minutes vibrating and listening to the music, just as he's about to fall asleep the automatic timer cuts it off and he wakes up. The moment has passed and he just wants out of it. If this seat just bounced he would love it. He is like 50% of all babies and likes movement. If your baby is one of these DO NOT buy this product...it will just be a decoration next to your couch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Boring!","review":"I bought the baby papasan because it had nice neutral colors and felt really soft, but I was very disappointed with it. My baby only used it for 2 weeks. He napped in it, but newborns can really nap almost anywhere. We even had to prop it up with a pillow to keep him from slipping down. After the first 2 weeks, he would scream every time we tried to put him in it. It's just too boring. It doesn't bounce, and there's nothing to look at or touch. I ended up getting rid of it because it was just taking up valuable space in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love Baby Papasan !!","review":"Our daughter was born 3 1/2 weeks early and was 5 lbs. 6 oz. when we brought her home in April. She has been in the Baby Papasan since she was about 1 week old and she loves it. She likes the music and soft vibration. She is 16 weeks old now and we have undone the snaps so that she is sitting more upright. It is a great piece look wise as well. The colors are soft cream, taupe and sage green and are great for a girl or a boy. We highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Aren't Everything","review":"For our third baby, I had my eye on this papasan throughout my pregnancy and received it as a gift soon after her birth. I plan to exchange it for something else, as she is 2 months old and has never taken a liking to it - and has already outgrown it. The problems I see from a practical standpoint are that the safety belts don't adjust to allow for Baby's growth beyond about 11 pounds (and even that's a stretch), Baby has to sit high up, there are no toys to look at while Baby is awake, and the vibrate function turns itself off after about 10 minutes which causes our baby to wake up rather unhappy. The Fisher Price bouncy seat from our first baby 7 years ago is still the best seat in the house for the Baby. This papasan looks great, but doesn't stand the test of time (and a growing baby!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The Baby Papasan looks so cozy for a baby. Unfortunatly my son didn't care for it at all. The incline of the seat is too steep I think. He tends to slip forward so the buckle is what is holding him in. I really wish I would have spent the $50 on something else. He loved his swing and bouncy chair. I would recommend getting those instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like sitting on a boring bench.","review":"I have a Pier One papasan chair and couldn't wait to get this product (even though my husband said it looks boring). He was right! Our daughter barely tolerates sitting in it and, at a month old, she is too big to be strapped in since the flap doesn't adjust for a growing kid (length-wise). Totally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING unless you just want them to sleep","review":"Bought this papasan because it was nice and soft and had a low vibration. Well, I have two newborns and neither one cares for this seat. It bores them. They are 8 weeks old now, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but laying in the papasan isn't much different than laying on the floor. They could really care less that it vibrates. If you just want it so your little one can sleep where you are, then it's o.k. - but unless they sleep, they'd get bored with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"My son is almost 3 months old. I'll admit I basically registered for this bouncy chair because I liked the design. I wish I would have spoken to a mom who had tried the different bouncy chairs. This chair has no features, other than a vibrate function, a music function, and a music & vibrate function. As he was and is very colicky, my son often does not use this chair. When I CAN put him down, I never choose this chair as there is nothing to entertain him in it! I ONLY put him in it if I have a Baby Einstein DVD on. I tried out my friend's admittedly much less fancy looking Fisher Price Kick and Play bouncy chair and my son LOVED it. He sat for about 20 minutes while we ate lunch...and he was AWAKE! We ordered the Fisher Price bouncy seat the next day! This one will soon become a dust collector I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I registered for this chair thinking that our son would be very cozy in it. He sat in it maybe 4 times. He is now 4 months and weighs 17lbs so he is to big for the chair now. He never sat in it for more than 10 minutes. This is our first child so I am learning what to buy and not buy. I will save this for our next baby but I know now that babys like to swing and bounce not just sit and vibrate. I think he got bored easily. I did give it 2 stars just because one time he actually fell asleep. But it didn't last but 15 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pampasan is a bit dissapointing","review":"My 3 and 1/2 month year old daughter had another brand of vibrating seat that was a shower gift, I was not sure she liked the vibrations as they were kind of intense. I bought the Papasan by Fisher-Price and I can say that it is very pretty, looks great, cute....but, I did notice that the frame part of it is quite hard and sticks out a bit, parents...wacth your feet! and that at only 3 months her feet hang down way past the end of chair so they are sitting against this hard metal frame, It would be great if frame was made of a firm plastic perhaps? also, She actually preferred the less expensive chair we started with. I do think the music is sweet and it makes yet another option on which to distract her at times by changing the scene, again, It certainly is cute as can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 Minute Warning","review":"As a new mother, I'm always thankful for any amount of daytime sleep that my baby takes. I put him in this seat from the day we returned home from the hospital. He loved the vibration and the music. Problem is - everything turns off after 15 minutes - which causes him to wake up and cry. I don't want him to rely on the vibrations for comfort - but 15 minutes is too short of a time for the chair to turn off. After 7 weeks of frustration - I went out and spent another $50 on the Eddie Bauer relaxing bouncer - and he's as happy as can be. I thought I should warn other parents about this chair - since it doesn't advertize that it turns off automatically on the box. I wouldn't have bought it if it had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"We received this as a baby shower gift and were so excited because it looked so comfy. Our son was 5 weeks premature and we thought he would love this little snuggly place to lay but he absolutely hated it. Right when our son would get comfortable the vibrations and music would just stop, and the seat ate through batteries fast. The bunny was a total waste and our son hated the music. Even the vibrations were so slight they really did not sooth him. He preferred the Fisher Price Aquarium bouncy seat that vibrated so strong I thought he would be sick but instead put him to sleep in moments.In all I think we used this seat a handful of times and now that our son is 4 months old he is too big for it. We will not be saving this for our next child so off to the consignment store it will go.I definately expected more out of this chair for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"This item is great at the beginning, but I agree it's not the best for later on. Although my son loves to nap in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reclined enough for baby","review":"I am not too impressed with this seat. My son would slide down further and further until he eventually was almost falling off! Yes, it is very comfortable and soft but it should offer a variety of positions for reclining to avoid this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a bad one...","review":"I must be the only person out there that didn't like this. Actually, I liked it just fine, but my daughter hated it. She sat very upright in it, and the strap was the only thing keeping her from sliding right out. All of her weight was resting on her pelvic area. It was awful! She fussed every time I tried to put her in it, so it promptly went back to the store. When I returned it, the cashier said that my daughter may not have been heavy enough for the Papasan and that was why she sat so upright. I don't know about that... She was born weighing over ten pounds and this thing is marketed for newborns. Oh well, great concept, but the seat could be more reclined. We're sticking with our Fisher Price bouncer--love that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but not functional","review":"We registered for this seat before the birth of our second son because we thought it looked really cozy and we liked the soft colors. The problem is that he never fit right in it. It sits the baby at a weird angle and he couldn't sit comfortably. We were so excited when we got it at the shower we opened it and threw away the box or alse I would've tried to return it. I kept trying to use it hoping that it would be better as he got older but to no avail. Besides being awkward to sit in, it has no toys and no way to attach toys to it so it really provided no help to me! We ended up using our first son's $20 Fisher Price bouncer and it was wonderful and well worth the money and it came completely apart for easy storage and travel! Go cheap on this one, but make sure it has toys or something to stimulate baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in the beginning....","review":"This chair is AWESOME for a newborn. It's big and soft and we thought that it was so cute that we had to prop our daughter up with rolled up blankets or lay her down sideways. The music isn't to annoying, and it shuts off in a decent amount of time.But then, like everything else... The newborn stage ends... And this chair loses MAJOR points. My daughter isn't quite 3 months old and the straps are at their largest point and they barely fit around her. There aren't toys to look at and she can't make herself bounce. It's now sitting in the dining room and my cat uses it for a bed.This was the first thing that I bought when I found out that I was pregnant. I just KNEW that I wanted to have it. Now I wish I would have bought one that a) she could make bounce and b) had a toy bar for her to interact with. If she would have stayed small forever, this chair would be perfect. Personally, I think it's a bit to much for the use that you will get out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money -- buy a REAL bouncer","review":"I got both this and the Ocean Wonders Bouncer so I really have something to compare this to.Everytime I put my baby in this he cried, the vibration compared to the OW bouncer is so light he could hardly feel it.The seat does not move -- so you can't 'bounce' the baby to soothe himThe music is VERY low it can hardly be heard and there is no volume.The blanket LOOKS great but if you have a kicker like I do it is worthless -- the little tiny velcros won't hold it.Boy does that rabit on it look cute --but it will be lost or put away the first week.One thing I do LIKE about it is it turns off after it has been on for awhile so you don't ruin batteries if you pick up the baby and forget to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks aren't everything","review":"I loved the way this bouncer seat looked more than any other one in the store of course because of it's plush design and soft fabric. However, for the price that you pay I wouldn't recommend this one. I kept it because I threw the box away, but I ended up buying the Ocean Wonders one and my son just loved it. This bouncer seat doesn't do anything but vibrate and play music. There is nothing entertaining about it. It is great for when they are weeks out of the hospital, but that is it. Ocean Wonders is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOKS SOFT & COMFY BUT THATS IT....","review":"I registered for this and god bless the ones that overpaid for it!!I wanted this bouncer because it looked irresistably cute and comfortable but as it turned out my daughter thought it was a joke. Her body only 7 pds at birth fell to the bottom even with the safety strap attached and she wasnt even impressed with the vibrations or music which constantly shuts off automatically after only minutes. It doesnt take much to please my baby she has never been fussy sick or colic in fact a friend paid 1.50 for a used bouncer that wasnt fancy in the least she loves to be in it all the time. My advice, try to resist the beautiful look and softness of the seat cause it has no stimulation or enjoyment for baby whatsoever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My son did not like this at all.","review":"The chair is nice and nicely made, but my son did not like it at all. We used the aquarium swing more than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely uncomfortable","review":"I bought two of these for my new twins thinking they would enjoy their own little seats, but neither one will tolerate this seat for more than a few minutes. The angle is wrong causing the babies' heads to be pushed forward onto their chests, and no amount of seat padding or propping up the legs alleviates the problem. Also, the harness actually suspends the babies in a most uncomfortable way...they are actually 'hanging' on the chair putting pressure on the babies legs and bottoms. Terrible seats...do not waste your money on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissapointed!","review":"I fell in love with the chair before our son was born. I quickly learned that the plushy fleece is just a sell for the parents. The worst feature - the vibration has a self timer on it and it shuts off after 10 minutes. There is no override for this! So, before my son had even fallen asleep, the vibration would stop and he'd wake up! Another bad feature - the safety straps are so short! If he is swaddled or in a fleece sleeper, I can't even begin to latch them. He's only 2 months old! I wish we hadn't wasted the money on this item and plan to contact Fisher Price about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every cent!","review":"My son absolutely loves this chair. He has slept in this comfy chair since he came home from the hospital. He was 8 lbs 12 oz, so I am not sure how it works with smaller babies but it is perfect for him. He is now 13 lbs and still sleeps in it daily.We have used this chair daily for 7 weeks and we have yet to change the batteries! I think this is definately a must have item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Bouncer!!","review":"My son really likes this bouncer. It seems like it's very soothing for him. If he's fussy, I put him in and let him get a massage, which he seems to like because it calms him down right away. The only thing that I'm disappointed with is that he's growing out of it at 3 months old, but then again, my son is in the 95% tile. If you try this massager you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but not very useful.","review":"I registered for this because I thought it was absolutely adorable. I have been disappointed with it though. It is definitely soft and looks like it would be so cozy and comfy. However, my baby slides down almost immediately after I put her in it. Her feet end up way off the end and her bottom is pretty much at the bottom bar. The only thing holding her in is the restraint straps which I always buckle, thank goodness. I have a small baby, only 5 lbs at birth so size isn't the problem. Also, it is pretty much only good for naps as there isn't an activity bar-not a problem for young ones but won't do once they get a few months old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Nest","review":"Our 8 1/2 week old has used this since the day he came home from the hospital. It really does keep the baby secure and warm. I put it in the bathroom when I am showeing, and because he is so comfortable, my showers are never rushed. The music is loud enough for him to hear over the shower sounds. Most of the time, he is sleeping by the time I am done. Wonderful product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for newborns...","review":"I loved this seat the minute I saw it and received it as a shower gift. My daughter napped blissfully for the first month of her life but now that she is 3 1/2 months old she has very active little feet and cut one of her heels on the box that controls the music/vibration. I wouldn't recommend this seat (or any others with the control box placed by the child's feet) for long term use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironic!","review":"This is by far one of the nicest LOOKING baby seats out there. I received a barely-used one as a pass-along-gift from my girlfriend. Now I now why it was barely-used. Her son didn't like it. Neither did mine! I didn't get it-- it was warm, soft-- he didn't care and wanted nothing to do with it-- preferred this hideous baby seat every time. The back is very flat- so I never felt like the baby was really \\"in\\" a seat, more like leaning on it. This may work for much smaller babies, but at 8 lbs., my baby was done with it by week 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"My daughter loved this. We used it until she was 6 months old. She did not like her bouncer or even her bassinett but she loved this papasan. I wish I had gotten it from Day 1. It's easy to put together and she loved the music. She slept in this for a few months bc it was the only thing that worked. It's very soothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for preemie","review":"This gift was a wonderful asset for our preemie baby. Due to its design it was one of the only things that came close to fitting her little body. It allowed her time out of the bassinet and mommy's arms. The only problem is its music/vibration automatic shut off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I received this as a shower gift. We thought it was the coolest thing. We were very wrong. We tried it with my daughter when she was just a few weeks old, and she didn't like it. We thought maybe she was too young for it, and tried back several times throughout the next few months. She is now 4 mos. old and still doesn't like it. She gets bored when she sits in it, the music is not very interesting and apparently the soothing vibrations are not very soothing. When we turn on the vibrations she gets a very uncomfortable look on her face and then starts crying (which she never cries). My advice would be to get a bouncy seat with an entertainment bar or a rocking bouncy seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my son","review":"I got this item as a gift for my son. He could not have cared less about it. There is nothing wrong with the product, but my baby simply did not care for it at all. By the time I would get him buckled in he would be squirming to be picked up. There are no toys on the seat, the bunny doll is useless, and my baby did not like the vibration. It was easy to assemble, well packaged, and the seat itself is very plush. Other children might care for this but I would suggest buying a swing or a bouncy chair instead of one of these sit alone chairs. In my opinion it is too hard to have your child sit in a small seat on the floor while you sit on the couch or in a chair. My son would much rather be at the same height as me. Since a toy like this is only good for approx. 5 months I would suggest spending your money on something more usefull."},{"rating":"2","title":"One item you should purchase","review":"This was the best purchase I have made so far. My baby loves hanging out and sleeping in this seat. I used it from the first day home from the hospital and she fit nice and snug in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Lifesaver for me and baby!","review":"This seat has been a lifesaver. For those moms that have newbors with reflux and obsessively worry about the baby spitting up while sleeping, this is a lifesaver. I put my little one in it after she eats and I don't have to worry about her lying flat and possibly spitting up and choking.My little one absolutely loves this chair as do I!The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I think Fisher Price could have added some toys to the front to give the baby something to look at. There isn't even a place to clip toys on.....But still definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No leg space!","review":"Beautiful, comfy looking, great music; BUT my baby has no leg room. Her feet hang over the edge. The angle of the seat leaves baby sliding down and out. The seat straps do keep her in. She kicks her feet a lot, and her legs would smack down hard on the hard surface at the edge of the seat. Beautiful start, but needs modification. I think this would have been better for a baby with short legs who is perhaps less than 4 mo old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for Babies - Would be Great Idea for Adults","review":"I put the papasan on my baby registry after looking at all the bouncers in the store b/c it looked so comfortable. But naively I was only thinking in terms of my own non-baby experience, and mistakenly thought my baby would love how soft it is. I was majorly wrong. My daughter is 3 months old & she has never been interested in this & will wake up and cry even if i put her in while she's sleeping. I'm taking it back to the store & buying a regular bouncer. I would recommend that instead of the papasan."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be great if I could actually buy one!!!","review":"I registered for this swing in July of this year - at which point it was \\"temporarily\\" out of stock. It is now Thanksgiving and my baby is due in the next two weeks and this item has yet to be in stock!!! I have checked in the store and online weekly and even began calling Babies R Us each Tues. & Thurs. the days they recieved shipments. I've called Fisher Price and they stated that they can not sell directly to the consumer (which is a loss for them) and that Babies R Us is the ONLY place that I can purchase it. I'm sure this would be a great swing IF I COULD ONLY BUY ONE!!! My second choice in a swing is also a Fisher Price model that is perputually out of stock as well (AND is also only available at BRUs)...seems like Fisher Price isn't all that interested in actually SELLING any swings! I have money - don't they want it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unhappy with order","review":"I was REALLY UNHAPPY with my experience using Amazon to order this. First, I didn't realize I had actually ordered it until I received the confirmation e-mail. I tried to cancel the order, but it was too late. When I received the item, the box was completely torn up. This was a gift for my best friend's new baby, and the way the box looked, I wasn't even sure what condition the product would be in. I will not be using Amazon to order anything from Babies R Us again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby looks uncomfortable!","review":"After reading the reviews, I registered for both the papasan and the kick and play. My son was a preemie, and at 4 1/2 lbs., I had expected this seat to be great based on the reviews. Unfortunately, he did not seem to care for this seat AT ALL. His head was pushed forward by the head rest, and there was no way to remove it or push it up, out of the way. I tried to put him in the seat off and on for over 3 months, as he grew to over 12 lbs. At no point did he tolerate the seat for more than 10 minutes. The music was a bit loud, the vibration seemed okay, but he had nothing else to entertain him and looked completely uncomfortable. The blanket was in the way and the bunny just blended in to the fabric, so I don't think he could even see it. He has enjoyed his kick and play to no end. I would recommend that over this seat any day, especially considering the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best infant seat ever","review":"This seat was an amazing comfort for our little one since the say we brought him home from the hospital. The vibration feature often immediately calmed him if he was sleeping and there was a disruption. At 4 months old, he still spends time in the seat... too bad they don't make one for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"This is a good bouncer for a sleeping baby. She could sleep in it for hours - that's why the high rating. Our daughter doesn't get much enjoyment out of it if she's awake - there's nothing for her to look at. Don't like the music, so never have it on. And it's hard to hear. Our baby is soothed by movement, so the vibration is not enough to soothe her. She would rather be in her swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"vibes too harsh","review":"my 2 week old loves the cuddle but the vibrations scare her. she loves to drive in the car which always puts her to sleep but not these settings.

I've had one of these for 6 months now. I got to use it once before the front roller came out of its holder. Before that it was great. After that it was very frustrating. I took it to a service center. They had it for 4 months because the parts were on back order. When it finally came back ,one of the sales men asked me what was wrong. I showed him the front roller and he barely touched it and it fell apart again ! So I still don't have it. I guess this is so common that there aren't enough parts to go around. This is very strange for a a tool that says Bosch on it. Don't waste your valuable time or money on this tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for light duty applications only","review":"I am a small business owner and bought this sander to grind off the flashing on our polymer concrete castings (a material that is similar to cultured marble countertops.)The good: It is light weight, easy to use and very easy to change the belts. It has a variable speed dial and a dial to align the belt should it wander off track.The bad: It is too slow on the rpm's, even when you set it at its highest speed. It is also a little bit noiser than I thought it would be. It is about as noisy as a pneumatic. The belts are of poor quality. I burned through all of the belts that came with it in one day. They are also very expensive.I can see this being an excellent tool for sanding wood or other soft materials but that is about it. Now that I am stuck with a non-standard belt size, I hope they offer belts for materials other than wood. I also hope that some other manufacturer will produce these belts to bring the cost down to where it should be for expendable items."},{"rating":"2","title":"After First Use of the Compact Sander","review":"After the first use of the compact Bosch Sander I rate it as excellent for my purposes. I bought it specifically to use in spot sanding dovetails when they stick out beyond the wood surface. For this use, its performance was excellent. It's very easy to handle because of its light weight and small size. I also used it to remove select areas of wood for better fit. I like it much better than my heavier Stanley belt sander which can sometimes gourge the wood (probably because of my carelessness)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to get started in the Sierras","review":"I purchased this book before a summer trip to Mammoth last summer and have been very happy. I have always enjoyed FalconGuide books, and this is no exception. There are plenty of hikes to chose , my only complaint is that there could be better maps and more photos included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Re-Title as Day Hikes of the Sierras","review":"The title sounds great, BUT it should be re-titled as DAY HIKES of the Sierras. About 90% of the hikes listed are less than 10 miles in length. Silly. The Sierras are magnificent and about 60 miles wide.. WHY would you want to buy a book with hikes shorter than 10 miles. ALSO, the maps of each hike are almost useless since the passes and major trail points do not have elevation marked on it. Shows elevation of most of nearby peaks, but stops at showing the stuff that matters. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong color numbers!!!","review":"I've heard some numbers are wrong, so the design doesn't come out as shown in the book.

I put it to the test, drilling a 1/2 inch hole through two plates of four hundred series stainless steel 3/8 inch plate in my steel work bench for mounting my vise. That drill hogged right through, without lugging down at all. I ended up really impressed. Glad i bought it from AMAZON.COM."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST you can get","review":"This is absolutely the best drill of this type that you can get. It is extremely powerful, the trigger is very sensitive, and the quik-lok cord is an amazing and useful feature. Buy one and I'm sure you will agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Customer","review":"The Milwaukee 0234-6 Magnum 5.5 Amp 1/2-Inch Drill was more expensive than other drills I considered. I bought it expecting reliability and extra power when needed. I used only once - I drilled four 3/4\\" inch holes through one inch thick yellow maple. It did this without problems. I was happy with the purchase. Eight months passed before I needed it again. The drill had been stored untouched in a climate controlled room but it no longer worked. The drill turns on only when pointing straight up. As soon as the drill is moved, it stops. Maybe I shouldn't complain, after all I can still drill holes as long as I climb under the board and drill towards the ceiling. It may be under warranty but I need it now not in six weeks. None of this seems to matter to Milwaukee customer service. The time and bother of packaging and shipping is more trouble than it's worth. It's going in the trash bin and I'll replace it with different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"D.O.A","review":"This drill was new in the box, I opened the box, plugged in the drill and hit the trigger... NO POWER, so I tried it a work the next day and the same thing. So at the end of the assembly line did they do a QC check before it went out the door?... I wonder?. Also why is my Milwaukee drill made in China?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best 1/2\\" drill available","review":"This drill is an absolute work horse. Besides doing lots of hole drilling in different materials, I've used this drill to mix thinset mortar, grout, and joint compound....it just churns away and barely gets warm. After burning up two Dewalt drills, I decided to go with Milwaukee. The keyed chuck is the best on the market and you never need to worry about it slipping once you've secured it properly. The drill has a lot of torque, so use the additional handle and hold on tight! Great drill....great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brute","review":"I bought this drill because of the great reviews it has received from the guys who have worked with it in the field. They should know. Also, it is one of the last drills that is still \\"MADE IN AMERICA\\" by AMERICANS!

I will be buying a different drill from a different mfg. from now on and I would advise any one reading this to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why pay more for Chinese tools and the Chinese economy","review":"For most of my life Milwaukee tools (starting with my Dad's Sawz-All) were worth paying more for because of quality made in the USA. After too much time spent searching (Milwaukee/Amazon does not appear comfortable disclosing the location of manufacture in the product description, so you have to search the reviews to get the facts), this drill as well as every other Milwaukee product I looked at are made in China. It is not worth it to me to pay twice the price if it is not made in the USA/local. I can get a perfectly serviceable Dewalt for half the price. I am bummed to not be paying the price of my new drill into our economy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Low RPM for Wood Drilling","review":"As well-built and durable as the Milwaukee reputation would have one believe. I've had mine for 12 years now, and it's still growing strong. The only gripe I have is the low max RPM which is not particularly the best for drilling wood. I bought the Milwaukee hammer-drill for some concrete work, and since that has a higher maximum speed, I use that most often now. I save the Hole-Shooter for when I don't want a high speed such as for hole-saws, Forstner bits, and drilling metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great drill","review":"I have had my Magnum 1/2in drill for 15 years and it is just a great drill. I use it to drill through steel and it does what it is supposed to do. Based on that purchase, I now own three additional Milwauke cordless drills and a router."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great drill","review":"I purchased this drill to replace the same product....gave my last one to a friend. This is not a cheapie drill typically found at the big box stores...more a piece of equipment. If you need something to get you through home projects AND big jobs, this is it. Spend the money, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best drill I have ever used","review":"This is the best drill I have ever used. It is incredibly powerful and will drive large bits and hole saws with ease (Be sure to use the side handle and hold on tight or it can twist your arm if the bit binds). It will drive an auger bit through a 12 inch barn beam often in one try. Also great for driving long screws. The limited speed compared to many other drill makes it work better and makes it easier to control. Great for everything except drilling in concrete or masonry (you need a hammer drill for this). Highly reccomended"},{"rating":"2","title":"HELP - is this 0234-1 or 0234-6?","review":"Did anybody notice this?...When I ordered the 0234-6 drill, the box stated 0234-6, BUT the drill itself stated 0234-1.1.

In both cases, I have experienced about a 33%+ defective rate. My prior batch of Ritek and Memorex was closed to 3% to 5%.The first set of 100 - the coating material for the writing surface caused the discs to stick to one another. I wonder if the coating caused the high defect rate.I then opened up the second batch and found the discs to not stick to one another. The defect rate is lower at about 1 out of every 5.I bought these discs based on the price to value. I would not recommend this brand to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so Good","review":"I also have the Plextor DVD burner and So far all my Ridata discs have burned perfectly!

They worked great, so I decided to get these faster ones. But in reality, they only work at 2.4X. I have not changed any configurations of software or hardware. In fact I can still get about 5.9X out of the 4X model, so I am switching back to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deterioration in Quality???","review":"I've heard nothing but rave reviews about Ridata media. I've seen posts where folks had gone through entire 100pc cakeboxes without a single coaster. A friend of mine even attested to its reliability. After careful research and consideration, I bit and purchased my first 100pc cakebox 2 months ago.Well, now I've completed the entire cakebox and I can say that I've discarded 20%-25% of the discs. I could not pinpoint whether the point of failure was with the media, my drive, or my software. But after reading some of the comments on this product here, I'm glad I'm not alone in my assessment. I too think that perhaps Ritek has farmed out manufacturing of this media thereby explaining the deterioration in quality.I still give it 2 stars though because at the price that this media has been offered at, I think it's still a good buy.... even with quite a handful of coasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"this thing do works..I gave 4 stars bacause so far i have burned about 20 DVD's and found 2 of them had defects...so they couln't be burned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"Bought these Ridata discs a couple months back. The cheap price was attractive, but that's all I have to say about these disks. I probably get a good 25% of the discs burn correctly, while the remaining have piled up to an impressive coaster collection. Kinda frustrating whenever you're 10 minutes into burning, you get an error and the disc is ejected. I'd recommend a name brand like Memorex instead.

I have played back these burned DVDs in a Cyberhome standalone player, Xbox as well as 2 DVD-ROMs without problems.

I tried both Nero and Roxio and both gave the same results.I would not recommend this media to anyone. If you're using some media with your burner already and planning to switch to Ritek just because of the lower cost, trust me - its not worth it, because if you factor in the cost of the wasted coasters you'll be even, and not to talk of the agony and the time wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Pioneer 8X drive only writes these at 4X","review":"According to Ritek's site, they are working on getting a full 8X out of Pioneer's DVR-107D and DVR-A07XLA, but they are not there yet.

However, if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality.

We actually experience the development of the apes as members of society, and the screenplay handles deftly and with outlandish, bold strokes, both racial and societal issues. It is colorful, interesting and features once again the delightful Roddy McDowall as Caesar, son of Cornelius and Zira.

However, too many plot holes exist in this movie. The government sends in its troops in small batches and fights them man to ape. No gas. No tanks. No air power. Why fight a mob like that hand to hand when you have helicopter gunships? They also didn't use even standard infantry tactics, just marched them in there straight up.

In fact, trust is only legitimately studied as a mechanism within political philosophy using a particular set of methods. Not surprisingly, those methods are the ones used by Russell Hardin, political philosopher.What we have here is the worst kind of territorial academic argument - more interested in dispute than enlightenment.

Each crunchy cookie is full of chocolate chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"These don't really resemble chocolate chip cookies","review":"I know allowances need to be made for being gluten free, since it's hard to get good texture and taste from gluten-free, but these chocolate chip cookies don't compare at all well with their namesakes. There's a weird flavor that overwhelms everything else--not sure if it's the rice syrup or what, but whatever it is, that plus the texture which is pretty gritty and chalky at the end makes these cookies a one-time purchase. They're so bad I'm throwing them out instead of eating them. The gingersnaps are tolerable. Not great, but definitely more edible than the chocolate chips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!!!!","review":"For those of us who can't eat wheat, having a cookie, and a good cookie, can be a rare treat. These cookies are delicious. Wonderful! Yummy! Even our friends who eat wheat love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I'm the only one","review":"I got these on sale during celiac awareness month, I chose the chocolate chip. I thought they were pretty gross, and to me they had a funny chemical after taste, which I don't know what it could have been from since it's all organic ingredients. Ick. I wouldn't buy these for .25 cents a bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product but price much higher than before","review":"Our whole family loves these ginger snap cookies. We have tried all 3 varieties, and they are all great. I last ordered the ginger snaps in December, and they were about $3 per bag. When I went to reorder, the price had gone up significantly ( to about $5). I noticed the other 2 varieties were available through Amazon and are still reasonably priced, and this one is available through Nutricity. Please make this variety available again through Amazon. Pamela's makes awesome bread mix and pancake mix, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Chocolate Chip for GF","review":"I've lived GF since the age of 12 (in other words, along time)lol.These are terrific cookies. I am usually fairly restrained when eating sweets, but I admit, I would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting had I not thought about the calories and the fact I was getting really full.If you are looking to feel like you aren't deprived, then you must try these.Other than the fact, that they tend to be a bit more crumbly than most cookies, they are a winner.ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"speedy and catchy for fist pumping and finger pointing","review":"THIS is the one. if i had to pick one explosion release to take with me to a desert island, this would be it. why? because it's got what all the punk bands (please, no \\"how do you define \\"punk\\" tirade here, thank you) that sign with jade tree seem to have: speed, attitude and energy. and while i like the other explosion recordings, this one's got the raw, dirty quality that seems most honest. short and sweet. so you can listen to it 6 times in a row, no problem.when this was new, there were a lot of \\"oi/streetpunk\\" descriptions, which i never quite heard, myself. fans of kid dynamite, strike anywhere, trial by fire, bronx etc take note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sandals.","review":"I was having pain in my feet because of other flip flops not supporting the arch.

John Paul Allen brings to you a novel like no other. When I read \\"Gifted Trust\\" an overwhelming fear took hold over me and pulled me deeper within the pages of this dark tale. I can't recall ever reading a book in my life that made my skin crawl until \\"Gifted Trust\\" knocked on my door. His words will amaze you and his thoughts will haunt you. He is the Father of Nightmares.-Kingdom of Shadows Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just be Good!","review":"This was a hard book to put down. Every time I thought I could not read any more, that it was getting to intense...I kept picking it up because I had to see what happened next. This is definitely not a book to share with the kids, but if you like to read books that you will think about often...then this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions with mediocre results.","review":"While the subject of Gifted Trust did not manage to appall me, its inept writing and sloppy editing did. With the possible exception of Jeffrey Michael Roberts, all the characters are as flat and unengaging as any to be found in a novel by Dan Brown or John Grisham. Add to that the misplaced puncuation marks; the frequent use of \\"you're\\" where \\"your\\" was intended; the incorrect spelling of Joni (not Joannie) Mitchell's name--a few of the numerous mistakes a competent editor would not have missed. The author is not entirely untalented; there are moments when he exhibits the flair of a good storyteller. But overall, this book serves as an example of a great premise that has been clumsily executed, not unlike The Lovely Bones. In the hands of a more accomplished writer, such as Scott Smith, Gifted Trust could have been a very fine addition to the horror genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic, but too amatuerish","review":"John Paul Allen's first novel, which was rereleased, is not the worst novel I've read. That is one of the few positive thigns I have to say about \\"Gifted Trust\\", a graphic, unappealing, amateur-hour horror book about an evil disembodied spirit named Virago(or Hellhound as it translates). Virago follows different souls through the years: a publisher in the early 30's; a serial killer who also rapes his victims and often kills children and their mothers; and a gay high-school teacher at an \\"alterantive\\" school. There are too many typos in the book, and the plot becomes hard to follow, and the coda is superfluous. The serial killer passages are the best of the book. Allen sure captures a sick and perverted mind well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest story I ever read!","review":"Wow! This story is definately scary! I thought I was beyond being scared, but this author really pushes the line and keeps pushing...It makes Hannible look like a character from Sesame St.I would recomend this book to anyone that likes horror!!He's got a website that I checked out, and it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"Very cute game for preschoolers and kindergartners. . .

I have used it to drill holes and drive screws in 60 year old plaster. I have been a skeptic about the capability of lower voltage cordless tools but this little gem has power to spare and is what you would expect from Milwaukee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the best cordless screwdriver i've ever owned. Durable, compact and versitle. It comes with a nice hard plastic case, a handful of bits and a drill chuck insert. At 2.4 volts you might not think it has the power, but you'd be mistaken... it drives slowly, but has a lot of torque. Well worth the price tag. I couldn't be more pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"Much more torque or power than you would expect for a small driver. Adjustable clutch prevents stripping screws. Angle grip or straight with power trigger in a great location. I liked it so much I purchased two more for friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kobe's Incredible Life","review":"I chose the book, Kobe, because I was interested in knowing more about the life of Kobe Bryant. I was surprised to learn about Kobe's upbringing and background because it was totally different than what I had expected.I liked this book because it tells all about Kobe Bryant's love for basketball, and his determination and drive to improve his skills. Kobe's basketball career begins when his family moves back to his hometown in America. The book also contains a lot of really cool pictures.Learn about how this young star athlete developed into an all star basketball player. Joe Layden does a terrific job in revealing what makes Kobe a superstar. I recommend this book to anyone interested in basketball. It is very inspirational!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kobe's family and career","review":"I read this book for an english report and I feel that it wasn't a great book to read.

The monitor weights 16.5 lbs, and www.ergotron.com says it will work....Despite it's advertised 18 lb limit, it wasn't even remotely close to being able to handle my 16.5 lb monitor.... It *seems* to be a great stand otherwise, and if you have a very light monitor go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"I got this stand for a Dell 1900FP which weighs 15.5 lbs. This weight is 2.5 lbs less than the arm is advertised to support. The arm held the monitor for a day or two and then started to sag. Right now I have to put something under the monitor to keep it from tilting forward and face down. The joint that is failing to hold could theoretically be tightened with an allen wrench, however cranking on that did absolutely nothing. Nice design but a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It droops, big disappointment","review":"I should have read the above post before I bought this arm (74). It droops under the weight of my Dell 1905FP which is below the rated max. It needed the metal spacer plate to fit the VESA 100 holes. I wonder if the weight of the plate kicks it over the edge? Also the verticle tilt screw set didn't release properly to allow verticle movement. Oh well back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I have purchased two of these from two different outlets and both were exactly the same. The allen screws would not budge with the supplied allen wrenches or with any of my high quality allen wrenches-The tilt arm on would not move even with the screw removed!I was very frustrated the first time and convinced the second time that this is not a good solution to my monitor needs.Kensington will be the next unit I try.Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Price","review":"I have a NeoFlex holding my Dell 2007FP and it works great. The topmost screws nearest the monitor needed hefty tightening, but it holds the monitor without any drooping. The quick height adjustment with the large lock-button is convenient as well. The reason why I left out a star is because the cable management clips are somewhat flimsy. They tend to pop open if there are too many cables inside. I'm running power, DVI, VGA, S-video, and USB down the arm, which required a rubber band around the clips to keep them closed. Ideally the cable management would be inside the arm, but these would be suitable for most applications. The arm also looks a little flimsy--if you're going for something solid, try the LX series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lab Technique Reference","review":"This book is very helpful to me as a veterinary technician student. The guide is easy to read, and the laboratory technique directions are easy to follow. The color hematology photos are very useful in identification of cell types.

She has a wonderful voice and I think this is her best album yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monica has Set It Off!","review":"Monica Arnold, known simply as Monica to the world, returns after 5 years of pain to deliver a mature, sexy album. What many people don't know, is that during this 5 year period, Monica lost the love of her life, her boyfriend. What makes it worse is that she witnessed her boyfriend, Jarvis Weems take his own life right in front of her very eyes in July of 2000. For Monica to be able to bounce off of that situation and 3 years later release a hit album takes a lot of guts. Although \\"After The Storm\\" has a great feel to it, \\"The Boy Is Mine\\" was the best Monica album ever. The best song on \\"After The Storm\\" is \\"Get It Off\\" by far. \\"Knock Knock\\", \\"Go To Bed Mad f/ Tyrese\\", and \\"So Gone\\" are some of the other highlights of this rather short album."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't even know","review":"This Cd. HAs alot more than just one bonus track. When the CD was supposed to hit stores it had 2 disks.

As usual she proved me wrong. Her voice is much more mature and crisp on after the storm. From the humor filled intro with Missy to the So Gone remix on the last song she worked it. The Highlights of the album is the song Not Gonna Cry anymore, I wrote this song(talkin about a dead boyfriend), You Should've known better, her duet with Tyreese and for sure \\"So Gone\\". This is one CD not to miss I'm hopeful it's gonna be the number one bought CD this week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monica's finally back!","review":"Those of you who were missing Monica after her last CD, \\"The Boy is Mine\\", she makes a good comeback with this new set of songs. The song with DMX, Don't Gotta Come Home, is my favorite song on the album followed closely by the song Go to Bed Mad with Tyrese. It also contains a remix of the hit single So Gone which is a good addition. Overall, although this album doesn't quite measure up to her previous one in my eyes, it is still a very essential purchase if you like Monica's style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait.....worth the money spent","review":"I picked up this CD on a whim thinking that it would just get tossed in my collection, because usually what happens when ytou hear an ear-cathcing osng on the radio, you buy the CD and rest is [bad]. But let me tell you, this whole CD is awesome. Some of my personal favorites are Set it Off, and KNock, Knock. The ballads are super-sappy but the ideas behind them are great. This girl is super tough ad it comes through int he song selection and ideas in her songs, as you can see that she had creative input on several of the tracks. Overall I have this CD permanently in my CD player. Great CD, anyone that wants a good Cd for the summer, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing....","review":"MONICA IS BACK!!!!!!!!!The CD is amazing...Monica has it all on this album.

Monica sings beautifully on this album and also raps for the first time in her career!!! None of the songs are \\"fillers\\" in my opinion all of the songs are catchy,beautiful,or just plain hot in general.This album deserves more praise than it is currently getting and definitely more promotion.

She has taken her music in a different direction...I feel more of a rap-like direction. Glad to hear that she is back, just wish that it was like the simiular groove sounds of her first album. I give the album 2 stars because I still love her talanted voice.

I've heard her previous albums, but I didn't think the overall effort was worth a purchase. That changed with the release of After The Storm. This is the maturing of Monica, mentally and vocally, and she worked with the right producers to show what she can do as an artist. I'll be listening to this album for a long time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums this year","review":"I have always liked Monica's voice but never really liked any of her songs other than those released as singles. So I never purchased any of her albums until now. Every single song on this album is just as good as \\"So Gone\\" if not better. This is easily one of the best albums released this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Back","review":"I think Monica's cd is awesome!! I really didn't get into her work before this because I am older and her sound before didn't appeal to me. But I am so happy she is back with a sound that appeals to an older crowd. I think the industry needs more black female artist besides seeing the same ones over and over. She is powerful competition and she gave us time to miss her and really appreciate her come back. She should be proud of this album and Congrats Monica!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the italian guru of rnb/hip-hop","review":"great great great. nothing else to say.what a great come back for Monica. I listened to the bootleg of this cd some monthes ago and it wasn't bad but something was missing.

Result: a fantastic cd that will take her to the top of the charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get into it","review":"I've been following monica's music since about 1995 up until the release of the CD I couldn't think of a monica song I didn't like cause the girl can sing and had fresh r&b classic beats, but I really couldn't get into this CD at all. It was obviously created to appeal to today's young teens just as miss thang did years ago for me but it's not as good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not her best work","review":"The cd was okay, but nothing to really brag on.

Possibly my worst purchase of 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm very disappointed in this album. She's sampling too many other songs on this album and not using her own creativity. I was anticipating the arrival of this cd and when I heard it I was in utter disgust. It was the worst 14 bucks I've ever spent. The song I really liked (past tense) was \\"So Gone\\" until I heard the ridiculous remix she has for it. Then the radio just abuses it by playing it every 30 minutes. And is there really a need for 2 cd's? Sorry Monica but I thought this album would be a little more mature. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monica-You Are So Gone!","review":"I bought this cd with high hopes. However all i got was a depressing boring piece of junk! So gone was good, until it got played way too much and then i hated it! The only other songs i like are \\"i wrote you this song\\" and \\"breaks my heart\\" but im startin to get sick of those too! Don't waste your money. If you're a happy person this cd will make you feel like crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before the Storm....","review":"She was smooth sailing. Okay well sorta. Honestly this CD is one of the worst I have heard this year. The best song on this CD is \\"So Gone\\". However, that bad part is that the song isnt really that good. Simply put, I think Monica's voice and entire image is no longer needed in the industry. Her songs don't really appeal to audiences who enjoy real music. I feel as though maybe she should shadow Brandy and see how she revamped her image and sound. Word of advice to Monica: Missy can't make a good album for herself, why let her produce yours?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Words Of Wisdom","review":"Monica's After the Storm is a truely new, fresh, and moving CD. Monica has develop over the years into a striking woman. Maybe it's because we are the same age and I grew up listening to her music. It seems as if she opening the flood gates to her emotions and allowing the listener to actually step into her life. Songs like Knock, Knock I sure we can all relate too. As well as Breaks My Heart(on of my personal favorites, Mo' I seems as if you were singing what i was feeling). But on the serious note, MOnica is a talent Female Artist with a tremendous amount of soul, the CD is excellent ya'll. Check it out and I promise you won't be disappoint. \\"what part of the game is this?\\"1"},{"rating":"2","title":"off the chains","review":"This album is the truth. Monica did the dam thing. Missy's remix of \\"So Gone\\" with Busta is tighter then the other version. The beats, the lyrics, the rap, all of it hott. This is the best R&B album I've heard this year. She sampled a lot of songs, but the way she puts it down is so smooth. \\"Down 4 whatever\\" is the best love song on the album. The song called \\"Too Hood\\" with Jermaine Dupri shows Monica's gangsta side. Oh, and I can't forget the cut with DMX \\"Don't gotta go home\\", that's the best song on the album. (watch out Lil' Mo, Monica is BACK!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Set It Off.....","review":"After a little break, mama Monica returns to the streets (yes, I said the streets) with a triumphant release spearheaded by Missy Elliot. The result is tight. Usually a sucker for \\"neo-soul\\" type stuff this disc was a pleasant surprise. I could do without the Tyrese track tho...but all in all, it sounds pretty good. The track Set It Off is a typical Missy influenced rap tune that is a certifiable club banger (trust me, I'm cool, I swear). Dont Go Home with X is a body mover as well. Really good disc from the ATL diva...Holla"},{"rating":"1","title":"After C-Murder, All U Want is a Gansta!","review":"What is going on with Monica? When did she decide to become gansta? It really bothers me that all she wants to do is be a ride or die chick. She wants a guy with a degree and a couple of felonies, which makes it harder for all the good guys out there. Instead of talking bad to u and pushing u around, how about letting a guy push ur buttons and let him get to know u and please u n every way. Stop going after these drug dealers and set an example for our youth. Find someone real and make some real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"After the Storm you're shipwrecked","review":"After waiting so long for one of my favorite artist, I was dissapointed that her style had completely changed from such soulful maturity for one of her age to the same hip hop that you find on any of the lesser talented artist CD. There was not a single song on the CD worth listening too. I have not been this dissapointed in music since I purchased Destiny Child's Christmas CD (which I now use as a coaster). For those who have not purchased a Monica CD before, by pass this one and buy her previous CD's.

I wasn't too much of a fan of \\"So Gone\\" but I decided to get the CD anyway since I liked her previous albums. (Plus she from the ATL so I gotta represent my hometown)After hearing about the first 5 songs, I was ready to take that CD back.... I was like \\"What...is this?\\" This isn't what I expected from Monica at all. She talks about the same things almost everybody else talk about and the songs aren't original at all. The only songs I really liked were \\"Breaks My Heart\\" and \\"I Wrote This Song\\". Other than that, you can keep the rest.

No need to fast forward on any tracks here as Miss Thang surely doesn't disappoint! Best songs here are: \\"Set It Off\\" (feat. Missy Elliott), \\"Hurts The Most,\\" \\"Breaks My Heart,\\" \\"Can't Do It Like Me,\\" \\"Ain't Gonna Cry No More,\\" and \\"Not This Time.\\" Every song here is a winner!and the \\"So Gone\\" Remix (feat. Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes) is awesome! This is a must-have!! Go get this hot album today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monica Is Back!!!","review":"After her last album \\"All Eyez On Me\\" was never released (In the US). Monica fans were left with a big \\"What the?!!!\\". But after a year or so Monica emerged with a 11 track cd that was worth it. The opner, a fast tempo track penned by superproducer Missy Elliott called \\"Set It Off\\" is bound to be a hit with dance floors and parties. Then follows her hit \\"So Gone\\". Other stand outs are the duet that Monica shares with rapper DMX on the track \\"Don't Gotta Go Home\\". This song reminds me of Aaliyah's song \\"I Care 4 U\\" and the song \\"Knock, Knock\\" were Monica showcases her rapping skills a la\` \\"So Gone\\". The only grip I have with this album is the song \\"Down 4 Whatevea\\". Which was originaly on the album \\"All Eyez On Me\\" was scrapped and placed on the second disc would have been nicely pleased between \\"Don't Gotta Go Home\\" and \\"Knock, Knock\\". But other than that this is a real good album. Worth every penny. But make sure you get the Limited Edition album. Its worth it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Gone (not no mo!) That girl done came back!!","review":"Monica done set it off. With this third debut album. I didnt think she was commin back like that an all the haters need to stop hatin an give tha female her props. Even though she dragged some songs from the All eyes on me album she made right decisions. She redefined beats that people havent heard in a while an she got a introduction of rap into this cd. Man holla at ya girl MonicaGo pick this album up in full effect.I promise U wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grab an umbrella and duck for cover..","review":"Maybe I built up high expectations for Monica's new c.d. but it was kind of dissapointing. There arent any stellar tracks besides \\"So Gone\\" which is amazing. Monica's vocals are flawless on this track and its outstanding. Sometimes Monica's walks the fine line between singing deeply and just sounding horrible as seen on the verses to the \\"So Gone\\" remix. Tracks worth checking out are: \\"That's My Man\\" a soulful number about finding Mr. Right, \\"Dont GOtta Go Home\\" a sultry duet with DMX that will definately get tongues wagging, and \\"Down 4 Whatever\\" which is one the bonus disc. I am still a Monica fan and hopefully her next lp will truely be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its pretty good","review":"I Always liked Monica but I had never bought one of her Cd's and I must say I am not disappointed.

The rest of players are also excellent; the piano leads of Jeffrey Barr I especially enjoyed, as well as Thomas Uhde's harp playing. Very cool album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two is better than one","review":"A beautiful duo album from two of England's greatest guitarists, recorded in their prime. Jansch is more blues-influenced, while Renbourn leans towards classical music and the baroque; yet their styles mesh perfectly. You can tell there's a lot of affection and respect between the two musicians. Wherever I listen to this album, it always conjures up images of being in a small country cottage, with rain outside, tea just poured, and a roaring fire in the grate. One of Jimmy Page's favourite records, I understand; it should be one of yours too."},{"rating":"1","title":"too simple","review":"A very basic book with little real substance--a thin book with few pages with simplistic drawings and no content. Explains all the obvious information about securing furniture and knick knacks, plus the usual safety boiler plate information that should be obvious to anyone with common sense. The information on structural aspects for the home are laughable and sometimes incorrect. I think I learned more in third grade about earthquakes than this book has to offer. There are many far better books on the subject. I'm sending this guy back. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be no stars","review":"Item originally arrived 2 days after purchase and it was DOA.

About 1/3 of the book is on decorating using houseplants and I liked seeing the different places and ways that we can display our houseplants. There are a few pages for types of containers, raising and grooming plants;what types of lighting one can use; potting, good section on propagating; a section on plant profiles; lots of nice, beautiful single photos of plants and a short essay on where the plant likes to grow indoors.I think it is well worth purchasing and most people will find it informative.

It arrived without the bridge installed. However there are no instructions on how to install the bridge.

The strings didn't fit properly because the knobs were loose! This violin is much too small and it is a very bad violin.

He's been Caetano Veloso's bandleader for several years and has worked with Japan's Ryuchi Sakamoto since the early 1990s; here they build on the sleek, elegant sound of the Quarteto Jobim-Morelenbaum album, which also featured the stately, stylish contributions of Paulo and Daniel Jobim, the son and grandson of the legendary bossa nova composer Antonio Carlos Jobim, and the sleek vocals of Morelenbaum's wife, Paula. This is a classy album all the way through -- elegant, unhurried, melodically and harmonically rich. Fans of the classic bossa sound will love this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry!","review":"This album is a must-have for any bossa nova fan, or any admirer of chill-out type of music for that matter. It's music, poetry, meditation and relaxation all at once. Put it on while your reading a book, drinkin a cup of coffe or spending time with your beloved one, it's universal! I would give it 10 stars if there was such an option.Sam / NY, USA"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful, Soothing CD Guaranteed to Make You Relax","review":"The collaboration between Paula & Jaques Morelenbaum and Ryuichi Sakamoto is one that is magical. Paula's silky, smooth voice and Jacques unique usage of the cello in bossa nova help make this a memorable CD. Sakamoto adds his contribution as a wonderful pianist and together the three artists create a spark that is brilliant and very relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"He still has it","review":"This is a unique collaboration between Jobim who seems to have branched from his earlier roots - and some interesting performers. If you are looking for Ipanema you may be disappointed but you should listen to this twice - at least - then you will be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent, one of the most exquisite CDs I know","review":"This CD is a must-have for any serious music lover, a true masterpiece melding Jobim's timeless compositions--some of which are virtually unknown even to major fans like myself--with brilliant and perfectly rendered arrangements for piano, cello, and voice. Paula Morelenbaum sings on most cuts with what to me is the purest, sweetest voice of any female vocalist treating Brazilian popular music, if not any music. The arrangements are unique and somewhat surprising at first, but then one quickly realizes that they reveal the amazing emotional depth of Jobim's musical ideas in a way that has never been done before. If you love jazz, classical music, and of course, Brazilian music, you will not go wrong with this recording and may, like me, find it almost impossible to stop playing again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely amazing....","review":"So much to say about this wonderful recording. As I write this, there are 27 reviews posted for Casa and not one of them is less than 4 stars, with the vast majority as 5 stars. That speaks volumes in itself. But the quality of the words and the thought behind them is truly a tribute to Jobim. If we were all lucky enough to have him with us now, the words of these reviews would surely either make him smile or bring tears of joy to his eyes. This truly is music that soothes...reflects...and makes us all appreciate either finding it or being introduced to it by someone. Introduce only your best friends to this, those that would appreciate it as much as you and I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest Seller","review":"Seller claimed this was in very good condition with minimal writing/highlighting and this isn't true. The book is literally crumbling apart. There are tears in the cover, the pages are coming loose from the binding, and EVERY page is heavily written on to such extent that it is unreadable. I don't know why the seller would claim this is anything but poor condition-- I am shocked they would claim this is very good condition. I cannot believe this is the book I ordered. The packaging it came in is in perfect condition, so this could not be due to shipping. Now I have to pay to return this and will end up spending more than a new edition would cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and detailed","review":"This is the first Elizabeth Gaskell book I've ever read and unfortunately not very impressed. The overall subject seems to be the love story in our heroine's life, however, book tries to give so many other mesages that it is not fun or focused anymore. There are social issues, emerging new worker-master dynamics in the victorian time, continues questioning of death and beyond... Within all this it is impossible to get a true taste of a social, phylosophical or romance novel.Although I like the period books very much, I could barely finish this one. However I watched the series from BBC and it was very good! I suggest the series over the book in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"This is a perfect DVD of the great mini-series of \\"North and South\\" - great to view on the DVD player.

If you have seen the movie the BBC did recently, the book is slightly different but still charming."},{"rating":"1","title":"North and South- if you can stand it","review":"I have never written a review before, but I can't restrain my contempt for Norilana. This book happens to be the beautiful, poignant love story I have ever had the pleasure to read. However, this particular text has been so badly printed that it absolutely overflows, if I can use that word in relation to a book, with typos! It is so obvious that the text was never proofread! Norilana should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for corrupting the text of this beautiful book to the extent that I was practically wincing every few minutes as I discovered another mistake. I dislike buying paperbacks, but I would rather have a paperback with the pure text than wade through another Norilana edition of anything again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love this book!

The movie made by BBC does not follow the book exactly but is a great film and a fairly good representation of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"North and South","review":"I won't be able to review this book until I can find one with print that is big enough for me to see. I would like to have known how small the print was before I made the purchase. Another reason I mourn the loss of real live book stores. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"I loved this novel. I found Gaskell's depiction of class separation, family, life and death all rolled up in a romance to be a very moving and completely enjoyable and satisfying read. A classic that gives you a peak into what went into the evolution of the Industrial Age. The author uses this social conflict as a backdrop to a romance between two vibrate characters, Mr. Thornton and Margaret, who are just two of the wonderful characters in a novel I highly recommend to those who have a love for classic reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book -- Terrible Formatting","review":"Like some of the other reviewers have said, the formatting on this is terrible, and for me made it virtually impossible to read.

I purchased this edition over others that were slightly more expensive but ended up regretting it. It is rife with spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors.

I loved the novel, but the experience would have been vastly better had I chosen a book by a reputable publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"a compelling love story for the ages","review":"This love story is for the ages.

Margaret is a very strong woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"North & South","review":"Product was in good condition and sent very quickly. I loved the story and I am not a huge fan of period dramas. I found the historical elements realistic and felt it painted a good picture of the place and time. The story had intrigue, conflict and good characterization that allowed you to see the different perspectives of the characters about the same event. I would recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas that focus around a love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Margaret, Margaret, Margaret","review":"A beautiful love story that took place in the background of the class conflicts of North and South and the industrialization of the North. Margaret Hale and John Thornton were wonderful characters and both of them had strong family values. Margaret was a strong and courageous woman who was able to stand up to the trials and tribulations thrown her way. John was absolutely swoon-worthy and his unyielding love for Margaret made your heart swell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the book - but not this version!","review":"I've never read a book with so many glaring typos, missing words, and mixed up text. Some sentences were so garbled that I had to re-read several times to guess at the meaning. I also agree with previous posts -- the book size is ungainly and the font is not user-friendly. This book was published by IAP Publishing of Las Vegas, NV. Avoid their books. Gaskell's novel was a wonderful read -- an Austenesque heroine finding her way in the world. An added bonus was the insight the author provides about the encroachment of industry on the people and countryside of 19th century England. Find another edition, buy it, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Font","review":"For people for are planning to read this for fun, I would recommend not purchasing this version of North and South as the font on the inside of the book is very small and could easily cause eye strain if read for a long period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Romance!","review":"This 19th century novel is an engaging and touching romantic tale set in the dreary but enlightening context of intense labor conflicts during the mid-1800's industrial expansion in England. The author was a contemporary of Dickens and Trollope. She writes clearly and in a way that holds the reader's interest. If you love Jane Austen, you'll enjoy this book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"The e-text was prepared by Charles Aldarondo. It is full of errors, which ranged from \\"off-putting\\" (hyphens in the middle of words, which possibly went across lines in the original), to \\"frustrating\\" (phrases transposed to lines some distance from where they belonged). In some instances I could not even discern what was intended! It was almost unbearably distracting. I assume this is not a problem with the other versions of this title...at least I certainly hope not. I would gladly do Mr. Aldarondo's job over again...for free! I loved the book enough to consider paying money to get a better version, which I probably will do! If you knew my frugality, you would know this is indeed high praise for the author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much more!","review":"I love the Norton Critical Edition because it contains so many secondary sources; from letters to contemporary criticism! That is useful to get a better understanding of this novel and its author. The footnotes are on the page and not somewhere in the back of the book, so it's a very easy to use edition. I'd recommed it for college use."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very basic edition","review":"I prefer hardcover over paperback and I wasn't too impressed with this edition, the only one available in hardcover. It's full of typos, some of which obviously are due to the fact that some machine scanned the text from the first edition and no human eye ever went over the text once again. Thus, \\"being bold\\" becomes \\"being hold\\", \\"he lives there with his ilk\\" becomes \\"he lives there with his milk\\" etc. First I thought those were archaic forms of English or some obscure dialect but no, it was just the machine... There is absolutely no \\"bonus material\\", no annotations, explanations, preface or anything else. No comparison with the carefully done Barnes and Noble Classics editions.

The series are supposed to be based on a couple of Gaskell's books, so I bought Cranford and this one. There was nothing of the TV series that came from \\"North and South.\\" The book was pretty slow going at first, but since I loved Cranford, I stuck with it. I'm not sure that to enjoy the ending you really needed all of the little details. There is a family prominent to the story that added nothing and wasted a lot of pages, in my opinion. But I guess they are there to illustrate both sides of the economic life. It's not a book I would read again. But the ending made up for all the slogging through I had to do to get there.

Don't buy this version.","review":"I came out of my way to write the very same review that is already here several times. The typos of this book are proof of the shoddy editing - I don't think anyone even read through it before sending it to print! Furthermore, paragraphs aren't indented (which is annoying), and the size of the book (a large square) makes it difficult to read.Here's an excerpt so that you can get an idea of the horrible typos:\\"Their two nights at hotels had cost more than Mr. Hale had anticipated, and they were glad to take the first clean, cheerful for the first time for many days, did Margaret feel at rest. There rooms they met with that were at liberty to receive them. There, was a dreaminess in the rest, too, which made it still more perfect and luxurious to repose in.\\" See page 39.I mean, you can't even read it!! I have NO IDEA what this means!

In this present time of financial crisis, it is, perhaps, comforting to know that this cycle occured in the past, as it does in this book. Issues regarding capitalism, its opertion, its faults and failings are one of the many themes of this book.Margaret Hale and John Thornton are wonderful protagonists and their development toward personal and professional maturity is exciting to read. This book posits the possibility of a moral capitalism, that, while seemingly idealistic, might actually work if we try. Now might be a good time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a new favorite","review":"I decided to read this book after completing my Jane Austen marathon. I received the movie with Richard Armitage as a holiday gift and was inspired to look to Elizabeth Gaskell for future reading. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Because I haven't read other editions I cannot speak for this particular version comparing to other prints but as for the story itself....Elizabeth Gaskell does not disappoint. Her content dares to delve deep into issues of the working class and barriers between social circles of the time. This book is right next to Pride and Prejudice in my heart....and had I discovered it sooner...Austen would not have been my favorite for so long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this edition","review":"The story of course is delightful, but please choose a different edition of this novel.

You are better off finding yourself a copy of the 79/80 edition. Marsh, in particular, is just full of it - when he isn't being completely hypocritical (the hachet job he does on the Doors and X, to name but two, should prompt one to dismiss this entire volume)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes","review":"This book has been very informative to me, but I've found some mistakes which makes me not sure if I should trust a lot of things from this book. I'm sure most of it is true, but still a book like this shouldn't have mistakes. One mistake being for Triumvirat saying that they were from Finland when they're really from Germany. Another mistake is under the discography for Spirit. It says the album, 12 Dreams Of Dr. Sardonicus, was released in 1967 when it was really released in 1971. I also do not agree with a lot of reviews in this book. I mean how could they give EVERY Black Sabbath album the same rating which was 1 star? This book also doesn't have complete discographies if the album wasn't released in the US which is annoying. It's also missing a lot of great bands such as Amon D����l II who deserve to be in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"What can you say about a guide that doesn't give 5 Stars to Wire, The Replacements, Husker Du, The Pixies, New Order, Joy Division, David Bowie, or The Smiths.

I not only lost the 7 unwanted lbs, but lost a total of 12 extra lbs. The down side (and there always is one with ANYthing) is that it makes your heart feel like it's going to pop out of your chest. 2 capsules taken at once will make you feel coked out of your mind, but the end result makes it worth it.

Greg took what he learned from his idol Eddie Van Halen, added some much more advanced music theory (and his own superior talent) and produced this gem of a debut. The album is worth the money just for Greg's exponential tapping technique, but best of all, you get 9 well crafted/extremely catchy songs. Every song on this CD is good (it's one of \\"those\\" CDs)....however, if I could take off half a star, I would because Greg tends to go off on scales in parts of the song or solo that just don't need that many notes. He's obviously having fun, though, and it's Mike Varney's (producer/recording engineer) fault for not listening to the mix enough and not having Greg do multiple takes in order to be able to edit the overkill - my opinion....also, the mix is a little off in a couple of songs. Greg does some really cool rhythm stuff but sometimes you can barely hear it because the lead parts are too loud.4 and a half stars, rounded up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor exicution.","review":"I purchased this item at a local drug store for $9.95.Whenever you returned the handset to the base there was a loud reverbsqueal.It ate batteries at an alarming rate (every week) and there was no A/C adaptor.I stopped using the batteries and the caller I.D. quit as well asall of the other features.Then, after 8 months it started squealing whenever you picked it upto make a call.It is now in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't touch it","review":"This product shouldn't be sold to an unsuspecting public.It's junk and does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping costs prohibitive","review":"I use one of these at my occupation and it is an excellent power screwdriver with plenty of torque, good ergonomics, and good battery life, however when I attempted to purchase one through Amazon for my personal use the shipping charges were more than half the cost of the screwdriver.

Too bad that the batteries and charger are garbage.In my experience with about 8 - 10 batteries for three of these screwdrivers, if you happen not to use a particular battery for a few weeks, it will self discharge and the charger will refuse to charge it. Goodbye another $25. I've had at least $100 worth of relatively new batteries fail this way in less than a year.This problem basically won't let you buy extra batteries to keep charged. If you do, they will just die. So, you're pretty much guaranteed to run out of usable batteries in the middle of a task.I suggest that you buy something better.Next time, I'll get a screwdriver with a Lithium battery, or use a regular screwdriver.(By the way, many people who have tried to buy NiMH replacement batteries for this unit to avoid this problem have been cheated with re-labeled or misrepresented NiCad batteries.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Winter Ends","review":"An excellent read for those interested in the lives of those who mined copper in the Keweenaw peninsula of Michigan, the hardships they endured, and the trauma of leaving families back in Cornwall, England to find work in America...no unemployment in those days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This was a good book if you want to get an idea of how your Cornish ancestor may have felt moving to the US.

That very same guy said that if you really want to listen to metal you should listen to some wierd ass bands that no one has even heard of. This guy is probably just a hater. Anyway, back to my opinion of the album, Slipknot's album is a good album. It has good songs such as Left Behind and Everything ends. The best song in the album will probably be Disasterpiece. I have to say Slipknot's last album was better, but IOWA does not fall too short from it. All the songs from this album are cool except for IOWA the track, I did not like it for some reason.

There is nothing new about Slipknot other then thier horrible inablility to play well live, and there lack of musical talent, except for Joey the drummer since he is the only member with any musical aspiration in the band anyway. Well look before you shout Slipknot is the best band or buy this CD take time to listen to someone more powerful with more musical and artistic depth.

Slipknot's unrelenting \\"anger\\" is apparently driven by the fact that they come from a barren state. Well, cry me a river...a whole lot of people do too.

If you want TRUE metal DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was a score of zero, they wouldn't even deserve it","review":"I'd have to say that Slipknot, doesnt even deserve the right of being called metal, they are probably the worst band i have ever heard, yes, i am trying to offend slipknot fans, because they need to get off their ass's and look for real metal, i mean this cd sound like it's a bunch of 6th graders with some garbage cans, and sticks, and a god damn stick with strings on it,and the singer, sounds like he has something in his ass, honestly people, if you like slipknot, then you need to go jump off a cliff, or run into the street and get slammed by a semi. If you want real metal, listen to bands like At The Gates, Bathory, Thyrfing, or Windir, Dissection, Mithotyn, Avenged Sevenfold, Opeth, whatever. LOL even Mayhem is a better band than slipcock, hah which is pretty sad. Im not sorry if i offended anyone because you need to realize that the crap your listening to sucks ASS. lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Music!!!","review":"I don't know how anyone can bare to listen to this. You can't even figure out the lyrics and there is no cordination in the music. All I hear is a bunch of screaming, wailing people over junk guitar which plays one chord or at least it seems that way. Do yourself a favour and forget this album and go and listen to some true music such as Metallica, Ozzy, Alice In Chains, Creed or if you please Nirvana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why,Why, Why, WHY, WHY!!!","review":"You're probably wondering \\"What are all the 'why's for?\\" Well they're for, in large lettering:WHY DID i BURN THIS...CD!??!?!?!??i SWEAR! These [guys] dress up in CLOWN MASKS! That alone says more about them then their music. All the songs [are terrible], there's hardly any singing. If you're into this kind of music, you should listen to MuDvAyNe. They're alot more melodic, and they're slower. You can actually hear the lead singer saying actual decipherable words. But this band, Nooo. They just play too fast and they scream over it.Eeeeeccccccchhhhh!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as the last one!","review":"This cd is even worse than the last one they came out with.

They were from the beginning along with Static X, Kittie, and all those other \\"hardcore\\" bands. And why does it take 2 drummers to do the same bass drum roll preformed by Danny Carey of Tool? I would buy Britney Spears sooner than this crap soley because no one denies that she is a pop artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"all i can say is noise pollution,these guys have no talent at all. its like see who can scream the loudest and play the fsatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This follow up makes me very sad","review":"It really depresses me when a band makes an excellent debut record and follows it up with (...). Slipknot is a perfect example. They come out swinging with a perfect, creative, and very original debut that is balls-out heavy, yet it some excellent work and pretty experiementive at the same time (\\"Scissors\\"). But I am very dissapointed.First of all, these are some very (...) lyrics. I can't believe this is the same Corey. If you think songs like \\" \\"Heretic Anthem\\" took a lot of the thought process, then you must think that Drowning Pool writes good songs.Even the music is all of the same. I expected a band as original as Slipknot just to switch it up a TINY bit. But nooo, they couldn't change at all. They had to please their \\"hardcore maggots\\" by making as heavy as a record as possible, yet nothing else.Overall, a very dissapointing follow up. Skip this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on!","review":"It's about time a band DIDN'T wuss out on their second CD. Iowa is as hardcore as Slipknot was before. It's not watered down to appeal to the mainstream MTV audience.

So consider yourself warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like metal or rock, get this CD!","review":"Ok, I'll admit, it took me awhile to actually get this CD. But now that I have it I'm glad I do. Alot of people don't like Slipknot because they say they are profane. Well I say these people are just closed-minded.If you liked Slipknot's self-titled second CD (the independently released \\"Mate,feed,kill,repeat was their first) You'll like this album, the band has discovered more of their sound, the instruments sound better, and Corey sings more on this album than the other (don't worry there is still plenty of screaming)Oh, but if you really don't like cussing, don't bother with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet mother of god i love this stuff","review":"Okay, okay, yeah, the guitar sucks. It really, really sucks. But it certainly conveys the right message- AH! KILL EVERYTHING! AH!And, the drumming is as ferocious as anything I've ever heard in my life. Absolutely amazing that anyone can play that fast and heavy. Corey Taylor is just as good a screamer as Tom Araya, or anybody else. This album combines the low guttural screams of Pantera with the thrashing death-slaughter-small-children-in-the-name-of-Satan lyrics of Slayer. The greatest tracks on here are The Heretic Anthem, Everything Ends, and My Plague (which has almost a, dare I say, nice/sweet sounding chorus), along with Disasterpiece- astonishing vocals at the end. Wow. This whole album is worth listening to over and over again until your ears bleed. And, oh will they ever bleed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipknot at their best.","review":"This is the best Slipknot album yet.1. (515) - I refuse to listen to this cuz I listened to it at night. Scary. Still good. 4/52. People = (...)- Favorite song on the album. 5/53. Disasterpiece - Awesome, grungy song. Disaster is what Slipknot is. 5/54. My Plauge - Decent. 4.5/55. Everything Ends - My least favorite, but still good. 3.5/56. The Heretic Anthem - Heretic indeed. 5/57. Gently - The softest song on here(...). 5/58. Left Behind - Awesome. 5/59. The Shape - Cool echos. 5/510. I Am Hated - Cool. Awesome raspy, radio type stuff. 5/511. Skin Ticket - 6 minutes, loving every second. If you think this is long, just wait...5/512. New Abortion - Scream, scream, scream. Corey Taylor's favorite thing to do. 5/513. Metabolic - Sweet. 5/514. Iowa - This is the song I was saying was long. 15 minutes. Doesn't match up to \\"Scissors\\" on their debut (19 minutes). 10/10BUY THIS CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be ALOT better...","review":"First of all, I am a huge fan of slipknot. Secondly, their self-titled debut is definitely a better choice than \\"Iowa\\". \\"Iowa\\" is heavy, just not in an original and well-organized way. There's not much change in any of the songs as the album progresses, and the whole album just seems very linear. While \\"Slipknot\\" was unique in that it's vocals, melodies, and riffs varied throughtout the album, \\"Iowa\\" doesn't deliver as much personality and color. It's just all thrash - all the way through, and not much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid cd!","review":"This album is absolutly horrible. Slipknot has no idea what they are doing. They just throw a bunch of crap together and call it music. This cd is very weak and lacks any kind of intensity. It should be in the pop section. Don't buy this cd. You'll regreat it, if you do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another angst album","review":"Once again, we have an album that is the product of excessive angst. Slipknot takes the approach of yelling and screaming with loud, often overbearing background noise to get out their feelings about society and people. Iowa is no exception to this pattern. I have not been, and will continue to not be, an avid fan of Slipknot. Try doing a little bit of actual singing sometime guys; it pays off. I'd have to say this was one of my poorest, least educated music purchase decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrement from Iowa","review":"Where do I start? Slipknot has many things that stick out in my mind about this awful album. The fact that they make simple music. They need 3 drummers/percussionists to do the work of one. This band has no talent..! Anyone who listens to this doesn't know what metal is. Bands in the \\"Nu-metal\\" scene are as good as the Ebola Virus is to humans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially Sepultura with Mr. Bungle's masks.","review":"Folks, Slipknot's music is nothing fresh. Listen to Sepultura's \\"Roots\\" in the middle of both Slipknot albums...you'll seriously think it was all the same band. The singer's voice, the sampling, the percussionists, guitars, bass, etc., totally the same. \\"Roots\\" had much better production, so if you like groove-oriented metal, get that.Probably the best song on here is \\"Gently\\". Unfortunately, it's not original, either. It sounds remarkably similar to \\"Exhale the Vile\\" by Machine Head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot=(...)","review":"It seems that to have success in the 90's music scene you have to do an act. Backstreet Boys do a nice dancing and act cute. Slipknot is in the other end of the scale, but they are still just a product that need to be sold. The music is more or less just a cacophony of noise. Some guys running around smashing musical instruments and act crazy. The lead singer could sing, if he wanted too, but he prefer to growl. Nothing new or original, there have always been noise around."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD (...)","review":"Alright, this is completely and utterly garbage.The lyrics are unbelieveably disturbing and these (...)freaks are obviouslyno talent (...)artists.No offense to you Slipknot fans because we all have our own opinions and like are own music and thats what makes everyone unique and individual, but all the same i do not recommend this cd. Indstead try System Of A Down or Gorrilaz or something. thanks for reading this. PEACE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knot for the faint hearted","review":"When I first heard Slipknot, I was not sure that I liked them so much. That was after listening to only one of their songs (wait & bleed). Then I got their first album and was almost immediately an fan. Slipknot manage to mix rap & metal to near perfection. Their new album Iowa is probaly THE best album that I have heard, period. I have met a few people who have been offended by some of the lyrics, all I have to say to them is F#ck you. If you can't handle slipknot then go listen to britney spears. And don't pretend that you like metal and then write bad reviews about this album. If you don't lick this album, then you never licked metal. Slipknot don't try to be like anyone. Slipknot are what they are, the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best death metal for the death metal fan","review":"I must say, this cd is complete in ever aspect of what a death metal album should be. I thought the first album was excellent, it's nothing compared to Iowa. Iowa is superb, from the low tuned guitars, to the scratching of records in the backround, and then the anger driven voice of Corey makes a orgasmic expierience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, it's just bad","review":"Their first album was sort of entertaining, but this is just awful. Anger without reason. I'll take Morbid Angel outtakes over this...and I dont even like Morbid Angel. And the lyrics...wow, eighth grade was tough, man. But swearing is sooooooo cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great angry music","review":"I bought this cd immediately after it came out being a fan of their first album. I have to admit when I first heard it, it sort of blew me away with it's heaviness. It even gave me a headache. So don't listen to this if you already have one or arn't feeling well. But once you get used to it, it's a quality cd. It lacks a little of the originality of the first one but they improved their sound though. The drumming is top notch. I think Corey has a great voice and he should have used it a little more in a less screaming fashion because he sounds good when he doesn't scream also. But if you like heavy music I definitley reccomend this and it's great to listen to when you are in a bad mood. I LOve \\"Skin Ticket\\", it's so creepy with allthose tribal drum beats. I could listen to it a hundred times."},{"rating":"1","title":"big dissapointment","review":"Slipknot's new release is a big let down. All the songs sound the same and the lyrics sound like the same words only rearranged. This CD came out of my player suprisingly quick. Self-titled was much better. Don't buy this unless you're 14, or a hardcore knot fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are Sid and Craig????","review":"If this CD had been released under the name of a different band, I would have absolutely loved it. But, as my subject says, where did Sid and Craig go? And, for that matter, Chris and Shawn? What happened to the ingenuity and creativity that filled the first album? I have only heard \\"DJing\\" on maybe two tracks, and no sampling except on a few select tracks. The lyrics are great, the drums kick...(as usual), and there are some great heavy guitars, but its missing the depth of the first album. By itself, a great album, but for Slipknot, mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont recomend this CD.....","review":"This album is very repetative. All the songs sound the same and are poorly done. The title track is 15 minutes of sh** if you ask me. I would not want to waste 15 minutes of my life listening to that song. Recommend Metallica or Motograter over this CD anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuthin But Metal......","review":"Slipknot picks up where it left off after their last release, Iowa brings the same crunchy guitars, and tortured screams. Needless to say, if you have the first cd, you'll need to go ahead and score Iowa too.

I agree with another reviewer on here where he said that this music isn't heavy, it's just garabage. If you want good heavy metal music check out Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Pantera, Slayer, Black Label Society and Iron Maiden or something like that. All those bands are great, this is just as I said-garbage.PS: one more thing. BANGING RANDOM POWER CHORDS ISN'T MUSIC! IT'S NOISE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot shouldn't be considered music...","review":"I don't know why I have this CD, I think the only reason I have it is because I stole it. Anyways, you seriously have to be deaf or have some kind of mental disorder to consider this music. Slipknot has no talent, it literally took me about 10 minutes to play all their songs perfectly on guitar. This CD was almost well worth stealing, the only purpose it served was flinging it from my window at the annoying neighbor kid. I don't know why everyone in my school likes them so much. I guess you would like this if you hate everyone or if you 'Have issues'..."},{"rating":"1","title":"slipknot is a disgrace....","review":"this cd makes me nautious, because so many ppl like these guys and they are garbage....ppl dont know the roots of this, its not metal, is hardcore punk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Me Linkin Park fan and u?","review":"ok ppl.

Yep...I can really relate to these cow pattie-shoveling Iowa goons who have nothing better to do then make songs about nothing but teen-angst, even if Korn did that 7 years ago...Yep Slipknot is really the most talented band I have heard since Milli Vanilli...all gimmick and no talent! ...

Half the songs on this CD are about the same overused themes that plague modern music. This is nothing like my favorite CD, Volume three, being so heavy it gets old real fast.Shocking to say that the only good song on this Cd \\"Left Behind\\" is one of the best ever on a cd filled with poor punchlines, bad vocals, machoish phrases, and everything rhymes (Which gets old very fast.)

But the other day I was thumbing through one of my CD Books and decided to give this one a listen just because I haven't in so long. I then released that this was a bad CD, Almost every song on here is quit honestly the worst musicianship I've ever seen. It sounds like Corey Taylor and his masked buds went out in the woods and recorded a grizzly bear attacking some yack, Then put in a one chord thump with the distortion so high you cant tell what is going on. Give \\"People=Shit\\" a listen, You will see what I mean. For about two minutes you dont even know whats going on.My honest opinion is the only reason people listen is that its the anthem for a false sub-culture(the goths) the only band they can really call their own. Thats the only way these losers will ever sell another CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLIPKNOT DOES IT AGAIN","review":"This cd isn't as good as the first but still great.

Buy this cd!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed attempt at industrial death","review":"Well if you closely listen to this album you would notice similarities between Fear Factory and this album. So I knew that Slipknot tried to ripoff Fear Factory and they failed. This album tried hard to become death metal, yet the growling was weak, the drumming made no sense at all, the guitarrist are 3 guys that cant pull a decent chord. Practically all the songs sound nearly the same, the same monotone vocal, guitarring and and the same beat. Hell I criticised this album yet I still like their first and third albums, go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"is this supposed to be heavy?","review":"this CD is more like complete garbage.

Slipknot also hit it great with songs like surfacing and spit it out. So naturally, I went right out and bought IOWA. What a mistake! Slipknot has absolutely no talent what so ever. They masked this fact in their self-titled album with some nice riffs and so-so lyrics. When you listen to IOWA, this reality is blown in your ears with moans, screams, and yelling. I know this is what metal is (and I love metal), but give me a break. If I could cut a cd by screaming and cussing into the microphone, I would, but I have integrity.

Most kids will think its cool to evil like that, or will think they are hardcore since they haven't ever heard any real metal, jus limp bizkit. or perhaps they will think the masks make them a \\"scary\\" band to make their parents cringe.

Every song is incredible. and it was the last good album they made too. personally, unless they were to have mad a similar sound to Iowa, they could ahve stayed, but since they had released Vol. 3, they should have quit.

Slipknot is probably the most overrated band of all time. Yes they got some catchy songs here and there, ie People = s***, sic and eyeore. But other then that their crap. The whole mask/boiler suits stuff was a clear rip off of mushroomhead (who've been around alot longer then slipknot has) and the excess members is just plan retarted. They hardly use their dj or keyboardist and the 2 idiots that bang on beer kegs are just pointless. If they got rid of them and just had singer, bassist, 2 guitarist (mick is a fine guitar player) and a drummer (joey, who in the right style could tear s*** up) they'd be a force to reckon with.

With their second album, \\"Iowa\\", Slipknot is about to leave fake metal immitators in the dust. This is an awesome album! I think it's a lot more heavier and aggressive than the first one. It's got great guitar playing, loud drums and percusions, and great singing and yelling from the lead singer. My favorite songs are \\"People = Sh**\\", \\"The Heretic Anthem\\", \\"Left Behind\\", \\"New Abortion\\", and \\"Everything Ends\\". The bottom line is that every song on this album is great!

Hell, even the Beatles recorded heavier songs! (Helter Skelter would probably make Slipknot's heads explode, thus ridding us of one of rock's worst bands). And I'm not prejudiced toward any genre of music whatsoever- I listen to everything from John Coltrane to Otis Redding to the Beatles to AC/DC to Muddy Waters, so don't say it's because I'm \\"Anti-metal\\".

The guitar riffs are not Slayer-inspired, they're Slayer rip-offs; there is a difference. The bass and drums rattle on all on their own, rather than providing a driving backbeat.

The guitars are heavier the percussion is amazing, and the thing that draws me to this album is Corey Taylors vocals. The music is quite similar to s/t but it is obvious that they are trying to make a very heavy record. The vocals on this show that Corey Taylor is not just a deep throated screamer, songs like \\"Everything Ends\\" and \\"Left Behind\\" really show this man is a talanted singer.My only slag off about this album though is the lyrics, sure Corey Taylor is an angry man but it gets quite boring and repetitive on a lyrical point of view, singing about slitting peoples throats etc, is a bit juvenile, but otherwise a classic heavy album. Hopefully more music will head this way and we could have the beginnings of a very nice extreme music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"KillerDrums","review":"I just bought the new Slipknot CD yesterday. What a treat for a drummer. I've been playing drums for over 20 years and was blown away by the double-bass drum sound. The riffs are defintely there also. The best song is Everything Ends. The song may eventually end but Slipknot will gain many more fans with this one. People = S*** is also a strong song. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because there were quite a few songs that were a little too familiar to the first Slipknot CD.

When I heard that the Knot were coming out with a new album, I was eagerly anticipating it. It did not dissapoint.Their first album, in my opinion killed Korn as a extreme heavy band. This album kills any nu-metal band. Extremely heavy, dark, and scary, this stuff brings back memories of metal from back in the day.I am not the type of person to list each and every song and have a review for them, but each song is impressive. I rank Slipknot as one of the 2 most intense bands ever. The other band, and the first is Slayer.

I don't even know why nu metal has the word metal in it. (...) bands like Poison or motley crue are more metal than slipknot. Give me a break.

I used to love Slipknot, so I can't just get on my high horse and scream about how stupid any fan of this band is, I know the appeal, I know what the name Slipknot represents to a large number of people reading this review.A few years ago I thought Slipknot was the absolute pinnacle of aggression and honesty in music. The fact is that this music is so far from honest that it makes me sick, the rock back-beats and vocal hooks blatantly pander to an impressionable fan-base, and the attempts at heaviness totally rape the amazing accomplishments of Grind and Hardcore bands that preceded them.So here's my plea: don't buy this album until you've listened to Converge, Pig Destroyer, Breather Resist, or early ISIS.

It's darker than the first, I wouldn't say heavier or angrier but definitley darker. Great technical work on the drums by Joey, especially on Disasterpiece which is in my opinion the best song on the album. Corey's last stand as an amazing vocalist, and the last album Clown had hardly anything to do with. Ironic, but that's as far as I'll go.

This album is much more heavier than the first one, some of the riffs and the vocals are on the death metal side , I don't recall any rapping, and there is a bit less singing.

Not even close. One thing I can't stand about them is how they never give Slayer any credit for ripping them off. This isn't cutting edge music folks!! This was cool in the mid 80's. Slipknot just turns it upside down and makes it look new. You can't make death metal mainstream, not saying that this is death metal. Releasing \\"Left Behind\\" further show a bad attempt at getting more $. But then again it's RR, who need to be put out of buisness for their recent decisions. This band is a gimmick. It doesn't take 9 people to do what they do, they just aren't competent to do so. And the lyrics sound like nursery rymes. \\"If your 555 than I'm 666\\" what is that?

It isn't very heavy either, not that that's a bad thing. Not everything revolves around how heavy the music is, but i'm just saying that if you prefer heavy music over mellow music then this might not be the album for you. Although i must admit that Corey and Joey did a pretty good job on this album. And don't think that the reason i don't like this album is because they're mainstream.

I was a fan of Slipknot before the hype and one thing I loved about this band was the fact that they had more of an old school vibe and energy to their sound. If you listen to a lot of Death Metal you can hear the bands that influence them. As it looks like Pantera are ready to call it a day, I can safely say that to me Slipknot are like the new Pantera, in the sense that they did it all on their own merrit. They didn't have big record labels pushing them along and did it from the underground. Enough about that and on to Iowa. Well not a dull moment on the album. I was a little scared when I brought this that it would be more commercial, but Slipknot know all about the metal way of life. I think their age is a bonus. Well done. Where we go from here will be an interesting journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are the next Pantera!","review":"If you enjoyed Slipknot's awesome first cd, you will LOVE this one- It's just as heavy, just as intense, just as AWESOME!

Harmonies are SOMETIMES beautiful and other times a little sour. The bass guitar is inaudible in all but a few of the songs. But despite these shortcomings, the incredible energy and musical originality of Saosin comes through. Rodriguez ties everything together with an incredible performance that alone is worth the price of this DVD.As an old boomer who saw Hendrix and the Doors in person at their peaks, I have long had an appreciation for truly creative and musically talented bands.

It's also really cool to get the narration with real (I think) times/events thrown in. Toss in the guest appearances by well known actors that was so common on TV back then, and you have really great series, definitely a classic.I also do not like the pricing situation (even given the stature of the show) and the fact that they've released only part of the first season (thus only 4 stars from me) so for now, I will content myself with renting the DVD's and waiting until they are less expensive, further down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No","review":"Paramount is delivering a double slap in the face this week, splitting The Untouchables and the Streets Of San Fransisco into half season releases so they can come back and charge again for the second half.If this set does not sell well, and it shouldn't, some bonehead at Paramount will figure it's a good thing they didn't go through the expense of releasing the whole season, instead of realizing that if they released the whole season at a reasonable price it would sell a lot better.Just pass on this until they release the program the way it should be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss Of Death","review":"Upset about how expensive it is to buy this great old tv show that has been chopped up into two volumes for each season?

I don't know if it was stress or what, but I must have read the same 5 pages over and over. When I reached the destination, I just put it away. About a month ago, I was in search for a good read.. and I picked it up again. Needless to say my children and husband were neglected for the entire weekend and I finished reading one of the best books I have ever read. I was a little disappointed at the ending- thinking Ok- now what? Well, I am now about 250 pages into the Angel of Darkness-- and finding the answers. A terrific read. Bravo Caleb Carr!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, But Not Compelling","review":"A criminal psychiatrist attempts to solve a series of murders by using criminal profiling techniques popularized by FBI profilers.Horrific crimes are committed against young male prostitutes, which have received scant attention in the press. NY City's police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt, decides to look to two of his Harvard buddies to crack the case.There are too many subplots going on which detract from the story. Why so many different factions are opposed to this novel approach isn't clear. Everyone from gangsters, to former cops to puritanical censors, even JP Morgan, has something to say about the unorthodox approach being used.A good editor could have made this a fascinating case study."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Alienist","review":"After reading Harold Schecter's book about 19th century serial killer, HH Holmes (the title of the book escapes me, Depraved maybe), I really found this a facinating book. With the history of crime fighting and the real atmosphere of old New York, I completely enjoyed this rather large volume. I am not generally one that goes in for such tombs, but you will not be disappointed by sticking with it!Sara Howard is one of my all time favorite characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The trendiest and most over-rated book around","review":"Caleb Carr paints a very detailed and interesting picture of 19th century NYC with Teddy Roosevelt as mayor... But the whole murder-mystery -- the reason to read the book -- is shoddy... a mystery written by somebody who doesn't have any sense of how mysteries work,,, no suspense here... This book is most likely to be on everyone's coffee table... and it's so overrated as to be laughable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed in the condition of this book. The top of the book has mildew type stains on it and the cover edges are wrinkled. I believe the wrinkling was caused by the seller putting it in a packaging envelope that was too small so the top edge got wrinkled when it was put in the envelope or during mailing. This book is supposed to be a gift, but I hesitate to give it now. I have ordered books in the past that were rated good and I was always comfortable giving as a gift...not sure on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy hardback","review":"I hate wasting money on things that disappoint me. But in this case at least I didn't waste money on the hardback edition (I bought Kindle edition). Never one to jump on the so-called \\"New York Times Best Seller\\" (this is a good example of why) bandwagon, this book is a total loser--and I barely got into it. It's boring. Doesn't move. Too much pontificating (Hmmm? Could Caleb Carr be a politician: A person who talks a lot and says nothing?) I much agree with those who gave it one star. Those that went as high as two stars were being generous. Although I've put it in my Kindle archives, unless I find myself absolutely without anything more interesting to read I seriously doubt it will remain there as a potential read. How is it stuff like this gets published? Kindle should offer this turkey as a freebie...even at that it would be overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another no","review":"I agree with \\"Engish Teacher\\"( I am one) that this story is flat and wordy.I was attracted by the hisory and the period.

There are a lot of people who love this book. Okay. I won't criticize this. However, I was only able to perservere for about a hundred excrutiating pages, decided to skip to the tedious predictable ending and see what happened, then rushed that sucker back to the library furiously pleased that I hadn't spent hard currency on such dishwater. As dull a mystery, as boring a lump of historical detail, as paper-thin a job of characterization as I have ever seen in a best seller. Two questions remain: \\"How?\\" and \\"Why?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better as a Historical Story","review":"I enjoyed reading the Alienist, but I wouldn't describe it as a \\"mystery\\" or even a \\"thriller.\\" It is an extremely well-written story of turn-of-the-century New York -- a story which centres around a murder investigation. I found the historical aspects of the story the most interesting, as Caleb Carr's detailed descriptions bring to life the city, people's attitudes and other aspects of life 100 years ago. No surprise, as the liner notes state that he was educated as a historian, and is a native New Yorker.As for the murder investigation, although it's interesting, it's not a \\"page turner\\" story. It is a very intellectual story with bits and pieces of action. Caleb Carr doesn't manage to convey the drama of the action quite as well as he conveys the historical aspects of the story. And I found the conclusion of the story unsatisfying.I agree entirely with the 4/5 rating this book gets (to date) -- 5 for the historical part of the story, 3 for the murder investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly detailed.","review":"Love historical fiction and especially about NYC.

However, after several nights of what can best be decscribed as highschool homework-forced reading, I had to abandon this book. TOO CONTRIVED. How fortunate that Kreizler (sp ?) was able to come up with the whole suspect-profile? Then again, Delmonico's seems like a swell place to eat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alienist is a great read!","review":"A friend of mine suggested I read this book when it first came out. I borrowed the book and then never read it. I wasn't interested. A couple years later, I did. Man, did I wish I'd read it when I'd first had the chance. I usually read biographies, but this made me broaden my horizons.Carr has faithfully recreated New York City just after the turn of the 20th century. He fills his work with believable characters and action. He throws in a few historical events to allow his book to read like non-fiction and then provides us with a serial killer mystery that keeps you guessing and turning the pages.It's not War and Peace folks, but it is a darned good read. I didn't think I would like the idea of a period serial killer story with an antiquated Quincey on the job - but I did.Find time to read this book. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"enticing and entertaining","review":"If you are a reader who likes a lot of description in books, then this book is for you. With page after page of in-depth detail, you are brought in among a web of terror and truth. To see the culture of the time is just astounding. Also, being a psychological thriller, it has all the necessary components. For one thing, it makes you think. This book has an extrodinary force behind it, and also a very intelligent point. You get the mind-numbing suspence, but you also get the chance to dive deep into the subconscious. Beware when you read this because you won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"A friend loaned me the book. It was so intense, I bought a copy of my own to read it again. Since then, I have loaned it out 4 times and they've bought copies of thier own. The detail was amazing and brought out aspects of investations back then that I never would have thought about. READ IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Edged Historical Fiction","review":"Caleb Carr's superb novel \\"The Alienist\\" brings history alive by using it as the backdrop for an expertly told murder mystery. Set in New York City just before the turn of the twentieth century, the novel features such historic figures as Theodore Rossevelt and J.P. Morgan as supporting characters. Also presented are the dawn of modern psychoanalysis and the birth of the notion of the serial killer. All of this narrative fabric is expertly woven by Carr, who perfectly captures the feel of life in the Big Apple at the turn of the last century for all of its modernistic glory and all of its decadence. Anyone who loves a great mystery should read and savor this fine novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"The first hundred pages or so are very slow paced. The book picks up suddenly and it becomes very hard to put it down. Yet the ending was, very expectable, slow and ... disappointing. Never the less, I felt I was there, in New York, I thought I could smell and see everything. Great mood setting descriptions. I'm not sure what happened towards the end of the book, it's as if the author was tired of writing and out of ideas. I wished there was a twist at the end but there wasn't. The unexpected thing about this book is that it had some very funny moments. I caught myself laughing out loud in a certain train scene. It's not an easy read, not just because of the elaborately long story telling but also because of the grizzly subject matter which is told in agonizing details. Over all, I linked it very much though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The alienist :a novel(Dr.lazlo kreizler)","review":"Different than what I expected. Couldn't put it down when I started. Very good story and will try to find more books by this author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"Remarkable historic novel taking place in 1919 when Theodore Roosevelt was Police Commissioner of New York.A serial killer was loose, preying on young boy-whores in the city. Reporter Moore, Laszlo Kreitzler, renowned alienist, and their team of investigators use all the resources available to them to track down this merciless murderer. (At that time in history, those with a mental illness were called \\"alienated\\", and those who studied them were thus \\"alienists\\".)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history, very well researched, lame ending!","review":"This was my first book by Carr. He does a great job in recreating New York city just prior to the turn century. He really grabs you and takes you away. I really liked the book until the climax. It is worth reading! Now I have to debate if I want to read his next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too deep..a bit like psyc. class.","review":"Tended to drag a bit and the ending was a bit too easy. 450 pages to catch the guy and the first time they see him, it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"For lovers of mysteries, the 19th century and ideas alike","review":"This could be the pleasure of reading at its best : you are transported into another world, with all the suspense that enhances the voyage, you are learning on the history of New York City, and on psychology at the end of the 19th century. The fascinating aspect of this book is that you accompany the characters in their construction of the elusive murderer's mind to discover his whereabouts. The mystery fiction fan will relish in the many references to the genre : the characters, notably, have some typical traits and quirks habitual to the genre. Finally, The Alienist is not built on historical facts alone : Caleb Carr is also an efficient social critic, as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"hoping for a terrifying romp I found predictability.","review":"Beginning with great promise and drama at the funeral of President Teddy, I was quickly drawn into this well researched historical novel. Carr is best when he sets the mood of an East Village tenement in 1896, or sending his detectives through the horrors of Bellevue. However, his murder mystery and character development became sorrowfully predictable after a few chapters. An excellent reference for turn-of-the-century amateur NYC historians, but a disappoiting novel--in fairness, I read this book immedaitely after CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, a work hard to shine against in its dark, complex wanderings through a schismatic mind"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKED","review":"This book sucked. The style was unrhythmical, boring and academic. The plot was interesting, filled with interesting scenarios but the ending was a complete disappointment. This is the worst ending of all novels I had read. It started from being a murder horror suspense novel to a cliched mob shootout ending. Actually there was really no ending. The novel just stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting period piece","review":"I found this book to be a fine mix of plot and characterization.

But, I think that the writing is flat and dull and that the whole book is tedious. It's at least 200 pages too long. There is some excitement in the final 150 pages, but the payoff is limited at best. Its good points include describing turn of the century NYC in a way that makes life today seem glorious and hopeful. We've come a long way, and Carr does a good job making that clear. But, narrator Moore is a bore; the interesting characters --Cyrus, Stevie, the two detective brothers, Mary--are given short shrift; there is almost no spark between the characters at all.Carr is a terrific essayist and letter writer. Is that his real gift? To find out, I'd have to read a second novel and I don't know that I'm willing to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"At times good, but often dull, confused, never riveting","review":"I'd heard good things about this novel so perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. But I finished it disappointed. A good editor perhaps could have fixed this novel. At times it's laboriously slow and wastes time. The author's skill for setting and description can't make up for his short comings building a tight story.I thought it was interesting when they analyzed a letter from the killer. I liked a lot of the description of New York City at that time. I liked a trip to a small rural Massachusetts town to interview the killer's brother.I found Theodore Roosevelt's character annoying and added nothing. We have shadowy characters trying to interfere with the investigation for no particular reason.Just expected more than I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition more expensive than hardcover?!?!","review":"Amazon needs to check their pricing scheme.

Wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling read!","review":"This isn't my usual type of novel - a bit dark, and historical in setting, but it was an absolutely amazing read. I could hardly put it down. I liked the voice of the book, as well as the criminal investigation element. The Alienist is a mystery novel, rather than anything gory. A great work! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Realistic","review":"I loved this book. Outstanding and well-written historical fiction. The characters are well-developed, modern, and interesting. It was refreshing to read a historical novel where you could get involved with the characters and feel completely at ease with their \\"current\\" technology without feeling superior from your chair in the comfortable future"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating work of historical fiction","review":"Truthfully, I wasn't quite sure I was up to such a lengthy novel, but Carr did a superb job of developing and interrelating the characters and the plotlines. The details of the time period seemed quite authentic; my only criticism is that I could have done without Teddy Roosevelt actually written into the plot. Dr. Kriezler - the alienist - is a fascinating character nicely complemented by the supporting cast. I urge anyone who remotely liked this novel to give The Angel of Darkness a read. In my opinion, it equals if not surpasses The Alienist, featuring most of the same characters who take on the evil Libby Hatcher..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes fascinating, sometimes slow as glacial ice","review":"This book, i.e., its author, succeeds in doing three things: transporting the reader vividly back to New York City just before the turn-of-the-century, revealing the fact that serial killers are nothing new and captivating the reader during the last 150 pages. It was a good read (not great), that provided rich detail of NYC during the 1890s, along with explicit descriptions of the cruel manner in which the book's killer treated the victims. The story moved slowly and I found myself having to re-trace pages frequently in order to re-connect one event with a previous piece of information. I enjoyed the book and was anxious to find out who the villian (understated)was. But, I won't run out the door to pick up Carr's next one. I may walk however."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid entertainment worth the price","review":"After I finished Aeschylus' Oresteia Trilogy and Henry James' \\"The Wings of the Dove\\" I really, really needed light entertainment.

Not only was ninteenth century NY portrayed accurately, bu the actual storytelling was superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story marred by cardboard characters...","review":"A good serial-killer story in a well researched and reconstructed historical background. Too pity the characters are mere stereotypical cardbord figures more suitable for comics than for a serious novel as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poorly executed.","review":"Other than some interesting historical tidbits, the book has absolutely no appeal. After reading this book, I now hate Teddy Roosevelt; and he is the only character that leaves any impression.A note to the author: Don't write in the first person. You are not good enough to pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically accurate but fictionally lacking","review":"I was quite impressed with the historical accuracy of this book yet it was not a very good mystery. Carr felt the need to slap us in the face with each clue, explaining everything to death and over and over! I think this book would have been a lot better if the author had left a lot more of the mystery to be solved by the readers, such as why the murders occurred on Holy Days and why near water. This book will never have to be interpreted by an English class, that's for sure! I feel Carr would have profitted by acting as a consultant and letting someone else write the book. A review I read recently noted that there are no memorable lines in the book and that's a darn shame. Such a beautifully set up scene and such a wonderful chance to develop a great story but this is not done. And 500 pages...gee whiz! Say it in fewer pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, self conscious and gratuitous","review":"Carr's writing style is really a problem here. A great English teacher once told me to write a sentence, then rewrite it at least twice to make it shorter. Before he ventures into another novel I would suggest he reads a few Hemingway novels to cut the unecessary verbage out of his work. I also can't help but think that the author had visions of a movie deal in his head the whole time he was writing this book; the dialogue is very self conscious and unrealistic. Finally, the violence is way overboard - gratuitous and totally unecessary to make the story successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavily padded, amateurish, lacking characterizations","review":"It seems all too clear that Carr's main interest is in recreating life in turn-of-the-century New York City. Page after page, we are told not only what it is like outside and inside a given building, but what the building was used for 20 years, 40 years, 60 years... etc... before! Characters are undeveloped; the \\"heroes\\" are unheroic underdogs, and the \\"mystery\\" is solved by blundering, and ends in a preposterous movie-type chase and standoff... just like the next novel that followed. I managed to read it and its sequel, but I can't imagine ever re-reading either one."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the Alienist, you MUST read Scarlet Women","review":"Scarlet Women, by J.D.

It was like the author was, most of the time, just trying to prove to his audience his knowledge of turn of the century life in New York City. These facts were educational but alone they were not enough to pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another overrated bestseller","review":"Carr has obviously done his research, but he wears it on his sleeve. Creative Writing 101 would have taught him that shoveling on research or backstory is not the way to engage the reader. For example, when they first go to Delmonico's, Carr brings the story to a halt by launching into several pages of dry narrative on the history of the restaurant. He could learn a few things from historical Romance -- it's true, don't laugh. Romance writers like Penelope Williamson, and others, demonstrate how rich historical detail can be seamlessly woven into narrative and dialog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"I love history and I love the history of NYC. I tried to read this book on more than one occasion. I gave up! Ok, someone suggested I say why I did not like this book. It was slow, very slow. I never ever talk about what a book is about in my reviews, a friends mother told me years ago, never read the back of the book, look at the reviews. Than came Amazon :) Anyway, I just could not get into it, I felt the book was slow, fall asleep fast slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring, predictable waste of an intriguing premise","review":"The story itself sounds interesting: a murder mystery set in 1800s New York, featuring a variety of characters that includes Theodore Roosevelt. Unfortunately, it's presented in such a routine, pedestrian manner that one trudges through the book with little excitement. Worse, Carr's obsession with the seedier aspects is particularly grating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Dull Weekend","review":"I had the misfortune to listen to an UNabridged version of this book narrated by Jonathan Marosz for Books on Tape. It was one of the most sloppily written books I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. Marosz' droning narration gratingly served to completely intensify the amaturish writing. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot plodded like a plow horse, and the ending came straight from the comic books. The story line was just barely interesting enough to keep me struggling through the 13 cassettes. I will never listen to or read another book by this author. Edward Herrmann's abridged version of this pretentious and gratuitously gruesome book has to be an improvement. Anything to shorten the agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"dulldulldulldull","review":"For a book that i heard so much about when it was published, i was rather surprised to find how dull it was. it's an interesting subject, but the author just couldn't pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Alienist","review":"Very prompt, arrived very quickly.

I kept thinking it would get better, but it never did. From now on, when I see \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" on the cover of a novel, I'll take it as a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty calories","review":"Only the books's thorough research makes it readable. The glimpses of 1896 New York are fascinating, and Carr admirably refrains from moralizing about the slum boys whose circumstances lead them to prostitution. He has fun with the character of Theodore Roosevelt, but the crucial player, the alienist Kreizler, has no real center, and the other characters are ciphers. The climactic scene with the killer on the water tower is a huge disappointment, a washout in terms of suspense or emotional catharsis. If the author had written \\"he noised\\" instead of \\"he said\\" one more time I would have thrown this book against a wall. If you care about writing style as much as plot, the book will annoy you. If style doesn't matter and you can tolerate frequent plot doldrums, you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book","review":"I love New York and any stories that take place there, especially old New York, and I heard Caleb Carr speak recently on CSPAN and was very impressed with his knowledge of history and politics. I had picked this book up 3 times prior and just could not get into it ( this was about 3 years ago) , so after seeing him on CSPAN I thought I would try it again. I did get halfway through, but to me, his writing was dry and uninvolving. I just could not get a feel for the characters or situations. Basically I was bored. As much as I wanted to like the book I just didnt care.I would instead recommend, if you are like me and want to read more books about old New York to stick with Edith Wharton and E.L. Doctorow ( Ragtime, one of the greatest books and is historical fiction )"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz","review":"I couldn't follow it. I tried really hard to stick with it, but found it terribly boring and very hard to follow. I am sure that it was a good book, and worth it if you read the whole thing.

Tries too hard for witty repartee which makes for very tedious reading. This book could have been 1/4 the length. Needless to say, it did not hold my interest. Too wordy, too boring, and not at all clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising Premise Squandered","review":"This could have been a really fun, interesting, and unique book, but Carr blows it by constantly intruding upon the story with his lame 20th C. scolding of 19th C. mores. The characters are vehicles to let us know that Carr thinks oppressing women and minorities is bad thing. I hate it when historical novels are populated with characters from Suburban USA circa 1990. Next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A facsinating and well-researched tale!","review":"Having an interest in the \\"serial killer\\" genre, I found Mr. Carr's outstanding research to be what sets this book apart. I found insights not only into New York of the 1890s but also into the history of forensic science and psychology. Any modern day fan of Patricia Cornwell or Ann Rule would appreciate this book as a chronicle of how our society as well as the procedure for criminal investigation has progressed in the last 100 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"... I want to be Sara Howard and be part of THE TEAM ...","review":"It's a book that gives one food for thought. One really wants to enter into the story and become one of them.

Great book Mr. Carr!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely entertaining and suspensful!!!","review":"I am a little biased because I live in the Gramercy Park area and spend most evenings in the downtown area of NYC (especially Union Sq), and that is one reason why I really enjoyed this book. It was suspensful, original, the characters were interesting, and the history of NYC was great to read about. I also enjoyed all the passages where the team went into detail of who, what, where, etc. regarding the killer. I thought it was fascinating to read about how they came up with the conclusions they did. It could have been more suspensul if Mr. Carr wrote more about how the killer was stalking the team, but overall-QUITE ENJOYABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple pulp thriller aspiring to literature (no such luck)","review":"Don't be fooled by this book--Carr tries his hand at crafting prose that he obviously hopes will be considered Literature. But he flies too close to the sun, and this book is ultimately just pulp fiction and not even up to Stephen King or Ken Follett standards. Carr overeaches his ability as a writer in most of his imagery and he frequently seems to use language to impress the reader with his vocabulary. ALso not a teribbly inspired plot -- I expected a more clever wrap-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"The only reason I gave this book a three is because it seems Caleb Carr put alot of work into it.

An alienist (a contemporary term for a psychologist) joins forces with detectives and an intenerate reporter to uncover not only who is behind them but why these killings are being perpetrated. Manhattan's Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt, is a minor character here. I was swept up in this novel and read it in a weekend in 1995, taking it to the most appropriate setting I could think of, Spring Grove Cemetery, to read and scarcely doing anything else until I had reached the last page. A fine, fun, addictive sort of psychological crime story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and best","review":"Caleb Carr's introduction to his motley crew of detectives is truly better than his later work, \\"Angel of Darkness.\\" I found his descriptions of old New York thrilling and mesmerizing. Teddy Roosevelt as Cheif of Police--what a wonderful character! Kreisler, Moore, Steevie, Cyrus, and the awful, sad Beacham--you too will be engrossed by these people. Carr's nrrative style is somewhat choppy at times, otherwise this would rate 5 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written and enthralling","review":"I remembered seeing many copies of this book toted by people a few years back, and finally gave it a whirl. I'm pleased I did - it was written with the precision of a master, but yet not in a snobbish, show-off style. The characters are endearing and realistic and the historical aspects are excellent. The plot is truly gripping and the style of the investigation is much deeper than the usual \\"question and hunt\\". Carr is a master and I'm already more than halfway through the sequel to this, \\"The Angel of Darkness\\". Don't miss either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing!","review":"The characters seemed to come to life as I kept turning pages. Following the development of the story through the eyes of John Moore made it more approachable. Despite the murders description's crudeness, which proved to be a little disturbing at times, every chapter entices the reader into knowing what's happening next. I particularly liked the fact that the main characters weren't superheroes in any way. They were pictured as common people with the desire to acquire the knowledge that will lead them into catching the criminal. People with interesting abilities and flaws. The answers to the reader's many questions are revealed in the right way: not too slow nor too fast, everything unveils at just the right time. I also enjoyed the author's narrative style. He was careful not to get lost in endless descriptions, instead he gives enough information to provide each scenario with the right atmosphere. All in all, an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read","review":"Caleb Carr is amazing, writing my most favorite book I have ever read. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book that you will never be able to put down. Take a day out of work. You will need this as you will want to read this from cover to cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Look At American History","review":"For those of us who love a good story, especially set within a physical location as well as an historical construct--this is for you. You are confronted with many views of a murderer. You come to know about the person through observation, empirical data, and through the victim's family experiences. The familiar landmarks of NYC as well as some of the significant personalities play strong roles in the storytelling. Warning -- the focal character is a torturer and killer of children, which is the least of the depravity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the Era","review":"I'm a huge fan of historical fiction - and as an author myself I know what it takes to do enough research to accurately capture a specific place in a specific time period. This author does it admirably. The author (to his credit) took the time to slowly build the story and the characters until I felt like 1) I was in New York of the 1900s, and I knew the characters well. Whether you're a fan of the mystery novel, the thriller, historical fiction, the whodunnit, or human psychology, give this novel a read - it's well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRAWN OUT, DULL & BORING","review":"This was simply the kind of book you could very easily put down. It took over a year (and some serious \\"stick-with-it-ness\\") to finish this book. Carr does a great job of presenting historical New York, but for a mystery/thriller I found it to be slow paced and uncaptivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction at it's best!","review":"The other reviews listed really get into the plot of the story, so I'll stay away from that! What an engaging read. I was amazed at the truthfulness of the historical setting, the development of the characters was phenomenal, and Mr. Carr entranced me with his writing! I felt as if I was a member of their little group trying to discover the answers to their mystery. I had a really tough time putting this book down...I had to find out what happened next. I had to get all of Carr's other books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of filler and fluff...not as good as The Alienist","review":"As my brief line says, this book was full of paragraphs to skip over, repeated themes and overexplanation. It felt like a follow-up book that wasn't well planned or executed. I was glad when I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a dreadful experience.","review":"At the outset this book was a smorgasbord of rich, turn of the century language, with a touch of history for spice. At the description of the first crime, the horrible mutilation of a young male prostitute, the book went downhill with incredible speed. The language lost it richness, the character's values shifted from turn of the century to contemporary and the mean side of the poorest areas of New York came to dominate a really dreary story."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, Not Great","review":"I can't confirm the plaudits that have followed this book. It has an interesting hook, putting the modern notion of \\"profiling\\" into the ahistorical context of 1896. And the references to old New York piqued my interest and made me drag out my copy of Scorsese's \\"Gangs of New York.\\" But overall, The Alienist read like a mediocre Hollywood psychological thriller.Frankly I am amazed it has not yet been made into a film as it would perfectly play on the big screen. A pitch must have already been made: \\"All right, get this. It's like Silence of the Lambs crossed with Gangs of New York. A psychologist with revolutionary ideas - I'm thinking Johnny Depp - assembles a team of amateur detectives to catch a Jack the Ripper clone in New York in 1896. And it has Teddy Roosevelt in it!\\"Not that any of the modern teenage audience would know who Teddy Roosevelt was.It's ok. Just nothing incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"raised indian and killing young boys","review":"the subject matter revolving the serial killer in this book is a tough one to read thru but also one that you find tough to put donw. my carr's writing style is engrossing and his use of historical references to ny in the late 1800's is interesting. a great read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness in the Gilded Era","review":"You are irresistibly drawn into this book, especially if you are a fan of murder mysteries, New York history, psychological thrillers, crime fiction or all of the above. Caleb Carr is one of the few writers to tackle late 19th century New York culture and crime with convincing authority. As dark, dangerous, and alluring as any of the dives he describes."},{"rating":"2","title":"this has to have been one of the best books ive ever read","review":"my teacher used this book as an example of a tenement building in ny at the turn of the century and it was very good. i then bought the book and couldnt put it down altho it can get alittle too discriptive at times its a really good book that you can totally get into it only took me 3 days to read this becuz i couldnt put it down. i have recommended it to many of my friends and after lending it to a few its become quite worn(that shows that its good). there is a sequel bout a woman killer but from what i hear it isnt the greatest and the first is much better. so if u like historical fiction this is the book for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing!","review":"Consider this cd as state's exhibit #1 that there was a cool alternative to the Jackson 5 and Osmond Brothers for kids back in 1971. Produced by their father and sold locally somewhere in Oklahoma back in the day, 10 year old Harold Moore, \\"Jr.\\", (wah wah guitar) and his 3 sisters (percussion and wah wah organ) pound out funky instrumentals and sing cool songs with nearly unintelligble lyrics like Mama, Like Tequila in their own initimable style (go for broke). Listening to the disc makes me wonder what became of the group, as there are no detailed liner notes to speak of for the album.This disc complements the garage punk music of the day and today quite nicely - you won't be disappointed if you pick it up (while not easy to find, there are deals out there for this outside of Amazon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darned cute.","review":"I bought the book for one specific pattern, a grass-green baby blanket with fluffy Berroco \\"Plush\\" sheep grazing on it.

I am thrilled with how it turned out, and so is the recipient, her baby, and everyone else who sees it. The rest of the patterns in the book appear to be clear and well-written too. However, if I never make another thing from this book, I will consider the price well worth it for just that one pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"what does 40 inches mean ???","review":"I ordered this product because it was supposed to be for a 40 inch waist.However its really only 32-33 inches long. How Squeem marks their products is a mystery. But it is not by any method I know of. I bought an earlier item from the Squeem product line, and it was too big. It seems they just put any old size number on whatever comes down the assembly line, regardless of what it is. Buyer beware with this companies products... they are good quality; but its anyone guess what size you will get.By the way: Im still waiting for amazon to refund the purchase price of this item.

It's not an easy topic to put in book form, I guess. If I had started with the video, I probably would've gotten it faster. I also wish she'd have picked easier names for some of the exercises. Call me clueless, but I'm not going to easily remember what the heck Lick of the Cow's Tongue is with a name like that. The main complaint I have about this book is the insistence on using stud chains. If you have a properly halter trained horse (or a really sensitive one), you should never need to use one. I have a wary Spanish Mustang rescue mare who'd charge into the next county if I even attempted to use a stud chain on her (and she's the one that I got this book for)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dating book","review":"A friend loaned me this book when I was single and I could not have been more thankful to her!

By making fun of opposing viewpoints, dismissing them without logically arguing against them, or simply stating his views without giving reasons, anyone who doesn't already agree with the author would be quickly alienated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Commandments","review":"The Ten Commandments of Dating is a list of practical dating rules, that the authors claim will provide \\"a greater depth of peace, love, and fulfilment in your own life and in your relationships\\" (Intro). The book is written by unashamedly Christian authors with an unashamedly Christian viewpoint. The book is intended for those who are dating, in order to help them make the right decision regarding marriage, and also obviously for single people who are considering possible suitors.The authors necessarily cover off on some deep issues with a broad brush and categorise complex behavioural ideas with short lists, but that is inevitable when writing a book on a topic like this (Other books have the same issues: See some of my other reviews). I found the majority of the advice in the book to be practical, sound and helpful and so I'll give this 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ten Commandments of Dating","review":"Excellent book for all ages, but directed at our young people. I urge any parent out there with children that are about to start dating or even if they have been dating for awhile you must buy this both for both him and her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"Like some other reviewers, I didn't realise the book would be full of religious overtones, so this was extremely off putting - the back of the book mentions nothing about religion, so it's a bit misleading. Yes, like someone else said, the title could have been a clue - but it didn't click with me.I did decide to give the book a chance despite this, but I stopped reading when the author advised against \\"exotic relationships\\". I couldn't believe that in this day and age someone is espousing such rubbish. He thinks your relationship has a better chance of working if you are of the same cultural background - very closed minded and verging on racist.Luckily I didn't pay much for the book, because I threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware of the religious overtone of the book","review":"The principles themselves are quite good. However, the context of the book is over-religious. Every other page, it would mention the name of god. For an atheist, it undermined the values of the principles themselves. And I felt that the summary or reviews should reflect the religious overtone so that people are not surprised by it.Some of the principles, even though it may work for a minor population, seems a bit unrealistic, such as waiting until marriage for sex. Finding out about sexual compatibility is an important aspect as the book has indicated that physical compatibility is important. I could see the value of not letting hormonal and emotional influences guide one's judgment. However, the extreme stance perfectly contradicts the discovery of physical compatibility in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"should of realized...","review":"... by the title that it would be religiously based, but i thought it was merely a clever title. if you don't want to read about how God influences things, then don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for quality young people!","review":"I had to read this book, the 10 Commandments of Dating, for a college psychology class recently, and it was such a good use of my time! The authors don't beat around the bush--they say it like it is, which makes for a very insightful and comical read. If every person my age would read this book, I think there would be a lot less broken hearts, before AND after marriage. Find out for yourself! I am certainly putting the commandments to use already."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better dating books out there","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It has some generally good advice, but I found it overly simplistic and the tone of the book annoyed me--I found it a little condescending and too rule-based, but perhaps that was just me. It is after all, called the Ten Commandments! The major concepts are helpful, but there are other dating books that cover similar material on a deeper level and from a more nuanced perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Rockers Free Range Chicken CD","review":"This is an overall great CD. The country rockers mix rock and country with their unusual talent that is rarely seen in many bands today. The whole CD is great if you like this kind of music.

She is a great woman of God. Plus teen girls love her! it's hard not too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life & Remembrance","review":"This is a beautifully written book with unforgettable characters and an unforgettable setting, in post-communist Poland. The feel of the novel is in fact much more ancient than it was meant to be but that perhaps proves the prevalence of the past in our present and future, and why this is important and inescapable. Powers' novel on revelation and discovery and guilt is explored not only on the macro level -- that of the village, but also on an individual level. The weaving of the storyline and interactions of the different strands and ideas in the novel is intoxicating. I couldn't put down the book nor leave the world of this village which has to embark on a trip of self-examination, and eventually, recovery. It is refreshing that the holocaust is dealt with in non-fiction, and this novel is similar to \\"Stones from the River\\" though more superior. Poignant, moving and unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Memory of the Forest","review":"This is an excellent novel with a hugely important and significant historical validity. It's a bit slow to get going, but once into the story, you can't put the book down, and it has an amazing ending. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"History, memory, identity","review":"Superbly written, _In the Memory of the Forest_ is a powerfully haunting exploration of the dangerous consequences of suppressing painful memories, both individual and collective. I especially appreciated how Powers takes time to build his story carefully. The novel takes on the deliberate pace of history itself: each character is convincingly layered, just as the identity of a village, or a person, or a family, is also constructed over time, an accretion of interwoven layers of secrets, fears, loves, evils. A richly engrossing work that deserves to be widely read and discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appealing and engrossing read","review":"One of those rare occasions when my both my partner and I read this book one after the other - she is a PD James fan, Charles Dickens fan - whereas I tend to read those books less dependent on plot and more on philosophical meanderings, or rich in atmosphere, or completely character driven - Fateless or Old Masters say. In The Memory of the Forest has all the elements and so it appeals equally to us both. One of the great moral questions in the novel of course concerns the old dictum \\"evil thrives when good men do nothing\\". As such things as racism will always be latent wherever humans gather, it depends on the rule of law and the vigilance of citizens, to maintain civil life. And the life of a Polish village is at the centre of the story - if the village can survive, maybe humanity will too, but at what cost?A very well written novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully refined performances throughout.","review":"I found this CD an absolute delight! From opening to closing measure of each piece, the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Antoni Wit, give beautifully refined and idiomatic performances. Tempi tend to be little more laid back than in other versions I've heard, but this more than compensated for by the nicely rustic, Slavonic character with which the music is played. The CD's sound is superb throughout, aided greatly by the warm and resonant acoustics of the Concert Hall of the Polish Radio, where this recording was made. Aficionados of Antonin Dvorak's music will find this a most enjoyable listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-Divas","review":"The Bluebelles sing wonderfully in this CD. I was shocked to find Sarah doing the lead vocals. Patti belts out her soulful renditions or \\"Where Are You\\" and \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" in her sweet, teenage voice. You can sense the future diva that would soon flourish from this little girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited, yet suprisingly so","review":"Dashing any ephemeral streaks of insightful work with skull-numbingly, hyper-actively repetitive drum-and-bass noise applications, this particular project yields little more then a one dimensional horror-speed gimmick, though there are just enough fleeting moments of compelling material that makes you know Plotkin can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Fahey's playing is astonishing as always, but what makes this a great album (I still have the cassette) is the power of the music to evoke the hurtling, massive locomotives, the railyards, the whistles in the deep night, the one-of-a-kind moods and experiences belonging to the now-vanished railroad era from which arose the folksongs that inspired him. He leaves nothing unsaid. A mark of his great originality is that he devoted a whole album (and how many years of developing it?) to this fascinating set of tone poems for guitar. Why on earth is this great music not more widely available?"},{"rating":"2","title":"They use it in my son's Kindergarten class...","review":"They use it in my son's Kindergarten class, which is why I ordered it for his birthday. The pictures are crisp clear colorful and interesting. He loves sitting and looking at it and looking up words (and I never would have thought he'd be such a book worm!). There are a few words that he wanted to look up that were not in there...cheetah, for intance. But it is a good starter dictionary and since we have 3 children, I am sure it will get passed down even if he moves on to something more complex quicker than we thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dino Felipe - Xanaconversex","review":"Dino Felipe's XANACONVERSEX features a blue-skinned video-game-playing mutant on the cover--and, yeah, that's pretty much what it sounds like, too. There's blippery aplenty on \\"Slutt Petal (2 Crunch).\\" \\"Plunk Extend\\" is two minutes of rhythmic chaos, while \\"Strictly Genericize\\" is its melodic equivalent. \\"Pinky\\" starts making a little more sense, but there's way too much noise-for-noise's-sake and not enough consideration to the tracks. The album seems as if it were tossed-off to fulfill a contractual obligation. \\"Butterfri\\" shows Felipe a bit more focused, and it works much better than the short tracks. Even \\"Sexual Boats (Guitar Floats),\\" at three minutes, has some semblance of actual song structure. So perhaps it's better to think of this as an EP with 4 real tracks--since it clocks in just over 25 minutes--and plenty of filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best singing bowl musician.","review":"Rainer Tillman creates the most amazing music. The songs are deeply soothing (not for driving), excellent for meditation or relaxation. I don't know how this secret continues to be kept. The 'Seven Metals: Singing Bowls of Tibet', a best seller on new age charts, comes close, but both of Rainer's 'Sounds of the Planets' CD's are better. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could happen ...","review":"What struck me the most about this film is the fact that the story line is so believable. Two ordinary guys, one married the other engaged are about to go into business together and in their quest for funding one of them runs into an old friend who they immediately pitch their plan to. The acquaintance listens promising to get back to them which he does, the only problem is that his terms are outrageous at which time the partners find out that they are now dealing with the Russian mob.

I personally thought that it was a little difficult (and I hate to say it, but stupid) to build things. My house and workshop looked weird- nothing how I would have liked to build them. Then the mayor told me to put a chair together and I had had enough, this is when I hit the power button. Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, but I don't really want to.

If you're older than that, do not bother. It is too easy, boring, and nothing like the Sims like the name suggests. Here's how the game goes: Talk to a character who tells you to build something, easily collect materials, and build it by matching shapes. Even the shape matching is no challenge because it lights up which pieces go where. I'm disappointed and glad I only rented it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the cuteness!","review":"I simply LOVE this game! Unlike the regular Sims, in which you have to make sure they're fed or else they'll fall where they stand, you just have fun meeting the new people that come into town, and I love their reactions when you decorate things to their liking!The characters are very cute, and I wish I could hug them (odd, I know, but I have a weakness for cute at times), and it's fun to build all the houses, furniture, and whatever they need. That's the main thing that's different from the Sims. Other than the fact that it might slow up after hours and hours of play (played for over 6 hrs. once), it's a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than I thought it was going to be","review":"We bought this for our 10 year old son to play.

Originally created for younger kids, my husband and I both found this game to be fun too. You are hired to rebuild a town. As you build more and more sims will come to live and you get to build them houses, furniture, etc. You can play the game over and over and can build different each time, so it doesn't get boring! I love the cute characters and their little 'simish' language! You can make them interact together and discover tons of little bonus things. I highly recommend this game to families with children 6 and up and adults.We borrowed it from a friend and will definitely be buying ourselves a copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun if you are a child?? Maybe??","review":"Prior to purchasing My Sims I had received My Sims Kingdom which I really enjoyed playing. I was highly disappointed in My Sims when I began playing it. The game seems to be really amateurish and not nearly as developed as My Sims Kingdom which has come a long way since My Sims. The game takes an incredible time to load which it does frequently, including every time you go in or out of a building. It is a very time consuming game because everything takes a loooong time to do, and it really shouldn't be such a long process.I do not recommend this game. If you like the Sims, buy Sims My Kingdom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly addictive!","review":"The game is very addictive will lots to do. You can spend endless hours building house, performing tasks or interacting with other Sims. My only complain: the lag time between actions. The game could have been designed better to avoid that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simszzzzzzzzz","review":"I bought this for my wife, expecting the same sort of game play as Sims and Sims 2 or perhaps SimCity. Boy were we disappointed.Game play is simple to the point of pointlessness. Loading screens abound and get longer the longer you play. In build mode, the challenge is mainly how to get the controller to put the piece where you want it. At first, I thought there was a hardware problem, as the screens bogged and the cd drive began to make lots of noise.As others have stated, multiplayer and some way to save and trade your designs could have made this a better product. Judging by the way it chugs and bogs down, we may be asking too much from this title already.The worst aspect is that you are essentially a one-person factory for your town. It would not be so bad, if only all this building had a point. I have played it up to 3 1/2 stars, and I am done with it. My wife didn't even get past 2. She says it puts her to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good, but then it's boring","review":"I first got this game when we rented it from hollywood video. I played it forever. My mom had to force me to stop and eat dinner. After about two days of costant playing, I got bored with it and never played it again.

But even if you do, rent it first, just to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A Sims-Style Game","review":"If you are looking for a suitable alternative to The Sims, look elsewhere! Sims-style games should be open-ended, with no real \\"point\\" other than simulation of life. This game is basically an RPG in sims' clothing - you are assigned tasks (read: quests) by various members of the town, with the overall goal of rebuilding a town that has been abandoned. There is no other way to play this game. The load screens take ages (and pop up for everything, even leaving a building). This might be a good game for tiny small children, but for an adult looking for something like The Sims... not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting and fun, but it loses a star for the load screens","review":"I love this game, but hate the load screens. It also bogs down after awhile of playing it.... All that aside, it's a great game. We rented Sims Castaways and didn't like the fact that you couldn't save more than one game at a time......I like the concept of building things in this game. One task I had to do was build a Refrigerator and infuse it with 10 \\"essences\\" of bacon...mmmmm Bacon... It gets challenging trying to build a 3 block sink but having to use 20 essences of Rainbow Trout...(for those confused by the term essence, they are the spirit of things you find that you can infuse into the items you build.). It's alot like Animal Crossing (one we've rented and loved and will buy) but I wish it loaded the next screen, etc like Animal Crossing did. All in all a fun game that is appropriate for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the \\"dark\\" tone?","review":"This is a well designed game that seems designed for young children.

I saw a video review, some gameplay and it peaked my interest. I really enjoy Animal Crossing, and expected this game would be the same. Some folks had compared the two. The first thing I noticed was incredibly long load screens, and so frequent, it became annoying pretty fast. I can't accurately say if that gets any better as the game goes on. It was just too frustrating, and I really couldn't get into the game itself.Again, my review is based on first impression, and very little play. I don't plan on keeping the game.

The singing overall is pretty good considering the size of the ensemble (200 voices--none of these works were intended for a choir of this size! ). The diction is good, but the tempi are sometimes too slow and rhythmic (which is uncharacteristic of Russian Church Music). The soloists, unfortunately, need help.

Not me, until I read this book. Now I want to see Valentino's films. What sets this book apart from others is the authors's comments, always on target and usually funny.

It is written in a style that simply slows down my reading, frequently having to go back and figure out what phrase was modifying what or wondering who/what the author was talking about. The author is very opinionated, although he seldoms shows the basis of these opinions. Rabbit trails are everywhere. I am still trudging through the turgid prose, which probably would have benefitted from an editor's closer reading before it was published, but I wouldn't reccommend it to friends. Ferguson lost me when he spoke of the \\"enormity of [Montgomery Clift's] talent.\\" Yes, Virginia, he was very talented, but was he really evil?Just because something is about gay people and probably by a gay person, it still has to follow rules of grammar and content to be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Thought","review":"My holistic vet recommended this dry food for my cat, despite it being intended for dogs.

Edward P. Wilson was, unfortunately, one of those who dealt with him and got rich on million dollar weapons deals tainted with the dictator's blood or the blood of his victims. Maas does a very good job in bringing to the reader the nefarious activities of Wilson against a background of legitimacy as these activities were filled with the involvement of former CIA associates and employees. Wilson finally meets his match in a dedicated US attorney. Maas is certainly very good in retelling the narrative including realistic dialog of the various characters involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serve its purpose","review":"I bought this one becuase my feet usually became cold during the winter.

It manages to infuse the humor, warmth, and personality of each dog into an easy to read poetic text. The font changes and the varying format for the text (from rolling across the page to short staccato sentences), as well as the dogs names, easily invites each dog to be read in a different voice. Even tho the dog breeds may not be named, the beautiful paintings make identification easy.

I threw the pan out yesterday after the nonstick was peeling off in chunks. I never used metal cookware in this pan. I used my silicone or plastic cooking utensils.As to the thin pan. This pan is a lightweight pan that heats up quickly. It does not have a heavy bottom so food could scorch.The only nifty feature about this pan was the strain and pour.

Not one dish was broken or chipped. I purchased the Nuance dishes for my new house.

I have 12 settings- plates, bowls, cups, and other pieces also. However, I owned them only a few weeks when I got the first chip in a plate. Now, 3 years later, almost every single piece has atleast one chip. They chip SO easily- its terrible. We are very careful with them- it doesnt matter though.

We enjoy looking at the pictures and he loves to hear the poems. In fact, the poem called \\"I am boom!\\" the thunder dragon has made him a little less frightened of thunderstorms.

It took off at full speed, the cord wrapped around the paddle trigger, preventing it from turning off, and the whole mess jerked from my grasp and wrapped itself around my left hand. When I was finally able to unplug it, I was amazed to find that my first two fingers were only badly bruised and not broken. I would have said that what it managed to do to me was impossible. Wrong.

While running in a screw, I stripped out the gears and now have a tool that will cost as much to repair as it will to replace. Also the paddle switch is not very well designed, for a drill that is intended for cramped spaces I would expect something that was less prone to getting bumped or caught up, also the drill continues to spin long after you let off the paddle.

After using this light duty drill a few times, the gears started to slip. A few more times and the drill was useless. I do not abuse my tools and as others have noted, these gears are very, very light duty. Further, the paddle handle location and bit changes are just asking for a chuck key rip into your palm if the tool is plugged in. If you have this tool, UNPLUG it when changing or removing bits.

I called the factory and they took care of this no charge. Within 3 months of use this one burned off again. I don't consider this abnormal use and called them again.

It would be more useful as refresher material for those with prior knowledge, or as a refference source.For beginners I would recommend either books by;Masaaki Kotabe 'Global Marketing Management' orWarren J. Keegan 'Global Marketing Management'."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Show","review":"While I am disappointed that once again this season is split up into two volumes just like season three, I am just glad that they are continuing to make the show available on DVD.In my opinion, it's not the number of episodes that are in the set that counts; it's the episodes themselves and the messages that they deliver. I purchased this because this show was my favorite when it was on. I made sure to tape it if I was going to be away when a new episode aired. I even watched reruns of it on PAX for a while.So even though yes, it is split up, it is still here to purchase and when volume two of this season comes out, you can bet that I'll be buying that as well.I highly recommend this to any fan of TBAA.

While the general aspect of the storylines are unchanged from the series origin, the acting and character development keeps getting better. There is real chemistry developing in the fourth season and the writers are making good use of the dynamics. The series continues to address the issues of life faced in common by mankind and present a picture of God's grace and mercy that will likely get a thumbs up in Heaven. Too bad the series was discontinued. The question remains, what needs to happen to get the rest of the series on DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good family entertainment","review":"Its a shame when we have over 250 channels and the only good family enetertainment is on dvd.

They cheered me up during hard times (adolescence is always hard it seems without adding anything else) and the stories are very soap opera like. The messages are good, the episodes are well-written. The guest actors are not always the best but for the most part they find good people. Great for if you need cheering up, fun even if you don't. I wish they would put the whole season in one box and throw in some special features. Quite a number of explosions and fire for a show about angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately worth buying!","review":"Lately, I haven't been getting great trance stuff. MOst of them were average or above average but not \\"perfect\\". I was at a music store in the mall yesterday and I was looking around the techno section. I was looking for the first Chicane cd but that wasn't there so I decided to buy something else. I saw this cd and I remembered how much I loved the song Exodus (Fire & ice Mix). There wasn't really anything else that caught my eye so I decided to go with this. I wasn't expecting it to be anything amazing because whenever I buy cds, where I only hear one song before buying it, it usually turns out bad. I was wrong about this one though, almost every song is amazing and I am really glad I bought this cd. My favorite song is Catch (Matt Darey Mix). If only you're into hard house/trance, then it's possible that you won't like it.

But I received it and heard something other than the Ruins - Burning Stone I know and love -- this a different Ruins CD, Stonehenge. DO NOT buy this. Since I opened I could not return it. So I smashed it. If you have ANY sense of decency -- DO NOT buy this CD as it is NOT what it claims to be. Save your money up and buy the Japanese import instead. It will be worth it as you will be able to hear the REAL Burning Stone (it is worth if only for the song \\"Praha In Spring\\") -- not Some American's idea of Burning Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just to clear up some confusion...","review":"The track listing in the 1999 Shimmy Disc reissue (Shimmy-057) differs from the Japanese import. In addition there are only 13 tracks listed, although there are 15 on the CD! The unlisted tracks are:Dapp (3:30)Shostak Ombrich (3:12)So this reissue is essentially the same as the import, but in a different track order.

The book is made out of thick, unattractive vinyl, and the 'sleeves' inside are thick and look like a cheap way to store business cards. What comes to mind when I look at it is a vinyl map holder.

It is misrepresented as a Ovation Applause Tenor Ukulele/Mandolin case for the Tenor Ovation uke. Additionally contributing to the problem is that the dimensions for the uke and the case are backwards. The uke is a little longer than 29 inches and the case is about 27.5 inches.When they say customers buy the uke and the case together those customers are buying the case for something else. If they are buying it for a Tenor Ovation Applause Ukulele the uke will STICK OUT OF THE BAG by +1.5 inches (And yes I am a bit annoyed.)I'm returning the case and need to find a suitable one for the Tenor uke still.

My laptop speaker sounds better than these do. Zero bass. For travel use, you're far better off with headphones. For home use, you're far better off with the kind of aftermarket speakers that are AC-powered and readily available for desktop computers. I recognize that getting bass sound off of batteries is a challenge, but this attempt by Sony shouldn't have been brought to market. About the only positive thing I can say is that the jack fits my iPod Shuffle without an adapter.

I find Deborah Madison to be a good observer, and the subject matter benefits from her keen eye--and ear. She certainly finds creative ways to exploit the typical farmer's market fare. The only significant flaw with this book is that Ms. Madison simply tries to cover too much ground--literally and figuratively. Many of the ingredients are obviously regional in nature and availability, and are therefore beyond the reach of many readers. Still, this is a finely crafted volume and the author should be commended for elevating the subject matter to a very high level.

For the price it was a great piece of equipment. But then came the issue of service. The screws that hold the sanding base onto the unit have a tendency to come loose. If you do not keep these screws tight at all times, it tears up the base of the sander. In normal use, you don't realize the screws are loose until after you turn off the sander.

This sander is not being used commercially, but in a home shop. Yesterday the pad came off again which is what happens when thay wear out, and this time it stripped out the threads in the hole that holds it on.

McMurtry is one of the nation's greatest writers, a born storyteller with a knack for quirky characters and above all else, a deep and abiding sympathy for people, regardless of their flaws and missteps. But this book displays none of those gifts -- in fact, it reads like a mean-spirited parody of McMurtry. A few characters are flat-out cliches and stereotypes -- something almost never encountered in a McMurtry book -- while the others are grating collections of a few endlessly recycled tics. The plot, such as it is, veers randomly between dull and meandering and simply unbelievable. This is a sequel to The Desert Rose, which is one of McMurtry's decidedly lesser books, but compared to this one The Desert Rose feels like Terms of Endearment. Fifty years from now The Late Child will be the McMurtry book that only gets reprinted in a scholarly edition for completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst Book, Period","review":"Frankly, I couldn't believe that McMurtry wrote this. I was so excited to see a sequel to The Desert Rose- it could have been great. The only interesting character in the entire (long) book is Harmony's son- and after awhile I even found him to be annoying. And come on- the dog jumped off the Statue of Liberty and lived? McMurtry made a name for himself by writing about reality- maybe he should stick to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a lot better","review":"This is the worst McMurtry yet.

This book is a perfect example of how McMurtry is the antidote to the Dr. Laura-style judgementalism which permeates our culture. In this book, McMurtry collects flawed folks, eloquently and humorously describes their mistakes and insecurities, then loves them anyway. When I'm in an over-critical mood, reading a McMurtry book is just the attitude adjustment I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique + great","review":"Some may be disppointed by the differences between this and some older McMurtry books, but I found a couple important things in common:- the book drew me in, kept my attention, and was entertaining throughout- there were some great characters (Harmony, her son Eddie, and her father) along with some other unusual but mostly interesting onesI had really liked The Desert Rose (the first of this 2 book series) but I even enjoyed this book more. At the end I hated to be done reading about these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"McMurty slips in this one.","review":"I usually have big fun reading LMcM's novels, but this one fell far short of the mark. I guess I really prefer his novels set in the old West and other action fare.Most of the characters just wore me out. Sort of wanted to slap them. Pretty silly in spots. And, how can a bunch of adults be bossed around by a five year of kid. The dog jumping off the Statue of Liberty and living was another aspect that was hard to accept. Thinking back, it's hard to come up with a character I could really care about.On the plus side, it was a fast read and the usual interesting McMurtry dialog was always present.Mr. McMurtry has given me so much reading pleasure in the past that I will still await his future offerings.

The Bosch cost twice as much, and became nonfunctioinal after little use, while the Ryobi model withstood heavy use for years. There was so much friction on the carbon pad, that it heated up painfully. The sander started breaking belts for no apparent reason. The dust collection on the Ryobi was not good, but it was totally nonfunctional on the Bosch.I have been satisfied with the Bosch routers (1613,1617), but their sanders, both belt and ROS, have not worked well for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sander - used to sand a deck","review":"I really like this sander and have used it to sand a modest size deck (9' x 20') - lots of sanding belts but the sander was flawless.

I have used this upside down which was an unexpected feature based on its flat top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Designed","review":"It is always a pleasure to use a well designed product. The 1274DVS is such a product. The belt change is a snap; pull thelever back, install the belt, push the lever back. Belt trackingadjustment is easy and stays put. The front grip comes off andallows sanding in tight places. I have developed \\"tennis elbow\\" and this sander's light weight helps: 7lbs vs. PC's highly ratedweight of 13. When you use a sander vertically or overhead, thatmakes a big difference. The speed control is simple to adjust, and is variable by the amount of tension placed on the trigger.Even if you have it set to max speed, by not pulling the triggerall the way, the speed will be less than max. The sander is madein Switzerland, and this has to be better than China.This sander felt great out of the box, sands flat and I highlyrecommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent sander","review":"I bought this sander after trying the Dewalt and having it die in about 15min of work. After researching other sanders, I discovered B&D; owns Porter-Cable and Delta, along with Dewalt. Since every B&D; tool I have ever purchased failed, I am hesitant to give B&D; my money.I chose the Bosch after comparing with its twin, the Ryobi BE321. The sander is well balanced and comfortable in your hands. It took a little getting used the \\"brick\\" design, but The egornomics are great. It has the power to get the job done. The dust colletion is average. Afterall, it is a belt sander!I would recommend this sander to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a little off the top","review":"I'll be honest, this is my first belt sander, but I love it. I took the recommendation of some of the other reviewers, and I couldn't agree more. The sander is easy to use out of the box, and is a smooth-running, well-designed tool. The variable speed switch is very nice, and adds considerably to the user's control. I haven't yet done any heavy duty sanding, but for finish work the dust collection seems to work well. Five stars for Bosch on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Update and solution to dust collector issue","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that the dust collection system is poor. Mine keeps coming off and frankly, it gets in the way. I beleive I have come up with a good solution. I have a Porter-Cable finish sander #333vs and it has a unique dust collection system. Called a sand trap, it is a porus cup that works quite well, collecting even the finest sandings. I purchased a spare cup for [$$$] and mounted it on the 1274 with a 1 inch piece of plastic tubing and a clamp. It seems to work perfectly. I'll advise after I use it a month or so. You can buy the sand trap from Porter Cable direct by calling technical services listed on their web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the sander, but no case?","review":"Great sander. Bosch obviously put a lot of thought into the design. However, I was bummed no case came with it, and none appears available. Without a case the dust collection bag gets banged up or caught on other tools. I'm in the process of trying to find another brand of case to fit this unit in. Come on Bosch, use a little comon sense and include a case."},{"rating":"2","title":"5++ Stars The Best!","review":"This is an extremely well-designed and well-built sander.

I recommend staying away from this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Belt Sander","review":"This is the only belt sander I know of with an absolutely flat platten (belt support). That plus the light weight and excellent speed control make it a great choice for cabinet faces, shelving and smoothing dutchman patches. While sanding a crown out of a 3/4\\" particleboard floor, I did find that I had to use a lower speed (probably because so much of the belt is in contact with the surface, for so long), and that this caused the handle to get hot (directly over the variable speed switch), so I would have to rest the sander. On materials that can be sanded at full speed (redwood, pine, metal), heat has not been a problem. Watch out for the cord, though. I got mine one day and bent the aluminium frame. It happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get the device to track","review":"I've hardly used this little puppy. I nicked the belt very slightly sanding a piece of aluminum, replaced the belt and it will not track properly or adjust now. I'll update this when I've called Bosch, but I've had other problems recently with a 1375a grinder, and Bosch was not very helpful.Overall this should be a great sander according to design and specs, but it seems so delicate as to be entirely unsuitable for anything other than an ornament.For now, I'm not buying another Bosch tool and I'm creating lots of colorful language when I think about the company.

The package was shipped promptly and arrived in good order and I have to say that I was impressed the first time I used it to fashion a new threshhold.

Several of my favorite tools are Bosch so we started out on good terms. However the dust collector plugged up early on and I couldn't get it to work again. Then the tracking quit adjusting. Finally it just stopped in the middle of sanding a big table top, maybe overheated? It's in the trash and I returned to my tired old Makita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best belt sander on the market.","review":"I bought the Bosch belt sander because, at the time, it had the best warranty. I planned to sand all the peeling paint off my 1 1/2 story clapboard house and repaint it. I thought that I'd go through at least two of these sanders. I bought the belts by the case and spent several weeks sanding the house. I'd run this thing until it overheated and stopped. I'd let it cool down and go at it again. To my surprise, I completed the job and the original Bosch sander was still working good as new. I later found out that this sander is good for more delicate work. I have more control and it seems to lay flatter. It eventually died (smoke poured out of the motor)and I replaced it with a Makita sander, a very robust and dependable unit. Over all, I'd prefer the Bosch for finer finishing work and ease of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tool","review":"I bought this sander to replace an older model with a non-centered motor.This tool is well balanced and having the motor over the belt makes it much easier to use and eliminates my tendancy to tip the machine and cut into the wood. It is a heavy tool and the weight works in it's favor. The belts are easily removed and installed with the single locking lever.The alignment is easy to adjust and the tool is relatively quiet. I have used it with the dust bag as well as with a vacuum hose. Dust removal is pretty good with the bag but of course the hose is 100%.The design make it easy to sand right up to a vertical wall and that has come in handy.I think this is an excellent tool for finishing large surfaces like tabletops and getting top notch results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeshop Sander","review":"This is a great sander for a homeshop that is also a great buy for industrial use. Inexpensive and agile. The belt system used on this sander makes the workpiece highly visible.

I broke or shredded 3 belts in the process and the handle got very hot. By the end the graphite pad had worn badly and also left a number of black marks on my decking. My old Dewalt 430 had none of these problems on the same type of decking.Also the sander doesn't seem wide enough. A new belt sticks out about 1/8\\" over the side and tracking adjustments don't help. Maybe this is why belts fail so fast. If I had bought this at Lowes I would already have taken it back.On the positive side it is light and compact and the dust collection works well. It's just not up to the abuse I need to be able to give a sander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe 3-4 hours run time and is just died","review":"My bosch 1274DVS has maybe 3-4 hours of use even though I have had it for 6-8 years.

And one of the women - shock, horror - had invested her hopes in her son who mysteriously disengages himself from the family. Of course I tried not to be influenced by the feminine in the message - and I have read many women writers (Anna Kavan is one of my favourite dozen writers and 'Let Me Alone' one of my top ten novels) - but I found myself trying to suppress the masculine in me, trying not to object to the way many men are portrayed in this novel.In the end there were too many tears, too many disappointments, not enough mathematics, too many twists and turns, too many identical viewpoints.

His style reminded me of two SF greats-- Octavia E. Butler and Tad Willams. Hardly faint praise.But Mosley forgot to include the one thing these two luminaries always have in their books in abundance and that is scope. The events of the book don't really seem to change anything; they only concern a handful of characters. Certainly the reader doesn't feel, as with Butler, that the fabric of society, even the nature of humanity, will be changed by the blue light. Outside the concerns of the main characters, it is business as usual for Planet Earth. While it is irkome to think of what this book could have been with a plot constructin equal to Mosley's writing talents, I have to applaud him for making the foray into science fiction. The genre definitely needs more ethnic diversity in its authors. I hope Mr. Mosley will try again-- this time with a better plot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I gave up on this book.

Unfortunately, I feel the need to warn other Mosley devotees that this is not what you are expecting. Change in and of itself is not a negative, of course, however, Blue Light is so utterly different in subject matter, structure and genre (for want of a better term) that I feel it will disappoint many.

I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Mosley of all....","review":"I have enjoyed all of Walter Mosley's works and was shocked as tried to read this most atypical of his writings.

Probably Mosley fans won't like it at all. I didn't even find it very science fictioness. And the review that tell's Mosley to let Dean Koontz write this stuff ignores how terrible Koontz is and how great this story is. Blue Light is positively lyrical.

I know of no author with the skill and perception, and sensitivity displayed by Mosley in his other books. But he just plain didn't do it here All I can think is that every author is entitled to a bummer. There is much about sex in this book, and there is much about death. And I will admit, because there are some rave reviews for this book, that I might have missed something. I will say that if you've read several of the author's books, go on and try this one. But please, don't read this until you've read at least a couple of the Easy Rawlins books, and at least one of the Socrates Fortlow books so that you know what Walter Mosley is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King Meets the Wizard of Oz","review":"I picked up this book in anticipation of a discussion with my monthly book club this coming weekend. We had previously read RL's Dream and I found that difficult to follow but considered it historical fiction. Now we enter the Blue Light. This book had none of the lyrical language I found so endearing in RL's Dream. This was a violent journey through a twisted utopia with no purpose. In a bow to the 60's, this was an acid trip gone very bad with a short fun period in the middle. The meanies were cardboard cartoon characters and the goodies were always running from them like Dorothy, Tin Man and Scarecrow through the poppy fields. I can't wait to see who picked this in our book club...Thanks for letting me share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Good Book","review":"This book was incredible! It's the first book in a long time that I took with me everywhere until I finished it.

Give this book a chance, you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It sounds like the blues through words","review":"Walter Mosley's creativity takes flight to another level in Blue Light. His diversity in talent and imagination is celebrated through this mood piece that is covered with the blues and wrapped in a combined cloth of Science Fiction and Crime Novels flavor. Mosley is speaking out to the environmentalist by singing out a blues song that has enlightened his characters into existence. I heard the music as I read and felt the various musicians change positions to do their own thang in the center stage. This novel should not be compared to Mosley's colored mysteries but be accepted and appreciated for its originality and brillance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I bought this book based on backcover info. What a disappointment. It's not just that it is poorly written and unimaginative. Unless you are into sleazily written sex and gore, you won't find much to hold your interest. There is nothing new here. Just tired, sorry, second rate prose, thinly drawn characters in a porno-lite storyline. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh man what a wild wild ride","review":"I have to agree with most of the reviewers in that I was looking for a story closer to the Easy Rawlins series when I picked this up. What I got however was a journey,one that was hypnotic, fascinating, repulsive and rivetting. I read this book on 2 flights and was gripped from start to finish. This book demands an open mind and the ability to accept Mosley's utopia.

It seemed to be a narrative of a group of semi-wooden characters reacting to a situation (the blue light) rather than a story about humans.

Skip it unless you have nothing better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Aweful","review":"Simply, a terribly written book. It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style. His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour. And that's all. The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world. The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of \\"the soul is love\\" type crap. Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Allegory","review":"Blue Light is not the standard Mosley with easily defined characters. This novel is neither for the intellectually challenged nor the faint of heart. Mosley's allegorical tale requires the reader's full attention to details.

While reading this very involving and disturbing novel, I wondered what exactly type of story this was...at times, only the interest in how it would turn out kept me going. How well-worth it...what an epiphany at the end. Mr. Mosely owes a bit of a nod to Joyce Carol Oates in that both authors dare to look inside of insidious and dangerous characters and find something sympathetic, scary and very compelling.

These scenes make a clear connection between the mutants in Beneath and the ones in this film. Of course, Mendez is still there in the chopped version, but many might not connect him with the Mendez dynasty alluded to in the second film. These scenes make a huge difference in this film. I'd say they elevate the film from 3 to 4 stars.The most obvious way to differentiate the two versions is the cover. The cut version has Virgil, an orangutan on it. This version has a picture of a very angry chimp or gorilla. In the cut version, you see Virgil from the chest up, the latter only has a face above the logo and a few film clips below it. While I'd really only recommend this to apes fans, I'd say anyone who's truly devoted to this series must own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's supposed to be new - but looks very used","review":"I will be sending this product back.

Consequently I was able to get access to a liberal sampling of their music. I must heartily agree with the last reviewer regarding \\"Believe Me\\". The song should have easily been a national top 10 hit but for some unexplained reason stalled outside of the New York/New Jersey area. It's very reminiscent of \\"Little Star\\" but different enough to stand on it's own merits as a doowop classic.I've always been particularly impressed by the Royal Teens' sax-flavored instrumentals and two excellent ones are featured in this short compilation (\\"Sham Rock\\" & \\"Royal Blue\\"). With only twelve tracks this is not an ideal \\"Best of\\" collection. I missed songs like \\"Leotards\\" (an obvious attempt to cash in again on \\"Short Shorts\\"), \\"Big Name Button\\" (another gimmick tune) and \\"Harvey's Got A Girlfiend\\". All in all, a vastly underrated group stuck with the \\"one hit wonder\\" label."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Royal Teens","review":"If your looking for a good copy of the song \\"Believe Me\\" by the Royal Teens, you can find it on a few CD's in a lot better quality than on this CD. ACE out of the UK has it on \\"Golden Age Of American Rock & Roll - Volume 10\\", Rhino has it on \\"The Doo Wop Box - 101 More Vocal Group Gems\\", other than that, I don't believe anyone has put out a CD from the master tapes as of yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I looked so forward to it ... but","review":"It is the slowest dullest movie to hit the screens in recent times. Kidman plays an Interpreter working at the United Nations who overhears an assination plot. From there the film just goes downhill, and it's hard to feel anything for any of the characters. Sean Penn acts like he doesnt really want to be there, and Kidman is unconvincing as the South African. The other problem with the film is that it goes on for too long!To market the film, they have plasted Sidney Pollack as Director all over it (as if it guarantees a sure-fire hit) and the fact that it was filmed in the United Nations Building.I really wanted to enjoy the film but found it uninteresting, dull and a big try-hard. Definitely one viewing is enough. Can't understand the box office bliss that it got on its opening weekend. Assume it was because nothing else was on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Penn is off this time","review":"Sean Penn is a very talented actor. So talented that I willingly laugh off his incredible arrogance. In \\"The Interpreter,\\" though he seeems to be just a little bit off his game. Everyone seems to be just a tad uninterested in the preceedings, and I share the feelingThis thriller moves at a plodding pace. I wasn't engaged at all. It's not a terrible film by any means, but considering my level of anticipation, and the film's pedigree it was a considerable disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Interpreter","review":"Escalating events begin when African-born U.N. translator Silvia Broome alleges that she has overheard a death threat against an African head of state, spoken in a rare dialect few people other than Silvia can understand. With the words \\"The Teacher will never leave this room alive,\\" in an instant, Silvia's life is turned upside down as she becomes a hunted target of the killers. This is an extremely fearful movie, with a mood, tone and cascade of plot twists. A solid entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment","review":"Just watched this with a couple family members and it was a great night's entertainment. Several times during the film we stopped it to kind of catch each other up on the details and hash over what was happening - great fun! Acting was wonderful and we appreciated that people didn't casually end up in bed with each other. Loved the mix of reality with the actual U.N. building, broad social justice themes, and personal psychological work that went on. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Ending Spoils Good Movie","review":"Seldom has an ending been so disappointing and ruined a good film as this one.For most of the way, this was a slick thriller, nicely photographed and nicely acted. Sean Penn is outstanding in here. I like to see him play low-key characters instead of hot-headed sleazeballs. Nicole Kidman also gives a good performance. Sometimes her classic beauty hides the fact she can act.The story was pretty involving, hard to put down once you've started. My only complaint up to the ending was the obvious plug for the United Nations. This looked a public relations piece for that organization.However, then came that ending - a real insult to anyone's intelligence. In a nutshell, nobody would go the extremes they went to here to protect a visiting dignitary, using all that manpower and machinery....and then leave him all alone in a room at the end! Are you serious??? It was unbelievably stupid and ruined what had been an entertaining and somewhat- smart film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is she who we think she is?","review":"Academy Award winning director Sidney Pollack brings together fellow Oscar winners Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn and turns in a pretty intriguing film. The movie works during the first 30 minutes as a US interpreter hear about a possible assasination attempt on a controversial African leader. Then the film goes into a lull of boring dialogue for the next 25 minutes. Then the suspense starts up again as we find out she's being followed by unknown assassins. Then another boring lull of dialogue! The climax of the film finally brings all the pieces of the puzzle together, saving the film from certain destruction. There's enough mystery and suspense to keep you entertained. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting-don't miss it! for action/adventure/suspense fans","review":"Other reviewers have synopsized the plot, while giving away key twists...I will say instead: the DVD was so good, it was viewed in succession by several people I know, with each viewer in turn commenting on how incredible a movie it was...it literally kept us on the edges of our seats... not wanting to pause or look away. Terrific acting... suspenseful... definately worth seeing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone should ask, Why?","review":"The underlying plotline is an interesting one; a dictator (or any politico) deflecting heat by making the world witness a reason to feel sympathy for him. However, the entire line of the story having to do with the interpreter, played by Nicole Kidman, does not make any sense.Assuming the bad guys could set her up to overhear the conversation, what would have happened had she reached Pierre and found out her brother was indeed already dead, ergo he could not have anything to do with the plot? Would she take the issue further? Why would she ... where was her motive?Even if you buy into all the improbabilities to do with the interpreter, why would the Secret Service make her a target of investigation?Also, and the capper for me, why would the dictator's henchmen want to kill her ... or, in the alternative, assume they wanted to kill her, why get into her apartment, steal a ceremonial mask, and then stand on the fire escape to scare her??? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Despite a terrific performance by Sean Penn, and a decent one from Nicole Kidman, this movie didn't move me. It manages to be both dull and improbable. There's a lot of Screenwriting 101 in it, stakes raised in a way that, unfortunately, feels very artificial. It also seems quaintly nostalgiac in its depiction of the UN. The founders of the UN might have fantasized it would work like this in 2005, but it doesn't.It's diverting enough if you've seen everything else, or if you are a fan of the stars. But keep your expectations low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen edition preferred to accomodate plot holes","review":"My suspicion that this film was mainly a \\"rah rah\\" piece for the U.N. is shared by several of my fellow reviewers. I hope that is the case so any who put work into \\"The Interpreter\\" can say they at least accomplished something. A really good spy thriller will maintain a nagging sense in the back of your mind that there is something amiss but keeps the action coming so you won't have an idle moment to ponder it. At the very end, the final piece of the puzzle will drop into place just in time to roll credits.In this movie, that nagging detail is so glaringly obvious that a non-stop chase scene couldn't mask it and there are no chase scenes in this movie worthy of the name. Staggering coincidences are required every few minutes to keep the plot moving. When the details of the nefarious conspiracy are revealed, the viewer is left thinking \\"really, that's it? They went to all that trouble for that?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Actors In A Boring/Bad Movie","review":"I give it two stars for the theme of the movie and plot which is unique! Unfortunately, I had watch this movie at two different times in order to \\"get into it.\\" I couldn't help but fastforward the last 30 minutes because I just wanted it to be over with!!! If no one screened this movie before it was put on DVD, it shows! I'd rather watch tv than this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicole Kidman is always beautiful , even in this terrible film . . .","review":"It takes itself a bit too seriously. The casting is far stretched also. A silly piece of work.Halle Berry would have been perfect in the role of Sylvia, but Nicole Kidman? She is supposedly African, with an African lover, and in all the photographs within the movie and among all the other people shown as her countrymen in the USA, she is the only one who is not black.There is no credibility on any count, whether the casting or the very, very weak story. Neither are the views of Manhattan, particularly in the last scene where it looks like a pastel backdrop rather than a view of the east side of the island. A waste of time, except for watching Nicole Kidman, one of the most beautiful people on the screen today."},{"rating":"1","title":"A smart intelegent but very slow drama that tries to be suspensfull","review":"The Interpreter is a story of a UN interpreter played by Nicole Kidman (who is very boring in her role and has no life) who hears an assisanation atempt on a African leader. Sean Penn( who is very borng) is investagating the plot. The movie has a good idea and is very smart and intelegent at times butt he satory drags on and on and on. the movie tries to be a suspens film but it dosent work there is only maybe 3 parts that are good. The movie started out good but went downhill fast. Overall the performances where bad and I love Nicole Kidman but this time she did not turn out good and the story was slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever, no doubt.","review":"Inspiring characters full of character and real humanity and insight. Plus a brilliantly portrayed and very original story. Definitely a must see in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is something that you could have imagined actually happening","review":"It's a story that happens all the time in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some corrupt government comes to power and executes its opponents.This is worth a rental, but not a purchase.The acting was decent. One big goof was that it looked like Africans from several different parts of the continent were used and it showed. (People from one region tend to favor one another in spite of the fact that they are from different tribes.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry in the political thriller/suspense genre for 2005","review":"This is an above-average international political thriller, bringing African politics and genocide to the game of American spy movies. The moviemakers created a generic African country with a fake name to represent a number of tragedies on that continent in recent decades, and female lead Nicole Kidman plays a UN interpreter who grew up in the strife-ridden African country and has some revolutionary experience of her own. Kidman's agenda is never really clear to her government handlers or to the viewer, and the plot is full of twists and turns. This is one of the better thrillers of the year, so check it out if you enjoy this type of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slap logic in the face","review":"We suspend disbelief all the time. But the ending is plain insulting. That a character could hide, as suggested here, just ruins the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"This might have been the first movie filmed inside the UN, but one can only hope that UN is not as stupid as the movie portrays it to be. The security checks were twisted. On the one hand, the entire UN building was evacuated because of a faulty metal detector and on the other hand, when it was known that a killer was in the building, security simply allowed the conference to continue. Sydney Pollack is a very intelligent individual, but here he lost his head once he realized he could film inside the UN.Overall, I think the movie was pointless as it simply highlighted what we already knew. A lot of innocent people are being killed in Africa. A better alternative would be to watch the Lord of War. In there, at least, they make a mockery of what's happening in Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst movie I saw in 2005","review":"How can a movie directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Sean Penn go wrong? If you watch this movie, you'll quickly find out. Or, you can take my advise and spend those 2 hours (which feels like 4) and do something else - anything else. The suspense was non-existant, the action was minimal, and the storyline and dialogue were ridiculous. I actually got up from my seat after the credits began rolling and started laughing.I normally don't take the time to add to the amazon review bank, but with this film, I felt obligated to offer a word of caution. How someone could recommend this movie is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stupid.....what a waste of talent!","review":"The only thing to recommend about this film is the \\"director's commentary\\" in the extras section - where the director \\"pontificates\\" about how \\"hard\\" movies are to make and to be \\"releasable\\" - which the irony is - this film is so awful it should have been shelved. Gone are Syndey's good days as a viable filmmaker (Kubrick he's not)! The casting is terrible (absolutely no chemistry between Kidman and Penn) and the screenplay is completely inane and impossible to follow. This is definitely one for the Mystery 3000 boys! Everyone collected their checks on this one - zero craft - zero film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too great","review":"I thought the plot line was OK. No great, but OK. I agree with other posters about the logic of the whole thing, but I won't get into it since they've already discussed that.I did expect better acting performances from Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman. They did not seem comfortable in the roles, and I was left wishing the casting director had picked different actors for the roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty exciting","review":"This movie, for the most part, was very suspenseful. I found my self squeezing my hands together because I didn't know what was going to happen next. The only problem was that there were a lot of characters to keep straight. At the end, it was hard to determine who was doing what for whom and why. This is not a movie where you can sit down and get everything. You have to think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses its mark -","review":"I went to see this film hoping to see a riveting, suspense thriller. While the idea behind the story had a great deal of promise the film comes across as sluggish, not well edited and the characters are too grandiose.As the film chugs along it always is trying to be like a \\"Classic Movie\\" you'd see on AMC/TCM and it loses itself.

Is he asleep throughout? Kidman does a wonderful job as the interpreter, she is beautiful and believable. We believe she is frightened, but Penn seems to be sleepwalking through the role of Keller. Hello? Somebody smack him awake, this beautiful woman's life's in danger!!I was really disappointed in Sean Penn's performance. He failed to pull out some real emotion and compelling character. He's not even believable as the grieving widower.Sadly, a forgettable film. Kidman's performance was wasted. No action, slow pace, needed more suspense, a car chase, or something. I've seen episodes of Fox's '24' that were more of a thrill! The bus scene was THE highlight of the film. The Interpreter is surely not in the class of \\"Three Days of the Condor\\", \\"Ronin\\", or even \\"Bourne Identity\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the politics.","review":"This movie would have recived a four star review if it were not for some obvious political slants in the movie.

The window had a link to learn more about CSS encryption which took me to 321 Studios window saying their software (specifically platinum 4.0.3 version) had been badly copied and my version had 'cracks' which would not work and could damage my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Rocks!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought DVD X Copy last week and have already burned backups to over 20 movies. This program is easy and fast. I tried Pinnacle, but that was like pulling teeth waiting for it to compress the files. Anyone who says that they can't use this software to backup movies over 120 mins, or can't use this on certain movies where the title is not 1 or 2 on the DVD either don't have a good DVD burner, don't have a good computer, or don't know how to use this program. This program rocks. I backed up my new Indiana Jones movies before I even watched them. Took a total of 90 minutes for all three movies. 15 minutes per movie, 15 minutes to write to blank DVD disk.

My son had them on for about 10 minutes and then refused to continue using them. When I tried them on, I realized why. The headphones somehow amplify the airplane noise and drown out the sound of the movie. You would have to turn the volume of the movie much higher than appropriate for a child in order to hear it over the background airplane noise. I ended up buying an adult-sized pair of Sony headphones (about $30)that specifically eliminate background noise. The Sony pair fits my son well enough, and he will happily use the headphones on the plane for hours. If you need headphones for an airplane, skip the Califone. They should be fine for ordinary use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones but not for airplane","review":"I purchased these headphones for my 2-year-old son to use while traveling via airplane, and like a previous reviewer, I found that the ambient noise of the airplane drowned out the sound of the DVD player at normal listening levels forcing me to turn the volume up (a lot) in order to hear it.

The opening scene was a great introduction to the main characters and their relationship to each other, plus a good laugh. Flashpoint moves at a nice pace and held my interest throughout. The only complaint I have - - I didn't feel that I got to \\"know\\" Tess and Nash as well as I would have liked. However, the action was great and unpredictable. The secondary characters were also interesting. The fact that this book deals with current world issues was a plus for me. It felt fresh and timely. The best I have read in a while. Suzanne Brockmann fans will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this Tape!","review":"This book on tape was really bad! There were too many characters to keep track of.

Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suzanne wrote this?","review":"I am a huge fan of Brockmann's, but oh my goodness, I don't think she wrote this installment of the NavySeals. I liked the characters, but their danger and action scenes fell flat for me because of thier behavior and dialog I either wanted to laugh or encourage the terrorists to take them out for violation of good character exchange! I will still read Brockmann because there isn't anyone out there who writes like she does or makes you feel what the characters feel like she does....BUT, I just might have to wait for the next one to hit paperback instead of killing myself to get to the bookstore on the first day of release."},{"rating":"1","title":"And now for something completely different","review":"One of my favorite features of Suzanne Brockmann's books is that she usually introduces her heroes or heroines as secondary characters in her previous novel. (what a sentence, but you get what I mean?)So here, she goes totally off the board with three characters we've never met before, have no fuzzy feelings for, and have no sense of depth for.Yeah, the love scenes are nearly PG-13 -- a most unwelcome change from her previous novels. But the worst part is that the reader just doesn't care about Jimmy and Tess.Ok, all that said, I can't wait for Cosmo's story. I still adore Suzanne's books, and hope that she is able to fight off the pod person who has taken over her body."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Heck Happened???","review":"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Suzanne Brockmann is my favorite author. However, after waiting months upon months for this book to come out I was so disapointed. Brockmann can drag a reader into a story better than any writer I know but this quality is sadly lacking in her newest realese.When I first found out that Brockmann was going to introduce a whole new set of charcters I was excited. These guys (although not Navy SEALs) are supposed to be the best of the best of the best. Am I the only one who wondered where these people's focus was? On a mission in nightmare of a country, all the characters could think about was who was \\"getting with\\" whom. Where was the gut wrenching plot? Where was the suspense that has made Brockmann famous.

Flashpoint is a terrible disappointment!

There was some possibility with the character of Decker but even that fell short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I found Suzanne Brockmann's books last year and was thrilled to find an author that I wanted to read her books 2 and 3 times each. So, I was looking forward to her new book......but I was sorely disappointed. I couln't have cared less about the characters (except Decker) and the storyline was just a little too unbelievable. I think the author may have rushed things in order to get a new book on the shelf. I am still looking forward to Cosmo's book (he's always been one of my favorites) and will buy it the first day in hardback. Hopefully the author will flesh these characters out a little more and we can care about why they are they way they are and can hope for a happy ending for them. I couldn't have cared less when Tess and Nash got together (what a lame way to do it - sounded like somthing from junior high) and really would have gotten more pleasure from Tess telling Nash to go blow.

Anyone familiar enough with The Residents phases and sounds can easily figure that a number of the original foursome flew the coop after the Mole Show. The lone survivor took it one the road. Flat, bland, and one dimensional, this recording shows the remaining Resident (now known as Mr. Skull) trying to regroup. Fortunately, with the discovery of new sounds, styles, MIDI, and the like, the \\"group\\" got it back together. But \\"The 13th Anniversary Show\\" demonstrates that art indeed imitates life.

The audience doesn't clap after each song, but they do after each suite.

Between-song banter there's aplenty, but audience reaction is not obvious. Standout tracks include the magnificent Jailhouse Rock and the quirky This Is A Man's World with its cartoon character voices. I wonder what James Brown thinks of it? Their quasi-orchestral arrangements are much n evidence, along with those strangled synth sounds. Things get really strange on tracks like Coming Of The Crow and Cry For The Fire, while elsewhere there are some jazzy edges. The Residents made some of the weirdest music ever but the problem is, sometimes it all sounds the same. I wouldn't recommend his album to those who want to discover this band's distinctive sonic experiments. Rather get an album that contains tracks like the studio version of Semolina, Blue Rosebuds and The Spot (with Snakefinger)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Film","review":"This is fantastic music--great to dance to and also to meditate and practice yoga.

Peikoff's presentation has all of the weaknesses, and none of the strengths, of Rand's own. Unlike Rand, it is unimaginative, devoid of creativity, and dull. Like Rand, it involves ambiguity, equivocation, absence of definition, arbitrary and unclear distinctions, the erasing or ignoring of distinctions arbitrarily and unclearly, etc. His tone throughout is one of uncritical worship, and this is the last thing that Rand's philosophy needs.Rand was a valuable and insightful intellectual, though hardly 'the greatest philosopher of all time' or even one of the top philosophers of this century. To gain the full value of her work, we need criticism and scepticism; we need precision and attention both to details and to context. Peikoff is a mouthpiece, not a thinker. His anti-scholarship is the paradigm of what those interested in the fulfillment of Rand's vision must avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, it's all so simple and clear now!","review":"'Anyone who doubts the truth and honesty of this philosophy must either be dishonest, irrational or a collectivist. After all, how can someone deny the truth of 1+1=2 and expect to not have conflict in their lives?'There you have it, folks - the heart of 'Objectivism'. Rand said it, it's as straightforward and obviously true as 1+1=2, and if you don't see it you must be a willful evader who deserves to die in, let's say, the collapse of a train tunnel. (See ATLAS SHRUGGED.)This comment is quite representative of the level of 'philosophy' in Leonard Peikoff's presentation of 'Objectivism'. It is also, and more importantly, quite representative of the level of 'philosophy' in Miss Rand's writings themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"but I'm not laughing","review":"Ayn Rand's \\"philosophy\\" is a joke to most philosophers. According to the Rand cult there's only one reason for this: the academy is overrun by communists. Now there might be a small kernel of truth to this; the only place in the western world one can be an avowed Maoist and be taken seriously nowadays is the university, but oddly enough Rand and her followers share important traits with many academic marxists including a poor to nonexistent background in philosophy and an immunity to facts and logic.Rand writes philosophy for people who neither like nor understand philosophy. If you want a sort of secular theology, then by all means read Ayn Rand. If, on the other hand, you want a reasoned, philosophical defense of libertarianism, then read Robert Nozick's \\"Anarchy, State, and Utopia.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is objective then what is subjective?","review":"Ayn Rand seems to have forgotten the definition of \\"objective\\". Her philosophy spouts forth from the notion that man is his own God, that his happiness comes before all else and that the thoughts, opinions and feelings of others are inconsequential as well as to be looked down upon. Given that view her philosophy should be called \\"subjectivism\\" as all thoughts are subjective to how any item would effect/affect one's own personnal happiness-- not how something would be measured in objective terms in which that item would be measured from an unbiased platform. Faulty thinking that appeals to the illogical mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several rereadings later . . .","review":". . .

It would seem the primary qualification for Peikoff's position is that he be of unquestioning loyalty. The result is a truly unoriginal book.

The bleak cityscapes of cinematographer George Barnes, spot-on performances by John Garfield and Thomas Gomez, spare score by David Raksin, the script, the direction---everything comes together into a film that's somehow both an archetypal genre piece and also a highly individual entertainment. One wonders what kind of career Abraham Polonsky would have had if it weren't for the blacklist. Good to see, though, that this once-neglected film has lately been getting some of the recognition it deserves. Fans of John Garfield should not miss one of his most indelible performances, but just as an example of high-quality Hollywood product from the late studio era, or as one of the great \\"New York\\" movies of the forties, this film is a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down I went, down and down, down to the bottom of the world...","review":"...down and down... and down...down......down.Wait, who was I listening to?

There's nothing worse than needing a 45 degree angle and having to use a mitre box. It's tedious and it takes so much time. This mitre saw is great. I really the the D shaped handle, it makes using the saw so much easier. The dust bag doesn't really collect much sawdust but that's not too much of a big deal for me. If you're looking for an inexpensive mitre saw, this one is the one you want!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Home workshop enthusiast","review":"I bought the LS 1011 several weeks ago from Amazon. Even though I read the negative reports from those who bought theirs 10 years ago and found them to be inaccurate. I looked over the field, going to many dealers before I decided on the 1011. My main objective was to get a saw that was light enough to lug around, the 1011 met that challenge, weighing in at 35 pounds. No other saw I could find came close. It is a great performer, not very loud, good H.P. and easy to use. I did buy a stand for it which is a great safety item and adds to the fuctionality. I really love the saw, wouldn't trade it for anything, I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The finish carpenter's best friend","review":"I bought my ls1011 in 1994 and have used it almost daily since.

However did I manage without it?Downside; The bushing rings between the table and base are a constant problem, wearing out very quickly with daily use. Also I have noticed time and again that even with a brand new 60 tooth Marathon blade, on a 45 degree compound cut the blade seems to \\"bend\\" slightly, even through soft woods.

I tried to replace it with the extra pair I bought, thinking that it might be defective, but it stays the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Ground","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated book that asks important questions without \\"talking down\\" to children. The text explores environmental issues beginning with the common-shared ground in many early settlements. Starting with the problem of townspeople feeding too many sheep on the commons, resulting in a scarcity of grass, Bang goes on to the forests, seas, air, and water. She does not offer solutions, but poses questions that are open-ended and invite discussion. I am an art professor and volunteer as an elementary art teacher. I plan to use this book during Earth Week to teach an illustration unit on environmental issues to third graders. Bang's use of multiple baselines in her representation of the common ground is delightful and creates another interesting avenue for discussion with children. I'm never disappointed with a Bang book. I've been a fan since The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher. Common Ground does not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book asks: To whom do the earth's resources belong?","review":"A thought-provoking allegory--with vivid, jewel-like illustrations--based on biologist Garrett Hardin's classic biology article (Science, 1968), \\"The Tragedy of the Commons,\\" this book raises important stewardship questions regarding the earth's flora, fauna, and natural resouces. It also deftly implies that the answer is embedded in the Tale of the Commons. Insightful illustrations use cut-away and distorted aerial perspectives to amplify the text, and to provoke readers to always consider \\"the bigger picture\\" when taking action. Indeed, this book teaches children a very important ecology lesson in a visually enticing way! It should also be noted that this book won the 1998 GIVERNY AWARD for Best Children's Science Picture Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth checking out","review":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Greg wrote all the material, played all the instruments (except for 1 keyboard solo), and recorded this whole album in his home studio.

Or 'Slickers' taking appalling advantage of the elderly?","review":"I ran across this show on Netflix and watched a few episodes. One episode showed the slick talking Mike and Frank on a rural property of a frail elderly man in Iowa. They were seemingly kind and gentle to the old man. But they then gave him $75 for an old saddle he had; even I sitting out in TV land could see it was worth far more and the old man could not defend himself. They took it home and got it appraised; $5000. It was obvious from the video that the old man's life would have been transformed by receiving even half of this but there was no mention of going back to give him a fairer price. Other such examples. How can these vultures live with themselves? Appalling, taking advantage of the clueless elderly and robbing them of their valuables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible show","review":"This show is bad enough on TV and they play it constantly so why would you waste your money on the DVD. The show is just these guys searching for a poor dirty hoarder to take advantage of and then them digging through their junk. I'm sure they find some valuable items or else they wouldn't still be in business, but they just give some arbitrary value for an item. For example they see a petrified dino turd and say picked for $50 and give a value of $100. There is no basis for this value other than I assume their opinion. It would be one thing if they took to an expert and that person gave a value on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately Depressing","review":"If your idea of \\"entertainment\\" is to watch nondescript, middle-aged men badgering the elderly into selling possessions for a fraction of their actual value, then this DVD is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Con Artists","review":"What a disappointment.

They are using a lame advertising tactic to make you buy this DVD which costs $2 a show. Absolutely ridiculous!!! Please make them do something about this and go to the historychannel.com and write to them how unhappy you are. I read numerous other people being upset about this and it pissed me off too so I wrote to them. Please pass the word so they can fix this and give us the ENTIRE season.Now about this DVD itself, I decided to buy it because I thought this was the only season out of all offered that was complete.

Mike and Frank share a truck as they wander from place to place climbing through barns, haggling with old timers, and looking to salvage rusting items for their shop. We learn some history, some old trading tricks and best of all the good natured bickering between Mike and Frank, who are sent on their journeys like modern Don Quehotes by xxxx a good natured, resourceful, and heavily tattoed mother-figure to the quarrelsome boys.An entertaining, informative, and thoroughly charming romp that leaves me feeling good time after time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase from mobileplanet!!!","review":"MobilePlanet, Inc. ,My wife purchased the disc Steno CP200 (MP500251) as a Christmas gift for me from MobilePlanet, Inc.

He was simply incredible, playing his signature blend of Folk-rock & Alt/Country with his touring band (His fellow guitarist Michael O'Conner ROCKED!) He played most of this album along with songs from his latest album \\"Wishbone\\". My favorites of the night were the title track (Lots of airplay on Sirius Disorder // 24 satellite channel) and 'Bring It On' - also a staple of Sirius' and NPR radio. The encore brought Slaid alone with his guitar, playing a unplugged piece from his new album called 'New Year's Day'. After the concert - he signed my copy of \\"Broke Down\\" with his inscription \\"For Joe, Slaid Cleaves 2004\\". I told him he was the first artist that I heard over Sirius Satellite Radio, and he was happy to hear that. He told me he was 'thinking' of satellite radio, I told him to go \\"Sirius\\". He said he would look into it. Thanks Slaid!!

Some of these were later absorbed into the London Underground ('subway' to Americans), but coverage of subway lines is incidental to the main topic. The book is arranged in a logical, geographic sequence, starting with Greenwich and working its way clockwise around London, ending with the Docklands. Each of 48 branches gets an average of nine pages each, covering why it was built, station design, operating peculiarities, and why the line prospered (or did not prosper).

The first album is fey and sunshine-dappled, like a country walk through a Canadian wheatfield. The second album, conversely, is like a dancing, drink-spilling night in a Toronto honky tonk roadhouse.Andru Reeve widely prefers the latter. And, therefore, he must dock this collection one star.

Unlike us, they have doorways appropriate for a doorway jumper, and this one looked so colorful and fun!Complaints:1. My son did not appear comfortable in this toy. He was constantly leaning to one side or another, never balanced.2. It looks like it would be adjustable to almost any height, but really there is velcro only on a small part of the cord, so it doesn't adjust much at all.3. The toys are silly and did not interest him at all.4. It just wasn't very springy. He flies around in the jumperoo and could barely jump at all in this toy.I don't know if the problem is doorway jumpers versus jumperoos, as I have not tried another doorway jumper, so I did not give the single star I think the product deserves.

This Sassy Jumper was the only type we found which had a clamp that would fit over our crown molding (we have a house built in 1900). That is the only plus I can see about it.the cons: our boy couldn't get upright to jump, the way the straps are that hold the jumper he was always leaning one way or the other. After a couple of minutes he leaned too far to one side and hit his forehead on the door frame! We took him out right away and boxed it back up. I had read the directions and had adjusted it to the best of my ability, so I believe it is a bad design.The other jumper with tray and 3 straps is great, we'd get one of those except for the clamp won't fit. Do not buy this jumper, everything about it says 'cheap', and results in a dangerous item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This is the first baby toy that I have absolutely hated. Our son hated it, too and we returned it. First of all, it is really hard to bounce. Our son is 7 months old and bounces like a ball all over the house and couldn't bounce on this jumper. Second, getting him in and out of it was a minor feat. He cried every single time, no matter how gentle we tried to be. Finally, the way it hangs, he rocks from side to side and spins around in circles. He loved the spinning to a point, then it got him really upset because he couldn't control it.We returned it and bought a Graco and he loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another product","review":"Sassy Seat Doorway JumperPoorly designed jumper. My daughter is 6 months old and did not like this jumper at all. What they don't show on the box is that the ropes attache to a bar that is straight across so if the baby leans to the side, the seat tips and the opposite foot comes off the floor and they are lop-sided. My daughter didn't like the off-balance feeling and would cry. Not a great design for stability. I also noticed that on the front of the box, they photoshopped the rope on the left side oft he baby so that it doesn't show it in front of it's face. The ropes are right in the way and really frustrated my daughter. She couldn't get to the toys so those were kind of useless if using with the jumper.

The challenge united the town under the leadership of \\"Morgan the Goat\\" (Colm Meaney)and his nemesis, the town vicar, to overcome their mountain's classification by the British Geographical Survey, Hugh Grant, who sees what's going on and comes around to the town's side.This is supposedly based on a true story which makes it even more interesting.

High production value, beautiful scenery, first class acting, writing and directing, one can't go wrong with this moving story set during WW I in a small Welsh town.

It you rate films by special effects, shoot em up, kill them all and abuse their women folk, then this is not for you. This film gives you a good, warm feeling throughout. Not that it doesn't touch briefly on the \\"seamy\\" side as most of the babies in the church look just like Colm Meany's Morgan the Goat, though why Morgan hasn't gone to war is not mentioned. The only drawback is the Irish actors playing Welsh characters and occasionally slipping up in their accents.If you don't speak Welsh you miss a very delightful comment by Williams the Petroleum. When the Englishmen's car is sabotaged they push it to the local garage. Williams breaks a rod and says, \\"I see what's wrong with your car but I don't know what you call this in English. In Welsh we call it \\"bethyngalw\\". There is no more comment on this.

Instead of starting with the Greeks, we get to see the Greeks in a broader context, including with premodern Japan, where women had more of a role, especially in culture. One of the things I especially liked about the book was how the author uses direct quotes to give a sense of how individuals either experienced or expressed gender. The second part of the book deals with modernization, with case studies of Russia and Japan, and the impact of the West on the globe from the 19th century. Starting with a global perspective helps to broaden the entire narrative.There aren't any footnotes, but there are useful suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter. This is a great place to get oriented to gender history in a global context."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible revelations","review":"This is an incredible book that gave me the most evidence of God's grace in this area I have ever seen. I had heard the interpretation that God hates divorce, so do not even mention the word divorce and it won't happen, but such thinking can lead to marital abuse in some cases.Hallelujah, God has mightily used David Instone-Brewer to help Him set the captives free with a comprehensive and scholarly teaching on this sensitive subject. David shows how many interpreters miss the Jewish context and then end up misunderstanding the meaning of what Jesus said and Paul wrote. The Bible clearly teaches that abuse is a reason for divorce, read this book to find out more. Discover the reasons that God divorced Israel (which include abuse) it is all there in the Bible but seldom taught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth Restored","review":"Instone-Brewer is the Martin Luther of the Divorce/Remarriage debate bringing deliverance from the bondage of the traditional doctrines.

No more conflicts or apparent contradictions. Now it all makes perfect sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like the other reviews have said...","review":"This book is just as thorough as the other reviewers have said. He seemingly ends up at a different place than I do, because he seemingly brushes aside a point I believe to be very important (\\"Put Away\\" vs. divorce), but maybe thats because of his historical approach to the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covenant is not Contract","review":"While addressing some points well, the argument starts off on the wrong foot in the first chapter, where he equates the marriage covenant to a contract. This takes marriage down to a business arrangement, not the covenantal relationship that models Christ's relationship to the church. Do you think Christ only has a business arrangement with the church?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Exegesis","review":"The huge focus on how ancient cultures treat divorce, is completely irrelevant. What matters is what Jesus says. Case in point, Mark 10:11-12, \\"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits [present tense] against her. And if the wife divorces her husband and marries another, she is committing adultery.\\" Emphasis added. This coincides with Romans 7:2-3, \\"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if he is dead, she is released from the law of her husband. So then, if she marries another while her husband is still alive, she should be called and adulteress (one who practices adultery). But if her husband be dead [literally no longer living], she is free from the law of her husband and is not an adulteress if she marries another.\\" Emphasis added.Its a sign of how apostate so called Christians are today, when we cannot accept the simplest, clear, and emphatic teaching of our Lord and Saviour. If you don't take Him at His Word, why do you call yourself a Christian?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fair weather camera - no easy button","review":"When everything is great, out of doors, lots of light and color, this camera can't be beat. Move to poor lighting or tough conditions and it becomes impossible to manage. Other reviewers have declared it to be a \\"fine arts\\" camera and definitely not an \\"event\\" camera. They are right. In RAW mode, it takes forever to load. JPEG mode is a disappointment and forget anything over ISO=200. The software that comes with it is buggy. Fortunately Photoshop Elements will do the downloads with no effort. The images I am getting are outstanding, provided I do everything just right. The color is a bit over saturated, but for me that is good. Battery life has been terrible, no more than 50 shots per charge. Still, for me, the outstanding image quality is worth the trouble. I am hanging onto my other camera though."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to get more than pictures, you should get one.","review":"You should get one, if you want to get yourself to a different place. Yes, a place where you cannot rush, you're forced to slow down, to work out, to think. The lower the price of this camera, the more convinced you should be that you will not be able to be always fast and precise, and to deliver always great with it. I think this is the point.That's why my overall satisfaction is a 5 stars, and that's a very high rating considering that sometimes the shutter button gets stuck and that at high ISO the performance is really outrageous (forget about resolution/tone above 400). Sometimes you can get really disappointed, as much as sometimes you feel good with the job you have done. Not just for the pictures, but for the fact that once you get the camera in your hands you know that something is going to change and you must stop while all around everything keeps running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigma SD14 dslr camera with Foveon processor","review":"I have been using an SD14 for six months.

You are stuck with Sigma lenses and I can't say that the 14.1 MP rating is s true 14.1 MP. But at the end of the day, when used for what it is intended - to take pictures - it produces the most beautiful and stunningly real, film like, dynamic, true color results. If you want features and functionality but lower quality pictures, go ahead and buy another camera, one without a Foveon sensor.

Seriously? Like most Oscar winning movies, this book is an overly acclaimed snooze-fest. A small percentage of it is well written and at times engrossing (for instance; the disastrous horse racing scene and the confrontation chapter between Anna and her husband immediately following). However, that alone couldn't justify the insipid tedium of the vast majority of Tolstoy's behemoth of boredom (Levin's endless fascination and involvement with nineteenth century Russian agriculture and long stale politics, I'm looking at you). If you've got a killer case of insomnia that needs solving, search no further. Otherwise, what a colossal waste of time! For a truly epic literary experience that will keep you up teary eyed and turning pages long into the night, skip this boring, overrated book and read Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good companion to movie","review":"It was great to read the original story and then go right into the screenplay so you can easily compare the changes that were made to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but very good","review":"If you have the time, there was an illness in the family and I needed to relax from daily chores this is an excellent read. The book is so much more than the story of Anna Karenina, although that is the most famous portion. And that is a good story. But I found the young man''s struggles with being a land owner and the new laws that freed the serfs very interesting. The philosophical discussions between what would become the members of communism and the old aristocrats. The struggles to be fair and difiiculties with a new portion of society, all were very interesting and a large part of Tolstoy's novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"just a classic","review":"it's Anna Karenina, this is a superb, 5 stars book... I'm giving it 4 stars because of the edition that has some flaws in the punctuations and the characters' names are halfway translated, but still is a good version, won't get you deviated from the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time! Though Anna Karenina is not necessarily an easy or quick read, you will thank yourself for persevering and reading this book. Tolstoi has an amazing way with characterization and descriptive narrative. He managed to find just the right words or phrase something in just such a way as to evoke real feeling from the reader; you can truly identify with the character/situation at those moments and appreciate the literary beauty of this novel throughout. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cassette NOT cd's","review":"this is the music I am looking for , but I asked for cassettes . Why waste my time listing CD's under cassettes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Good","review":"I have been wanting this product for a long time to aid with cutting those parts that are too awkward to hold on the saw, but too short to use supporting stands. My saw is the LS1212 which is no longer available for the most part. However, these extension bars from numerous sources are suppose to be compatible, and for the most part they are.The extension bars are compatible, however, the set screws that hold the bars in place are NOT. I looked up the cost of the set screws from Makita and they want $7 for each set screw. Being that this product is already a little high priced, I think that the set screws shipped with this product being too small is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arzachel - self-titled (Demon Records Ltd.) import CD","review":"Another title that took me awhile to land down a copy. Arzachel was a short-lived project that saw Steve Hillage (prior to joining up with Gong) teaming up with the three members of UK progressive outfit, Egg. This was the band's sole lp release that originally came out in 1969. It sounds SO 1969-ish that it simply isn't even funny. Call it prog / psych, call it a true underground classic. I call it explosive psychedelic that's a MUST-have for all fans of the genre. All six tracks will fully trip you out, but the ones that made me sit up and take notice were the hit-you-in-the-face opener \\"Garden Of Earthly Delights\\", \\"Queen St.Gang\\" and the sixteen-minute mind scrambler \\"Metempsychosis\\". Should appeal to fans of The Move, Tomorrow, Khan, Caravan and maybe early Moody Blues. Most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the stuff old Canterbury is all about. Great synth with distorted guitar work. If you want some OLD stuff, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"how DO you pronounce the bands name?","review":"Arzachel is a pretty cool band. They're the kind of band that, once again, doesn't deserve to be as hidden in the dark as they are at the moment. A band that doesn't deserve to have their music be forgotten, or just ignored. THIS is a really good band. On this album, I hear Emerson, Lake and Palmer-like keyboard playing, and even early Deep Purple-like blues rock. To me that's enough to declare this album one you really need to hear. Just give it a chance and you'll see its brilliance sneak up on you. When you least expect it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie Palmieri and his orchestra in peak form.","review":"This 1973 release was Eddie's last album to feature the great but underrated Ismael Quintana as lead singer. Yes, it only has five songs but this was recorded at a time when Palmieri and his band were truly at their absolute best. \\"Puerto Rico\\", \\"Adoracion\\" and \\"No Pienses Asi\\" are all Salsa masterpieces that make this CD a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but she does not go through the steps before her routine","review":"It's okay but I noticed with all the firm dvds, they do not go through the routine before the actual workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased.","review":"The Firm Lower body sculpt DVD did not meet my expectations.Not enough info was offered to let you know that you need to purchase additional equipment (the Fanny Lifter) in order to do the workout. So once I got the DVD I could not get stared right away. The moves are very slow, not enough repetitions, too many routine changes, not to mention the lack of enthusiasm by the instructors. Lines are definitely learned. Not unisex friendly. I could not see my husband working out with me to that routine! More for \\"Stepford Wives\\" I have heard that The Firm Series from the 1980's is better than the current. But I'am not going to experiment. I'll continue to work out to my Billy Blanks videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never used it","review":"I was very disappointed in this dvd. Actually, I've never even popped it into my player. The back says you have to have some equipment to do the exercises, which of course is sold by The Firm and highly overpriced. I could use other stuff that I have instead, such as a sawed off broom stick handle for the stick and a foot stool instead of their $40 plastic stool. It's the principle. I just want to exercise, not fill my house up with a bunch of stuff I'll never use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price","review":"I was looking for a nice messenger bag that was also cheap. When I first purchased it I was a bit taken back by the $9.98 shipping fee, but when it arrived here the day that it said it would I was really happy with what I got. The color is the Olive Green that it said it was and its size is perfect. I was initially worried about it being either too small or two big when its on me but it is just the right size to fit all my books and look fashionable. It has 6 big pockets everywhere you could think of, as well as a little pocked inside of the main storage area. If you are looking for those little loops to hold your pens this one doesn't have it. There are just zippered pockets on it, which doesn't bother me at all because I just put my pens through those two loop things on the front of the bag. All in all it is a great bag for the price, nice size, good color and I am really happy I got it. I put The Smiths pins all over it and it is blank so I can paint whatever I want to on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bag!","review":"I ordered 2 of these bags and use them regularly!

It's not too big, but enough to be able put a laptop and a couple notebooks or textbooks. Should last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"This is an ok bag but the \\"Heavyweight Canvas\\" is a very loose weave,that is to say it wont hold back anything stronger than a light fog and wont suffer much abuse. The lining is 3rd rate thinner than paper nylon. In short a good bag if you are buying for fashion, a poor choice if you are actually going to use it. Look out for inflated shipping costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best thing in the genre. One star.","review":"First off, let me say that I detest pop-punk. I was driving with my friend earlier today and she put on this album. I didn't know who it was at first and when the first track came on I was amazed. I mean, all she ever listens to is crappy pop-punk, right? This was friggin' awesome! The choir, the organ, everything was perfect! Then, it ended, and in came the second track. How could a band who can make such an awesome creepy ambient song waste their talent on crappy 3-minute pop-punk songs with 3-5 chords repeated endlessly?

The only thing that makes them punk is the fact that they wear black and have tatoos, shouldn't the judgement of punk be made on...oh...I dunno...THE MUSIC?!?!?

Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm... yeah","review":"I found this CD in a computer at my school. When I found it I thought \\"Hey cool, a free CD!!! Good Charlotte? I've heard they were pretty good.\\" When I got home I threw it in my CD player and hit play. The intro was different, but I kinda liked it... then the first song kicked in with the line \\"you come in this world, covered in blood, they're all soo happy you've arrived.\\" bouncing along in a pop-ish beat. I was surprised... in a bad way. I listened to the whole song... it was mildly catchy but definitely not my style. I sat patiently through the whole album. And when it finally ended an hour or so later (I have to say I was impressed with the length) I was left very unimpressed. Good Charlotte is a very pop-punk band, and while I like punk, pop is not my thing. So, while I see how some people can like Good Charlotte, I wish I had left this CD in the computer where I found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow this blows","review":"I use to be a HUGE good charlotte fan, like obsessively.

But you have to give them some credit for trying, this album looks like The Ramones debut compared to their previous album, The Young and the Hopeless. Tracks 1 and 5 are by far the best songs on the disc and the only ones that hold even the slightest hint of creativity. Well, 16 stands apart too, but the singers nasally voice has the power of making that song possibly the worst on the album.For some music that's NOT manufactured and worth your time and money check out Black Flag, The Ramones, Modest Mouse and The Dead Kennedys.

When the two accidentally meet up at an auto garage after years apart, the stripper suggests to her equally beautiful business-executive friend that she come down to her club and check it out. The businesswoman does exactly that, and even gets an unrequested erotic table-dance from her stripper friend! The businesswoman decides to give it a try as a stripper, and soon she's the hottest girl at the club. That doesn't settle very well with her blonde friend, who, nevertheless makes money on-the-side doing girl-girl performances with another pretty blonde who works at the club.

However I was disappointed when I plugged it into my power port on my vehicle. First of all if you have a \\"Power Port\\" like some vehicle makes it probably will not fit in it well enough causing the device to power off when you hit a bump. It must be in a cigarette lighter. Second, I was very disappointed with the quailty of the sound. I knew that by using an FM transmitter I would be sacrificing quality, but it was a lot worse than I expected.Some good things about this product are that it uses the full FM spectrum from 88.1-107.9. That's nice when you need to find a unoccupied frequency in the upper ranges. It's also nice that this device charges your iPod while you travel.Overall, I would say save your money unless you don't mind poor quality and I would say only use it then if you don't have a tape deck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for road trips!!!","review":"I'm glad I got this product. sound quality was good except when traveling into areas with many radio stations but static interference was minimal.

If you've read the other reviews here you should already have a pretty good idea what's wrong with this product. But I need to add one more serious flaw: it's not stereo. Sure, it lights the little \\"stereo\\" light in your car's FM radio- but it sounds like all left channel / right channel separation is lost in the audio- even with a good, strong, clear signal on an unused FM frequency. Now of course I can't be certain whether this is a design omission, or if my unit is simply defective. To me , it doesn't matter; it's unacceptable in either case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last you..","review":"First off let me say that when this product works it sounds fine, i had no trouble with that at all. But more importantly i've gone through 3 of these in a month and all with the same problem. Something goes wrong between the cigarette adapter and the actual cradle itself. First signs are that if you leave your cradle in the wrong position no power at all, followed later by having to have your cradle in just the right position to get it to work (even the most minor touch such as touching it to pick it up resulted in loss of power), and finally no matter what position you put it in no power at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe mine was bad but ....","review":"The mechanical swivel arms broke and now it's in a bigger mess.

This is pretty critical - otherwise I am having to continuously worry about my ipod being in place and lose focus on my driving"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I just got my iPod, and I got this fm transmitter as a gift a week ago. I was a little skeptical about this whole FM transmitter thing, but so far I haven't had any problems at all, in fact this has definitely exceeded my expectations. It looks a lot better in the car than I thought it would, plus it gives you options on how to mount it. I had no problem finding a blank frequency to use. I live in Tampa, Florida and I've driven all over and not had one interference problem using 87.9. It also helps to have a good stereo system (obviously). I tried this in my brother's 2001 BMW 330ci, and it sounded crystal clear all day.The only thing I've found to be at all negative is that it does broadcast the sound sort of quietly, so you have to turn your stereo up louder than normal. Not a big deal, it still sounded great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother...","review":"This is item is great...as long as you only expect it to work for a month.

What a mistake. Transpod's FM transmitter is bassy and has lots of hiss, no matter what frequency you choose. The holder arm has joints that slip and get disconnected, causing it to lose power and making the whole thing quit working. Transpod is a great idea, but severely flawed in execution. It's also overpriced... but again, had it worked properly, I would have gladly paid even more. My recommendation: get a $7.99 cassette tape adaptor and plug it straight into your iPod. It sounds and works far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"It's nice to have a charger and player all in one, but the sound quality of the transmission is about that of an old, scratched LP (and as instructed, I tried every station between 88 and 107).

High freq whine is a problem.","review":"This product is a great idea and they really thought of everything in terms of features. But the execution is very poor. The system does not lock in the iPod very well and you get intermittent high frequency whine, probably due to a ground loop. When you touch the case of the iPod the high freqeuncy whine goes away. The bandwidth does not go down past 88.1, which is a problem in a big city where most of the channels are occupied with powerful stations. Most car radios can tune down to 87.5 or so. The white color is very noticable and it practically blares out that \\"There is an Apple iPod in this car. Please break in!!!\\". It's nice that it color coordinates with the iPod, but a ore discrete color scheme would be more practical. The construction feels shoddy. They could do a better job.

Great product only gripe has to do with clunkyness. Something slimmer would have worked great!.Would not have paid 99 for it but definetely worth it for the 49 bucks. Plenty of stations to choose from, works great where other transmitters have failed!!! why pay more for iMonster this one does it all. No I don't work for these folks, just a happy consumer, finally a product that delivers...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"It's a great buy for the money. It took some effort to get it going but over all it works great. I can drive for hours with no interuptions. You ocasionally encounter static areas but i find that if i unplug and plug back in it elimates the problem.The adapters are very helpfull for cigarette lighters that are in an unusual angle. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product - Great Price!","review":"I was very impressed with this product. I have used it on three different vehicles and because it has three different adjustments, it's interchangeable. I love the fact that because of the digital display, it's easy to find an empty FM station. Amazon had the best price for the quality. I am very happy and I recommend it highly.C. LuceroLas Cruces, NM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I liked it. I didnt have to change too many frequencies. I owned a different branded FM transmitter before(Griffin iTrip Mini FM Transmitter for iPod Mini), this is way better than that. But the design could be improved. I felt like to many joints while connecting. I live in DC metro where it is hard to find any unused frequencies but this performs on 87.9 itself. anyways it is good start for FM tranmitter. I would recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best option","review":"i recently bought the DLO Transpod a few days ago. The sound quality was very poor. Being a classical and jazz enthusiast, i was very disappoined to find the play quality nearly horrendous on these types of music. The bass was horrible and static was most prevalent. The extensions used to connect the Tranpod to my car were a bit bulky and designers used cheap parts. Wherever the manufacture came up with the $100 price tag is a mystery to me, but i cant complain too much for i got suckered into buying the device myself. The concept of the DLO transpod, however, is innovative-as having a docking staion which acts as a ipod charger and transmitter. The concept was executed horribly. My suggestion is to buy a cassette adapter or a car kit which includes one (as i have done) for better sound quality. I personally suggest one of the Belkin auto kits which are nearly 60% less than the Transpodmike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good fit!!!","review":"I got this as a gift. Unfortunately I could not use it. As it seems, the way the thing is designed, and the way my truck is designed I couldn't find a way to make it fit. Where my outlet plug in my truck is right behind my gear shifter. So there was no way the i Pod was going to fit in the holder with out getting hit by the gear shifter. If you tried to use the arm extension they give you the thing bounces around or spins around because the i Pod is too heavy. I have the larger I Pod. It's the video one. So, I would check to see where your outlet is before buying. I ended up getting the Griffin 9501-TRIPCBL iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger. Very happy with it. Sounds great and was easy to use. Good luck and Happy trails...."},{"rating":"1","title":"the whole is less than the sum of its parts","review":"I tried this out for a couple of days, then I got rid of it. Yes, it's an Ipod holder, car charger, and FM transmitter all in one, but the problem with any accessory that does more than one job is it never does any one particular job as well as something that does only that job. First, I had a very difficult time getting the Ipod in and out of the holder; second, underneath the sound, there was always an annoying BUZZ; third, it doesn't automatically turn the I-pod off when you turn the ignition off, something my simple Belkin car charger will do. My advice: don't try for the all-in-one solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"good purchase","review":"I have tried several FM transmitters with no luck. The static was more irritating, so I kept searching for one that had good reception. I thought that because I live near an airport, I would not get good reception, and almost gave up my search. This transmitter is fabulous. The FM station that came upon it when I first turned it on worked with no static, even close to the airport. I would recommend this product to everyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else.","review":"I bought the Transpod for my 4G Nano. It worked OK in my area, but it is WAY too fragile if you are going to be removing it regularly or traveling with it. The cheap plastic neck and fragile wiring made for a crap fit in my Accord. The fragile wiring between the cheap plastic neck and the cradle separated....and the wires broke. I used the thing like 5 hours. Pisser. I bought a Griffin with a flexible neck....and it out-performs this junk in EVERY regard, including price. Skip this one. It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money...","review":"At best, it works.This not a QUALITY sound solution. If you can plug into auxilary jacks on your car radio, that's the better way to go. There is a hiss or high pitched hum that comes through. It seems to be from the iPod hardrive spinning, but I am not sure.The adjustable \\"arm\\" that plugs directly into the car lighter is not a very stationary setup (wobbly). If you try to snug the thumb screw joints to stop it from moving, you can crack the plastic joint. I did just that. I am still trying to fix it. What appeared to be an easy fix with crazy glue is turning into a major repair. The whole joint came apart. I may have to use some of the optional pieces included.Of course, DLO does not appear to have a website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd bought this one first","review":"I tried one of those belkin cassette ipod adapters first, because it was cheapest. Man, what a waste of time. The sound came out of only one speaker and was really weak. So I read some reviews and decided on this one. I didn't want to take a chance on any of the ones with middling reviews.I was too impatient to read the directions, and I just pulled it out of the package, stuck my ipod mini in and jammed the thing into my car lighter receptacle. Its display lit up with \\"88.1\\" so I tuned my radio to that station and voila! clear beautiful music! 88.1 is not an empty frequency where I live, but this gadget blasts right over the interminable yakking that station. No static. No audio bleedthrough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice product...stylish and functional","review":"Ok so an FM transmitter isn't going to have the same crystal clear sound you might get with a direct dock approach (i.e. no wireless transmission)... but for what it is intended to do, this product delivers and lets you enjoy all of your iPod music if, like me, you don't have a fancy new car radio with special iPod input jacks. Bought this for $29 on what must have been a close-out special on Amazon, so it was definitely worth the money. The iPod is going to wiggle a little, and also you can't get the iPod in the docking station without removing whatever skin or protector you use. But it charges the iPod while playing, and unless you're driving offroad, I doubt the wiggling is going to be a big issue. If it bothers you, just find something to wedge beside the iPod so it doesn't jiggle as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darned Good!","review":"Defintiely not the best FM solution for your iPod, but at this price, nothing else comes close!Plays music perfectly clearly, esp. compared to the cheaper ones by Belkin, even if the frequency you set it has a station, it overrides the original station wihtout any cross-playing.Doesn't fit the 5G iPod snugly (this one wasn't built for the 5G), but I never felt that iPod would fall off or anything.You can't get anything getter at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transpod does not last..Very disappointing","review":"The first six months I had my transpod it worked fine. The audio quality is not fantastic, however, with some adjusting of the bass & treble it was fine. However, one morning I plugged in my Ipod & got a lot of static feedback over the channel I normally use which turned into a loud high pitch squeal. I tried tuning into several other \\"blank\\" stations, the high pitch squeal persisted on all of them. When I unplugged the transpod the squealing stopped. I had the product too long to return and am very disappointed that a $100 product lasts barely six months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"I like it. There are additional connector arms included so it can easily be modified to fit your car. There are no real issues except when my cell phone rings or connects I hear a slight buzz for a second, then it goes away. A bit chunky, but it does seem well made. One other issue is I can not connect it if I have a protective skin on my 60gb video unit. The fit it too tight for that. Great signal however."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Mercy","review":"From the first moment I heard this song I have not been able to get the lyrics, the voice, or the man out of my mind. This song is one to remember and the singer definitely deserves a closer look."},{"rating":"2","title":"We like it!","review":"We bought this for the family (Mom, Dad, 10 year old and 7 year old). We brought it home and set it to play mulitplayer with shared remote (because we only have two). That was a mistake. To play skee ball (\\"alley ball\\") you get 6 balls. Well in this mode, you throw one ball. The next player gets the remote and rolls one ball. The next person gets the remote and rolls one ball. By the time all 4 of you roll your six balls, the kids are restless, and I'm half asleep. I thought we wasted our money.The next day I played in single player mode, and that was a lot of fun. Then I played my daughter in Multiplayer, 2 players, each with their own remote. That moved soooo much faster than playing with shared remote.So, to summarize, in single player, or multiplayer head-to-head mode, with individual remotes....VERY fun. Don't even try to play multiplayer with shared remotes. You'll fall asleep waiting your turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own a Wii you really need this game.","review":"I got this game for my kids Wii since the sport package was getting boring for them.The 25 different games available is a good deal overall, and they can play by themselves or together and they work They work very well with the wii wand, the whole point in getting the Wii.

Maybe okay for 5 and under, but the games have preset number of turns and are just a waste of time. Get the Wii Party Games, cheaper and more fun!!!!!!!!!! Some of the games are difficult to figure out how to play. Prizes are as trashy as the real thing. Really felt like I was at the carnival getting ripped off on rigged games... SO in hind site, if you are trying to practice to actually win rigged games at the carnivals...this will give you some practice :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun, Fun","review":"This game is truly like being at a real Carnival. The only thing missing are the real stuffed animals. The skill it takes to play the games is amazing.

The only thing tht will be missing is the threat of rain and pesky insects. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Game !","review":"I bought this for the family after reading the reviews here.

Don't waste your money, buy something else, if I could rate it lower than 1 star I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game EVER!","review":"I don't even want to give this game any stars at all. This is the WORST GAME EVER! You can't win at any of the games and all it did was frustrate the hell out of me and my two kids! I'm sorry that I even rented it. I wish I could get my $4 back. Don't even bother with this game. It is a waste of time and a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that much fun","review":"You can't play a course, just one hole at a time.

Unlike Nintendo Wii products, the avitars are not diversified to reflect individuals of all races and colors, which I find very insulting and offensive. I taught my children and grandchildren diversity awareness.After playing the games and finding out that during certain intervvals, the games freeze. The vocals on the games are depicting of negative attitudes, which I refuse to allow my grandchildren to play with it.Take my advice and don't bother buying this game. I plan on sticking to Nintendo Wii games, even though I found the purchase of Dance Dance Revolution to be entertaining, as well as diversified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with the characters","review":"We were so excited about getting this game to play with our two young children. We love carnivals and fairs and were thrilled when we finally received the game in the mail. But our excitement quickly ended when we were picking our characters and realized that there was no option for people of color. We are a mixed race family and have two members with brown skin. There is NO option other than white for the characters, which is incredibly distressing for us and I'm sure others who are not white. We did see a person of color in the game - he was a carnival worker. I think this sets a bad stereotype for children to see. The company should be ashamed of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wii Game","review":"This game is fun at first but once you play all of the games it gets kinda boring. I was disappointed with the games you can unlock the ones I unlocked so far were similar to the games I could already play. It does have quiet a variety of mini games for the price of the product. It is also much better to play with more than one player."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun","review":"This game is alot of fun... my whole family plays.

I rated it a 3 for average fun for adults and an over all 4 because I do think kids will like this game. I just don't see that it's worht almost $40 for my husband and myself.

It's not really fun to play let alone play it over and over again. Young children might enjoy this, but it's not for everyone. It's a shame because from the reviews I was expecting more, but I think this one will be traded in for something else real soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnatural","review":"I purchased this game specifically to play \\"Ally Ball\\" or as we call it Skee Ball. Using the Wii remote, it was unrealistic & did not feel natural. I was trying to throw the ball as though I was really playing & it wouldn't work. I tried everything. Flicking my wrist, throwing it like a light bowling ball. Very diappointing. I tried a few of the other games too & they felt unnatural too. To make the game work I had to use the Wii remote in a way that was nothing like you would play the game in real life. I plan to give away or re-sell this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun!","review":"Like this game a lot. Yes, there may be some waiting time for the game to load up at first, but once you get going it's not too bad. Me and my friends love playing this game (especially the star shoot out one).

But time is short and it is sliding by.Looking at the Wii ad you would think this game is going to be great fun at parties.Erhhh nope. This game either has controls that are too sensitive making the game impossible or too vague making you wonder what the point is.Usually I can pull something positive out, but really this game just ticked me off as yet another lame attempt to harness the wii controller.Save your money and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could/should have been better","review":"I loved the concept of this game - to string together the wide variety of mini games you find at an old-style carnival. Sadly, this game falters in the execution. Some games are very intuitive while others require clumsy combinations of aiming, locking and less than natural movements.Also, none of the 'charm' of Nintendo's Wii executions are present here - no use of Miis; easy and natural customization of characters; smooth, intuitive flows of motion to make the games work - there's none of that here.Too bad - a great idea only marginally well executed. Suggest you rent first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi my name is Kai and I'm six and a half.

Not sure if this is an overall problem or an us-specific problem.
