Have heard many Boss stereo setups in the past and was impressed with the quality of sound for the money paid, and I am very pleased with these speakers. Sure there are better ones out there, but for less than $20, these can't be beat. If your on a budget and want to improve the sound of your audio system, I would recommend giving these a try.

Makes pulled pork (10 hour smoked Boston Butt) that brings tears to people's eyes, and have won cooking competitions with short smoked salmon (brined, rubbed, smoked for 45 minutes) that comes out incredibly flavorful. I use a probe thermometer to monitor interior temp which keeps very constant. Adding wood chips is a bit clumsy at first (lifting the whole stack) but once you get the groove going, not a big deal. Have done 10 pounds salmon or 25 pounds pork in one session, so this is a crowd pleaser as well.

There are two rods on the grill that were not properly welded.3. The galvanized pan where that holds the stones / charcoals is rusting.As a charcoal smoker it was very good, cooked some good ribs. As a gas smoker or a gas grill it was very inefficient,heat losses everywhere and it took forever to cook something.I will only recommend this product If you want something that will last a year or two while you save some money to buy a better set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage quality...avoid","review":"Brinkmann gas grills are junk quality. My 4 burner Brinkmann gas grill is falling apart after just two years of lite use and being covered. The spot welds on the ignitor came apart and all three gas channel crossovers rusted out. The parts to repair the grill cost me over $50. Brinkmann customer service was rude and unsupportive since these parts are not covered in their paltry warranty time frame. Other parts are also rusting out. There are NO utensil hooks provided so you need to drill holes and provide your own. The design shows no fore-thought and is not user friendly when replacing parts. I guess you do get what you pay for. Best advice is to stay away from this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Packaging!!

It was bought as new and six different items were MISSING from the package (screws, handles, pan, bolts, manual)! I was so embarrassed b/c I already had over 5 lbs of meat thawed ready for my husband to use the new smoker and now I have company coming with nothing for them to eat b/c somewhere along the way, AMAZON didn't do a quality review on all the items included in the package. I am in the process of trying to get a replacement but in the meantime I am out of luck.

In fact, this book contains the proper names of awards, books, movies -- even rivers! Each carefully categorized to make it easy to use. For puzzles constructors, this book offers you an alternative to the usual dictionaries and thesaurus' that are so often used in construction. You'll quickly and easily find new and interesting clues that will keep your fans coming back for more. This a must-have book for anyone who loves crosswords and other pencil puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bobby strikes out","review":"There isn't much to this book. Half of it seems to be\\"Bobby\\" Parker's irrelevant autobiography. Then you get about ten baseball box scores, right out of the newspapers. The rest of it purports to tell how Jackie Robinson broke into baseball, but I couldn't believe a word of it. Did gangsters really have shootouts in the grandstand? Not likely! And if they did, it would have taken twenty more years before the game became integrated. Robinson was required to avoid confrontations, not to hire hitmen to watch his back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Kudos to Parker! This is a fantastic book. Depth, characters, everything to make the package complete. I just finished \\"Game Face\\" by Dr. James Chlovechok which was touted by Cy Young Award-Winning pitcher Dean Chance and it was also terrific. Now I've read two outstanding sports books in the same month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast flowing hard boiled drama, with real characters","review":"The idea of fictionalizing a plausible scenario involving real, historical characters makes for a great book, and Parker certainly knows how to write a lively tale. A war hero comes home from WWII, recovering from wounds and a Dear John letter. He gets a job working as a bodyguard for a rich man, protecting his daughter. Then he gets another job to protect Jackie Robinson. Between baseball action, we get a lot of \\"Spenser-like\\" hardboiled action involving guts and very little extraneous talk. Any fan of the Spenser series will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"who thought I would agree with ng about anything","review":"I wouldn't have thought I did, but as far as his thoughts about this book, I find them right on. As a fan of both baseball and Spenser, it was a foregone conclusion that I would pick the book up, but I wouldn't have predicted how deeply it would move me or how often it would come back to my thoughts. If you like Parker, you'll like Burke, another in the Spenser/Stone/Randall style of protagonists. Add to that thoughtful (if ficitionalized) history of the integration of baseball, and some of the issues about it that might not have occurred to you in only passing thought and you have a total winner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected pleasure.","review":"I have absolutely no interest in baseball. The only reason I picked up this book is that I know that Robert B. Parker is not capable of telling a bad story. The first third of the novel - which gives bodyguard Joseph Burke's background - was interesting, but the story really did not really begin to come alive until Burke started to interact with Robinson. (And, yes, it does echo the Spencer/Hawk dynamics.) While I might have prefered another Spencer, this was a quite enjoyable story very much worth the telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude, Shallow, Neolithic","review":"For those who find fifth-grade reading material a little challenging, this story might be fine. The plot is wrapped up just fine, but the banter is devoid of depth. If you like shallow figures and crude language, combined with dysfunctional interpersonal dynamics, read this. If you are more drawn to quality, leave this book alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I found this book full of nothing! Very poorly written, no suspense, too corney!

For that, I will always be greatful.The books is the story of their life told through a massive collection of jokes that just never stop coming. You don't get an intimate portrait of Gracie and sometimes it is hard to tell when he is \\"puffing on the cigar\\" or not. But you do get a VERY funny and interesting look at the life of two celebrities and most importantly you get a candid and touching glimpse into George's love of Gracie. I can't believe he carried such a flame over 20 years after her death.

For years, his gift sat on the shelf, because I couldn't bring myself to read it, knowing that it was the last gift I'd ever have from him.

Dillon is a macho guy and I loved the way he fell for innocent Laine and because of her became better man. I guess I am a pure romantic but this story was worth the price of the book. The other two stories are enjoyable but this one really spoke to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only helpful to learn English - not to learn Thai!","review":"I'm an American trying to learn Thai and was excited to have this book to supplement my other books and CD's, but it is pretty much useless to me because each illustration is written in English and Thai alphabet - not written phonetically for the Thai word. So if you don't fully comprehend the Thai alphabet, then this book will have no value for you. It's sad because it would have been very easy for them to include the phonetic translation with every picture.

We've never had a devotional to open as much discussion from our children as this one has. The author addresses topics in such as way to get little ones thinking and really involved. This little book has brought true bonding time with our children, where they have openly shared their hearts. It addresses questions they will have about God at some time or another. What better time to address it than when they are still young and open? I highly recommend this book to anyone who has small children or grandchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for my 6 yr old","review":"I have found this book to be inappropriate for a 6 year old. We just read the devotional that tries to parallel the death of Christ by using a made-up story of a boy soldier who is whipped to death in place of other soldiers. Having a child die to explain Christ's sacrifice just seemed too extreme for me. I think Christ's sacrifice can stand alone and doesn't need this fictional horror written alongside it. In general I feel this book is not written for a 6 year old level. I just wanted to caution anyone using this book to preview it before reading it to your child, because you might be blindsided as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"As a new Christian, I am always wary of buying books to read to my children. I want to make sure that the theology is what I want them learning! I found this book to be very theologically sound. My only complaint is that the author seems to sugar coat some subjects. The one that comes to mind is his description of hell. He says that it is a \\"dark, sad place\\". I chose to give my children a more vivid description of hell. I do not feel that it is necessary to withhold any of the Bible from my children. I do not know if that was the author's intent, but I worked around it. I think that if you take the time to really read this and make certain that you are guiding your children through it, it can be a wonderful addition to your devotion time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I see that others have rated this as 4 or 5 stars. We have to disagree. In our opinion it teaches lies. Telling kids that they have to obey God in order to be happy. Not true.

MOHAA was the best FPS out there, but the greedy guys over @ EA Games messed it all up w/this expansion pack. Gameplay is REALLY short, and multiplayer gets a B becausethe Tug Of War maps were cool. New guns really didn't make a difference in gameplay, and could have been put out in a patch. Graphics definitely went down, and you never even get to use the American weapons except for the first level. If you liked MOHAA, buy it, but buy it REALLY cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the Original, did this too.............","review":"It was a very nice addition to the original and great for summer time off from work. There were some usual \\"how in the hell do you do this?\\" things that went on like the original but none that couldn't be figured out without a little time and effort.

I don't do a lot of multiplayer (high-speed net access is unavailable) so I really wanted to play the singleplayer missions. I finished them in one weekend. I know, it's an expansion pack, but I hoped it would have \\"expanded\\" the MOH playing experience. It didn't. Spearhead is basically a sequel, not an expansion like Clone Wars was for Galatic Battlegrounds or all the Sims expansions. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for all FPS fans!","review":"The new expansion is well worth its money! I bought the new game and it has great features, new weapons, and skins. There are 3 new single player campaigns and 10+ new multiplayer maps. The Axis weapons are pretty much the same but if you choose Allies, you get all new weapons corresponding to the player (British, Russian, or American). Graphics are amazing, even on a 32MB GeForce 2 MX card! Recommended for all Medal of Honor and FPS fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but WAY too short!","review":"This expansion falls far short of the great game Medal of Honor. The missions are far too linear. The biggest gripe by far though is that there are only 9 new missions. That wouldn't be so bad, but these missions are extremely short compared to the originals in MoH. The graphics get a boost, but that doesn't make up for the glaring lack of content. I am extremely disappointed. What a let down!

But the opening sequences of this game are basically played in the dark, and if you really think this is an enjoyable game in spite of this, you are welcome to spend your money (but close the curtains and turn up your screen brightness or you won't see ANYTHING for quite some time). Be aware that \\"computer dark\\" is not \\"real dark,\\" where your other senses play an important role). I have found this quite irritating and not much fun so far, though the game is so predictable after a try or two that it would be hard to fail. It's unrealism carried to the tenth degree in the name of realism. Boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! (but short)","review":"This is a fantastic add-on to the original - better graphics and sound effects. Being a military historian specializing in this theater of operations, it is accurate and the sounds effects are superb! EA Still has some challenges with the graphic renderings of the people, but that is really minor compared to the play-abilty of this add-on! The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars is that I would recommend waiting until this got to a [lower] price as it is much shorter than I had anticipated and does not add too much more to the original outside of several more missions/new weapons etc... Still, I recommend buying this if you liked the first. I am also watching EA's website to see if EA is planning to add more to this line - like the Italian theater of operations and perhaps the abilty to choose which side to play on - Axis or Allied... They should release a soundtrack CD to this series - the music is that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It seemed like such a good idea...","review":"For basic storage, I usually use Pyrex or Rubbermaid. But for the truly innovate stuff, Tupperware rules. So, I was really happy to find this, and looking forward to storing my ginger and galangal root in the fridge, and having it stay fresh.The box sucks. The lid is stiff and doesn't fit very well (it's not made from HDPE like most Tupperware lids). The vent holes aren't big enough to let out moisture, which condenses on the sides and runs back onto the food. The ribs on the bottom are shallow and wide, which is probably great for washing the box, but my ginger, kumquats, pear tomatoes, etc fall right between them, right into the water that has collected. Mold city.The little booklet that came with the box tells you how much venting various kinds of produce needs, so you can open one hole, or two, or none.

Sometimes it can be challenging to get the lid off. I've even spilled the entire contects of the box trying to get it off. I'm not sure if Tupperware changed the product - but fair warning... you won't be getting the one you think by reading the description and looking at the photo. The box still works keeping items fresher longer but I'm disappointed in this product and wouldn't buy another one. It's also pricey for the size.

It brings to life one of the most inventive and creative personalities in American history. He is presented in a very positive way, making him a role model that can be an example to younger and older people alike. This book is written in language that is easily understood by young or foreign readers.

Overall, I would say it seems to irritate our Golden slightly less than the Furminator, but it also clogs up far more quickly. I find with just a few strokes I'm already having to stop and clean the fur out of the teeth. Our Furminator also has that nifty little push-button so it's much more convenient to clear out the fur and continue brushing. I would say these are on par with one another, but this is much less expensive, so if you don't mind the minimal inconvenience of having to stop frequently and clean out the teeth, this is a good alternative to the Furminator,"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't realize it would cut the fur","review":"When I bought this I thought that it was going to somehow \\"rake\\" out the undercoat while leaving the topcoat in tact.

Another reviewer stated that it actually pulls out the hair versus the Furminator which seems to cut the hair.The other thing I noticed was how nice and shiny his coat was after using the tool on his back and side.

It is true that this rice flour is the best quality rice flour I've used yet - however, for me the shipping cost as much as the flour, which i found hard to live with. You can get white rice flour at an asian market, much cheaper, and also a fine ground. However, the texture when using the asian white rice flour is a bit gummier - this brown rice flour has a much better texture.

Almost all of my nails look like I keep them cut down to the quick. I am hoping that as they grow out this time they will be stronger and that I will eventually grow out the 2 nails with the split in them and resolve that problem.

Initially I bought only the the buddy system without the bungee attachment but after a few runs I thought it would be worth the extra ten bucks. I love the overall system, however; there will always be some level of pulling depending on your dog. Even though the lunge buster significantly minimizes pulling I would not recommend it for avid runners with back problems. The pulling places some pain on your lower back. I guess you have to weigh the pain on your lower back versus your willingness to compromise your running form with a regular leash. Furthermore it is harder to control your dog because the bungee system is so flexible. Ultimately I am very happy with product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a substitute for proper training","review":"I bought this just so I could review it and know what to recommend to my clients. I do love the system itself, but not this accessory. It won't do anything to discourage a puller and I can't see that it will do anything to relieve the constant shock of a dog tightening up on the leash. Good training will do more good for you and your dog. Buy the system, but leave this accessory off the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea poorly executed","review":"The Lunge Buster is a good idea for the Buddy System (or any leash that you are going to attach to yourself or a bike, for that matter). However, when we received ours and tried it out, it broke on the first lunge. It feels like there is a bungee cord attached to a small ring on the inside, but the ring is now not connected to anything and the bungee is only attached at one end. Until they start making these with a little more emphasis on quality control, I would avoid them. Save yourself some money, go to Home Depot or Lowes, and buy some bungee cord and a couple of connectors - you can probably make the equivalent of the Lunge Buster for under $8. The rest of the Buddy System is fine (so far), but the Lunge Buster is a definite bust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunge Buster Busted","review":"Very excited about the arrival of my Buddy System, bought the Regular Dog System, with the extension and the lunge buster. Didn't connect the extension initially, thought I'd try the regular length lead and the lunge buster. Unfortunately, me and my excited springer spaniel went out through the front door, she made one lunge for the gate, and that was it, lunge buster busted! I think the bungey cord inside the material came away from its anchor point. I have returned it, but will order another and give it one more go. Otherwise, we did a 10k run and I loved the fact that she could move around me and my hands and arms were free, much more comfortable than running holding a lead. Am optimistic that we'll get it all sorted out and it will be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for super active dogs, like Whippets.","review":"My 33 lbs. Whippet is very active, especially at coursing and racing events. After some slight pulling, which lunge buster holds ok, he pulled again with all his weight, and lunge buster fails. The inner elastic rope thorn apart from metal ring to which it was connected. Since outer coating is solid, it was required to make the opening in it, to pull elastic rope and connect it again to ring (pliers needed).So if you own a dog with great pull ability, this is not your product. Or prepare for some DIY-stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but not as shock-absorbing as I'd like","review":"I purchased this to go along with my purple Buddy System (which I also reviewed here on Amazon). This is definitely a must-have if you have the Buddy System and a large dog, if for nothing else than the added length it gives you. As a lunge buster, it hasn't really been effective with my 75lb. Weim; she pulls just as hard and just as much and I still get jolted by her when we're out walking the trails. But it does give the Buddy System some length (which I like since the system by itself is shorter than I'd like) and it does take \\"a little\\" of that whiplash out of her yank."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually like the leash concept loads and was excited to recieve it","review":"The \\"belt\\" portion of the leash was thinner than I expected and I was hoping for more attachement options as I had 3 dogs at the time of ordering.

They go to great lengths to portray stereotypical characters and predictable events which make it impossible for anyone to miss their intended message. While imparting the message of racial tolerance is laudible, it should be done with a little more subtlety (even if this is a movie aimed at an under ten-year-old audience). This movie is a perfect example of a mediocre story which has been raised beyond its potential through heroic efforts in its production.The other major flaw of this movie is the way it ends. It seems that another ten minutes was added to the end of the movie just to provide sufficient length.

This is followed by a selection of recipes and menus that are arranged by railroad in the latter part of the book. This section still continues to provide some historical insight to some of these recipes. All in all this was an enjoyable trip down memory lane for me and a great reference tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book","review":"I bought this copy as a gift.

Because of my husband's job, we moved around a lot, but I'd always meet someone from STL and, of course, one of the first questions was \\"So, where'd you go to high school?\\"Depending upon the answer, one could ascertain the neighborhood that person lived in, a general idea of the family's income, the activities they might have taken part in, etc. Not being a social anthropologist, I hoped that this book would, once and for all, give some real insight into that provocative question.

I love Arnold Lobel's books b/c they have such good messages to teach children about caring, sharing, friendship, thoughtfulness. I feel like I am teaching my child through books about morales without sounding redundant or preachy by saying things again & again myself.

What I like best about them is that Frog and Toad never do anything cruel or spiteful or rude as you see so many other characters in children's books.

Here we see another side of \\"Hitch\\", that of the critic of modern English literature, ranging from the witty 19th century plays of Oscar Wilde (whom he admires), to the leaden prose of the neo-conservative Norman Podhoretz (whom he most certainly destests). Even if you don't always agree with him (I find his views on religion repugnent) you don't have any appreciation of the English language if you don't get SOMETHING out of this book. As a student of the history of ideas I was fascinated by his account of Isaiah Berlin, and there are similar riches here for anyone interested in anglophone writing from the late 19th century until the turn of the current millenium.

Believe me it improves with every viewing. Previous reviewers have already outlined the plot so I'm not going to repeat that. What I will say is that this is a highly original, well-scripted and marvellously well directed film that has many laugh out-loud moments. Look out for a young Michael Horden who has a small role.This really is a political satire long before the word satire came into popular use in the 1960's.

For example, the United States had the knowledge and could have used its position on the Security Council to intervene in Rwanda -- UN officials could have done more, but it's the Security Council members who call the shots and bear responsibility. I can also say with confidence, there is no valid excuse for American Representatives on the Security Council to have turned blind eyes, as they did for months, to the rape of children by UN forces in the Congo. Nor has America introduced Security Council resolutions to change the system which allows this to happen. (Obviously, the other SC members are equally guilty, but they aren't aupposed to be moral beacons of the same magnitude as America.)\\"Broken Promises\\" just thwacks away at the easy target without ever getting to the heart of the matter -- the UN 's member states and their behaviors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far right nonsense","review":"Only useful to members of the loony right who want their prejudices confirmed and those who believe their country is never wrong about anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Size Matter ?","review":"Certainly looks good.

I keep mine in the fridge right next to the OJ and just take a swig with my morning cup of juice to wash the taste away quickly.However, since I've started drinking it, I've noticed my energy levels have increased and I don't feel dizzy anymore (I currently have anemia of pregnancy).

This might not happen for those less sensitive to iron supplements, but for your average sensitive person like me, it's just awful!I don't mind the taste at all, and I brush my teeth right after to prevent the \\"blue stain\\" everyone mentioned. I even reduced the dosage to once a day instead of the recommended 2, to see if that help with the constipation issue. Nope! And it takes DAYS to get over it.

I haven't felt this good in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I am a male endurance athlete who has had iron deficiency and borderline anemia for many years. Year after year my bloodtests would show anywhere from \\"low normal\\" to very low levels of red blood cells and also low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. During and after hard workouts I would feel very tired and would have to rest and recover alot longer than my athletic friends who had done the same workout. I tried everything from eating red meat 3 times a week to taking various types of \\"iron pills\\". Nothing worked until I starting taking Liquid Floradix. This stuff is really amazing! After only about 4-5 days I began to feel alot stronger during my workouts and just had more energy in general throughout the day. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has had a problem absorbing iron using the normal methods. This stuff has really changed the way I feel. Try it--you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty Dishwasher Residue","review":"Sure they're indestructible, but so's the white residue left on them after going through the dishwasher!

It was 400 pages of Danny and his Mother, Gerry's feelings and thoughts. Which were very self-serving. At one point, when asked in a television interview what she would like to say to Danny's victims, his Mother said in essence, feel sorry for Danny. This book was a forum for an overbearing, selfish mother to tell us what a wonderful, sweet child her son was. He murdered, kidnapped, raped 12 year old children! What about them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book could have been so good, but it was such a disappointment! The point-of-view was very one-sided. I am interested in people showing sympathy for the forgotten innocent victims of crime--the criminal's family; however, all this author did was focus on how Gerry Starett wants the reader to feel sorry for her son, Danny. The reader is supposed to feel sorry that Danny, a cold-blooded murderer and rapist of children, is locked in a cold, dirty cell eating disgusting jail food? Give me a break! I wanted to feel empathy for Danny Starett's parents, siblings, wife, and child. Unfortunately, Gerry Starett's constant rantings and the author's failure to handle the subject matter better made it almost impossible for me to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews here before purchase","review":"I picked up this book while wandering through a bricks & mortar bookstore on sojourn with a hospitalized relative. I read lots of \\"true crime\\" but never before have I encountered such a one-sided unabashed apologia for the evil-doer (Danny Starrett.) The authors (the cover says they have previously won a Pulitzer prize - surely THAT book was less biased?) insinuated themselves into Danny's family - but the trade-off in their \\"deal with the Devil's\\" family is obvious. More balanced writers such as Ann Rule can take input from friends and family and give insight into the criminal mind and development, but in this case the unfortunate result is 400 pages of \\"poor Danny and his Momma\\" with short shrift for the victims, their families or loved ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozeville","review":"15 photo's of the killer. Yes, 15. Why? I have no idea. Weasel-faced child killer, Richard Daniel Starrett (Danny to his kin) is a psycho yet a lovable psycho to his family. Mama will go to the ends of the earth to protect her baby even after she finds out what he's done. Seems the wife didn't have a clue that her hubby was up to no good, even with all his strange little habits. The book seems to sympathize with the Starretts (there is even a wedding photo of Danny's parents and one of Danny's mother -- at work!) I know they can't be blamed for their crazy son, but they seemed a bit put off by the murders. Damn those pesky victims, if only they would keep quiet our boy Danny wouldn't be in all this trouble! That's the feeling I got, anyway. If you really like to read True Crime, you should skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"This book was the biggest waste of money! It was all about poor Gerry Starrett and her poor psycho son, who kidnapped and raped several girls, even murdering one. And oh how horrible his life in prison was. Not one word about the victims and their families. This book is very one-sided. I can't believe a family would even have the gall to write a book in defense of a murderous son."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mother's perspective on her killer son","review":"After reading the first three chapters of this book I ended up skippingthrough the rest of it just to get the basic details of who and why Danny killed and molested so many young girls. I found the book to be mostly a ones sided perspective from his mother. She sounded like she was making excuses for her son's horrific deeds. The book kept jumping back and forth between victims and time line of events. I found myself having to re-read the beginning several times just to remember in what sequence the events occured. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they were totally bored and needed some quick entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could This Be your Neighbor?","review":"The authors of this book have researched this book very thoroughly, and their style of writing is excellent. They compare and contrast the views of both the main characters that leave the reader wanting to learn more. This is a page-turner book in which you don't want to put down until it's finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"A status-quo history","review":"I was disappointed greatly with the contents of the book. Hoskin and Gingerich peddle the old Eurocentric view of astronomy. Short shrift is given to the views of scholars such as R.R. Newton and Dennis Rawlins. The presentation of material is very shallow, and the tangled web behind the advances of Kepler and others is not presented. It is like whitewash."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cool.","review":"These corn holders are awesome. There are four pair of holders in the set.

This one is a bit more philosophical than some of the later ones. It was his first book and sets the foundation for his life's work. Very important for those who want to better understand human psychology. His later works focus more on personal/self improvement with more examples of real people and with \\"steps\\" to follow. Not that this one isn't also personally useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book the first time back in High School. It makes a lot of sense out of why some people do what they do when they decide not to think.

I would take this book with a grain of salt though, it makes sense, but at the same time it is just a piece of the puzzle that explains human behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shoes","review":"Exact on the size.

The Perth Institute's research has found strong correlation between an individual's personal financial traits (Prince calls these \\"financial signatures\\") and how they will perform financially in a job setting.This approach really gets down to the bottom line, showing managers how their team aligns with the corporate financial values.

However, I don't love it on me because it seems dated, and it's a bit \\"big\\" for my taste. However, I do love Laguna by Salavadore Dali, which is lighter and brighter by comparison.

All he did was listen to the song lyrics, regurgitate them back with some loose interpretation of what they're supposed to mean, and that's your story behind the song.

No such luck here. Just some KISS fans offering their opinions. The only good thing about this book is the brief, but interesting, interview with Gene and Paul and a couple of nice photos.

Mena Suvari fails miserably at the part of Catherine- she stumbles and acts unevenly in her attempt at playing a powerful woman. Director John Irvin would've been much better off with a no name actress with the will to become Catherine Bourne, one of Hemingway's deepest characters.

I was fine with the factual changes they made, conflating some scenes, adding some facts, etc., but there were a few problems I had.One, the scenes were way too fast. The movie picks up after about thirty minutes and the scenes start getting a little better pacing to them, but overall I thought it was a pretty poorly paced film. I never really felt anchored, and therefore never felt weight in the scenes which were supposed to give weight.Two, I didn't think the acting was fabulous. It wasn't terribly, but those are difficult roles to play.I'd say this probably isn't worth your money.Read the book. It was Hemingway's freakish surreal/fantasy novel before he killed himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The FrontPage 2000 Version","review":"I can't believe I bought this, one of the worst purchases I've ever made. Far from being a step-by-step how to actually set up a web site, it's filled with \\"if you want to do this, then do this, or if you want to do that, then do that.\\" Perhaps I'm more comfortable with programming books that actually step you through a series of ever-increasingly-complex projects in order to teach you how to use the languange. This book reads more like a reference book for those who already know FrontPage, or a page-by-page description of what the controls will do rather than why I would want to use the control in the first place. IMO, it's hardly a beginner's book, and not worth the deeply discounted price it's selling for."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.","review":"This is one of the worst-formatted, hardest-to-use books I know -- and I'm very familiar with technical and instructional writing.

I modified the hole and made the bolt fit and the lock still didn't work because the levers that hold the latch system did not line up correctly. I am really disappointed in this product and I would not recommend buying it.In the end I'm out about $20 for this item. I paid $27.95 to purchase.

Installed no problem but then the issues started. Internally in the lock there is a plasctic flap in the key hole which is very cheap. Was not long before you could not even install the key in the hole due to it sticking. After using some graphite dust I could then get the key in and make it work again. Now I can put the key in but the lock itself will not turn. So now I have a locked tailgate with a locked tonneau cover and no way to get into it. Unless you want to end up screwed like me I would avoid this lock and get something of better quality. Sure wish I did.

Here he tries a similar story in his style. You are better off buying The Arabian Nights in an unexpurgated edition -- yes, that means that when the hero sneaks into the harem, he really does it with the ladies. Its easy to see that Anthony's bold sexual themes derive from the inspiration of his source. However, the book lacks a certain dimensionality to the characters, as if this is an early work when he was an uncertain writer. I don't remember much of the story or plot, and that says it all -- its a throwaway imitation.

Amazed that this 'one season wonder' will be available on DVD but I'm loving it already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Treat!","review":"I vividly remember watching this show with my family when it originally aired. It was bright, edgy, genuinely funny and Billy DeWolf could deliver a line like no one else (with the possible exception of Paul Lynde!) When I saw it was becoming available on DVD I felt a mixture of joy at being able to see it again, and fear that it would be one of those nostalgia pieces best left in it's own era. Let me assure you, it's a treasure. The characters are well drawn and engaging, and the writing is smart. But what makes this a home run for me is the treatment. S'more entertainment has done a beautiful job on these episodes. The colors and sound are crisp and clear, and if you are someone who has been burned by DVD collections where the quality was godawful, this is one time you can buy with peace of mind. This is truly one of the best TV series on DVD.

The little sword is a great improvement from the first Pippin's, which was a little floppy. Ugluk looks very good; his armor is nicely detailed, but the belt is a little loose. His Hair seems to be dyed blond near his scalp. The usual messy Uruk-Hai pony tail looks good on him. His sword slashing and whipping action works well. The scimitar is very good-looking, and so is the whip. Pippins knees bend, which is an improvement. His cape is detailed well. This is an awesome twin pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Uruk-Hai figure out there!","review":"Ugluk is the highlight of this pack,while pippin is just a repainted version of the one from the Merry & Pippin vs Moria Orc pack Ugluk is a all new figure,Ugluk is movie accurate,comes with a sword and a whip and is very well painted,he has many pints of articulation and that's never bad.If you like the character Ugluk and/or the Uruk-Hai(like me)this is a must buy,but buy it just for Ugluk and Ugluk only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugluk is the reason.","review":"This is a great twin pack mainly because it includes Ugluk. The face on Pippin looked really weird but the figure itself was ok. Ugluk on the other hand was awsome! The facial expression he uses is kinda scary which is really awsome about this figure. Ugluk is really the only reason to get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for 3yr olds. has error in game","review":"My child loves Garfield so I figured this game would be perfect for her since it is suppose to be for 3-4 yr old children. It is actually a little to advanced for preschool child as they usually can't read and spell to many words yet. The other reason I give this game 1 star is because there is an error in one of the sections. You are suppose to count the objects and then drag the matching number to the box. There are 3 sets of objects. On one page there were 6, 10,9. Well both me and my husband both with our daughter counted two sets of 9 objects but the was a only a 10 left to drag to the last box. This particular page was always wrong because there was no matching number even though there was suppose to be a number that matched. This is very frustrating to a preschool child!!!

I did not pay very much for the game maybe this is why it was so cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"changed my life","review":"It was really heartening to know that I could learn a language without a teacher at my advanced age.

At this level I would suggest \\"Japanese in 10 Minutes\\" (hardly true, but it does have stickers you can put on the objects in your house to teach you the names of common objects) and \\"1000 First Words in Japanese.\\" You are learning on a very basic level here on the first set of lessons---lots of repetition. The important thing: never miss a single day, even if it's only a few minutes. Also: as the lessons progress they get harder, and it gets impossible to listen and do tasks at the same time. You need to sit in a chair and concentrate. Don't be afraid to repeat the lessons.

If you are have a real good eye for movies you can alreayd pick out then ending by the actions in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Once that happened, I wasn't really interested. Edward Burnz just is so wooden to me and uninteresting. I just couldn't get behind his character. Rachel Weiz looked beautiful as always, but they really gave her nothing to do. Watching her seduce the VP of the Bank was a fun.This movie is real predictable. I watched it with a friend who never really into movies like I am, and she figured everything out from the first five minutes. Now that is bad.Dustin Hoffman was great in his role and he seemed to be having fun playing the big and bad. Should have been more scenes with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"The plot is both illogical and incredibly formulaic. It's like they strung a bunch of overused gangster movie cliches together. In general, the characters are all \\"types\\" of one kind or another. Irritating cardboard cutouts yapping cliches at each other.Dustin Hoffman has been in some great movies, but this is a low point. Although he is the only actor in the movie who at least attempts to be original. You can see that he's trying to bring something to his character, but he just seems to be trying too hard.If you want to watch a movie about con artists, try the brilliant House of Games, or The Grifters, which is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The con is...on you!","review":"I liked Ed Burns \\"Sidewalks of NY\\" more than this one. Yet Confidence is the kind of movie you'd watch on a boring sunday afternoon, when there's nothing good on TV. It wants to be smart, but doesn gets there. The writing is poor, and motivations of the main characters are weak. Would you run a scam operation from your own home? They use their place to do cons, thinking the guy will be too scared to come back!!!dusting Hoffman doesn't sell it as a mafioso, but with such bad writing, he did what he could. This one movie that should have never been done. With so many better con movies out there like Matchstickmen, Ocean's Eleven and the like, we didn't need Confidence. Christopher Walken's \\"Scam\\" with Lorraine Bracco (from the Sopranos) is a much enjoyable and better movie than this one. At least in Scam there's chemistry between the leads, and strong motivations for their actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Confidence!","review":"I gave this film one star only bec/ I didn't seem to have the ability to give it a negative rating or indicate an imploding star.

I love his work in general but this blows.This flick tries to be post-modern/gleaming hip and fails miserably.We watched most of it then gave up half an hour before the end; I rarely do that and I love a good crime/con flick (Double Indemnity!

As far as entertainment value goes, there\`s much worse, given that the acting is actually decent (even if the characters are cardboard), the soundtrack is alright and director James Foley manages to deliver some flashy camera angles.

The acting is up there with the rest.Rachel Weisz is very talented and Paul Giamatti is becoming a real true Actor. Dustin Hoffman, Ed Burns and Andy Garcia are as good as the usually are. The Music is fun and has smart as the movie is. I think it is great that they used european groups such has FC Kahuna. The Plot is intressting, and the narration also.But to me this movie could have been AMAZING but it wasn't it was great.Something is missing maybe some lack of complex or an end wich was a bit exagerated (it's a very good end but a bit too much), clearly something is missing.I recommend this movie and all the other James Foley's . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite the good work of Weisz and Giamatti, this stinks.","review":"Lackluster con movie that steals its angles other than create a new ones. Ed Burns can't act his way out of his New York stereotypical character, and Dustin Hoffman is really not in the movie. The only actors who did their jobs were Rachel Weisz who probably gave the best performance in this turkey of a con film because she at least keep you interested in her character and Paul Giamatti, who would have made a much better leading man than Ed Burns because he at least knows how to act.Other than the good performances of Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz , the movie really stinks.

Ed Burns does a great job as the lead here but is let down by a script that ultimately disappoints in every way possible. Dustin Hoffman is great in a role that we never have seen him do before but with only fifteen minutes of screen time, he fails to make an impact. To say that Rachel Weisz is the only good thing about this film is an understatement because she is the best thing about it.

Unfortunately, vetrans of this genre may see the \\"surprise\\" coming long before it is officially due. And once the oh-I-didn't-see-that-one-coming trap is sprung, you don't want to look too closely at how the pieces of the puzzle fit together; cause they don't. Interstingly, a tag line of the movie is that con games don't hold up if closely scrutinized. The writers should have taken their own advice.For a great example of the con game genre check out \\"House of Games\\", starring Joe Mantegna.

(Unless you're looking for answers)","review":"This book is a never-ending dialogue between the hokey Chris the Christian, and Sal the Seeker. This book constantly contradicts itself, and is boring to read. Kreeft made a very poor attempt at making the dialogue format amusing; this would be better as a high school text book. The book avoids the question of, \\"If there is a God, why is there evil in the world?\\" by saying that God didn't make evil. When Sal says that Chris said that God made everything, Chris says that evil isn't a thing. Kreeft obviously doesn't believe that intangible objects are not a creation of God. Fair enough. However, he said in the chapter prior to that that God put the feeling of beauty in us. Last time I checked, beauty is an intangible object.

It's supposed to be book a book that answers tough questions about christianity. It certainly asks tough questions like the one about whether or not Jesus' Ressurection really took place or not, but the thing is that it does NOT answer these tough questions.

Kreeft, who is a master at creating Socratic-like dialogue and employing logic to bring about a point, has created a series of dialogues between Sal the Seeker and Chris the Christian.The dialogue is not meant to simulate real-life conversation, but employs wit, irony, and logic to bring about the points that Kreeft wants to make - namely proving that God exists, explaining the problem of evil, Heaven, Hell and the other \\"big\\" questions.For those that do not care to read dialogue-centered books this will not be for them.For those seeking answers to such question, however, they will find that Kreeft does a masterful job of raising the tough questions and leading one to the true answers.

One use I had was to store #4-#10 bolts, nuts, washers, etc. & then set it upright on a shelf or in a tool bag to carry to jobs. #4-#6 washers are pretty small & thin and the way the lid flexes I think they would migrate from their intend compartment.There are 6 compartment dividers included but there are 9 positions that accept dividers.

Well, I guess I could call Middlesex, England but what, exactly, are they going to do to fix my speakers over the phone? The call and the shipping would probably cost me more than I would spend to get a replacement set of the same quality.So, as usual, buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stopped working in ten minutes.","review":"For the ten minutes that it worked, I was amazed at the quality of the sound and aesthetically pleasing appearance. It suddenly made a squealing noise and stopped working. I have read reviews of similar products where my experience was a common occurrence. I read no reviews about this model where there were complaints about defects. Maybe I was merely unlucky. I requested a replacement.

Distortion from the minute that it was hooked up. Obviously I had a defective unit, maybe a nondefective unit would have been acceptable at the time. I was not willing to take a chance on a replacement, so I did some research and purchased the Zvox Mini. Blows all the made for ipod speakers out of the water. Sure, I will have to buy a dock to charge my ipod...but I have QUALITY sound...not the hollow and tinny sounding music I have heard from other units. Cannot say enough about the Zvox...check it out-zvoxaudio.com.......many published reviews included on their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT","review":"ordered the Altec Lansing inMotion and the logic 3 at the same time as I needed to sets of portable speakers. The logic had better bass and more volume. It doesn't have an adapter for my 60iphoto but can fit in without. These are small speakers and you shouldn't expect to match your home stereo, but they are the best protables I've heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible piece of junk","review":"i ordered this based on positive reviews that i read, here and elsewhere. however, when i got it, i could not believe the terrible sound and really cheap production quality of this machine. it's a total piece of junk--i would not pay 10 dollars for it, let alone over 80! mine is on it's way back to amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"For portable speakers for an iPod, this is an alright buy. However, after i had caried it to 2 or 3 places, and i made sure it was packed tightly so nothing would mess up, i found out that the AC adapter stopped functioning. This was bad because now I am left with speakers that can only play with batteries. Another problem with this speaker system is that its \\"3D surround sound processor\\" is not very good. No matter how close I am to the speakers, I do not change the 3D setting because it sounds the same, if not worse, as the normal setting. There isn't much point to buying specific speakers for an iPod anymore because Apple has come out with an iTrip costing $20-$25. This small device plugs into the iPod and boardcasts the iPod's music onto a radio nearby very easily. All the listener needs is a radio, and this will cost far less than the speakers. So i recomend not purchasing this, and just purchasing an iTrip if you want to hear your iPod on portable speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logic3 i-Station Dock and Speaker Station for ipod","review":"Bought the 60gb ipod and love that.

One of the more interesting features is that speaker and sub-woofer units can be stored away in a very compact fashion, making it extremely easy to take along when on holidays or business trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice look, awful sound","review":"Comes with firewire and USB cables, nice and compact, but the soundis awful.

What a pain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first but ultimately a disappointment","review":"I purchased this system over Amazon several months ago, and initally had a positive impression of the speakers. Overall, the device looks and feels pretty cheap, but it was doing the job. Now it simply has stopped working, and I was relying on being able to use it for business presentations overseas. For the price, I feel that the quality just isn't there. And when you can't rely on the very basic level of functionality then it's really not worth buying. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable travel companion","review":"I spend a lot on time on the road, and it is always a pleasure to plug in the i-Station so I can enjoy the music in my hotel rooms. The sound is amazing for the size and price, although it does hit its limits at higher volumes. It can use more lower frequency response, to play the notes in the lowest octave. Also limited by the size is the stereo imaging. If only the speakers can be separated.I bought another one for my 85 year-old mother, sent along with my older iPod, to use as a jukebox. I think this is a great application for someone in her situation, because she would not need to fumble with all the CD's. What would be great improvement would be a screen that shows the display in larger type, so an older person, (including myself) can read the information without putting his nose on the iStation. Or better still, buttons to control the iPod while plugged in."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this!!!","review":"I am surprised by the rave reviews this item received. I thought the sound was terrible. The $25 boombox I got from Walmart sounds 20 times better than this. I can't see paying $80 for something that has such poor sound quality. Maybe if you just want it to listen to once in a while at low volumes it would be okay. It is not a system for everyday listening.I also tried the JBL on stage, which is much much better--but still sounds a bit tinny. But if you are trying to keep the price down, I'd say spend the extra $20 or so dollars and get the JBL--JBL does not have a battery option, but it is a small system--not much bigger than the logic.I ended up purchasing the Altec Lansing im7, which is much better and totally worth the extra money. I also have the klipsch ifi, which is not portable but it blows all the other systems away if you don't need portable (and is only $200 at Costco.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logic 3 I-Station Dock & Speaker","review":"Love this unit. It is perfect for traaveling and taking my kind of music wherever I travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm with the naysayers - these speakers are a waste of money","review":"I got these speakers because of the positive reviews. I chose not to read the negative ones. Unfortunately, the naysayers were right. These speakers look cool but are not good. The sound is tinny and weak and if the volume is turned up the unit starts to shake. I didn't spend extra money to buy cd-quality music so I can listen to it on these speakers that make the music sound like it is coming from a 10 times re-recorded casette. The unit is also not as small as the picture suggests because it is supported by a folding out stand in the back (sort of like a standing picture frame). Also, if your Ipod has a case, it has to be removed or Ipod will not fit in the dock. That problem can be solved by using the included dongle. Overall, the sound quality was so bad that I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, but disappointing altogether","review":"Buyer Beware!I ordered the Logic3 based on favorable reviews from other readers as well as the reasonable price. I was pleased with the ease of use and setup as it took me less than 20 minutes to start playing music with my iPod mini. However, after playing it for 3 hours with AC power, the speaker station stopped playing altogether. I could not reset any options and it froze my iPod, too. I had to let my iPod battery run out and then re-charge it in order for it to work again.I tried to use the speaker again a few days later, and the same thing happened again - it stopped playing music altogether. Again, this was on AC power. I was frustrated after not finding any hints for resolving this issue in the guide book, so I decided to return it. I am now looking for another system, and I am willing to pay more for a reliable one, but I am hesitant to do so based on my experience with the Logic3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy for the Price","review":"I should say that I am happy with the purchase so far. The speaker system works as described and the sound range on the speaker is also appreciable. It encourages me to actually use my Ipod video to watch movies. Earlier, even though I have a 5th generation Ipod, I used it largely for audio only purpose. But now, I am using it for watching Videos as well. At a close range, it makes a personal video system on the table or on the lap. On Batteries, it does not run very long but I don't consider it as a problem as I use the DC adopter a lot.I would have given it 5 stars had it also charged the batteries ( it charges the Ipod but I am talking about the Unit batteries )while running on external power. But, I guess that is asking for too much.You don't get an auditorium filling sound range from this little unit but for an office room or for a family room, this is sufficient. This is also a great party jukebox for family parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"I asked for the i-Station for Christmas and when I got it, I found that although it's a nice-looking speaker system and very easy to use, the sound quality is incredibly poor. Even using the \\"3D\\" option, it was like I was listening to music in a tunnel. The sound was very muffled - I get much better quality just hooking my iPod into my computer. It's a nice product, but not worth the money if you're looking for a good sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"I-Station Dock","review":"This product is everything I thought it would be.

Also you do not have to remove your belt clip to slide unit into the \\"i-Station\\" to operate. You remove the universal base holder that comes installed (very easy)and slide and snap in your model base holder (four styles provided).

It's not that grace doesn't exist or that we can't be more mindful of instances of grace in our lives...it's just that reading the blurb about the book gives you just as much info as reading the book itself.

Grace is real and is wonderful, but Ms. Richardson doesn't seem to know where it comes from. Ms. Richardson begins the book with a personal story that doesn't mesh with timelines discussed, and so from the beginning, I got a sense that this had been hurriedly put together. The credibility of the author is questionable with such confusion. All philosophies are referenced in a way that comes off as being political correctness at it's worst. This book is a narrative on eastern philosophy for the most part. The Purpose Driven Life is the only Christian reference I noticed in her references, and in listing that, the author's name was misspelled. \\"Rich\\" Warren rather than Rick Warren.

This CD belongs in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who was the editor and what is his problem?","review":"I believe that whoever edited this doesn't seem to be very fond of electronic music. He says that the samples were good but uninspired.Take a look at all of today's music and tell me that all the other bands of america are uninspired. I think that after about 400 years of recorded music (scores, records, tapes, etc...) you can't hope to find something new every time. What's so great about the Avalanches and other electronic persons is that they take that and recycle it into something new.I thouroughly enjoyed the album and would suggest it if you like any Electronic music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avalanches reducing to snowball...","review":"Openings can be deceptive...My first exposure to the Avalanches and the title track is a whimsical, sugar-pop delight with the Madonna Holiday sample slotting in to perfection. Unfortunately the remains of the album disappoint as it album dissolves into a mish-mash of over-elaboration and mis-direction. Like me, if you like your oeuvre deconstructed, a little darker and starker, I would suggest any Massive Attack and/or Dummy by Portishead (with the wondrous gloom-diva, Beth Gibbons)."},{"rating":"1","title":"too busy","review":"The avalanches are all over the place.

It was shipped together with two other items (36\\" clamps). None of these items were wrapped/protected at all.

This DVD is enjoyed by both parents and kids. But, there is only ONE Christmas episode on the DVD. Even though the whole DVD is considered Christmas, and all of the ending credits are the Christmas theme, only the first episode is Christmas. Still, it was funny and entertaining with lots of DVD extras. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good DVD but buyer beware","review":"I will echo some earlier sentiments and express my disappointment that there is nothing new to this DVD. It's great for any Phineas & Ferb fan, but I probably would not have bought it had it been clear that the Christmas episode is one my kids have seen a number of times. It really was marketed to come across as something all new. I was curious why the box didn't give a more detailed description of the Christmas show and this explains why; people would instantly recognize it's the same episode as seen on TV. Good DVD with a lot of bonus features, but Disney should be a little less ambiguous with their title releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Special on DVD","review":"This DVD contains the Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation tv special from 2009.

This is not, it's the Christmas episode from last year along with a few additional old episodes.

Don't be put off Caroline Graham by this book though. The rest of her works are outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wasn't a very good ghost story.","review":"I bought this book with high hopes after reading everyone's comments here, but when I read it I was very disappointed. it wasn't scary, it wasn't spine-tingling, it didn't make me scared to turn out the lights and go to sleep. The reader never gets a sense of what happened or why. I like ghost stories that can really make you worry when the lights are off, and this one just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"It was somewhat interesting in the beginning... but then the story seemed to go nowhere. I found the characters irritating. I didn't buy them as people. THEN, the book ended about (what I felt was) half way through the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"I found this book rather boring. If there is a ghost story in this book it is very cleverly hidden. I kept waiting for ghost to appear, and I waited until the very last page and got nothing. I would suggest reading this book only if you can find nothing else to read, but keep your expectations low."},{"rating":"1","title":"true cliffhanger","review":"I was disappointed by this book for two reasons. First, the plot was told in a choppy stilted manner. Also, the book just seemed to stop on the last page rather than come to a plausible ending. However, the book seemed very well researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Ghost Story","review":"I bought this book after reading one of the author's other books, The Heart Of A Witch. It is a ghost/poltergeist story. I enjoyed the book, although I don't think it is as good as The Heart Of A Witch. It is definitely in line with a lot of the \\"Ghosthunter\\" shows that are all over the cable stations these days. If you like those, then you will like this because the young couple who are the hero/heroine of this story, rent a \\"haunted house\\" in a small town in the hopes of finding imperical, documented proof of a haunting. At first they seem like a happily married couple, but as the book goes on, you see that things are not what they seem in their marriage -- just like in the house. There is a definite parallel there. The book is good, not great. I have the author's third book, My Soul To Keep and I am looking forward to reading that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saint Etienne Remixed to the point of insanity!","review":"This CD set takes a whole bunch of DJs, Producers and Saint Etienne songs and reworks it all into a cool mixture of styles from Euro-Trash dance mix to way-out there Aphex Twin space walks.These are truly new tracks - some minimally based on the original tune (a single phrase from Sarah might be heard) some more so, but none seem to be just the original track with a beat added.If this is the only St. Etienne CD your collection is missing, you better get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR ST.

Electronica's subtleties escape me, and you should take this review as being from a non-fan of electronica.If you're a St. Etienne completist, it might be worth a buy.If you're a St. Etienne fan (like I am), I'd skip this record. The arrangements never go anywhere and they sap all of the vitality and quirkiness from the original songs. I kept listening to both discs in hopes that one of the mixers appeared to be a St. Etienne fan out to have some fun and to entertain the listener, but it didn't happen. If it takes longer than 6 minutes to do a remix, somebody at the record label has given you too much space in a compilation and you couldn't do anything with the song if given 6 hours if you couldn't do it in 6 minutes. The sweet coy songs of St. Etienne sound bloated, endlessly repetitive and sterile here, and not worth a second listen. This one went straight to the CD drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"variety rules","review":"While all the remixes on this set are worthy, it's a definite buy solely for \\"Burnt Out Car\\", which is the greatest lost pop record I've yet heard. Even if that doesn't tickle your fancy there's plenty more here to amuse. A nice record (in all senses)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casino Classics","review":"Casino Classics is a remix album of Saint Etienne and not a very good one. Many tracks sound like overly long extended mixes that just go on and on without aim. The sound of the mixes also sound very 90's and therefore dated. I love Saint Etienne and I usually like remixes but not these. The booklet is alright with well-written liner-notes by Kris Needs and some blurry photographs that seem to have been shot by an amateur. Allmusic gave this remix album 3/5 but to me this is a bit too high. 2/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classics......yeah right.....","review":"This is only worth the money if you don't already have the 2-disc version of \\"too young to die\\" singles collection. The first disc is the bonus disc that came with the singles collection. Some of the remixes were ok, but there were just too many instrumentals. Most of side two is the same. Most of the remixes bear no resemblance to the original tracks, and seeing as how most of the vocals are also gone, it's really hard to enjoy. If you like extended versions or radically remixed VOCAL remixes, then this is not for you. You'd be better off searching for the individual singles and finding the one vocal remix on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Very short on meat.

The book claims to be about 3 months aboard a nuclear submarine but the author really was only on there for 1 week. Many pages were filled with giving us the backgrounds of the sailors and every african american on board. The author certainly made sure his political viewpoints were revealed. Very superficial, very very superficial. I wish I could get my money back. I guess I should of known what it would be like as the writer is a writer from Time Magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Submariner","review":"I enjoyed this book greatly. This reminded me of my time on board a submarine in the 80's. I was on an SSN, however many of the experiences were the same. The memories were the same.

It does have some very benefical graphics, guns, and music. But the women and other characters look like mutants when seen up close. Also it requires Directx 8.1b. This is a drag because most people will have to upgrade to use the system. I would reccomend FPS games like Star Trek elite force and Goldeneye. But i am old school. If you want my advice, check to see if your system can handle DX8.1 first. If you don't it will cost you. (i have a p4 and it still messed up my system)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, no sir I didnt like it.","review":"I just have one thing to say. I ran up to 5 different enemies in the first level, while blowing their friends away, and they did nothing once I ran behind them. I had time to switch from the SMG, to the pistol, point it, decide to put the silencer on, put the silencer on and finally kill them. Any game with AI like this should be banned. I thought rainbow six was bad with the AI that wouldnt react to their friends getting killed right in front of them but that was 5 years ago, EA has no excuse. I give it a second star because it is Bond and is one of the few games to actually use pixel shading. Avoid this game. Just get the demo and you'll get the best this game has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the game is anything like the Demo, you're in for a blast","review":"I played the demo and loved it! It handles well and is easy to control and the action is terrific! I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed No One Lives Forever. It seems very similar. You can find the Demo on Gigex.com.

I got this game for a friend's birthday. I figured \\"It's another Bond game, it's gotta be good.\\" Boy was I DEAD wrong. From the moment the gameplay started, I knew this game was not what I had bargained for. The controls were clunky and buttons were placed in bad spots and the weapons had to be cycled through rather than set to hotkey buttons; the graphics were good but not great; and the levels all had some switch you'd have to pull somewhere in the level to open one of the thousands of locked doors. Now I've got to go now because I think I'm going to puke from giving a BAD gift for a high price. Overall, I can't reccomend this version of the game to anyone. James Bond should stick to consoles if the PC ports are going to turn out like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA games ...","review":"EA games cant make a FPS. Rare was the best, and the only competitor is Bungie. Goldeneye will always be the best FPS out there.

Thanks for your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very underrated game","review":"Online all I see is people attacking this game for being simplistic and a disgrace to the bond games. Personally, I think the game is great. While the loading times for some levels (especially the Japan one in the demo) are absurd, for the most part the game is fast-moving and exciting. It has all the women, gadgets, and stealth you would expect from a bond movie as well as great graphics. It also has some truly unique sections - for example, in one level you must suction-cup up the side of a building without being seen. Buy if you're a bond fan at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play it on PS2. PC version is trash!","review":"I loved this game on the PS2, so I bought it for the PC. In the PS2 version there are driving missions and unlockable characters and its really a lot of fun. In the PC version there are NO driving missions at all. In fact, the game is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! Its like someone played the PS2 version then re made it for the PC, only they had a very vague idea of how the missions went and forgot to include driving missions. On the PS2, the last mission is actually hard, while on the PC it is the EASIEST THING EVER! If you want this game, get it for PS2 where it is actually fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is too bad","review":"This game could have been a lot of fun if they would have let you play Mutiplayers without having to conect to the internet, First what if you don't have the internet second what if you can't conect right them which is most of the time, Me and my buddy had so much fun with the last one we played against each other all the time it was a blast..

Why the hell, in 2002, would EA release a game where you can't use a gamepad or controller? They did this with Nightfire. Although I did play some of the game and thought it was slick, good designs and all, it was maddening trying to do it using the keyboard. I beat this game on XBOX 5 years ago and have to say it was the hardest of all Bond games I've ever played. But it still was a lot easier than trying to play the PC version with a keyboard only. I've got better things to spend my time doing. THis is going in the garbage. Good thing it was free. Now, to the XBOX360 I go to play BloodStone.

A secluded island, a finite cast of suspects, and Dalgliesh as usual. I enjoyed the story, but was a little annoyed at the romance. Perhaps I missed something in the earlier books that brought us this far? I guess romance isn't James' forte, but mystery as usual is. Another good story and worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lighthouse","review":"I have not read this one yet, but I have never read a P.D.

So I am quite confident I will also love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Writing; Solid Plot; James Makes It Look Easy","review":"Would that all writers of mystery used words as well as PD James does in The Lighthouse. James is, for one thing, notable for her skill at keeping her characters fresh and her plots stimulating. In this book, a mysterious death occurs on a secluded, isolated island that is used as a getaway by the rich and powerful. James richly describes the island and the people, and with her words is able to show you so much more about her characters and their motivations than she actually tells. Many years ago, James introduced the concept of literature as mystery, and she can still be counted on to deliver a satisfying novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"P.D. James \\"The Lighthouse\\"","review":"If you've read Ms James, you won't be disappointed. A typical British mystery written so that Americans can understand.

The plot just plods along and the resolution is so contrived as to be risible, with a feverish Dagliesh coming to his conclusions in ways he never has before. Read all the others, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book deserves a 10 star rating","review":"I just got done writing a fairly long review, so I'll be brief with this one. I highly recommend this book, as I recommend all of P.D. James' books. If you want an author who keeps things fresh and entertaining, then you will definitely enjoy this book. Maybe this isn't James' strongest book, but that doesn't matter. She's a master, and she deserves well above four stars. For these people below me to knock it down makes me wonder if they really know what a dearth of great authors are out there. But I can see their point, since James has set the bar so high with all her books before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I am a fan of P.D. James' previous mysteries, but the Lighthouse is a disappointment. The new characters don't engage the reader and the whole idea of a murder in an inaccessible location has been done better by others. The sub-plot of making Dagliesh ill is handled clumsily (could Ms. James have spared us the melodrama and just given him the flu instead of a trendy disease?), the 'reveal' of the murder is a letdown and the arrest of the murderer seemed to be written for a Hollywood production (Vaseline???)Stubenville, Metro Philadelphia, PA"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little like Nebraska","review":"My husband and I listened to The Lighthouse on a drive through Iowa and Nebraska. We are both fans of P.D. James, and thought this would help pass the time on a long drive.

I hope Ms. James returns soon to her normally-fine writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterfully Written","review":"I would have gone with 5 stars if not for the first 80 or so pages.

I highly recommend her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"After the brilliance of Death In Holy Orders (to my mind Baroness James' finest book) there have been a pair of disappointments: The Murder Room and now The Lighthouse. Both novels suffer from lackluster plotting and an absolute absence of anything even remotely resembling humor.I wrote elsewhere that Baroness James is so busy elevating the murder mystery into literature with a capital L that she can often over-reach: the occasional literary allusion to Anthony Trollope can be fun, but eventually the poetic allusions start to feel shoe-horned in to the dialogue.To be fair, the book begins well. Baroness James is very skilled at creating closed environments and establishing relationships among a diverse set of characters. But before too long I detected the beginnings of a Big Finish, the kind of thing that Baroness James tries for on occasion, and the book just turned very tired and mechanical as the plot ground to a close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogically Arranged and Hard to Use","review":"My child is struggling with Spanish right now, and a lot of the problem has to do with this book. Most modern textbooks are arranged so that they tell you what they will teach you (vocabulary and concepts list for the chapter), they teach you (lesson), and then they tell you what they taught you (review). Spanish for Mastery 1 is not arranged in this way. It is very difficult to find vocabulary and concepts in this book by scanning the beginning and end of the chapters.

When I first got one the sword broke and I had to return it. The sheath is a good length so the sword blade doesn't stick out. His coat is big, but it makes him look more rugged.

I bought this book by sight, not reading the back - believing it was a new Nora Roberts book. NOPE. It was two books she wrote for Harlequin back in the early 80's. To read these is like pulling teeth. The books are very dated in their writing. And as for romance? There is none. In the first book, the character of Jake is made out to be the male romantic lead, but comes across as a male chauvinist pig. He's always forcing himself on Samantha. And Samantha just takes it. I love Nora Roberts, but not this. Save yourself the trouble and pass this book up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Nora Roberts??","review":"I bought this book because I like to read everything that Nora Roberts writes. I have read some of her early books, and have enjoyed them. However, if you've read any of Nora's books, you would hardly believe she wrote these. The other reviews are accurate. The heroines are not even likeable--they are silly and tempermental. How can anyone fall in love with them?? The heroes are inscrutable--so much so, that when they proclaim their love for the heroine on the last page, the heroine is shocked! No wonder, because they don't act like men in love, they act live cavemen ready to drag the woman off to the cave and \\"ravish\\" her. These stories are so old fashioned, they seem like they were written 30 or 40 years ago, not 20 years ago.

Do 47 year old women go around calling 35 year old male boarders darling? And everyone was dear with a pat on the hand. I have a 47 year old daughter and she certainly doesn't act like that, nor do I.

I can't think of another Chinese children's story as popular outside of, \\"The Story about Ping.\\" And this one is hands down the better of the two.The original was a retelling of a Chinese folk tale about 5 Chinese brothers (maybe from the late 1930s), and I don't think the author was of Chinese descent.

I always loved that book - not for its pictures but for its message. It is about family and I was kind of surprised that there were no parent in the new version. After reading Seven Chinese Brothers, I still like the original the best. I agree with another reviewer that we try to shield our children from everything instead of discussing things with them. Stories are not just meant to be read but discussed. It is true that the pictures in the current version are more colorful and more appealing to the flash and dazzle to which many of our children have become so accustomed. But try having the children focus on the message and not the beauty or lack thereof of the messenger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ai Ya! This is a great book!","review":"I'd say for 6 years and up.

I went to the specialty shop up the way from the chain record store I was working in and got Runaway Boys on an import 45. My boss and I spent the evening playing that instead of what the powers that be wanted us to.So here many years later, Setzer has returned the music he loves. And the results are great. This is not a sterile homage to Sun's rockabilly years, but a wonderful interpretation of some songs well know and not so well know. The ones I'm familiar with, like Blue Suede Shoes hum and crackle with the same energy of the Carl Perkins original. The songs I wasn't familiar with are just a joy to listen to. Brian and his sidemen must have had fun making this record and that shows. Buy, listen and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' Right","review":"Brian Setzer has always excelled when he kept things simple.

The sound is very retro-authentic. I love the way they tried to use the same or equivilant instruments on these recordings. It truly sounds cool. As a musician, I find very little inspiration from most bands today, not so with Brian and his crew. They ROCKKKK in every sense of the word. Bottom line...Like Rockabilly...Get this, you'll love it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is fantastic","review":"I really hope he puts out one of these per year. Brian has managed to take the authentic sound and energy of mid 50s rockabilly and record it with totally modern sound quality. Unlike his offerings with Stray Cats and 68 CBS, this cd has no modern rock or punk edge to it. This really does sound like it could have been recorded in 1954. But the one thing that has always bothered me about music recorded back then is the tinny, flat sound that even the best remasters tend to have. But here we have the best of both worlds; Authentic, heartfelt rockabilly in big booming 3-D sound. Take this home, crank it to '11' and try try not to smile and tap your foot. I dare you."},{"rating":"2","title":"+ 1/2 stars...A Return To His Roots","review":"For this 23-song collection of Sun Records tracks from 1954-57 (both big hits and obscurities), Brian Setzer put the big band orchestra aside and stripped things down to just himself, drummer Bernie Dresel, bassist Mark Winchester, and piano player Kevin McKendree. The results are pure magic. Setzer captures the nuances of rockabilly, yet still manages to put his own unique stamp on the proceedings. Recorded and mastered in just three weeks, Setzer has created one of the most enduring albums of his career and sure to satisfy old Stray Cats fans who were waiting for him to return to his rockabilly roots. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"FAN-FREAKIN'-TASTIC!!","review":"It's always great when Brian Setzer returns to rock-a-billy.

The band is Brian (of course), Bernie Dresel (still), fabulous Mark Wynchester on bass (his bass you can hear on Vavoom, Dirty Boogie and 68 Comeback Special,...) is back again. Jim Hoke played sax and Kevin McKendree piano.Album or compilation is dedicated to legendary Memphis Sun Records. You can hear covers of such classics like Blue Suede Shoes, Red Hot, Real Wild Child and covers of songs that are known mostly to true rockabilly fans (Peroxide Blonde..., Kenny Parchman's Tennessee Zip,...) On few song The Jordanaires (Elvis' backing group) are singin', and Gene Simmons (of Peroxide Blonde and...fame) is on backing vocals. Brian even got the credits for this song! This is 100 % rockabilly. Check the originals!

Where's the fire Setzer brought to songs like \\"18 Miles to Memphis\\" and \\"Rock This Town\\"? Setzer may still be one of the greatest guitar players in the world but his uninspired vocals on this album are just unbearable and borderline embarrasing.

Great music grows on you. On the first listen of Sea Change I thought, 'Hmmmm... folky, very mellow...and interesting.' On the tenth listen, I loved it and on the thirtieth, I was in awe. When I first bought Mutations I had a similar impression except I sat that cd down, listened to it six months later and kicked myself for not giving it a chance.If you are expecting songs like 'Loser,' 'Devil's Haircut' or 'Sexx Laws,' you'll find nothing like that on Sea Change. What you will find is this unpredictable artist surprising you will thoughtful lyrics, beautiful melodies and as always, interesting instrumentations (with help from Nigel Godrich). 'The Golden Age' is a great introduction but for me, the disc really shines on tracks 4-11.This may eventually replace Mutations as my favorite Beck disc. If you are a true Beck fan, you cannot do without this disc. It is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changes","review":"There are few albums that makes you wonder. When listening to Beck's sea change for example you start wondering how devastating breaking up can get that it will turn a Comic and happy white Prince like artist to a melancholic \`I'm not sure I will live to sing my next song' Dylan. It's his first album that you don't envy his talent, don't admire his vital energies you just start preparing your self to the day she will walk away and you just wont have Ningel Gordich's phone number to help you sing the pain. These kind of albums makes you become evil sometimes as well.. there a few singers that cry so harmonically that you wish they will stay that way until the next time they will walk in to their studio. Five tears indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyes Reopend","review":"There should have been a warning that came with this CD. I expected it to be just as upbeat and fast and happy as his previous work. So when I first flipped in Becks CD I was completely turned off by it and just threw it in a corner to be forgotten. BUT!

And I am enjoying it very much.Get this album but be expected to get something more mellow and sad at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime 180","review":"this album is truly a complete turn around for beck. going from this distortion based blend of hip-hop and country and about everything else, to this simple stream of melodic 'rainy day' music. but do not confuse my words with the phrase 'sell out', he's changed nothing more nothing less. i will also add that in order to truly enjoy this album you must LISTEN, it is very subtle in its tempo and chord changes, so one might think that it sounds rather repetative, but make no mistake this album is subtle genious."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartbreakingly beautiful","review":"Beck manages yet again to be unique, interesting, and poingant all at the same time. Sea Change is in the same spirit as Mutations, but with Sea Change, Beck manages to take his work to entirely new level.

Beck is a good band, I wouldn't say that they're immensely talented, but they have some great songs. Frankly, I found this album boring. That's not to say that the lyrics and the music aren't beautiful, but at times all the songs come off as sounding exactly the same. The fact that they all have the same theme-sadness- doesn't really help either. As somebody has said, there are more ways to express sadness than one. Beck just keeps using the same lazy, depressed, bummed out sound throughout each song. It almost puts me to sleep with each listen.

He doesn't; and he's not a guy who should be relying on his vocals. Others call it a narcoleptic drone but that doesn't convey the sickening sense I got that Beck is immensely self-satisfied with the sound coming out of his mouth. I cannot begin to fathom the people (and evidently Rolling Stone magazine) who raved about this CD -- do they allow family members to write reviews for Amazon? Beck's agents? A few nice moments with the cellos, but other than that, please let me sell you my copy of Sea Change. In fact, send me postage and it's yours, FCFS.

Get Stereopathic Soul Manure instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing, not the music, creates the hype","review":"Once again Beck adopts a different musical style - and again, he produces a listless group of songs that others have done far better. Why this guy continues to get the press he does is beyond me - the problem with critics is that they confuse experimentation with outstanding music. Beck's albums don't wear well - this one might sit in your CD player for perhaps a few weeks and then collect dust on your shelf.

How many songs can you listen to in which Beck sounds like Perry Como before you either fall asleep or want to turn this off and return to the living world??! .. not many. The one positive: He did not use his disco falsetto voice on this CD. Thank god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change Is Not Always A Good Thing","review":"I'd rather be listening to Mutations...still in all, I'm looking forward to seeing Beck live with The Flaming Lips. I found this album, to be blunt, boring. If it's low-key music and strange lyrics you're looking for, you'll certainly get your fix with the last Sparklehorse album or something.I only got this CD because it was Beck, and though I think musicians doing something different is great, I expected something...more...of Beck.That's just my opinion.I didn't like 'Kid A' or 'Hot Shots II' either.Maybe I'm just bummed...maybe I should just listen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"i simply cannot recommend this album","review":"for the last decade Beck has been the iconic master of eclecticism. each of his albums brought a new mix of every possible musical influence under the sun. and they were all, in their way, fun. this music is post-modern funeral dirge music sung without any joy, let alone any sense of melody or hooks. usually i'm not one to chastise an artist for doing something different, for taking a chance. but to go from such a great, visionary producer to making this joyless, spare, and utterly ...tastic record was in my opinion a career misstep. i hope he gets back on track with his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah It's Pretty.......PRETTY BOARING!!","review":"For starters get Marianne Faithfull's new album \\"Kissin Time\\". Beck produced & co-wrote some of the tracks.

I work at a record store so i've had the opportunity to scan through all the music magazines...where all these good reviews are coming from I don't really know.

This is a far cry from his single \\"Loser\\" which had him pegged as a one-hit-wonder (at least in my book). Sea Change does not contain any of the fun but kitchy \\"two-turntables-and-a-microphone\\" tracks, trading good drum breaks for strings and forlorn introspection. Sounding more like Scott Walker than a \\"one man dustbowl\\" Beck shows his true range and capabilities with this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sincere and beautiful record","review":"There is no other artist in the public eye who has continued to be as ingenious and wonderfully surprising as Beck. He seems to feel no need to stick to one particular sound, but rather allows himself to explore musically. With Sea Change he has achieved one of his greatest successes. Beck doesn't pull any punches with this album, but seems to be wearing his heart on his sleeve, so to speak and it is truly touching. He is much less guarded than on past albums. I think some fans of Beck's biggest hits may be a bit alienated by it, but for his dedicated fans and perhaps for a whole new audience, this record is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever changing, can only mean a genius","review":"I can not express how moved I was by Becks' new album, Sea Change. I'm delighted that there is an artist who can continue to make music that is forever changing. Otherwise, I grow bored. The toned-down expression of the tracks, compared to his earlier work, can only prove that he has talent to cross all boundries of music. There are some very sobering moments I agree, like the track Already Dead, but the melody plucks at your heart. This is progressive music, it strikes at the soul. Beck can not be compared to anyone simply because all his albums are unprecedented. But I believe if Jeff Buckley was still alive, he would be making music like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"I generally find music reviews useless and misguiding, but this one sets a new standard:\\"Whatever's going on in Beck's world, at least we know he's purging, which, all things considered, may be better for his soul than ours. --Kim Hughes \\" (editorial review)Are they paying this guy to write this junk? \\"Sea Change\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different from Odelay! - yet very compelling.","review":"When I first purchased this album, I had not heard any of the tracks, but assumed it would be something in a similar vein to Odelay!. I was very suprised at the first hearing of this album, and a bit disappointed that it was not in a similar style. However, after listening a few more times, I have decided that this album is a more personal (and much less surreal) work than Odelay!, but no less compelling. Don't expect to hear anything like Where It's At, but expect another great album from Beck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite good enough","review":"I have long been a Beck fan, but as many times as I tried to get into this album, I just couldn't. There are about four or five songs that are good or great, but the rest of the CD just fails to get the blood flowing. As a whole, the lyrics may be worthwhile, but the lyrics can't carry the too slow, too uninteresting melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must BUY!!","review":"I have herd Beck's other cd's and each have their own Vibe to them. But This is such a Good Album. It's almost like it gives you that cool Radiohead feel to it. Makes you think about your life for awhile. Such a well produced CD! A must have in your collection!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"both feet in the grave","review":"This album was utterly disappointing. I've been a Beck fan for about 12 years and it has taken that much time for me to become disillusioned but \\"Sea Change\\" has done it. The critics were right about the heartbreak at least: this record is so bad it's heartbreaking. He relys heavily on trite cliches to mope his way through dull, unevocative, just-plain-bad songwriting... I was really looking forward to this record. \\"One Foot in the Grave\\" has been one of my favorite albums since it's release. I'm also a fan of \\"Stereopathetic...\\" and \\"Mellow Gold\\". But this collection of songs sheds such a light on the nature of his artistry that it actually makes his past releases worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is just plain boring","review":"I bought this CD without the benefit of hearing it first on a listening station. The last CD I purchased by Beck was Odelay. I had read two great reviews of Sea Change in usually reputable magazines, and, since I liked Odelay, assumed I would also like this. Either my taste in music has changed or this CD is just downright boring. I've listened to it three times now and can't see where all those great reviews are coming from. Are musicians so lacking in innovation these days that Rolling Stone would rave about something this lightweight?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BO-ring. Puts me to sleep every time","review":"I have never heard such a boring CD in my life. I loved \\"Mutations\\" -- especially \\"Nobody's fault....but my own...\\" -- this CD however is flat. A dud. I have listened to it over and over again wanting to love it. Sadly, I don't. The songs never get anywhere. They don't cast a spell. Hey, I like mellow music -- love Nick Drake, Tim Buckley, later Talk Talk, Bert Jansch, -- but this is just missing something. Ok, songs #1 and #10 are good and enjoyable...but the rest just never get off the ground, feel mundane, and tired. Sorry. I love Beck's other stuff and I admire him for making this album which is clearly heart-felt. I just don't like it...except for zoning out in a bad way."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip, skip, skip, decent track, skip..","review":"I have to allign with the 1 stars here. This is NOT a good album. RS gave this a 5 star and I honestly think they have a stake in the record sales. This is slow, lifeless and lacking any punch. Whats with the symphony junk on this album? This never works. But beyond that, there arent any interesting songs. Ok, I'll say there are 3 decent tracks but on a stronger album, they'd be filler at best. Maybe Beck feels dull and lifeless these days and if thats the case, he's succeeded in putting it in song. It doesnt make for an interesting listen though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to you, Beck?","review":"Wow. Has Beck ever changed. This \\"Yer Cheatin' heart\\" style music is hard to listen to.It's so depressing. It's like someone ripped the creative spark from Beck's brain. Sure there's still musical genius there, but the point of listening to music is enjoying it or connecting with it. Oh well, Beck always does his own thing. I can't bear to give him one star when all of his other CDs are fivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, this is total ...","review":"Loved Beck for ages. His quirky stuff will always hold a special place in my heart, but this is total .... He doesn't have the pipes for slow stuff, and the music behind it isn't clever enough to carry any of the sounds. It's total crap, start to finish. One listen and I was ready to pitch myself off of a bridge. It makes Radiohead sound more fun than Nsync. If Beck is really that far in the .. emotionally, I'd like to have some of his problems, starting with his paycheck."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sea of intermediacy\\" - with one royal exception.","review":"\\"Paper Tiger\\". I've burned a hole in this CD playing this song over and over again. I gave the rest of the album a good, hard listen hoping to find other orchestral pieces that sear your body and mind as much as this one, but came up sadly empty-handed. Download this tune, but save your money and don't purchase the CD, unless you crave moderate despondency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did somebody punch Beck in the mouth?","review":"That is the only explanation I can come up with as to why Beck sounds like he's mumbling his way through this entire album.A lot of the time I'll mention songs that stand out and then go through a breakdown of which songs are bad and which ones are okay. There's no reason to do that since all of the songs, with the exception of Paper Tiger, are awful on this album.Seriously: Get ahold of Paper Tiger (which is frankly an amazing song) on iTunes and forget the rest of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"majesty in the struggle with loss and isolation","review":"Beck intentionally, and I think bravely, made a full album with not a single rollicking piece in it to break or artificially lighten the mood. A true artist, Beck finds dignity, triumph and majesty in the struggle with loss and isolation. \\"Sunday Sun,\\" \\"The Golden Age,\\" and especially the masterful channeling of Nick Drake in \\"Round the Bend\\"--imagine ND in the studio with the later Pink Floyd--brilliantly explore personal desolation without in any way becoming maudlin or morose. It's always gratifying when a great artist proves his or her greatness in creativity and honesty (\\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" and the astounding \\"Little One\\"), and not just cleverness in marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is one amazing album. For an artist to change tack as quickly and effortlessly as Beck does from Midnight Vultures to Sea Change shows real talent.Sea Change is full of melodies that will have you enthralled. Sure, he may be bummed, but it means a more creative, soulful songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemplative Beck is BEST","review":"Sea Change is a truly complete work in the category of roots music. Personally appreciative, but by no means a devotee his previous work(s) -bar Mutations- Sea Change was a winner for me from the first moment. Other reviewers are correct to point out the continued development of themes established in Mutations, therefore if more a fan of his other compositions, Sea Change may not be for you. The blending of simple acoustic guitar melodies with ambient backing + Beck's signature lyrical style makes for a complex, but definitely roots work that keeps the listener coming back and turns them onto something new almost every time through. As any roots fan will tell you - LET IT GROW."},{"rating":"2","title":"the golden age indeed","review":"Beck, is there anything really left to say? He is brilliant!!! Taking the same path as \\"mutations\\", Beck brings forth his soul once more, this time with deeper introspective lyrics and some self healing. In a time when we all need it, Beck rises (unlike Springsteen) to the occasion. And don't believe for a second Beck is becoming trendy, he has always toyed with this sound: this time i think he finally realized his vision. One listen will prove my point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa dude.. Beck's depressed...","review":"Beck, the man who had 'two turntables and a microphone,' now has a broken heart and a lot of emotional songs. This album is beautiful and very profound, and presents Beck, one of the most mercurial musicians of the last decade, in a whole new light, almost like drum programming meets Leonard Cohen. Certainly the best album released this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric Perfection","review":"Very rarely have I bought an album from listening to it for free. You know what I mean -- those stores that allow customers to preview CD's. But this was the first time I bought an album from listening to the first sentence of the first song. I knew I had to have this one; the mood and the atmosphere are dead-on perfect. Yes, Sea Change is sad, moody, even depressing. It's also nothing short of brilliant.This is the perfect road companion while driving, the mood-setter for a date, the background to a California sunrise. Listening to Beck lament about love lost, gained, and lost again, over subtle guitar licks and orchestral movements, the listener can't help but take a deep breath, relate, and move on to the next track. This is not Odelay nor the self-conscious Midnight Vultures. This is as bare and naked as you will ever hear an artist get, and it's simply breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck is Back","review":"I adore Beck so I am biased to begin with. That being said, I love this CD. Is it as good as 'Mutations'? Well, no but that is because it's different...it's melancholy all the way through without any quirky rhymes or instrumentations. Initially, I wasn't too sure about this but after a couple of spins it grew on me.Don't get me wrong though, it's still Beck. For those of you who have listened to him through the years/phases, this won't surprise you at all as he has a tendency to shift gears rapidly from one CD to the next. This is about as far away from \\"Midnite Vultures\\" as you can possibly get.As with all of his CD's he is sticking with a genre, 'Odelay' was heavy on 60's sound, 'Mutations' country/folk, Midnite Vultures 80's synth with a dash of funk and 'Sea Change' is well, humm...folk meets 70's lite meets the Cure, meets The Smiths, kind of..hard to describe really but worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downtrodden Beauty","review":"Beck's music has seemingly evolved from playful dabbling in funk excursions, folk songs, hip-hop or even techno and metabolized into a fullblown masterpiece of straightforward, crestfallen elegance. The abounding melancholia on Sea Change is potent enough to crush one's heart. The lyrics are humble and graceful, the music pristine and unabashed. Sea Change captures Beck's unique songwriting ability in an ultimate form of graceful austerity that sings as gently as the wind, and at the same time, roars like a tumultuous ocean. Beck obviously poured out his heart and soul on Sea Change, and his new unsolicited sound is magnificently evoked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, emotional, not what you might expect from Beck","review":"The transformation of Beck from street musician to eclectic recording artist and songwriting wizard must have been a difficult one, and we see an awful lot of pain in the album. The songs all have a serious, sad, sometimes powerful tone to them, which is not actually matched by the lyrics when you take a good listen - there is hope there.But what really impressed me was the arrangements. There are a lot of strings on here, and the arrangements vary from sparse to bombastic. The fourth song, \\"Lonesome Tears\\", in particular has one of the most powerful string arrangements ever commited to disc.Those arrangements - it's obvious that great care was taken in making this album, something which cannot be said for all releases. I played it awfully loud yesterday, and became thoroughly involved. It is a participatory album, not one that listens well in the background. You pretty much have to pay attention to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow and Suprising...","review":"Up until now I have always put Beck in my \\"Fun Music\\" category...Midnight Vultures has permanent rotation space in my stereo. This CD doesn't qualify as \\"fun\\". It's more of a Sunday AM Coffee or post breakup kind of thing. Which is great. It's always refreshing to see an artist try a new style and Beck is fearless in wearing his heart on his sleeve. Just don't put it on to get the party started!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the hype and worth your money","review":"Look, skip meals, sell drugs, just do whatever you have to in order to buy this. I've been a fan of beck, but to be honest, i was getting tired of the flashy, ringing bell sounds of his other work. Every single song is fantastic, and if you like it, check out the unreleased track, Ship in a Bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck's Golden age","review":"Anyone labeling this album \\"boring\\" or \\"pretencious\\" is totaly to wrapped up in their own self image to see how beutiful it is (don't beleive me? ask Beck!)The song that'll totally get you hooked is paper tiger. The strings and drums funk out emotion and his muttering melody will haunt you to the bone. The lyrics, like all lyrics on this album, are dark and sad and classic, and yet not cliche! HOORAY!The best part is how much Beck has progresed since his last album. Without a trace of what made us love Beck before; it's still just as good. Beck will never get old and hasn't made a bad album yet!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!!!After buying this album, buy one foot in the grave, then Stereopathetic soulmanure, then Mellow Gold, then Odelay, then Mutations then Midnight Vultures!!!!!!!!!!! I DID!!!!!!!!!! Exclamation points!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not as annoying in print as I am in person!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sea Sick\\" might be more decriptive.","review":"This CD illustrates what's really ailing the music industry: it's not free downloading, it's lousy product by the so-called major artists. The 2 stars are only here for the engineering and the marketing, not the songs or performance (which merits 1 star at best).Beck delivers another CD of trite musical poses and stylings that sinks because there is nothing of substance to support it. Songs that go no place, and will never be cool anywhere. Play this at a hip, happening party, and one of 2 things will happen: people will leave, or someone will say \\"what happened to the GOOD music?\\" Radio stations will probably lose ratings if they put this in heavy rotation.If the record company over-pressed in anticipation of mega sales, then this stiff is headed for the cutout bins next year. So, wait until this is a [price] bargain CD. Better yet, pass and just let it sink because it's not any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Bummer!","review":"This cd is one big BORE. All of the songs are depressing. None of them are good. Buy at your own risk. Even if you are a fan of Beck's previous efforts, you should avoid this one at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The softer side of Beck...","review":"First off, I love just about everything Beck has done to date, even some of the more folky, country sounding stuff. This release goes even further down that trail. It definitly has a certain melancholy mood that flows thoughout the cd. What's got you so down Beck?To be fair, I have only listened to it once so maybe it isn't fair to rate this yet; but I really haven't heard anything on this album that stands out.Unless you really love the slower and more mellow aspects of Mutations, you will probably be disappointed. This is not the funky, sampled, radio friendly Beck here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the holy name of god is this? A joke?","review":"I love Beck. I'd marry him. He's amazingly creative, talented, bizarre, dresses in funny suits, has cool hair, and dances like a crazyperson. I love all of his previous albums and was super-excited about this one.It is awful. AWFUL. I was so shocked by its droning monotony that I thought, and am still suspicious, that is it a joke. Anyone who has heard his previous work must be wondering.Not that I think artists should be restricted from going in new directions with their music, because obviously that is the only direction to go, but JESUS! Every song sounds the same. Seriously. Are we in the Twilight Zone? Did he get a labotomy?This, from the guy who THROWS FRIZBIES AT THE SUN!(beck- I love your music and I hope you come back to us!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond dull","review":"While I loved Mutations and thought Odelay was pretty good, I can't get into this one. 3 tries and each time I was ready to fling it across the room. Man, I can dig sad, but this is just downright incoherent and dull. Maybe if you are floating on acid it might work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beck dives into the depths of horror","review":"This album is grossly overproduced and I wish I never bought it. What happenned to Beck? He was the genius behind Stereopathetic Soul Manure, One Foot In The Grave, Mellow Gold and Odelay and then it seems that the corporate 9-to-5ers got to him. Every album since Odelay has been grossly overproduced and you will find the names of the producers in big letters on the back of each of his last three albums.Also, it seems that the critics are afraid to criticize him.Someone must be paying off these critics. To all of the critics: have some guts!I now gladly use this cd as a coaster on my coffee table. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over","review":"\\"Sea Change\\" lacks any kind of energy, and its lyrics would yield only yawns from Mrs. Bumthrust's grade 10 creative writing class. At this point in his career, Beck's music is comparable to old folkies like James Taylor, though his humourless earnestness makes even Taylor seem more fun than a barrel full o' Buzzcocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Letdown","review":"Beck's family must have been hit by a bus, and his woman left him, and his dog died, all in the same week... because this is some seriously depressing material. No spunk, no life, and very little creativity. Of course with Beck, you are going to hear some unique twinges of brilliance, even on a mood album like this... but I'm telling you... this is not Beck as you know him, not at all. This is Beck on heroin in a pool of depression. Until now, I have loved ALL of his material, this makes me want to cry for a bit, and then go to sleep. I fail to see the genius in this one. Hopefully he has a \\"real\\" release in the works that will be soon to follow this misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL DULL DULL","review":"I'm going to the local CD xchange and trade this dud in for $2 credit. I find the monotony on this CD numbing. For some good sad stuff try James Mcmurtry's \\"Where'd You Hide the Body\\" or the Cowyboy Junkies' \\"The Trinity Session\\" or \\"Lay It Down\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, like, totally, so over-hyped","review":"I don't know what everyone is raving about, honestly. Sure, it sounds all soft and mellow like a good Air record, with some Nick Drake mixed in there somewhere. . .but why not just listen to those artists' records? The lyrics are trite, the songs are boring, and the reason the music is sad is because every tempo is almost catatonic. I've always liked Beck, but without all the flashy bells and whistles of his previous releases, he reveals himself for what he is: a mediocre songwriter with a strong baritone voice and funny way of pronouncoing words.The production sounds superb, however. Of course, with Nigel Goderich at the helm, it's going to sound fantastic. But the core of this record is a bunch of sort-of-but-not-really sad, adolescent-angsty songs that will, with any mercy, put you right to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are these people talking about?!","review":"...By reading their own comments you would expect lower ratings. I was extremely disappointed with this album. Yeah, it's got some beautiful moments, but it is essentially the same song over and over. It certainly is sad and evokes s self-centered mood, but do we really need anyone to take us there in this day and age? \\"Lonesome Tears\\" is the most interesting, but it too falls short of creativity. I love Beck, and I hate to say it, but this album BORED ME TO DEATH. It truly appears to me that not alot of work went into this project. I can say that if you like monotony and predictable musical arrangements, this is the album for you...Go ahead all Beck-is-God followers, rate me bad, but it's not going to change the fact that this album truly is not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Good but not great>>>>>>>>>>>>>&","review":"Overall, this is an O.K. effort by Mr. Hansen. It comes off (after one listening) to be a bit overproduced. Goodrich is a fan of (heavy) compression and in these beautifully written songs, it wreaks utter havoc (for other examples of this see 'Pavement's Terror Twilight'). This could have been a powerful masterpiece that would stand the test of time. But unfortunately we are cursed with all the miscellaneous \\"studio bells and whistles\\". Beck is and will always be a low-fi artist. Please accept this."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland","review":"As a big fan of Beck and beautiful bummer music, I was really let down by this release. I don't find one song of great beauty on here, or anything with which I connect on an emotional level. His singing here is flat and static. The lyrics are hard to hear. The arrangements are odd, sterile, and echoey, and the songs all crawl off to nowhere. Anyone looking to get into music of this nature would do better to buy Nick Drake, Pernice Brothers, Iron and Wine, Ron Sexsmith, Fairport Convention, Love, Bread, Elliott Smith, Josh Rouse, and Tim Buckley, to name just ten. All these artists take sad songs and subjects and elevate things with climbs and arrangement drama. Here, Beck borrows their bells and whistles, adds them at all the wrong times, and mumbles into a microphone inside Nigel Godrich's thousand-acre studio. Result's a snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull...overrated...a big disappointment","review":"I started listening to Beck for his humor and genre-mixing. While the idea of Beck getting serious intrigued me, the actual album didn't. Every song on the album feels the same. While others might be excited by the presence of someone who has produced for Radiohead and one of Beck's earlier albums, Mutations, the airy production only further detracts from the album. Syd Barrett, one of the big influences you'll hear here, had a sound of immediacy--on his solo recordings, it's as if he's right next to you, singing and strumming his guitar. Here, the production covers up Beck and obscures the lyrics.If you like acoustic psychedelic Syd Barrett-esque music, try Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot--it's what this album should have been like. If you still want a low-key Beck, try Mutations instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"that's it...iv'e had it......","review":"That's it, i've had it with you people who think you understand music but won't allow a musician to grow......if you want to hear odelay, go to your cd case and pull it out! it's right there between your papa roach and sugar ray albums.This is not a depressing album, it's beautiful and energized. It's in the spirit of great songwriters like nick drake, alex chilton, and tim buckley who were able to turn a feeling into a melody, then a word ,then a song. Tim buckley started referring to his \\"fans\\" as lobo's (lobotomy) after they started wining about not hearing the goodbye and hello stuff anymore, i'm sure beck has a simillar term for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth, crisp and wonderful","review":"This CD has been on repeat for a solid week. His soft mix of words, acoustic guitar and mellow beat make for one of the best albums I have heard this year. It reminds me of a great album by Son Volt with the added characteristics of Beck. A constant theme with many variations of tone show how Beck is one of our great musical talents. It's a paradigm shift that will lead Beck I hope to more great albums. At first listening to it in my car I couldn't completely hear the layers placed in each song. Once I had time to bring it in and have a second look on my home audio system it was magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Stars","review":"it's all been said before.The music and the sound quality on this recording are absolutely superb!10 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Record","review":"Heard this one when I was getting divorced.

Great album to do some serious boozing to..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Building A Masterpiece","review":"Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" is a pure masterpiece. What's most striking about it is that it's so subtle and so honest. What other artist can pull this type of record off? The music is certainly built for rainy nights and the lyrics sculpted from Beck's apparent heartbreak but there is also irony, sadness, humour and satire to prevent the songs on \\"Sea Change\\" from descending into total dirge. I've had this CD for over a year now and it's taken me that long to appreciate it. It's stunnigly beautiful and deep and hooky too.Beck is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like Gordon Lightfoot, eh?","review":"Excellent album, if only because Beck is paying tribute to one of our alltime best: Gordon Lightfoot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck doesn't let you down","review":"Beck doesn't let you down. I'll never get tired of his eclectic sound. This album is a bit mellow all the way through, but in no way am I disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"There is no other way to describe this album than utterly depressing, but in a beautiful and melodic way. Imagine a despondent acoustic guitar player with subtle atmospheric keyboard and string arrangements in the background. The background does not overwhelm the folk sensibilities and the song writing is superb. I don't care for Beck when he is at his goofiest, combining funk and folk, which, in my humble opinion, mix like oil and water. If you dont care for the prior releases by Beck, listen without prejudice, as I did. This album appears to be a one-shot deal for Beck, as I dont expect his future releases to sound like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck's Best","review":"One of the saddest things I have ever heard. But one of the best. Beck, being the chameleon of music has covered just about everything out there, fusion, country, metal to syntho-driven beats. Here he and producer Nigel Godrich put together an album that will either put you to sleep or make you cry, or both. It has rich landscaping texture that almost resembles Radiohead (Nigel Godrich). If you are a fan of either Beck or Radiohead and don't mind to be depressed for the better part of an hour (if you like Radiohead then you won't), then you need to make this album a part of your library. Favourite tracks: The Golden Age, Lonesome Tears, End of the Day, Round the Bend, Already Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic sad/mellow acoustic album","review":"Cracks me up when a reviewer says this:\\"Play this at a hip, happening party, and one of 2 things will happen: people will leave, or someone will say 'what happened to the GOOD music?'\\".Give me a break - what's wrong with different types of music for DIFFERENT situations. You're not going to put this on at a party so why even put that absurdity in a review. Fact is, this is some great music. Some parts remind me of acoustic Neil Young (like \\"Already Dead\\") and I've even heard a little Waters/Floyd vocal in there. Yes, it's not completely new/original acoustic work, but it's great and it sounds like Beck needed to get it out. Listen a couple of times and it hooks you. Beck is one of those great artists that can change from album to album. Enjoy it - I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"Sea Change has all the pacing and dynamics of an iceberg or tectonic plate.

The guy can really write!So you Beck fans should know that millions of people heard a \\"lost classic\\" Beck song while some really cool Red Sox footage rolled. Nice treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a fan of Beck","review":"This is complete garbage. Regression into the cliched lyrics and lackluster melodies that make mainstream music successful. For a much better album, try \\"Mutations\\". For mediocrity, but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Execrable","review":"The pits. Sold it after two listens. The impeccably recorded sound of someone attempting suicide in a tub of warm slush. Not even impressive as bummer albums go. This is so far off from why anyone began listening to him...I mean, he was fun, right? We didn't expect him to actually say anything, did we? Oh? You did? This is the result. I'm truly amazed at how many people got off on this. I dunno, maybe you bought into it being a breakup record. At least he was honest titling it \\"Sea Change\\". Indeed.Oh, the Amazon editor is out of his gourd even comparing this to \\"Mutations\\", which is an excellent record. Go ahead, keep hitting that \\"unhelpful\\" button. That won't take away from the fact that you gleefully paid money to hear someone mope aboout their misery in a startlingly uninteresting way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drifting in emotion...","review":"It's easy to write off this cd as just depressing and dull with the first listen, but once you actually listen to it, I mean sit down and really listen to it, the simplistic beauty of this cd comes to you.His breakup with longtime girlfriend may have been horribly rough on him emotionally, but it seems to be the best thing that has happened to him musically. He still sings in his droll, monotone tones, but there's something behind it now, emotion.This cd also has some of the most bare lyrics from Beck I've seen. He still goes into his metaphors in some of the songs, but he isn't hiding a lot on this album. It's very open and elegant, and it shows a maturation in the musician.I highly recommend this album, it's a solid, consistent album with soulful lyrics and incredible music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck's best work!","review":"In my opinion, this is Beck's best work. The lyrics are so genuine and emotional. The music is solid and it works perfectly with the lyrics to convey their emotion. It's perfection.I can also relate to every song on the album and I listen to it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chillout Album","review":"I've heard people say that this album is depressing, which may be true. However, it is also beautiful. Beck is extremely talented, and it's nice to see and array of styles from him, from folk to crazy ass awesome rock out to chill. When Beck makes an album, he makes an album that flows, much like a Pink Floyd album. Also much like Pink Floyd this is a great cd to pop into the car whilst driving late at night. Beck does every style he does wonderfully, and his chillout style is awesome. I listen to this all the time while reading or when about to go to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Musical Ear-Candy! Beck has gone back to the 1970's..","review":"I am a little angry at some of the reviews out there. What is the matter with everyone? Sea Change is a beautiful piece. A masterwork! At first, I was not sure I would like the CD. However, now that I have listened to it many times; I have found a treasure. And the treasure is for all of us to enjoy. No, it is far from Loser and Odeley. Now I hear the early 1970's. Being inspiried by Gordon Lightfoot it appears. And many other 70's ballad makers. I am a songwiter and I predict this CD will win Grammy Awards and other Awards. This CD is a SLEEPER. Watch what happens. Beck is showing us his talent in another lasting form. He has shown us he is still one of the greatest talents today. I say to you again Beck Hansen. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cry your eyes out.","review":"This is a great album. Beck really opens up and shows how mature he really is on this one. Indeed, it's a melancholy album, but it doesn't leave you feeling that way. If anything, it'll help you through feeling like [dirt]. You'll get the feeling Beck is pouring his heart out just for you to hear. Nobody else. This album is a narration for a relationship that went bad. The bonus track 'Ship In The Bottle' is really great. I'm very surprised it wasn't put on the American version because it is just so good. To put it frankly; Go buy this album immediately, even if you don't buy the import, buy 'Sea Change'."},{"rating":"2","title":"blah!!","review":"Beck really never fails to impress, but he rarely does completely suprise, this being one of the exceptions (to the latter). Take something like Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots or OK Computer and strip them of everything but emotion; that comes close to describing the beauty of this effort, but not quite. I never thought I'd see something rival Nick Cave in the heartbreak record department, but Beck rises to the occasion nicely. Some songs have similar sounds and get a little repetitive, but the music is so intricate anyway that you don't really notice until you listen to it on an hourly basis, and by that time you really don't care. In any case, it's great. Nick Cave fans that aren't familiar with Beck need to hear to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buzzkill","review":"Although methinks the crestfallen folkie vibe may not be 100% legit (think about it: were any of Bowie's drastic poses on the level?), I'm still impressed with most of these songs -- even if the two faster sound like Peter Gabriel. Or is it Bowie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Shelf","review":"This CD is so good! It is mellow but every single song is fantastic. I really don't have a favorite tune but \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" is the one I relate to the most. Beck is one of the smartest songwriters today. He knows exactly how to get his ideas across in a way that is reconigzable. It's simple but powerful. Best CD of 2002 followed by Yoshimi."},{"rating":"2","title":"beck is great!","review":"I was very satisfied with this albums sound. The lyrics are very beautiful and heartfelt. I can relate to alot of it, and his voice is as beautiful as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dpeths of boredom","review":"Beck fans will approach and embrace Sea Change as a return to his delicate indie sounds. An opportuntity to enjoy the insight into the artist's love's lost psyche at the time of this recording, but the results are anything close to resemble exciting. Beck does manage to create a genuine standard with \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" but that is the sole highwater mark of Sea Change. This record will be remembered with fondness as it sits horizontally next to Mutations, etc.., but there will not be a lot of spins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to \\"Satan Gave Me a Taco\\"???","review":"For the first time, Beck goes serious. It's not like I don't understand his need to explore his real feelings with conventional words, but it's just not the same as when he sang tunes such as \\"Death is coming to get you\\", \\"Let's go moon some cars\\", and \\"Whiskeyfaced Radioactive Blowdryin' Lady\\". I've always listened to Beck because he was the only guy out there making completely and truly irreverent music - making a mockery of the very concept of meaning in music.I can't say the new album is bad, but to me it's just not Beck anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to listening to Sea Change, but was very disappointed. I find it almost unlistenable - the sad droning, non-stop waa waa waa, and the depressing melancholoy that infuses everything on this disc is too much. And I *am* sorry to say this because I think Beck's work is brilliant and innovative. It is definitely NOT a five star album. (Rolling Stone, Robert Hillburn - what WERE you thinking????)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Over-Hyped Album Ever?","review":"When I read the 5 star review that Rolling Stone gave this and the 9 out of 10 score Spin gave it I ran out to buy it. While I expected a masterpiece that fused Nick Drake with some more modern sensibilities what I found instead was a boring, derivative album with a few electronic flourishes that failed in all ways to deliver. I'm not saying its a bad album as it isn't. But the melodies are bland and boring with very few exceptions. File this with Wilco's Yankee Foxtrot Hotel (or whatever its called) and Sleatter Kinney's One Beat as one of the most disappointing, over-hyped and under-delivering albums of the last several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genetic sport","review":"There's no telling how a horrific artist like Beck could come up with one of the most awesome albums out there, so just accept it for what it is... an orgy of sublime agony that somehow sprung from the train wreck people call Beck."},{"rating":"2","title":"great but check out Serge","review":"I love this CD as much as the next guy. Beck is fantastic, and has clearly matured a lot (although i think mutations is much better). I must say though, if you like this, buy Serge Gainsbourg's Histoire de Melody Nelson. Beck totally took his music from this. Paper Tiger = Melody. I have no problem with that i guess, just check it out. So it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only CD I Want to Listen to Right Now!","review":"Ohmygod! If you love beautiful things, and your heart has leanings for music and art of a quiet, plaintive, heartfelt bent, then please, please, please buy this album! Not since the Cure's DISINTEGRATION have I put on a CD that won't come off until I become saturated with the sound. On the way to work this morning, I rolled up the windows and kept turning up Beck until my world became flooded with gorgeous waves of liquid sadness. I've never experienced a musician who was so utterly fearless. The result is not wallowing like some would have you believe, but rather cathartic and uplifting. I wouldn't trade it for anything right now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misery loves company.","review":"While some cds are like friends you can cry to this one is one that cries to you.

Generally, when buying furniture on-line quality can be questionable as a picture is all you have to go by. In both regards I was pleased.

I'm so glad I watched it with her as I was able to continually skip scenes. I'm not real big on political correctness but the shorts were completely offensive and inappropriate. I know that comparing the societal and cultural norms of the 30's vs. today is like comparing apples and oranges. But these films were nothing but child exploitation bordering on sexist kiddie porn with doses of racism thrown in here and there.

The self-study CD that comes along with the text itself is very weak. Oh, and here's what really got my goat: the dialogues on the class CD are spoken by non-native speakers.

My machine screams with ever game I've played, including massive strategy games, but playing this you would think my P4 was a comedore 64. The game just keeps going down.

I've started saving every single time I do anything anymore and that makes the game not very fun to play. If you haven't already bought this game, don't waste your money.

But when I began playing, I noticed that it was not a very good game. It was very hard to get a population of 1000, even when going in super speed, When zoning, the streets were made for you, landmarks start at about $30,000, raising taxs is confusing, and \\"Budget Grim\\" is always going off, even when taking a loan of $100,000.

I sat watching my cities develop (which takes forever) and realized I was having about as much fun as doing laundry.I also found the game very easy.

Yes, the graphics are sharper and are really nice, but as one reviewer noted before, the game is now far more work than fun. I think that's a pretty fundamental complaint, really. I have a pretty powerful computer, and the game operates the way it should, but I must always restart my computer and repair the Internet functions before my system is in working order again after game play. Too, the cheat code dialogue box rarely opens as it's supposed to do, instead, hitting CTRL X turns the cursor into a smokestack. I'm going back to Sim City 3000 Unlimited.

The last SimCity, SimCity 3000, was a letdown, and after a week of play, it seems as if the folks at EA/Maxis have lost sight of what this game is all about. You now have to chase after every little fire, there is no sandbox mode for creative play and city building, it's impossible to build a small town with a high living standard, and so on.My impression is that EA thinks Will Wright designed SimCity to be a strategy game. He didn't. He designed it to be a TOY. Something that creative types - especially older gamers such as myself - could sculpt with. Apparently EA/Maxis believes that all gamers have the mentality of 12 year old males with water on the brain. They don't.The second star is for the graphics. They're nice.

Additionally, the game does not seem to hook up to any server and download updates automatically. Most games with online ability usually will have some easy way to install patches. Not this one! They really leave the user(customer) in the lurch.It is a general no-no in the entertainment business to punish your customer from the get-go.

The requirements for the game are incorrect. If u only meet the minimun then dont get this game because it barely runs. The minimum requirements should really be the recommended requirements. I had to play the game on my friends computer because it didnt work on mine, and even then it was slow on his. As for the actual game, its not as fun as the previous sim cities. Micromanagement is annoying and very stressful. There are many missing features such as the tall skycarepers, annoying bugs, and again, constant slow down. The game is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lag is a big problem...","review":"There is no doubt that the graphics in Sim City 4 are better than those of SC 3000, but the lag you get in return is not worth the relatively puny graphic improvement. Originally, I thought the problem was my computer, but after meeting the requirements, defragging (and going on a deleting spree), and reading similar complaints at both Amazon and Simcity4.com, I'm disspaointed to realize that there is probably something wrong with the game.Hopefully a patch will fix this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the Simcity series, but they need to change it","review":"I enjoyed the Simcity games and felt ripped off with Simcity 3000 as it was basically the same package as the previous Simcity. If you love the basic city building concepts of the Simcity games, Simcity 4 is the exact same thing. At least they changed the graphics for this one and gave it an updated look for today's video cards but if you look at screenshots for Simcity 4 you'll see that it has the same rules, building types, etc. If you'd like to play Simcity again with an updated graphics engine, go for this title, but if you've been \\"simcitied out,\\" save your money and buy another title. Sims anything sells like hotcakes and EA realizes this. It's another attempt to cash in on the Sim name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this review before purchasing this game!","review":"If you buy this game please be warned that it is very bad.If you think this game will offer you the action packed thrills of GTA or anything along that line please reconsider.

I've been a big fan of Maxis and the Sim City games, but unless you have a brand new 2,000 dollar computer, DON'T GET THIS GAME!

My specs: P4 2 Ghz,Radeon 9700,512 MB,Soundblaster Audigy 2. The game churns. I'm sure most of the reviews seen here are either from Maxis trying to save their dwindling game, or people who have played it for five minutes. With my machine, a city with a population of 25k on the largest map will barely run. Days take 5-6 seconds to advance even on the fastest setting, and it is impossible to scroll around and place buildings because of the slow down. This programming is horrid. No current machine can run a large city without terrible lag. Simcity 4 is unstable, and with ANY ATI card, buildings are turned off when you scroll, yet I was able to fix this by changing a few lines of code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I have owned every version of Simcity. By and large, they have all been very well done and obviously well-tested. This version is neither. So far, one patch has been released and another is imminent because of severe problems with performance and gameplay. It is apparent from gameplay that playtesting prior to release was insufficient. The time it takes to master this game, assuming that is even possible, is far too lengthy to make Simcity 4 enjoyable.Given how many people are likely to be turned off by this release, we may be seeing the end of what was once the best sim series in gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya right.","review":"To the person who was upset when the game crashed under an 8 mb graphics card.Upgrade.

Boy was I wrong! Unlike SC3000, anything you build costs money to maintain. Even the water pumps. Its impossible to keep your money in a positive balance. I never play that game anymore because its sooo impossible to play. I can't believe my boyfriend wasted 50 bucks on it for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't play much","review":"I was excited about this game, I really was. Even if it wasn't *so* great as I was expecting, it's fun and it has good graphics. I also enjoyed that is way more difficult to play that the earlier versions. BUT, I gave up on it. It is TOO BUGGY! I couldn't play for more than 20 minutes straight. And it's not my machine or my video card. It crashes a lot, specially when you start having a big city. It's slow and... crashes again, losing all you have done in your city (wich are...virtual years ;)So, I like the game, but this game, as some of the Sims add-ons, was released before being ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on XP","review":"After many attempts to install the game on our home PC running Windows XP failed, we discovered that the game was incompatable with our OS.

Especially when I got a statue to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Effort","review":"I was sorry to see all the negative reviews on this game. Yes, it is a memory hog and does crash often.

This game has so much possibilities.Not only was I addicted to one city - but I could not wait to join it with others.I was disappointed when Maxis canceled out on \\"Simsville\\" - but they have added all the ingredients into Sim City 4.

This game starts out with a bang and looks beautiful. However, even on my 1-year-old desktop, the game virtually crawls to a halt after only 10 minutes of development. Scrolling takes at least 30 seconds, zooming in or out takes even longer -- unless it locks up entirely.Does the game really need working traffic lights, packs of wild animals, construction workers, and all the other bells and whistles that make it look breathtaking, but ultimately unplayable? I think the developers have gotten carried away with the graphical capabilities.PS -- I've installed the patch from the manufacturer's website that's intended to fix this problem. The improvement is noticable, but the game is still slow and unenjoyable. I've uninstalled it and re-installed SimCity 3000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremly challenging, but fun","review":"Simcity 4 is by far the most challenging game Ive ever played. It took restarting my city neary ten times to actually get a propering city that actutally made money on its own. Its worth the time though, when you get your city to around 500,000 or so citizens, you really start seeing the cool residential and commercial buildings. The biggest problem I encounter is the constant no job sign that pops up in my residential districts even when I have compatible commercial jobs to match the income level right next door. Overall I think this game is worth all the frustrations and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics but VERY restricted options","review":"All the Sim City games were better than the one before. With Sim City 4 it is great to see the stunning graphics and plethora of new parks, buildings etc. But, unlike previous Sim City games, with Sim City 4 you can't just slap a city together and let your imagination run riot, which I thought was the whole point of having Sim City. You must build up a city from scratch and carefully monitor your expenses. If you go just a little wild, you get fired as mayor. While this is fine, the lack of an option to play the game and see it's true potential without having to do it from the beginning each time is a major downer for this game. Sim CIty 3000 is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"was disappointed","review":"i loved playing sim city 3000 unlimited and couldnt wait for sim city 4 but as with the sims, ea has made it so complicated that it was not fun at all.

The game is extremely slow and runs terrible on just about any system. It crashes and freezes every time I play it. My computer is not bad at all either, it fact it's quite good. I haven't heard one good thing about this game either. Go to the BBS at simcity.com and see for yourself. Not one good comment about the game, all complaints to Maxis/EA wanting patchs and other efforts to refurbish Sim City 4. NEVER again am I going to buy a Sim City game after my experience with this one. If you want a good Maxis/EA game, I would HIGHLY recomend The Sims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not to buy SC4","review":"Why not to buy:Game is very slowAfter playing for a while, the game actually freezesBuggy as all get outTook out many great features in previous gamesThe graphics AREN'T better!

Some people might be amazing experts in the game, but for the general public, I do not recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Requirements!!!","review":"The game is absolutely fantastic! The graphic design, the transportation simulation and the animations all add up to a very nice city constructing game. The experience from the previous games had a good effect.Unfortunately, the game is hungry for memory. I bought a new PC some weeks ago. A 2.4GHz CPU with a GeForce4 4400 128MB grafic card and 512MB of DDR (333MHz) RAM and guess what!? I get an annoying slowmotion-show as soon as the city is big enough (approx. 100000 people). It looks to me as the RAM memory is too small! I hear and see that the HD is constantly being used, so it smells like swapping in and out the content of these rather big maps. So I guess I will buy another chunk of 512MB DDR RAM to try to finally play fluently Sim City 4 with a total 1GB of RAM!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics but at a cost","review":"Really looked forward to this version based on a number of previews; graphics and city details definitely improved over SC3K.....but there's a cost to pay. Even with a computer running at 1.1GB w/128MB RAM, NVidia GEForce2 32 MB video card and most of the neat graphics features turned down/off, the gameplay becomes slow and erratic as your city develops. Just read a review where the same problem appears in a 2.2 GB system w/ 512MB RAM. If you're thinking of buying, wait and see what EA can do to fix this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much...","review":"The graphics are stunning and the detail and more options are really nice. One problem, you may spend hours even days building the perfect city, and still it will decay and they'll kick you out (when u reach -100,000 dollars) not to mention that you'll have great health, low crime, low fire rates, high education, low pollution, and many other things that sims like, you'll still lose.

Other reviewers point out that this is mainly a visual experience, with movie tributes to the likes of Hou Hsiao-Hsien for the anoraks to delight in spotting. But nobody seems able to tell me WHY it is so long. There is one scene where the bus pulls out of a diner's car park, and drives up the road that extends into the distance, over the hill and out of sight. Fixed camera wide shot, no cuts. It takes 2 minutes 40 seconds - why? We know where the bus is going, and the frame is not particularly interesting to look at. Maybe there is a deeper meaning to such anti-editing statements that I am missing, but it looks like Aoyama just couldn't be bothered cutting the thing properly. Two stars for the cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made.

I'm a 42 year old man and take care of my things. My 3 other Coleman coolers have lasted 2-7 years, and are still being used. The first time I used this Igloo cooler, the lock/latch broke. The third time I used it the hinge came undone. The fourth time I used it, the plastic strap that keeps the lid from over-extending the hinges broke and the lid just came un-hinged and fell off. What a piece of junk. Furthermore, it claims to keep ice for 5 days. I used it one day at the beach keeping it in the shade, then brought it into a 72 degree air-conditioned environment. The next day the ice was gone. I emailed Igloo support and they wouldn't do any warranty repair/return without an original receipt. I'm not sure about others but I don't keep receipts for $40 coolers. I would never buy this again and have replaced it with another Coleman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Apart Quickly","review":"What a disappointment! I've had the cooler for about 6 months now, and it does an impressive job of keeping ice frozen, but the thing is falling apart. On the first use of the cooler the screws for one of the handles stripped out. I repaired this by going to the hardware store and purchasing drywall anchors, and they have been holding well. I replaced all four screws knowing the others would fail in short order. The plastic strap that stops the lid from overextending frequently gets caught under the lid when closing the cooler, preventing a tight seal. This repeated crimping of the strap has now led to it breaking on my last trip. When I returned home, I forgot about the broken strap when I raised the lid. This resulted in the lid overextending, and both hinges promptly broke. I suggest you find another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips 50PFP5532D - Hopeless!","review":"I bought this TV in 2007.

Nothing special but for the $11 I paid it's impressive they come with a case at all. Looks like it'll mount up to your belt if you want to take it on a quick day hike or boating trip.The binocular itself is really compact which is nice, but it is almost wide enough for me to use comfortably. To the item's credit I'm a big guy with a big head. The adjustment is smooth and the zoom is decent. clarity is pretty good too.

For about 20 years after that, Julian attempts to make spiritual sense of these visions, and in doing so, she becomes one of the more significant mystics in Christian history, as well as the first woman whose writing we have in English(She was a contemporary of Chaucer).

The 10x25s are barely clear in the center and terribly fuzzy and distorted beyond the center point.3. Of course the 10x25s are higher powered, but I believe I could still make out a whisker more detail with the 8x21s.4. Eye relief is similar on each, but since the outer edges of the 10x25s are distorted, they have, essentially less eye relief and thus the 8x21s have a wider field of vision5. The 8x21s are more compact6. My 8x21s are every bit as clear as my more expensive and much larger and heavier Barska Atlantic 8x32s.

The British couple cannot find a bottle of water to drink in the whole city of Venice, they wake up naked in a strange place and do not wonder where they are, the reader has no clue why they are bored with each other until they meet the sado-masochistic couple, endless and wordy descriptions of Venice, a woman who enjoys it when her husband breaks her ribs. Give me a break! If you want to read good modern British fiction writers, try Graham Greene, Anthony Burgess, John Fowles, Martin Amis, and of course, Salman Rushdie. McEwan is a waste of time, including his Amsterdam in which it is not difficult for the reader to guess the ending and again there is basically no character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORDY, IMPLAUSIBLE WASTE OF PAPER","review":"UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE AUTHOR, I READ THIS BOOK IMMEDIATELY AFTER FINISHING \\"A TALE OF TWO CITIES.\\" COMPARISONS ASIDE, I GUESS THE MOST SUCCINCT REVIEW I CAN OFFER IS THIS: UPON REACHING THE DEPRESSING FINALE, I TOSSED IT INTO MY OFFICE WASTEBASKET.

At points the use of symbolism by the writer was so blatent it became mundane. For example when Colin and Mary first meet Robert they notice he is wearing a tiny razor blade around his neck. Many events in the plot were left frustratingly unexplained, instead of creating mystery, they cause the story to become unbelievable. One of these such instances is when Colin and Mary see Caroline waving to them on the balcony, although reluctant, they go to visit her. The author offers little more than a vague explanation for this fatal mistake. However although the plot is lacking and tends to lag in areas, the writing does have flashes of brillance. My favourite part in the novel is when Robert describes the ritualitic way his father groomed himself. Ultimately, I think the issues that The Comfort of Strangers raises, are far more interesting to ponder than the book is to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine piece of dark fiction.","review":"I \\"discovered\\" Ian McEwan a few years ago. From my reading I think that you can draw a dividing line through his works. The latter works are literary and refined and seem to me to be character studies that dwell on the inner thoughts and (abnormal) psychology of the characters. On Chesil Beach and Solar are good examples. Prior to that, he wrote short, dark, disturbing novels in which, even though you could tell where the story was going, you couldn't look away. I am thinking of Enduring Love, Amsterdam, and the classic The Cement Garden. The Comfort of Strangers clearly falls into the this latter category and I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE FREAKY READ...","review":"Ironically, The Comfort of Strangers was the book I had earmarked to tackle next when I read a recommendation of it by horror-writer, Jeanne Cavelos. She lists it as an \\"innovative horror novel.\\" Is The Comfort of Strangers a horror novel? Yes. Is it a literary novel? Yes. No one can better bridge these two categories than Ian McEwan.I can't give away much of the plot - the book is far too short. A vacationing couple meets a mysterious stranger and strange things ensue. The city they are traveling in \\"may or may not be Venice,\\" according to the book's back cover. For me, it works better to picture Venice. It evokes both Death in Venice and Don't Look Now, and fits in well with the tone of the novel.Read this as horror or read this as literary fiction. Just don't expect a predictable payoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Minor-Masterpiece","review":"I don't understand the criticism I've read about the plausibility, or the lack thereof, of the plot of TCOS. How plausible are our dreams, or our nightmares? In TCOS, and in his equally disquieting novel, The Cement Garden, McEwan creates characters with no moral grounding, who wander unconsciously through life. This seems to me the essential quality of his characters. Is this so implausible? Haven't we all encountered people who drift dreamily through their lives. For me, McEwan's fiction is too painfully real and, I believe, Ian McEwan is very deserving of whatever praise he receives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Comfort of Strangers","review":"Well written, perfectly crafted, scary as hell. Good movie version too with Julie Christi and Donald Sutherland. I'm a big Ian McEwan fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A","review":"Building to a quietly shocking denouement in this short novel that packs more emotional punch in 127 pages than most fleshed out books, McEwan demonstrates in The Comfort of Strangers that he has mastered the craft of writing. Atmospheric and incredibly controlled and tense, the narration mirrors the heavy claustrophobia of a couple vacationing, a crowded feeling exacerbated by the passages describing the sun and the water. The psychological awareness utilized by the author is at its best - he deftly shows the inner workings of personal relationships while at the same time allowing foreshadowing and ominous imagery to simmer beneath the surface of the story. It is while waiting for this sense of unease to manifest itself that is most thrilling, and the numbness which one will feel at the conclusion echoes what the protagonists themselves feel as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not suspend disbelief","review":"Lead characters are not at all believable or particularly interesting and are kind of mind-numbingly stupid. Plot is equally unbelievable, ridiculous, and over the top. There's just no \\"there\\" there. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"Every action by every character in this book is inexplicable. I don't know what the author was going for here, but if he meant this story to be taken seriously, he completely missed his mark. I remember writing a story much like this as a child in seventh grade before I learned anything about life. Seriously one of the worst books I have ever read. It's only positive is that it is short. Luckily I got it for free from my trial membership on Amazon Prime,...indicative of the types of books available through the Amazon Prime lending library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"My bookclub picked this out based on the exciting description. It was very diappointing. The main characters, Colin and Mary, are one dimensional and seem to have very little chemistry between the two of them. There were a few times in the book that I wondered if Mary had multiple personalities. It is unclear what their history is or what is the full story about her kids, why they are vacationing there, etc.Robert and Carolyn reek of creepy, creepy from the first moment that the reader meets them. However, they are more interesting then the main characters of Mary and Colin. At least Robert had a bit more dimension to him than the other characters.The ending was the most exciting part of the book. The rest just goes on and on about nothing. Even with an exciting ending it leaves so many holes and unanswered questions that just leave you wondering \\"What the ? ? ?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Going for shock value","review":"Our book club all read this as our first Ian Mcewan book. It was so short that the exact history/relationship of the couple is never established. You don't know enough about the couple to care much about them, so the ending seems disturbing as it comes out of nowhere and seems to be the ONLY interesting thing to happen in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Venice","review":"The writer's \\"evocation of place\\" includes the interesting observation of the constellation Orion visible in the evening in summertime, indicating a location somewhere in the southern hemisphere. Couple this with sunrise over the ocean, and we are led most probably to the coast of Brazil - possibly Sao Paulo. Why he wanted to locate his couple here is unknown - maybe because vacations are cheaper in the 3rd world."},{"rating":"2","title":"thoroughly engrossing, remarkable writing","review":"Stylistically, I've never encountered a writer whose vivid, precise descriptions of the characters' immediate surroundings does so much to illuminate and reflect the characters' increasingly fragile psyches. McEwan employs this ability of his to mesmerizing effect. As you progress through this novella, you'll encounter little nooks of crannies of this unnamed European city, sidestreets, alleyways and the abode of an enigmatic couple. McEwan's facility with words enables him to depict these various spots as though they contained powers of their own, as though they were all conspiring with one another to bring the protagonists to an untimely end. This all portends the final outcome of the book. It was pretty chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sense of atmosphere","review":"The skill of Ian McEwan is that he creates not only lush prose and complex characters, but that he completely immerses the reader in a sense of place and time. In this story, the travelling couple in a foreign land, is so vivid that you feel you can feel the frustration of the heat, the sounds, the scents, the sensations they experience. As danger approaches in the most subtle way, it is unsettling. However, my only complaint would be that the ending left me somewhat dissatisfied. Otherwise, a worthy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Description?","review":"I didn't buy this because the Product Dimensions: 28.5 x 1.5 x 9 inches ; 3.4 pounds seems to be incorrect from other sites.

I typically use it once a week after a good shave. Apply about a quarter sized blob to your face and leave it on for about 10 minutes. Use a washcloth soaked in hot water and wipe it off your face. Be warned though, don't use your wife's good white washcloths though. The product smells great and had a tingly feeling while on your face. After rinsing and drying your face your skin feels tighter, cleaner and fresher. Follow it up with a moisturizing after shave like Nivea for Men and your face will feel like a million bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"This pan was described as 2\\" deep which is why I chose it over Lodge. It is *not* 2\\" deep, it is 1 1/4\\" outside height, less than that pan depth. The depth was important to me and because the given height is wrong, I give it 1 point. I have been misled.Anyone using this brand of castiron ware should check with comments from other users regarding the seasoning used by Sante. I agree with those that find it very unpleasant, affecting food taste and needs to be scrubbed off and reseasoned. Not something I was looking forward to but willing to undertake because the pan is described as 2\\", deeper than any other cornbread/scone castiron pan. Which it is not.I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"M.C. Breed","review":"M.C. Breed's cd is so lame I bet an old immature album was better than this lame stuff. I felt that he should be more creative and write better rhymes. His rhymes sounds like he made them on the toilet. Like he just felt like saying something. He reminds me of Master P because what he says does not need to be said. Just like that UGGH that Master P does, does not need to be done. I feel that he just says things that he talks about on his record just to get a dollar or just to be like everybody else who curses and talks about women."},{"rating":"1","title":"A marxist analysis of the marketing of this dvd is needed","review":"I was actually considering buying this title but then was struck by the irony of a 26 minute film on Marxism that costs $59.99.How much is that per minute?

So, I soak and wash in cold water and they come out nice and clean again. Also, do not put these in the dryer! Hang them up to dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but far from the best","review":"These plastic/vinyl pants are fair. They really didnt do a very good job at controlling leaks.

We're a bloody thoughtful bunch aren't we? I'm a Carlislian by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive and poetic masterpiece","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. One visually stunning masterpiece among others by Andrei Tarkovksy. Nowdays when people seem to think that \\"visually amazing\\" is equal to the artifical reality of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or new episodes of \\"Star Wars\\" It\`s funny to look back and see how beautiful films were made 20-30 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless.The fourth wall falls.","review":"From one of the few artists in history who never produced so much as one poor piece of work came this definitive moment of cinema. No other film has ever captured me in such a way, I quickly become afraid of what I will find in the \\"zone\\" and concern for the characters is secondary. \\"Stalker\\" is an experience, not a form of entertainment. Much like \\"Persona\\" it is very easy to forget that you are watching a film. All of Tarkovsky's films are of an unequalled beauty, Stalker is amongst his most beautiful. To call it \\"Science Fiction\\" is a grievous insult, this film is nothing less then poetry. There is no excuse for not having seen this, I feel very sorry for anyone whose preconceptions will not allow them to admire this film, they have been cheated as they maintain, but only by themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawner","review":"I am too simple a person to understand anything that happened.

To make matters worse, it seems that Stalker was filmed in a tank of dirty water.What is this film about? As far as I can tell its about peole being affected by some place called the \\"Zone\\". Sounds like a good premise? Yes, well it would be if it was'nt so boring. Seriously, this movie works better than most sleep aids. I was out like a light after 30 minutes, but the glass of water I was holding woke me up.I'm sure there is a perfect time to watch this film, but I have no idea when that will be. Rent this and have the FF button handy while you watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst films ever made","review":"The badness of this movie is beyond belief. It is several hours of a bunch of guys wandering around in a field. Really. Sometimes one of them says, oh no, don't go that way--if you do all kinds of terrible things will happen. But evidently the film makers didn't budget for any actual terrible things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Simple: Boring","review":"I was tempted to make a joke and say this movie is very Rachmaninoff (whom I think is way over-rated) -- that is, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. But no, the movie is not even that. Not only is there nothing to signify, there is no sound nor fury. In short the movie is BORING. Need more? OK: the movie should last the duration of time it takes to read the single sentence synopsis of its idea. I imagine some 5 to 8 seconds is all that's required. The movie lasts longer than 8 seconds though. And there's not only no idea, no sound, no fury, there's not even any good cinematography. Don't even buy this to satisfy any curiousity you might have: you'll merely waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever!","review":"This is definitely the worst movie I have seen, it was so bad that I recommended it to my friend and I saw it again with him and we laughed and mouned as we tried to endure this 2-and-a-half-hour horror!

I say this, and I usually don't feel this way, I am a movie-fan myself. And I usually love slow movies, 2001 is one of my favourites, but this one is totally uninteresting!

However, due to the director's style, it is one that very few would appreciate. It is a very slow-paced, but crucially thought-out movie. It requires patience, but pays off indefinitely. Very poetic, solid movie. It's like a novel that you read once and love, and read again and again and you keep discovering more and more of it. If you enjoy thoughtful films that you can reflect on, this is definitely for you, but if you don't, you will be sorely disappointed.Once again it is very slow-paced and deliberate, filled with rich dialogue and characterization, but the impatient ones will lose interest and won't \\"get it\\".

Here all you see is real, the water, the grass. In these simple things lie the meaning of the human condition. The charcters wander in a Zone that is a metaphore of their ravaged souls. Silence, decay, rain. Yet, in this film there is hope, never ending and one that will always endure.

Watch it by yourself when you're slightly frustrated with the incompetency of the outside world to fully enjoy this masterpiece.

That's a real masterpiece. When I saw tarkovsky's film, I was so disappointed. Endless shots of the back of people's necks, or long shots of rotting swamps...Slow and boring movie...Talk, talk, and more talk. The book got into the soul of the characters, but the actors in this movie just talk endlessly about philosophy. So boring. Now I've heard the americans are trying to make this a Hollywood movie. I just hope they don't go to the other extreme and make it a crapfest with alien monsters, explosions and rambo-like shootouts. I give the book the highest mark possible...The movie is just boring and long and forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor has no clothes","review":"This is a long, BORING movie. It's just unbelievable how self-indulgent the pacing is. I cannot figure out how people can enjoy this film. (I have a suspicion why they praise it, though -- see the title above.) Even if you like serious films (as I do), don't subject yourselves to this boredom. The whole point of the movie could have been made in 30 minutes. Instead, we have to endure nearly 3 hours of endless shots. Just an example: There are three men in a field. The first man walks toward the viewer, slowly. The whole trip takes perhaps 2 minutes -- just walking. Then the second guy starts walking -- another 2 minutes. Then the third... And then there is a cut, finally. Next scene: the first man starts walking again, this time shot from the back -- 2 more minutes. Then the second -- another 2 minutes. Then the third... Did you enjoy reading this verbose description. If so, then perhaps you may like this film. Normal viewers, beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toss the nut","review":"Masterful. Tarkovsky takes the viewer by the hand through a philosophical and emotional minefield. Never have I encountered more suspense in a film. Never would I have suspected that this effect could be accomplished with such brevity of imagery and dialogue. The setting is a lavish dystopia. The camerawork is excruciating. The music score is well matched. Don't let the one clunky scene early in the film at the border crossing stop you, either. This film is worth the glitch. Or perhaps the glitch is a trap? It's hard to know for certain when you enter the world of Tarkovsky. So fire up your TV and \\"toss the nut\\" with the Stalker."},{"rating":"2","title":"The height of filmmaking","review":"I'll add a few incidental comments to the raves others have given. This film is a highly abstracted rendition of Arkady & Boris Strugatsky's novella \\"Roadside Picnic\\" (and contrary to the official synopsis, an alien visitation creates the Zone rather than a meteorite.) The title implies Clarke's notion that any sufficiently advanced civilization is indistinguishable from magic; the aliens' random trash is beyond our comprehension. That's just plot device, though, for Tarkovsky's moody portrayal of our inner lives. This is an incredibly atmospheric film with an \\"industrial\\" (in the pre-techno sense) soundtrack, and it also inspired a worthwhile CD by composer Robert Rich. Btw, I won't mind if they lose the lurid cover if, and hopefully when, this is issued on DVD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly sensitive masterpiece","review":"Stalker is like a window to someones dreams and it\`s been made so powerfully that the world in the film feels almost real. Tarkovskys storytelling something that reveals the characters and the films innerworld layer by layer. The film\`s more about moods and philosophical aspects than based on a story filled with tensions, surprises and typical beginning and ending. After all the years it still remains fhresh and modern, and visually one of the most beautiful films ever seen in history of cinema.

It is very light and comfortable, but controls are limited. There are two fan speeds, but no heat settings. There is a cool air switch.

To my surprise, it actually did a better job in the same amount of time. Despite the heat, no burning occurred, and my slightly wavy hair was nice and straight, shiny and smooth. Not really sure what ions or tourmaline do, but the results are solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and stopped working after a year","review":"Although there is a 4 year warranty on this product, the seller went out of business and no one can tell me where to return this nonworking dryer. It's touted as superior with a long warranty but what good is the warranty when you can't get it honored? A dryer this expensive that breaks after a year is no different than a cheaper model that you can at least replace 5 times over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Sold a Used Product!","review":"I am a loyal Amazon customer, but much to my disappointment I was sold a used blow dryer. The packaging looked conventional. Upon closer inspection, I noticed the white label that should be affixed by law to the bottom of the electrical cord(warning of water danger) was missing. But this is the worst; the words \\"off\\" and \\"low\\" were gone from the handle of the dryer, partially worn off from use. Where the hand would grip the dryer, the words had rubbed off! I could not find in the Amazon product description the words \\"reconditioned\\" but it seems that is what you could get. I did speak, sort of, to a customer agent, who said I would get a \\"new\\" one. I was not sure if that meant \\"new\\" or \\"another.\\" It came right away with free shipping and it does indeed look new. Just remember it has a 30 day warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF!","review":"This is the worst dryer I've ever used in 20 years as a professional stylist. Arrived damaged.

Excellent purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Hair Dryer EVER!!","review":"My hair stylist recommended this hairdryer and I can't say enough about it. It is lightweight and has a high/low setting and a cool trigger. It comes with several filter replacements although I've had mine about a year and haven't needed to replace that yet. I just suck the lint/dust out with my vacuum when needed.This dryer has done wonders for my hair. I always had cheapie dryers that got pretty hot. I didn't realize their was another way! I have a lot of coarse hair so usually after drying I look like the before part of the Frizz-ease commercial. With this dryer (while using a round brush) I don't even need to straighten my hair. It doesn't get very hot at all and it cut my drying time in half!! Not sure how that's possible but it is.I found the cheapest price on Amazon and my stylist was shocked when she heard how little I paid so I was pretty pleased. I'll never go back to those cheapie dryers ever again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"T3 hair dryer","review":"Not the best hair drier I've used it gets hot as you cornuie to use it but I wouldn't have purchased it if I was to look for a professional hair drier that can bring up the heat because this doesn't really do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Plug - \\"Seller didn't back their product\\"","review":"I'm one of those people who reads most reviews before purchasing a product on Amazon. I understand that it seems like most of the time there is that one or two people who speak poorly about a product that the masses rave about. It's just a blow dryer, about $80 at that, but still just a blow dryer. This product could be a good hair dryer, but the plug does not work subsequently neither does the dryer.Why I'm leaving this review is to expose the lack of commitment the seller has towards their product and customer. The seller would not respond to my emails about this broken down product in under four months. For the first 3 months the dryer worked well. Then the dryer at times would work and not work. Finally the dryer would not turn on. I cut the plug off and tested the power to the dryer without the plug. The plug is bad and so is the dryer with this plug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less that 4 weeks!","review":"Paid almost $100 for worst blower i ever had! Dont get fooled by its stylish looks. The heat was generous but the power was weak and took forever to dry my short hair. To top it off in less than 4 weeks the front nozzle broke off making it totally unusable. I purchased this hair blower for its high rating on an online review as being one of the best hair blowers for the price. I was also looking for a lightweight blower which is probably the only good thing you will get from this product! According to what ive read on Amazon, I dont believe it is warrantied by the manufacturer when purchased from Amazon. Dont waste your money! Will try and get a refund from the seller....

Here are the positives:-It's very light-Generates great heat-Love the extra long cord-They provided extra filters when I purchased it which I thought was a good thing but....Now the negatives:- Even if you change the filter regularly (hint, hint with the included extras), mine died after a year.- It's passing was very dramatic and looked like it was going to catch on fire, and smelled like it too.So it's great as long as it works, until it doesn't........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 months","review":"I did a lot of research before buying this hair dryer. I debated between the Elchim 2001 Classic and this one, and ended up getting this one. i shouldn't have ignored the reviews cautioning me on this product. After using this product for about 3 months, it's broken; it makes a low whirring sound and barely blows any air out on high power, makes a weird burning smell, and emits extremely, extremely hot air.So, potential buyers, beware!!!!! I didn't believe the negative reviews here, but trust me, now I do!! My new Elchim Classic will hopefully arrive within the next week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Impressed","review":"I was skeptical about buying such an expensive hair dryer. However, my best friend had one and I tried it on a trip. I thought I liked it but still wasn't sure about spending the money. My stylist let one of the other girls dry my hair one day. She used one when drying my hair. I commented on how soft and smooth my hair was. I usually get my hair flat ironed to get the same effect. She didn't have to. I called my girlfriend to see if her hair dryer was the same brand and it was. So I bought one. I love it and haven't flat ironed my hair yet! The only thing I was dissapointed in was that the warranty doesn't apply to the purchases from Amzon. I just hope it lasts for a long time so I don't feel cheated. Overall I am very impressed. I didn't realize that a hair dryer can make such a difference in your hair. I say go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crooks!","review":"I purchased one to try.

There is no info there either....I wonder if this company is even legal and paying taxes?!The only way you can contact them is thru amazon's email form and they will replay you with some generic email saying that you need to pay 15% restocking fee and return shipping fee!!So you recive an item that doesnt work and then you have to pay extra $50 or so to have it replaced!?It's just not worth my time....Dont take the risk of losing your time and money as I did.I had to file a claim to Amazon and i am looking forward to file a claim with BBB.Thanks for the reading and I wish you good luck!Sasa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"Don't buy this product!

Not so. I used it for about a month, trying to like it. It was quiet and light weight, but didn't dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should. It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn't have much blowing power. It's like my old hair dryer on low! I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100. Now, that dryer really BLOWS! It's also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.

It looks like the fan just completely broke off. I had gotten the first through my sister who is a hairdresser and she replaced it for me (that one lasted less than 6 months) and the second one lasted longer, but still not long enough considering the cost. There are limited setting options too, so those of you looking for \\"cool shot\\" or \\"warm\\" options should look elsewhere.

It was a poor choice on my part to even buy it and if i could i would return it. don't waste your money on it. its not any better then something you can buy at Sallys beauty supply or any local beauty supply house. the only thing i can say about it, is that you turn it on it works, but not with the best of power."},{"rating":"1","title":"No serial number T3 dryer","review":"I ordered a T3 dryer from Amazon because I had one previously and really like it.

Yes, it dries hair. There is no standard temperature setting, you can just have high strength or low (wind level, not heat) and it is so hot i've burned myself and my hair on it. Because it gets so hot, it's own internal temperature regulator SHUTS IT OFF all the time in the middle of drying. The only way to turn it back on is to wait until it decides it's ready to go again (several minutes of sitting.)

So when I contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly, they responded via email that this vendor AND Amazon.com are not an authorized resellers of T3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty. Now I am royally hosed.I highly suggest NOT purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Authentic","review":"First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it's no featherweight, it's heavier than my previous one.Second, I found that I couldn't register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it's sold by amazon..Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it's real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn't even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake.

Ok, that's silly, but \\"God said no\\" is one of the best songs I've ever heard. It is totally heart-wrenching rumination on the irrevesible nature of time and consequently, the indellible marks of guilt and evil. It may not be the best song Bern ever wrote, but it's probably the most ambitious and beautiful.Oh, yeah, the rest of the album is brilliant too. The title track is another favorite, wherein the singer dreams of not just a new American language, but a kinder, bigger world in general.

I own all of his stuff & have seen him several times (including a house concert before started getting huge). And while I think this album has some EXCELLENT songs (God Said No and Thanksgiving Day, & maybe Black Tornado) the rest of it doesn't live up to his potential.The biggest problem I find is the rock band backup. Someone else mentioned that he's trying to branch out & find a bigger audience but I think by signing to the new label & having the band he did so at the expense of his soul. The music is just too much. And despite claims to the contrary I don't hear ANY radio hits here. I think this effort is a bust.I'm still going to listen to him & see his shows- but I look forward to the end of his contract with this label.

It crushes ice better than any other blender I've used. It also mixes my protein powder and milk to a nice, thick, even consistancy. Functionally, I couldn't be happier.The problem is the extremely poor build quality. The gears are plastic. I noticed the black powder coming off from the gears after more than a few seconds of use. The blades don't come off, so cleaning is difficult. Soaking in water over night to clean the blade is not recommended, as the screw that holds the blades togather is NOT stainless steel.But the biggest problem with my unit is that the motor is arcing.

Some reviewers seemed upset that you have to press the 'dispense' button to dispense the smoothie into a glass, but that's what the manual says to do, and I don't have a problem with it.

The other reviewers are right, it's not a book that will tell you what to do, it tells you what to consider in each situation. Especially important are the sections on bluffing, value betting, pot odds and the fundamental theorem of poker. Sklansky is very mathematical, but he also shows what he is doing with each example, so basic math knowledge should suffice.

Sklansky gives advice on these and many more topics in his typically clear and concise style. This book has to be reread and studied to fully benefit from its ideas, but rest assured it is easy to dip into and will undoubtedly improve your standard of play. My one criticism is that their is insufficient coverage of no-limit and pot-limit poker, which is the prevailing form of poker outside the USA. Other than this the book is a must buy for all serious players.

The information is great for anyone that can use Sklansky's work as a springboard to deeper thought, but can lead many to mismanage variables while sizing up a situation. Not Sklansky's fault, but the reader. This was the first poker book I ever read and I misused the understanding at first for increased losses. However, overtime, Sklansky's thinking here has helped at the tables and off the felt as well.

Understanding the knowledge within this book will help make the other information a player needs to utilize to become a winning player much more tangible.It's actually kind of a shame. When this book was first published, it simply revolutionized the world of poker like so few other events have.This is definitely a must read for anyone who intends to become a student of the game, but I wouldn't recommend it to beginners. Simply put, I have yet to encounter a long term winning poker player who has not read this gem.

Since virtually every dedicated player has read it, to play without reading it is to put yourself at a disadvantage. Sklansky focuses on the math of poker--how to calculate odds, pot odds, reverse implied pot odds, etc. It's not a fun read; it reminded me of some of the college textbooks I dreaded, but it rewards hard work with a new depth of insight that will make you a smarter, more insightful player. It deserves five stars but I gave it four because it can be so dreary. No colorful stories of how so-and-so went all in with a pair of fours only to [take out a set on the River, etc. Sklansky is so professorial in tone it's hard to imagine him at smoky poker table betting the farm.

The relentlessly stilted nature of his prose does not help (he crams in so many SAT-words, it's as though he were trying to fulfil a quota).

Scent and Softness.2. 'HOW MUCH HAIR IS REMOVED PERIOD\\".Anyways i wound up having to re-lather with Proraso a product that works to get a smooth shave.....But to finish the shipper sent me the product quickly and the soap does have a pleasant scent.Otherwise I'm not pleased so I guess this is my first negative review but maybe the soap was old, Its hard to say?.Nuff SaidIndiana ED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great except for the death part","review":"Triethanolamine has been associated with \\"cancer, allergies/immunotoxicity, organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), contamination concerns\\" and gets a 5 out of 10 at the Skin Deep database for toxicity earning it a \\"moderate toxicity\\" tag.

Even after a hot shower, the scent is overpowering. The ingredient list and front don't say \\"natural scent,\\" so it's probably a chemical compound, but I'm not absolutely sure about that. I will probably throw this tub out...Of course, the scent itself and its level are subjective judgments.

Every time I went looking at another shaving cream, I kept coming back to Taylor of Old Bond St (Sandalwood). It just seemed like this was highly suggested in reviews everywhere, so it made sense for me to try it - and I sure am glad I listened! This shave cream is the way you're supposed to smell in a barbershop - a great musk smell! It lathers well, I didn't find myself needing to use a ton to get the desired lather for three shave passes, so to me this is a win-win. Great value, top shelf quality and a highly desirable smell that my wife loves! Thanks Taylor of Old Bond St!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"Can't praise enough. A tiny bit goes a long way for a daily shave of at least 2 complete and 4 passes under the chin. The best part is the scent, which for me persists for most of the day.

Decided to try something new and less expensive and followed the good reviews here on Amazon.First impression upon opening the container was, whoa! Stinky stuff! There is a pleasant sandalwood aroma hidden in there somewhere, but you have to endure the strong chemical smell that surrounds it. Other reviewers have said the scent is strong, but I was skeptical. They weren't exaggerating. Its overwhelming. I used to enjoy shaving with my safety razor, badger brush and Art of Shaving cream. The smell was subtle and pleasant. This stuff is offensive, and very unpleasant to shave with. I find myself avoiding shaving because of the noxious odor. Worse, the smell lingers on my face.I'll give this cream a star for good lathering and another for value. But I can't go any further because of the offensive smell it gives off.

I used it with Mugg shaving soap from a convenience store,It got close however left me all nicked and cut up with razor burn still. After a little research, I bought bic double edge blades for their sharpness and Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream for protection and a smooth shave. Boy did it not disappoint! For the first time in my life I got a close, painless, comfortable shave with no burn or razor bumps! The sandalwood smells like an old barber shop and it lathers up real nice.

I used a real badger shaving brush and fusion power razor with it. No aftershave, follow it up with a little face lotion when in dryer climates. My only complaint is that when I first used it, I made the mistake of dipping the brush directly in the bowl to mix it. This made the jar last about 2 months. Now I just scoop out the right amount with my finger and mix it in my palm. Who needs a bowl anyway?

Prorasa previously held the spot (and its a great choice as well) but this is just so much creamier and a pleasure to apply to my face. It also holds moisture well so when I lather both sides of my face at once, it hasn't dried out by the time I get to shave the other side (which has been a slight problem with other soaps).Its got a strong scent, which I really like, but if you're sensitive to fragrances it might be too much for you.

I use a Merkur 180 and use pre-shave balm to get my face ready for a shave, and this stuff smells good, but leaves you with harsh burn during and after the shave.

It was a good story, definitely the kind to read curled up on the couch with a cup of tea.Treasures Lost, Treasures FoundAn excellent story!

Most interesting is the depths to which the Clinton administration would go to derail and deride Starr - all detailed and supported in the book.

I made the mistake of tapping the Stanley pin into the hinge only to bind the hinge up in this liner. What I got it removed, I then discovered this liner. Once removed, the spring loaded pin worked perfectly. Not all hinges have this type of a liner, so look before trying this.

I have to use three of them to actually close my door - one one each of the three hinges - , but it is a large and heavy door and used several times a day.

Strength not quite enough to bring door to fully latched position but very nearly closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak. Not strong enough to fully close basement door","review":"These are extremely weak if you need to swing a heavy door. I have a solid wood door going into my basement and two of them can not close it completely, and yes I adjusted the tension to the max. If you are using it for a hollow core door they may work. Anything other than that, these are useless. Use the Everbuilt spring hinges which work great but require a little more work as you have to replace the whole hinge rather than just the pin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out","review":"Nice idea but the directions were awful.

It's sort of like a dark Nora Roberts or Danielle Steel. \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" comes to mind - and that was panned by most critics too, but I loved the book. Men seem to hate this book but women like it. I don't think I've ever seen a man read Nora Roberts. Maybe it's a thing that has something to do with age and gender.I've never written a review before, but I just had to considering the extreme views of the other reviewers. I find the love/hate thing an indication that the book causes a great deal of feeling. Isn't that what reading something is suppose to do?

While the image was relatively bright and sharp I saw two of everything. My first pair I received had dirt or cloudiness inside them that I couldn't clean and, notably, didn't seem correctly aligned as there seemed to be a slight double image. Figuring it was a bad unit, I asked Amazon for a replacement and received one the following week. Again, the image was relatively bright and sharp and, again, I saw two of everything. This is now going back for a refund. Not sure if my luck is that bad or if this series is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also seeing double","review":"These binoculars look good and feel good, but the pair I received performed abysmally. They have been returned for a refund. There are too many alternatives out there to mess with a manufacturer who apparently doesn't test what comes off the assembly line. My pair had exactly the same problem reported in the other negative review; namely, a doubled image. I had no problem getting both sides simultaneously in focus, with good clarity on both sides, but no amount of additional fiddling with the binoculars would eliminate the doubled image. Such an inexcusable alignment error represents either lack of testing of the finished product, poor design, or poor internal construction. Over the years I've owned a number of binoculars from other manufacturers and none had this kind of problem. Since the binoculars I received can only be used as a monocular, one star is as good a rating as they merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collector's item","review":"This little 41-page picture book is a lovely reminder of 1950s Chanukah graphics, produced by Arnold Lobel (also of Frog and Toad fame) and Ezekiel Schloss.The illustrations probably long predate Lobel's amusing bestselling secular children's series, and for that reason alone, this book is a collector's item.But there's a certain something about the graphics that stands on its own, too, and makes Chanukah brighter, and more fun for kids and grown ups alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good drama","review":"This movie was recommended to me by a friend.

I was not disappointed. If It Feels Good Do It is a real rocker but the rest of the cd is full of softer songs. They are a couple other hard rockers (Pick It Up And Dail It and Never Seeing The Ground For The Sky) but the cd seems to remind me more of Coax Me than Money City Maniacs. The whole cd is very good. There's not a weak song on the disc and as a bonus it comes with a lyrics sheet...a first for a Sloan album. Pretty Together is the band's best since Twice Removed. Pick it up and buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major letdown","review":"I've been a fan of Sloan since \\"Smeared,\\" and have always looked forward to the next album. Some folks maligned \\"Between the Bridges,\\" but I thought it was one of their best efforts, especially Jay Ferguson's stuff. But \\"Pretty Together\\" just doesn't do it for me. It sounds like an empty, rote exercise. The melodies are flat, the performances perfunctory, the spirit lacking. Worst of all, the distinctive songwriting personalities of all four Sloaners have been homogenized into one big rock sound that's just not very distinctive. I thought the New Pornographers' last album is more Sloan than the new Sloan. And a whole lot better. I hope that \\"Pretty Together\\" is just a career hiccup and that Sloan will bounce back. This album is sort of like being let down by formerly dependable friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"we love sloan, ayayayayayayyayayayayayayyayayayay!!","review":"this is a good cd. except for one song that sounds like something 'n sync would sing, that would be jay's number, entitled \\"are you giving me back my love?\\" the title says it all. actually it's a decent song since sloan sings it, but in any other context all i can think is justin timberlake. i like andrews songs \\"in the movies\\" \\"the great wall\\" and \\"never seeing the ground for the sky\\". also check out track 13, it's cute and fun. sloan is my #1 fav band and i want to marry them."},{"rating":"1","title":"$5 a tin?!?!?!","review":"Yes, we're addicted to these mints in our home, as are our friends who always want some of ours.

Maybe it's an age thing, or a vitamin thing, but this little book is my start-with book. It's easy to flip thru and find that little crumb you are looking for to get going again. And by all means, it is not a Linux in a Nutshell, or other more comprehensive reference book, but certainly for quickie RH-specific double-checks, it's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection of ironic and merry Russian folk tales","review":"The real audience of this book would be young adults, wise children, and literate adults. The tales consist of quirky folktales that are different in texture from the usual Western European stories we are more familiar with. A story might start out following one character, then seque to another, then to another, in a constant weaving of narrative. It would be disconcerting to a very young audience, but very entertaining to anyone who catches on. It is a good introduction to stock characters from Russian folk literature, such as the witch in a hut with hen's feet.

No student of Christianity should be without reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I find this book disappointing. Firstly, one fourth of the book is taken up by the author's travel accounts. It's a different story when an author gives some background to each recipe. But it is not the case here and I find the result of those two books rolled into one very awkward. Second, and more annoyingly, many recipes rely on meat substitutes. I have always found it sad and the sign of a certain lack of imagination when vegetarian cooking tries to mimick meat-based dishes. It is particularly regrettable in a book on Turkish cooking which has a rich tradition of NATURALLY vegetarian dishes. Which is why I ordered the book in the first place !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly misleading","review":"I truly wanted to like this book. I like travelogues to tell the reader about the culture while delving into the recipes.Unfortunately, I found the recipes were actually the same meat based dishes from her other book \\"Turkish Cooking\\" with soy subsitutes where the meat would be. Broth becomes non-meat flavored bouillon. I'm upset to have found only a handful of actual vegetable based recipes. Alas, vegans will not find anything of use in this book.I then flipped through the sister book, \\"Turkish Cooking,\\" to find the same layout and identical recipes listing the originally intended meat or fish.

I realize groups from '93 had to change their style (no more chronic style beats) to accomodate the new sounds of '97, but other than world war 3 the beats were unimaginative, boring and sounded like anyone could produce them. T.A. had amazing lyrics for gangsta rappers back then, but in '97 you had to come up with some thought provoking material which T.A. couldn't do. Bad lryics with bad beats equals bad album.

They work really well in small spaces like these, and they're extremely easy to move around, especially since they don't have to be near an outlet.

I recently joined a choir (I've got a good ear) and bought this program so that I could copy my tenor parts from the scores we sing and listen to them until I got them down pat. I think this program must be directed toward folks who compose using a MIDI interface because it's definitely NOT for folks who want to use music notation. If you get any more complex than 4/4 time the program inserts funny rests, seemingly at random, which can't be removed. You can enter words with the music but it's difficult to line up the words with their proper notes. It's not very happy with notation or accidentals or time changes or key changes. In short, this may be fine for a MIDI composer but you should look elsewhere if you want to \\"compose\\" using a staff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Never got it.Not there fault .

It looks and feels good but the pellets get caught in the chamber. Maybe because they are plastic. It wouldn't turn enough and the pellet would hit the barrel before it was properly line up for a discharge. I took it back 3 times and they all had the same problem. The first one I had worked for the longest amount of time but the other 2 didn't work right out of the box. Not every pellet would get caught but 2-4 would be in the chamber after shooting 8 rounds. Also sometimes the chamber wouldn't even turn. I finally exchanged for a Walther cp-sport for $15 more and it is a much better gun for about the same price. The way the co2 cartridge is loaded and how the chamber(made of metal) is loaded is just more realistic. I have had no problems with the sport.

The conclusion is clear, Christians are more competent to counsel than psychologists and psychiatrists (if you do not believe me read the book).

It is time that the concept of an individual's sin having a direct correspondence to their state of mental health be put to rest for good. A person with a massive coronary may need more prayer and to confess his or her sins but medical intervention is needed for a cure. In much the same way, a diagnosable mental disorder is in need of medical attention, and to counsel otherwise is irresponsible and the polar opposite of true Christ-like compassion. If one can justify the balanced use of the \\"medical establishment\\" for heart disease then the same justification can be made for treating mental illness.

Vital bits of information are missing from virtually all topics it covers. As an example: The section on Custom Dialog Boxes in chapter 3 has absolutely no mention of how to access the child control data which are of course the whole reason you would want to create a dialog in the first place.

Right from the beginning with a saloon that looked like a New York City tenement building, and costumes to match, with a chorus as dull as the gray of the room. Juan Pons as Jack Rance is able to sing the part, but that's all. He doesn't even come close to Sherrill Milnes' mean, tough guy portrayal. And Minnie, oh dear! Mara Zampieri was so all wrong for this role. Her voice I can only describe as \\"thin.\\" When Placido Domingo finally arrived, he literally lit up the room with his presence. He remained the only bright spot in this entire production.Definitely skip this one and go directly to the Met production with Barbara Daniels as Minnie, Sherrill Milnes as Jack Rance, and Placido Domingo as Dick Johnson. That one is a five star winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"La Fanciulla del West","review":"This production was a real disappointment. First, I am just tired of singers who are 30 years or more older than the people they are protraying. There really is excellent young talent out there.I love the opera, but it takes a great director and great acting to save the libretto from seeming ridiculous. The acting here would not have passed muster in a high school play.The sound quality was part of the problem, but Zampieri was harsh and shrill. Domingo did not impress - especially with the acting. The Rance character did the best job both in singing and acting - and that was only good, not excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed production","review":"There are some great aspects to this production: the orchestra, Domingo's voice and that of Pons. Zampieri's singing is bad, though. I wonder why they gave her the role. Also the supporting members of the cast, while doing some great singing, are poor actors, and their stage movements are usually awkward.While the Royal Opera House DVD with Domingo and Neblett is pretty good, the great news is that the memorable production by Metropolitan Opera with Barbara Daniels and (yes) Domingo is now available on DVD.

It has the scares, some (but not much) humor, and a gorgeous leading character (Ms Watts). The visuals are fascinating and the story grips you right from the start.

At other times, it benefits from its detective feel even more so than it does from its horror side.

Furthermore, Verbinski has pasted in a number of irrelevant scenes, which are little more than an irritating distraction, whilst skipping over some of the more atmospheric scenes from the original.Sure the movie is still an effective and thought-provoking horror, but that is entirely due to the magnificence of the original.Even the famous shock ending seems rushed here and feels spoiled.I'm afraid this merely reinforces my view that remakes are, almost without exception, (John Carpenter's The Thing being the exception) inferior to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Waste Of Time","review":"I saw this with my mom. I dont really like horror movies and havent seen many. The only thing scary about this movie were the images. They were disturbing. There wasn't any moments though that made me jump out of my seat. As the movie went on I was able to make the connections. It wasn't that hard. But I knew the ending way into the movie. It just dragged on and on. Almost half of the movie could have been cut out. A lot of it just didn't need to be in the movie. Just please, dont listen to all these other people who say it was a good movie. They dont know what they are saying. Use you good judgement and use your time for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, Hip, and Chilling.","review":"After seeing this I immediately wanted to tell everyone I knew about it.

Well worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Big Deal","review":"When this movie first came out everyone said that they loved it. After I watched this movie I felt emotionally and physically drained. It seemed that what little storyline the movie did have was not connected at all and sometimes the movie made no sense at all. I will try not to spoil the movie but the \\"death tape\\" made really no sense at all to me. The only cool thing was watching the content of the tape, it was very bizarre. I will regretfully say that despite popular opinion I do not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"some jumpy parts","review":"this movie is sracy when u watch it in tha dark! lol it is a good movie but not as sracy as RINGU but it is a good jumpy/thiller movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and interesting","review":"The Ring is more of a mystery rather than a horror flick. The plot revolves around a videotape that, when watched, causes the viewer to die seven days later. A reporter, played by Naomi Watts, plays detective and unravels the mystery of the tape while becoming directly involved. The only drawback to the movie is the reporter's psychic, monotone son who seems to be based on a collage of previous horror flick children ala The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echos. The Ring has several genuinely terrifying scenes that will keep the viewers on the edge of their seats throughout. Bring on the sequels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky Ring...","review":"I'm not a big fan of horror flicks but this is one of my all times favorites. I lean more toward movies like \\"Misery\\" than chop 'em up films like the Friday 13th series or the Halloween series. This film does a lot of scaring without resorting to gaping neck wounds and gallons of blood. And it has an interesting story line. The director uses imagery, colors, and builds the tension in a way that draws the viewer in and fills you with dread for the lead character played by Naomi Watts. This is a great horror film to add to your collection. The dvd comes with extras that are interesting too. Give this movie a try and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, lousy DVD","review":"I thought this was one really scary film. And that's why it's getting 2 stars -- 'cause the movie's good. The DVD is miserable. There's nothing here worth buying -- in fact, there're really no extras at all. There is some deleted footage combined with the \\"Ring\\" video, but there doesn't seem to be any point to it. And there are two trailers for other films, one of them being the original Ringu. (Are we really expected to pay for advertising now?) That's it. No commentaries, no \\"Making of\\" features, not even cast and crew filmographies. Don't buy this DVD -- rent it today, and wait for a special edition to make this worth buying. By far the most disappointing DVD release I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving vehicle","review":"This film definitely made my stomach churn with anxiety...the only flaw would be the 2 teenagers killed in the car.

Nakata does succeed where Gore Verbinski fails : the sheer horror. In Ringu (japanes version) everything is left to the imagination. Ringu makes you guess, keeps you to the edge, where as Ring you even get to see the occasional ugly face.Furthermore, Ring is a compilation of THREE movies. Ring - Ring 2 and finally Ring 0 which brings you to the beginning of everything.Give the Japanese version.American Ring is none other than a commercial remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but not my cup of tea!","review":"This is the most weirdest movie that I can think of.

When i decited to see the movie it already came out on TV, my bast freind and i started watching and we were vary SURPRISED.All of my freinds were right it was a complitly waste of our time,the ring is not scary at all, it has a lot of suspense but its not scary.Maybe there were some parts that was a little scary but that's it!I would not be surprised if the ring 2 will be as teribal as this first movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my 2 hours back... =(","review":"The Ring is boring. Why so many people say it's scary is beyond me. The so-called \\"investigation\\" was pointless, and it still didn't explain anything about why the deaths were occuring. The plot was needlessly slow and the mildly \\"scary\\" parts were too few and far in between. It's rated PG-13, how scary and disturbing could it be? Creepy music and spooky scenery just doesn't do it for me. I'm very disappointed.As far as the \\"extras\\" on the dvd goes, they're pretty week, it's just a collection of edited scenes and non-sensical images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"The Others\\" instead of this horrible movie","review":"The Ring is very boreing and very dumb.

How scary is that? I probably should watch the movie again so I can be fair; however I remembered that it sucks pretty badly anyways. You have 7 days from the time you pick up the phone to live!?!?! If you don't pick up the phone after you watch the video, the mean ole ghost won't kill you. IT will just keep calling you back until you pick up, then you have 7 days. Funny, I don't remember camcorders being around in the 60's. Anyways, my rant doesn't probably make sense to those who haven't watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, great horror, great movie.","review":"I thought this movie was just totally awesome. It scared the heck out of me and it was a good story. This girl named Samara got thrown in a well by her mom for her father did not love her. Her nightmares are on this tape and if you watch it the phone will ring and it'll say: seven days. Freaky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually Beautiful, Mentally Defective","review":"It looks great, it sounds great, but it's not great. The effects are nice - somebody went to town on digital grading, that's for sure, although the company that did the effects has a web site that needs a password to get into it - very annoying and un-user-friendly. Still, it's full of holes. The origin of the videotape never gets explained and we never get a reasonable explanation for how these people are getting these creepy phone calls from dead people. They really expect you to suspend way too much disbelief however and that ultimately pulls the movie down. This kind of convention has been done before, and far better, in movies like The Changeling. If you like this movie, you should really check it out, it's far better at conveying the same message."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cleverly done horror film","review":"... the movie is a masterpiece touching up on all the classic and newage horror tricks. not to give anything away, but honestly how many movies do we see where someone emerges form the t.v. come on!! that is classic and you know it. the characters are well played by well groomed and suttle actors. I was surprised to see that the movie is shockingly played down by very what seemed to be laid back acting It makes for a good balance I beleive. the story line well, youll have to figure that one out on your own. Im not really sure if any body knows axactly what is going on. you have to create your own point of view, which to me makes for a good movie in itself when the audience truly has to think.See it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you're probably expecting","review":"This movie probably is not what you're expecting.

The movie follows reporter Rachel Keller (played by Naomi Watts), as she tries to figure out why a mysterious videotape killed her niece, a week after watching it. Rachel shows the tape to her ex-husband (played by Martin Henderson), and they team up to try to find records, the meanings to mysterious happenings, and the reason to why the tape kills, with only seven days to live. After Rachel's son Aiden watches the tape, she travels to a strange island only to find even weirder things, and the secrets and mystery behind THE RING.The movie is great, although the dvd lost a star for lack of special features, etc.if you liked this movie, DO NOT see Ringu- its a dissapointer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah","review":"Good movie, but it kept you thinking though.

Hehe, it's not that bad of course, but \\"The Ring\\" indeed is the movie that managed to scare the peace out of me for the rest of that day, and with its' flaws (the tape that's never explained where comes from or how was \\"produced\\") -well, the movie managing to do so well what it intends to do I DON'T CARE!

If you saw this movie first, you very well might. Scary, mysterious, and engrossing, \\"The Ring\\" succeeds because it eschews so many staples of modern horror (nudity and wanton sex, gratuitous gore, killers who can't stop spouting one-liners, etc.) in favor of an original plot, careful characterization, and a creepy, believable atmosphere. Tautly written and seamlessly directed with a standout performance by charismatic Naomi Watts as the benighted lead, \\"The Ring\\" is everything most horror films are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointed","review":"I was excited when the movie came out, saw it and went what?

It is such a cliche. It uses the phone ringing without anyone being there like on scream, and seeing \\"the ring\\" before you die and having a certain time limit before you die is from Fear dot Com. It has the little boy being a sort of prophet like the little girl in Bless the Child. It is awful. The woman who played Aydens mom didn't act like she was even scared most of the time. They could have picked better actors/actresses than the ones they did. Maybe it's just where I have seen so many of these movies that they are all running together. But i thought it was an awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be scary?","review":"After hearing that this was the scariest movie of the year, I rented the video.

I like to think I have above average intelligence but did any one else have trouble figuring this one out? Who made the phone calls? Who made the video; a girl who died twenty-five years ago (when the VCR hadn't been invented)? This movie was very [weak]. If you enjoyed the X-Files, don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All this and no Wagner?","review":"The Ring is one of my all time favorite classical music pieces. I was happy to hear that they were releasing a movie of that. I was waiting with baited breath as the camera would pan across the Rhine and treat me to scenes of Rhine Maidens. Instead, I get something completely different. If Hollywood is going to make a movie with the same title as one of the best classical pieces out there, they could have the decency to use the same plot. No, instead, they do some stupid horror movie.I mean geeze, what's wrong with showing scenes of Fafner after he puts the ring on and becomes a dragon? And then having his brother Siegfried kill him? Blah.When I first did this review, I didn't see the movie but now I have and I'll have to say it was a pretty good movie. Very very creepy. It's a horror movie that they haven't made in a long time one that actually scares instead of trying to gore you out. Very good movie, but it still get's one start because it's not Wagner."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Disappoint","review":"This movie is an abysmal waste of time.

I was thinking that finally here was a scary movie that had something good going. A scary movie that actually was scary...then as the movie continued it just got more and more stupid. It was such a disappointment since the beginning captured my attention. As the movie goes on it just veers into blatant stupidity. It seemed like the writer had a wonderful idea, couldnt figure out what to do next and decided to just put in a whole bunch of confusing unnecessary (...).Then at the end I got excited again, thinking...okay! Now maybe everything will come together and make some sense...but then...it veered off into stupidity again. The movie is okay I guess. But when you think about it later you realize that absolutly NONE of it made sense! So you decide...but if you want my opinion...just watch Child's Play.

All the critics wanna treat it like one of those dumb \\"Scream\\" type movies, and they uphold movies like Night of the Living Dead and Rosemary's Baby. Well for one thing Night of the Living Dead sux! and another thing, The Ring blows the crap outta Rosemary's Baby. When I saw the preview, I was confused about what the movie was about. It sounded like just another urban legend--a videotape filled with nightmarish images, leading to a phone call foretelling the viewer's death in exactly seven days. As a newspaper reporter, Rachel Keller (Watts) was naturally skeptical of the story, until four teenagers all met with mysterious deaths exactly one week after watching just such a tape. Allowing her investigative curiosity to get the better of her, Rachel tracks down the video...and watches it.

I cannot believe it was PG-13 and really did not expect it to live up to its hype.I would put this on a par with Brian Depalma's Hitchcockian ode \\"Sisters\\", \\"Jacobs Ladder\\" or the more recent \\"Stir of Echoes\\" all of which are far more frightening than any slasher film.I thought this film made quite a psychological impact, and thoughit is incoherent in parts, it still makes a lasting impression.

And this is a good example. The creepiness from Ringu just didn't transfer very well onto this remake. I'd rather not give away too much detail by explaining why.

The 1st Ring is so much better than the 2nd. It has more meaning and is a whole lot scarier than the 2nd! Sure, it's not the easiest plot to follow, but at least it's full of suspense! The part that scares me the most is when Katie's mom is talking to Aiden's aunt about how she saw her daughter dead in the closet, and a flashback happens and you see Katie sitting dead in her closet with a wierd, deformed face. Another part that's strange is the pictures of whoever watched the video are always blurred. It's movies like these that are restoring my faith in horror culture.If you need any reasurence that movies can still be scary, watch The Ring. You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film! And make sure you avoid the sequel.

I think the editor and producer needed someone else to take a look at this movie before they released it.There were a lot of things that weren't explained at all and also what seemed to be unnecessary scenes left in the movie. All in all, I did not find this movie to be very cohesive, and I didn't find that the ending answered many questions or resolved many issues. I also didn't get the feeling that the movie was supposed to be one of those subtle and/or leaving issues unanswered kind of movies (those gaping-mouthed corpses certainly weren't subtle). Try the book, Ringu by Koji Suzuki, that the movie is based on, it does answer your questions, and tells the story in a much more sinister way."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"why is naomi watts' name not mentioned under the title? she is the star of the movie and is the main antagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese Original is Much Scarier","review":"I watched Japanese original \\"Ringu\\". The Ring only covers only a part the phychological part. The reason why \\"Ringu\\" is much scarier is because the underline Japanese culture.

It kept me on my seat for the entire time. I normally get up to get something to drink or eat, but if I even thought about it I knew I would miss something of important. The scariest part of all I think was when I had just turned off the DVD player the phone rang. Now talk about a creep out. That is exactly what this film did it creeped me out I didn't want to answer the phone so I didn't. Then I turned all of the lights on and was tehn and only then able to fall asleep.

Do not waste your time. Terrible!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible movie...","review":"I don't like horror movies at all and I actually went to see this at theater. I know why. I heard this movie compared to \\"The Sixth Sense\\", which was a great movie. And the premise is great. \\"You watch a video tape and a few days later you die.\\"So I wanted to see why. What was so evil about this tape. How did these viewers die, and why? Everything about this movie is good except the ending and the answer to the above questions. First of all, the Ring is in no way like the Sixth Sense. At least that movie was consistent, it was a ghost story.The Ring for the whole movie (except the ending) leads us to believing there is a logical reason why people are dying. Naomi Watts inspects the tape with high-tech equimpment and follows leads. I kept hoping she would find the evil killer genius behind it all, but instead the movie reduces itself to some \\"Freddie Kreuger\\" type ending. I was very dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Your Blankie Ready To Cover Your Eyes!

I must confess that MANY, MANY times the blankie was very close to my eyes as The Ring is LOADED with HIGHLY disturbing images, jumpy parts that made me yell aloud more than once, and the ultimate dark scene with a a scary dead girl coming out of a TV!Interesting premise of viewing a video, getting a scary phone call & being dead within 7 days.

It has some very slow moments and the plot doesn't tie together well. I saw this movie w/ my girlfriend (who easily gets scared and doesn't like to watch scary movies), and after we left the theater, she wasn't even scared and we barely discussed the movie except for how it made little sense.

The flashes on the screen come back at you after seeing the movie and if you notice there really isn't any kind of music in this film. I know that many people are probably reading this and thinking what a wimp...but I have been watching scary movies since I was five and I have never seen anything like this. I would not recommend this movie especially to kids. I think that this movie has a lot of evil in it. If I could I wouldn't even give this a star because it doesn't deserve it.

Finally I get scared at the end but come on you shouldn't have to watch a whole horror film just to get scared once at the end. The fact that this wasn't a slasher film but a psychological film didn't bother me but a lot of things didn't make sense like where did the video come from and why is it that this girl is evil and how does she have this power to kill people and why does she talk to the boy. On a good note the scenery is very beautiful, with all the fog and how it's dark and dismal which gives the movie a very creepy feeling that I liked. Also it is scary to think that you could be killed from just watching a film.

It is just that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop.","review":"So many people are gushing over this movie. It is average at best.Just to review, a thriller spins a tale with clues and loose ends along the way. This movie has some good points; imagery and cinematography bumped this movie up to the two stars. However the storyline is thin, and in the end there is no aha moment.

It doesn't have an ending yet, but THE RING 2 will premier this March. So I suggest you watch this one already.

If one loves to be scared half to death this movie is for you just make sure someone is there to hold your hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary Movie","review":"For several years friends have been telling me I just NEED to see the movie The Ring. I assume this is because I am a fan of indie genre fiction, mainly horror and dark fantasy. Well, I'm not easily scared; having seen almost everything in my 58 years on Planet Earth, but this film shook me. To call it creepy is an understatement. I really don't enjoy the bloodfests that are commonly associated with horror, and The Ring isn't that kind of horror. It's subtle, well written, and got my skin crawling in a way I've haven't felt in a long time. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys real horror, not just blood and decapitations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Those VCRs at Low-Budget Motels!","review":"This was a great movie. At first I thought that it might be kind of stupid or geared towards kids, but it held my interest the entire time. Of course, it has a supernatural bent, which stretches the imagination a bit, but for that genre, it was very well done.The basic plot is that several teenagers watch a strange videotape and within one week, they are all dead. A reporter finds out about this because her babysitter is one of the teenagers who died. She and her estranged husband investigate the suspicious deaths.The story moves quickly, the acting is good, and I imagine that watching it at night with the lights out would be creepy. Lots of fun and I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFYING!!","review":"This movie, although a remake of some japanese film, is strong enough to hold its own and is simply amazing.

It's a horror story wherein characters die one week after viewing a horrific video tape. An hour in, I was envying the characters.I'm a big horror fan (heck, my twenty-fifth birthday party had a \\"Legend of Boggy Creek\\" theme), but I simply could not buy into this premise - a killer video tape? I mean, give me killer dolls any day over that. What's next, murderous spatulas? Killer quiches? Honestly.Rent it for a laugh, nothing else. The only thing to fear about videos is late fees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original.","review":"If you're looking for a good horror movie, Asian cinema seems to be the place to look nowadays. Nothing exemplifies this more than The Ring. A remake of a 1998 Japanese film, the American version is lacking everything that made the original such a talked-about hit. The two most important aspects that it never can quite achieve are subtlety and atmosphere. In the orginal, the kids all look as though they've died of fright. In the remake, they look as though they've died of fright, AND THEN TURNED INTO DECAYING, DEMONIC CORPSES!!!! All this did was to add to the special effects budget. It doesn't improve the atmosphere, and it totally ignores the idea of subtlety. You don't need decaying, gooey, demonic corpses to make a creepy, disturbing movie.The DVD looks good, sounds good, has a short movie made just for the DVD, but I'd recommend skipping this and buying the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"All filler, no thriller...","review":"This movie could have been good, but it got caught up in explaining itself and then everything fell apart. The story was too tangled to make sense. Too many weird coincidences needed to happen and did happen, making the movie seem cheap and hollow. There were some creepy parts, especially when the little girl comes out of the TV. But come on folks, all the gay horse farm crap, and the orphan daughter crap, and the psychotic mother crap...it's too much. People call this a psychological thriller, but it's more of a confusing thriller. The Ring 2 is even worse. All filler, no thriller. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool stuff","review":"I've never seen \\"Ringu\\", but I get the feeling I'd like it, since I really like this. I agree with what seems to be the general sentiment in that you should watch this more than once to catch everything and truly appreciate it.Stellar performance from Naomi Watts. This was her first movie in which she played the main character, and she carries that weight very well. Martin Henderson was good, too, as the more laid-back of the two investigating the mystery of the tape.I say watch \\"The Ring\\" every Halloween.

This movie, however, fell flat on its face. It was rather disjointed, and didn't rely on gore really to scare...it tried to be suspenseful, but was unable to create an atmosphere that left the audience in fear for the duration of the film. There are much better horror movies than this.

More shock value there.This one's a modern retelling of the classical Japanese NOH theatre tale - the 'vengeful' ghost seeking retribution.Granted there are a few minor jolts - but it is not too special -more or less something for the kids on a very wet afternoon.Sorry!

But when I did see it I thought the film was absolute rubbish! Sure its kinda scary when something jumps out at you but people are comparing this film to classics like The Exorcist! Hello. The Exorcist was actually a decent film with a storyline that didn't make you feel like you wanted to kill yourself. The Ring has a complicated storyline and unlike most horror movies YOU have to work it out instead of being told about it.

How else could one explain the open ended questions that go unanswered in order to lead the viewer with no closure, just the credits. If I had to quess the screen writer of this film must be furious because too many parts of this film are well crafted which lead me to believe that the choices made were those of some Hollywood know nothing. The one thing about show business is that where else can useless people make so much money for doing and knowing nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"I am not a big fan of the horror genre. But I started this movie with an open mind only to find myself waiting for some kind of closure as the ending credits started. Convoluted visuals and a half-baked plot with nothing to back either one up simply left me wondering \\"What happened\\"?It starts out with a promising story line. People who watch a certain video tape are dying seven days after viewing it. But from there the story is weak, distracting, and just plain stupid.You are no closer to knowing why any of these events occured at the end of the movie. I am not a dense person. I don't need to have everything spelled out for me in movies. I don't mind \\"open\\" endings where you have to use your brain. But there is a fine line between artistic and inane.

I'm not saying the movie was bad- it wasnt- it was enthralling. I was absolutely TERRIFIED. I am a 25 year old woman and I was too afraid to sleep after seeing it. I was huddled so close to my husband and I had the blankets wrapped around me so tight I was suffocating, but I wasnt moving and I sure as hell wasnt taking off my covers....ridiculous, I realize, but the movie was as creepy as it gets.

Nothing is resolved. And if you're content with watching a movie and not receiving all the information necessary to understand WHY things are happening, then you'll be ok watching this. Yes it is somewhat creepy. Yes, Naomi Watts is a fantastic beautiful actress and does a great job along with the boy who plays her son. Yes, the plotline was a fantastic one that could have been developed better.But in the end, you are left with a movie that doesn't explain why the \\"entity\\" is killing people, where this \\"entity\\" came from, nor how to defeat it. Unless they come up with a sequel/prequel movie that answers my concerns above, then this movie will have been a waste for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural horror movie","review":"The Ring is a movie about a videotape that kills whoever watches it in one week after viewing. This movie is based on the Japanese movie called Ringu. Watching this movie was definitely frightening. I could confidently say that this is the scariest movie I've ever seen. It's filled with eerie events and unexplainable horror.Naomi Watts stars in this movie as the main character. She tries to get to the bottom of this strange puzzle. She's a journalist and she uses her knack at investigating to figure out what is going on. Her acting is realistic and very good.If you've never seen this movie you should go watch it. I've never seen such strange images in a movie before. The explanation of the supernatural is very weird, though. I realized quickly that I wasn't too frightened about such unrealistic occurrences. Anyway, it's a really good scary movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper for my movie collection","review":"Personally the movie did not scare me, so I was a little dissapointed since so many people said it was so scary. But I'm a difficult person to scare since I've seen many many horror movies and have not seen one that I'd actually call scary in at least the last 3 years.However, the movie more than makes up for that with it's beautifully created eerie and disturbing imagery. The movie's official website ...is equally as well done has the same feel to it. Everything about the movie is absolutely gorgeous. I think for me, the visuals were too intriguing and awesome for me to be scared. Hard for me to feel fear when I'm filled with astonishment and admiration for the visual effects.Also a great somewhat-original storyline (if you don't count it's Japanese counterpart made only a year earlier). This video is an absolute must for my video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ring, Bluray Edition 2012.","review":"Overall, this bluray of the film is great.

The movie \\"spoon feeds\\" you the plot/story to you the whole time. How could you not know how it will end after seeing the fly \\"come alive\\"? Two people I watched it with had seen it in the theatre. They claimed after watching the \\"short film\\" made for the DVD that half of the sceens in the short film were actually in the theatrical version. I can't speak to that, but can say it wouldn't have made me like this movie anymore than I already did.

It didn't scary me at all (okay, the scene with Noah, Samara, and the TV was a LITTLE bit creepy). Actually, I thought it was more comedy than horror, such as the scene my friends and I have dubbed \\"The Suicidal Demon Horse Scene!\\" (I cracked up when I saw that, not that there's anything funny horses die).And another thing! People in horror movie's are SO STUPID. It really ticks me off. I was near the end of the movie, and Rachel (was that her name?) was trapped in the well, and she finds (spoilers) and I'm like \\"WHY THE HECK DID YOU WATCH THAT STUPID TAPE IN THE FIRST PLACE!?\\"There were really two things I liked.

The deadly secrets of the video tape that \\"kills you when you watch it\\" is already leading you with a trail of breadcrumbs to follow. The past of this nightmere video created by a little girl, is full of the unexpected. You see it in your head, the images follow you, and after seven days you die. Watts plays a facinating heroine who goes deep into the creepy past of anna and samara morgan. Going to old houses, creepy cabins, and mental wards. Surprisnly they don't explain all of the creepy mysteries, which makes your mind play frequent \\"the movies over\\" guessing games.

That the main character went through all this stuff trying to help out a girl ghost who is actually evil?!?

You would think by now that Hollywood could figure out that lots of outrageous gore and naked women is not the way to make a movie that actually scares people. This movie is rated PG-13, and after seeing it I had to sleep with the lights on for a week. This move is filled with atmosphere and tension that keeps building up as the mystery of the ring is revealed. Naomi Watts is excellent as the main character, a reporter named Rachel Keller. I hope Watts continues to do more work like this, and not more garbage like Mulholland Drive. This is probably the best horror movie to have come out in literally years, with the possible exception of some of M. Night Shyamalan's. Let's keep our fingers crossed that the sequel, due out in November 04, at least comes close to living up to the original. Five stars for this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about??","review":"Ok, I have no clue what eveyone else is talking aobut?? I just finished watching this movie and i can say that it was one of the worst films i have seen for a while. It seemed to me that the whole movie was a build up to the end and thats it. It wasnt scary, gory nor surprising, actually it was quite a let down. For all of those people who read the previous reviews saying how great this film was..... DONT BELIEVE IT! The whole movie is a build up to the end, which is cool, but not worth watching 2 hours of film for 5 mins of neat special effects. :( NOT A GOOD MOVIE.

It did have a good mystery going until at the end of the movie when they explained the reason why everyone diedafter viewing the video tape.

It is about a reporter (Naomi Watts) whos neice dies after watching a video tape that kills you 7 days after you watch it. This movie is a psychological thriller that will keep you up thinking about it. You will have to watch The Ring multiple times to catch everything this mystery has to offer. I am 13 and love scary things and i had heard that this movie was the scariest thing ever. But when i watched it i found that it was definately creepy but more of a mystery movie than a horror. I think that this movie has an amazing plot that will keep you entwined all the way. The only thing i disliked about The Ring on DVD was that it included NO special features or deleted scenes. I see why Dreamworks Entertainment did this though: they want you to be scared...you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARF!","review":"Worst waste of time I have EVER spent.

Two of these tracks have been remixed. One remix is ok, but the other one is not so hot. If you want some old King George you'd be wiser to spend a few extra dollars on Life Of A Kingpin, or even one of his compilations, which have a variety of tight artists on them, from Deco-D to Mississippi Mafia.

He is also very easy to read and has a way of cutting through and dispelling all the bologna that has been conditioned into us by clearly exposing the flaws and falsity of our conditioned beliefs which clouds the Realness of our Essential Nature - a Realness that can be directly recognized once we start trusting in our Intuition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not acknowledged","review":"Osho had a beautifully simple way of expressing what he wanted to say. Even though we do use our intuition we are loathe to acknowledge how significant a role it plays in our lives. We live in a world where the left brain is regarded as god, yet it can only spurt forth facts. Our right brain, our limbic brain and our prefrontal lobe have far more to offer that is of value if only we give them the space to be heard. Osho weaves lovely funny stories in amongst his book that helps illustrate what he is wanting us to understand.

I've spoken on the topic in great depth to many audiences. I believe everyone has this gift, but some of us experience it to a higher degree than others through the inner-visions we receive, the little voice that guides us from within or through gut feelings. Osho gives some of the best undertanding of intuition and practical ways to tap intuition that I\\"ve ever read. I believe his book helps many people better understand intuiition. I don't agree with his views (expressed briefly) on how repressions of human sexuality negtively impacts intuition - but I had never really thought about it until reading his work - so the verdict is still out on that topic for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work as expected","review":"He did a wonderful job with this book.

Problem is that he can't seem to take his own advice - the book is basically him rambling on and on and on - pure mental spew. He is definitely talking the talk... as for walking the walk this guy is doing nothing of the sort, he's way too egotistical to be believable as anything but a salesman who cannot shut up about himself.I bought 3 books by this guy in 1 shot thinking to save money on shipping. Wasted money on 3 books written by someone with a head the size of Mars.What a waste of time and money! You want guidance on meditation or intuition, look elsewhere please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I do not recommend this book to anyone. Osho's views on reality are absurd. Some of the things he says sound like they come out of skeptic magazine.

They provide quick overviews of what might be needed to start/run a business based on their artificial criteria for the field they're surveying.It has some useful information, but nothing that isn't easily found a hundred other places online.

This book is like a cheesy late night infomercial on building wealth; it's so useless!There is no mention of any necessary skills or education for the business. For example, one of the ideas is a financial brokerage. There is no mention of necessary education, and I think that most people would need some sort of financial background and/or education before they started their own brokerage. Another example, baton twirling lessons (is there really a big demand for this?) would require that you know how to twirl a baton.Also, does anyone really need a book to tell them that they could sell junk on the street corner?

This volume considers facets of Odin's personality through prose and poetry, focusing on how He relates to women in particular, and to men as well. Heathen lore is taken into account and then carefully shaped along with fiction and semi-fiction; familiar stories are given new life with thoughful retelling, hinting that there may be more to this God than many give Him credit for. Well-written, inspirational, and definetly worth taking a closer look at.

Unfortunately, many people still believe that autistics are unreachable, locked in their own world. The case of the girl in this book is extremely rare. My best friend had heard of autism from this book. When I told her I had it, she refused to believe me because this picture of a helpless girl was what this book had given her.

There is also multiplayer, but I haven't had the chance to test it out. The menus are nicely done, and each of the racers have specific stats to them.

I couldn't get enough of the unveiling love and romance between them. Ms. Faye did an excellent job developing those two. Also, the story of Sabrina dealing with the physical and emotional abuse was very touching. Ms. Faye did a wonderful job giving her readers a look into what abused women are subjected to.

I was expecting short, basic routines but looking at the chapter selections, you can choose which pose you want to work on for correct form or just start from the beginning and do the whole thing.

I just got done with the yoga workout, and I love it. The best part is that they have several people at varying levels of experience demonstrate the poses, including one instructor who shows modified poses for those who are not as flexible (like me). I also like how the main instructor explains every pose in detail, and the fact that they start out by teaching proper breathing techniques. I have only seen a part of the meditation video, but from what I did see it looks like a good lesson too.

Ralph's father is a scientist trying to solve flooding due to the green house effect, and Ralph receives info from Dar Tellum that might help. Unfortunately, as sci-fi stories go, this one's somewhat flawed, which detracts from the educational value that it could have had as a children's book. Also, the narrative style, with little dialog, probably isn't appealing to most young readers. It also seems to tell youngsters not to confide in their own parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Friedman Masterpiece","review":"I have yet to buy a book by Norman Friedman that I didn't love.

I saw this exhibition while I was in London this summer and I was pleasantly surprised at liking the book because I always assumed that publications wouldn't be able to measure up to seeing the garments in person. Instead I found that the book gives me a chance to appreciate each beautiful garment at my leisure, and read the history about Queen Maud (which gives a context and feeling of \`realness' to the clothing).

Nor does Sundby just read the bible to only hear what she wants to. Reverend Sundby goes through ALL the motions of studying scripture accurately and with the willingness to accept the truth it is speaking to her, including a possible \\"anti-gay relationship\\" interpretation that Oliver believes is the only right interpretation.What makes this book refreshing is not only is it scholarly, but it is written in the context of her life story.

Any time that I can count over 3 great songs on a cd , I feel lucky. I count about 8 on this one. Track 1 is a good opener and things progress from there. My only complaint is that when I saw them live, their drum sound was as good as Celestial Entrance and I don't believe it is quite as good on this album. The drumming is great but sometimes the punch of the sound on the prior album isn't there. Great drumming though! The drumming really propels this band and makes such a difference. Another great band to check out is Brainstorm. These are 2 of the best out there now.

You can literally feel the inspiration drop out of the music. The creative guitar rifts and heart-lifting melodies of the first five tracks are nowhere to be found in the rest of the album. Celestial Entrance was strong and inspired throughout, but you won't find that in Enigmatic: Calling. I think Pagan's Mind has lost some of their focus. If you want to choose one album from this band, go with Celestial Entrance. It is absolutely phenomenal."},{"rating":"2","title":"tipette","review":"This food is highly recommended!!

I shied away from Pimsleur for years because I scoff at the (usually unfounded) claims that this or that method will have you speaking a language in no time. Finally, with limited time and a desire to learn Russian via a full-audio method, I tried Pimsleur. I am now starting comprehensive Russian II and give Pimsleur courses to committed language learners as gifts. Its secret -- a good method underpinned with the best of 50+ years of applied linguistic research, classroom experience and common sense. For many languages, the best materials were developed during World War II and never significantly improved afterward. I wish Pimsleur existed in levels I thru III in ALL languages!

Georgian is a very anchient and very rich culture, but very different from Russian, too.I can understand the logic of the cover designer. The picture looks folklorish and rather primitive, people are drinking alcohol -- it is certainly as Russian as it gets, right? Well, you'll be better off if you learn the language and come to the country to see for yourselves.Don't get me wrong, I have the warmest feelings towards all the folks who learn Russian, my native language.

It takes a little getting used to but the editing capability is terrific. The only problem is that when you learn enough to edit downloads and live performances you want more editing capacity than Pyro 2003 provides. The basic program allows volume leveling, cropping, fading in and out, overlapping tracks, and splitting tracks and that's it. In order to do more editing one should look at Sound Forge XP Studio, unless your a professional and need Sound Forge Professional or Pro Tools.For everyday home editing I'm very happy with Cakewalk 2003.

Although it does all that is advertised, the software is so god-awful slow in saving any file - even without changing file format - that I have reverted to multiple software packages. And no, I can't blame my hardware, 1.5 gz P4.Pryo does offer a nice way to clean up audio noise. It lets you listen to just the noise being removed isolated from all other sound. This really helps when the control labels and graphs are meaningless.

The built-in infrared light will light up to 50 yards or so. The lens are clear enough, although of a mid-range quality and the focus is a bit picky to obtain. But for the price I paid ( $200some ) it's a value-for-money device. Do not expect to spot a bad guy in a dark alley at 200 yards, it won't work. Don't use this for security if you need better performance it is not designed nor priced for it.

As a member of the osage tribe I can assure the reader that this dialogue would have never occured. The author's use of stereotypical language in describing comments attributed to the Osage leaders and in describing the lifestyles of the Osages is offensive, e.g. Baconrind bellowed, the feast raged, osage squaws.

Also, Gordon has the artist confront her struggle with money (and its attendant power). As a poor artist, being \\"scotch\\" is a puritan-like ethic, yet the heroine quickly adjusts to vast wealth, feeling she alone can appreciate it without corruption.

Students respond to its frank discussion of female sexuality, copious references to art, fast pace and breezy, lyrical writing style.

The fact that the artist is a smart, funny, critical, feminist woman made all the difference. I learned so much simply from \\"listening in\\" on her self-analysis. And Gordon's descriptions of works of art were luxerious, more sensual than the sex scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like cool nectar on a warm day","review":"Certainly, the back cover draws you in with the suggestion of sex and money and perhaps a little moral corruption.

This is my second time over here in Iraq, and I can't believe that Hollywood still portrays soldiers in such a horrible manner. What's up with calling everyone \\"Soldier\\" anyway... and also, what's up with calling every officer \\"Sir\\" and also the callousness that officers have towards the troops. NOT REAL. Also, in Iraq, you would never see females in the type of unit/ squad that is portrayed in this series either. Also, where's the uparmored vehicles that we really do drive around in anyway.This show is in very poor taste to what goes on here in Iraq and at home with our spouses. I think the producer did much injustice to the portrayal of soldiers. Once again, Hollywoods way of trying to make a buck at the cost of portraying soldiers very badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iraq Vet - \\"Over There\\" stinks","review":"I first saw this show within days of returning to the states after a tour of duty in Iraq. Me and other guys in my unit couldn't believe what garbage this is. Army life in Iraq is NOT like what was portrayed in this show. Real soldiers don't act like that. The equipment was wrong, the tactics were wrong. Worst of all, the dialogue was all wrong. I'm glad that FX canceled the show.It is clear that the script writers of \\"Over There\\" didn't do their homework. \\"Over There\\" is not the real deal. I suggest checking out the book \\"Jarhead\\" (Anthony Swofford) or seeing the recently relesed movie of the same name. Although it covers Desert Shield/Desert Storm from a Marine's perspective, it accurately portrays the behavior and emotions of enlisted soldiers even in todays conflict in Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Realistic","review":"It is sad to know that the show is cancelled. It was one of my favorite shows to watch and I anticipated the next episode every time. Some people who wrote reviews totally went way over the line. I am in the Army and everything that happened in that show happens in the military today. The cheating, alcohol, loss of limbs. Yes we are fighting for our country but we are also human beings with problems like everyone else not in the service. That show gave a true account of what goes on for us on and off the field and how the stress can and will wear us down. As a soldier who has been to Iraq, over there was better than any other show or movie that has attempted to accurately depict a war scene filled with the emotion of the soldiers. The military is different now that it was in the Vietnam war and every other war before and after that. This is a new era where we are fighting a new war but we are still fighting for the freedom of this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crushed","review":"I love this show. I cried a few times, laughed some, and actually learned a lot about our soldiers. A lot of what happened in the show really is at least partially like what happens \\"over there.\\" I cried sorta when I found out it will not come back. It was the one thing that makes my college nights on Mondays worth while. That actors were phenominal! I am a theatre minor in college so as a harsh critic, this show has every element to keep people coming back. Its only mistake was covering a war that is still going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Hurt Locker","review":"Sorry if you've heard this before. I didn't have the patience to read all 115 reviews. This was an excellent series that kept you captivated first to last. With the acclaim \\"The Hurt Locker\\" has received, I was looking forward to its being the same nerve and gut wrenching portrayal of a war that few of us understand. With the exception of Hurt Locker's main character, you don't have anywhere near the detail of the other characters, as you do in \\"Over There\\". Don't let this series languish on your \\"should have seen\\" list. You will not forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVER*THERE","review":"One of the finest TV series I have ever seen, and I am very selective.

I want MORE!!!","review":"I can't believe \\"Over There\\" only had 1 season. I LOVE watching this series, especially because Eric Palladino's Chracter Sgt. Scream is very much like someone who is very special to me. \\"Orphans\\" is one of my favorite episodes because of him! My friends who've come back from Iraq say this show is very real & accurate of how Iraq is. The stories for both the soliders and the families are priceless. You learn that you are not the only one going thru your situation. You learn how bad it could be and how great it can be too. \\"Over There\\" really helps to put in perspective what goes thru their minds, and understand what they're going through \\"Over there\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Although I currently do not serve in any country's Armed Forces, I am a veteran of the aries of Denmark and France and I served in Iraq right after the First Gulf War, so I am familiar with the scenery and tactical challenges the men and woman portrayed in the show are facing.I like the switch between the front and the home front, which is equally hard on the families and the soldiers and I hope that, by watching this show, some of the hard core civilians will see examples of the hardship faced by Your soldiers (and by transference - the soldiers of the coalition) and the familes at home.Great show"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over There - Moving!","review":"Over There is one of the few made for TV series that is so poignant, you feel like you are actually there...you feel you are getting the real story of what our troops are going through \\"over there.\\" It is not for the light of heart, or the young.

It also makes me appreciate our troops fighting abroad! A must see..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defeatist Propaganda","review":"The series is well filmed but BE WARNED, this is defeatist propaganda. Every soldier is either a racist, gets cheated by his wife, loses a limb, enlisted to avoid jail or kills a 8 year old (That's right) or hates the press. By wacthing these series you are saying that our troops fighting in Iraq are criminals, and you are only giving their enemies more reasons to fight. They are volunteers and are there because YOU don't want to. Show a little bit more respect for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The creators of this show should be ashamed.","review":"I really did not like \\"Over There.\\" I rented this film with one purpose in mind: I wanted to have an accurate portrayal (or the semblance of a portrayal) of what life is like in the deserts of Baghdad. I wanted to know what the troops were going through. Instead, this television show is distinctively anti-war and and anti-American. The soldiers are portrayed as punks, low-lives, idiots, prostitutes, lesbians, unintelligent dopes, victims, killers, torturers--and more. This is not justice to the soldiers in Iraq. Instead of seeing characters with integrity and patriotism with the likes of Jack Bauer from 24, we are provided with characters who are shallow, depraved, and who spout out insults for no apparent reason. Any person who has spoken to someone in the military knows that the soldiers are intelligent, well-spoken, and thoughtful people. The creators of this show should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave Effort","review":"I accidently ran into this show while doing the usual end-of-day channel surf. It was absolutely thrilling and engaging. I have no idea how realistic the show was, as I have never been in the service or Iraq. However, the characters seemed real and struck me as kids that you'd see working at the local fast food joint or gas station, but wearing fatiques and carrying weapons. And that seems to be to be the difference between war and real life -- the uniform and the tools (in this case automatic weapons) empower everyday individuals with extraordinary powers.Also, Erik Palladino was fantastic. I hated his character in ER, but here he showed his acting chops. I loved this show and sad to hear FX cancelled it, but 'hello' make it easier for your audience to find your shows by playing them at the same time, same day every week."},{"rating":"2","title":"tv that means something","review":"Guess the masses stayed away from this series thiniking it would be some ultra liberal anti-war show or NeoCon Pro War Fox propaganda. Too bad - because it was a good show that had the old \\"soilders on patrol\\" method of telling their story. A story that should be viewed by as many people as possible to get a valid discussion going. Guess TV has to be \\"reality\\" name calling or over the top \\"soap-opera\\" to hold a large auidenceThe show is bleak- maybe too bleak but it does grab your attention. Even the stories at home are handled well- esp. the one with a soilder who loses a limb. The one that fails a bit is about a lady soilder who goes AWOL - think it was put in cause some Fox exec. wanted a pretty girl to show more skin. But do not let that stop you, buy the show and than talk about it. Don't forget \\"Band of Brothers\\" - another important show made for TV about war and what it does to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Done well, I was there.","review":"Over There was one of those shows that told the story well. Sure, one squad wouldn't have got into every issue they did, but who wants to get to know a different squad every episode? For the person who like the shoot-em-up war movie, this is not for you. For the person who wants to see the most accurate fiction show I've seen yet (on the Iraq war), this might be for you.I enjoyed it and I was in this war. I don't think it tells all, but it does a nice job."},{"rating":"1","title":"z-z-z-z-z-z-z","review":"This show is just ok. The theme song is really lame and really annoying. Mrs. B is hot and fun to watch (a female driver on the show). But it just gets kind of predictable quickly. We get all of the expected scenarios here... an amputee who wants to return to the army, a woman cheating on her husband while he is risking his life in Iraq, ied's going off every so often... but it's like they spent so much time trying to give a realistic portrayal of the war that they forgot that in order to keep the audience into the show that they needed to deliver great stories and great writing. This might be worth renting but is not worth buying unless you are a veteran of the war or have family who is and they were not maimed or killed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been wonderful","review":"I was really ooking forward to a smart and insightful show about the war in Iraq.

We threw the first one out over a year ago because the temperature consistently read far too low, rarely getting above 97.2 for either my husband or myself. Recently we purchased another BD Rapid thermometer without realizing it was the same one we had tried before. We decided to go ahead and try it again, but this thermometer was the same, never showing a temperature above 97.4.

So I compared it to my old Walgreens digital thermometer and the old fashioned mercury BD. Then repeated twice.

The story, in its original form, has sharp teeth. The profundity of Janacek's opera lies in its contrast of mundane and morose humans with the super-*natural* animals, and at 90 minutes, it's succinct. Dunbar -- citing a need to bring the story in under an hour -- focuses pretty much on the cute animals. Worse, the denuded score is sung in a wan, timid style. Janacek's music, though far from Germanic, still demands passion of its singers. On the plus side, there are some nicely animated sequences, and the animation is above-par for today's market. Those who buy this DVD should consider introducing themselves to the *real* work via the MacKerras CD or (perhaps even better) the EMI/Rattle CD, which is in a superior english translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming diversion","review":"This is a delightful way to enjoy this wonderful music.

I've used this one in temperatures ranging from -10 degrees F to 90 plus degress in my camera, my computer, and my HP Photosmart printer. The capacity and reliability are great, but the impressive thing is the speed for the money. I've tried a couple of name brand standard SD cards in my Canon S3IS, and they're fine for still photos, but when you do high density video, they do not keep up. I have yet to have any problems with clipping or slow performance form this Kingston Elite, even at significant zoom/high frame rates. It's also reasonably priced.

Another in a camera I reserve for rough use when my DSLR might be in jeopardy from rain, snow, etc. They work great for long movies as well as hundreds of photos.I haven't had a single Kingston SD card fail me yet.

It gave a memory card error and my camera was unable to read or write into it. I plugged it into my computer and the computer failed to get any data out of it too. I bought a new SD card and my camera worked just fine. So I lost all the memories of our trip in just a second. I got an RMA from Kingston where they replace the broken card but you are responsible for shipping it to and from them. The total shipping cost would be approximately 10$.

They are able to play this on their own but needed several games with an adult to get the hang of it. While played somewhat like Clue, there is alot of dependence on the luck of the dice so it lacks the challenge to develop much strategy. However since they have to learn to keep track of their clues and places visited (by marking little clue sheets which run out fast), it does help increase their attention and deduction skills. Like other reviewers, we have problems with the pieces falling over all the time and they seem to be getting frayed with use.

If the kids don't get freaked out by the game concept of solving a murder (any parent allowing their 5 year olds to experience the age appropriate games delivered by Playstation 2 can get over this concept), the original CLUE works far times better. The confusion of the setup and play of CLUE JR will remind uninitiated parents of how user friendly the standard edition is. In turn, they will find the ease of playing and explaining said version is to the wee ones. A fine idea, to get a younger crowd to enjoy an old favorite board game, but poor execution make it a pointless venture when the original game was already perfect for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 kids love it","review":"I don't know why this has so many bad reviews.

Karel Reisz's direction and the costumes, cinematography, and score are first-rate, but the film rests on the formidable artistic shoulders of the incomparable, one-of-a-kind Vanessa Redgrave and she does not disappoint. Her accent is maddening at times, but her bravery and dedication to this role should be featured in acting classes for years to come. Along with \\"The Bostonians\\" and \\"Howards End\\", this performance ranks among her towering achievements and make the video worth buying over renting, as several viewings are needed.

The applicator is a soft tapered sponge-like brush that moves very easily. Since it's not an actual brush, you won't be splitting up the bristles putting it back in the tube. The color is a true black, and the formula is very smooth and opaque. It glides on easily and dries quickly.I like liquid eyeliners, always have.

Additionally, it would turn off and on exactly once every minute. I contacted DLO customer support and clearly worded the problem. I asked if this is the way it works or do I have a defective unit.

The escape techniques are excellent and there is no information which could offend even the person soft as baby poop. Personally I suggest a more direct approach, but in some situations this would be balanced. I find a frightening lack of realism about the school yard where kids today may be armed, or junkies or both. Kids must understand that even the LEO will avoid confrontation with an armed junkie until there are reinforcements.Overall, I would strongly recommend it where Dad can sit down with son and/or daughter while watching it and discuss family philosophy about violence viewed from the oppressed and as viewed by the oppressor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Words of Widsom","review":"Always loved Rob Bell and his sense of bringing Gods word into meaning.

With the camera in the bag you can close the zipper....almost. A struggle whenever you would want the camera since you will need to close the zipper if you want to avoid the possibility of it falling out (which might be ironic since it is pretty hard to extract).

All in all a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likely can't go wrong with this small Lowepro camera bag/pouch","review":"I had already bought one of these before for another camera at a well-known brick-and-mortar store so I expected it to be fine. The camera (a Panasonic 5X zoom compact digital camera)fit in the bag just fine, with just enough room in the small pockets to keep two extra (AA in this case) batteries and an extra SD card (if I wanted to). It is a tough and durable little case, well-made and fits its purpose just fine. It is recommended, especially at the price available online (if free or low cost shipping). Just check its inner dimensions carefully against those of your camera because having it not fit would really be the only downside in purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for My Lumix ZS3","review":"Since there seems to be some disagreement, I thought I had better rate this product.

Front pocket is handy because you can get to your camera without worrying about your extra battery and memory card falling out. QUALITY!! Front pocket has 2 separate compartments too QUALITY!!

It would appear to be perfect on first examination, nicely protective and a good, snug fit. However, I found that I needed both hands to CAREFULLY extract and replace the camera in the case and close the zipper. There is a large ridge on the inner seam along the zipper, which interferes with the movement of the zipper. Anyone who takes a lot of pictures and wants easy, spontaneous access to the camera, will be frustrated as was I. The case is nicely designed and very sturdy, however, so I suspect that a larger Rezo would be a better option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit for Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3","review":"I purchased this case to fit myPanasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 10MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3 inch LCD (Red)and I was definitely not disappointed. When the case first arrived it looked like the camera wouldn't fit, but instead it fits perfectly. The camera along with a few small accessories (i.e. extra battery, extra sd card) are a perfect fit and can be easily placed on your belt. Perhaps even nicer than this is that in addition to the velcro used to close the belt loop there is also a snap that makes the belt look extra secure. Nicer still is the fact that the case is easy to unzip and pull out the camera when hooked on the belt without having to worry about dropping everything out of it. Overall, if you have a ZS3 and are looking for a case don't hesitate and pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper mechanism is not smooth, it catches.","review":"I was enthused by many of the reviews, but disappointed that the zipper mechanism wasn't smooth enough; this proved impractical as fighting to get the camera out, esp. for a shot that you see, is something that didn't appeal to me. I have a slightly larger LowePro case for my other digital camera and the zipper mechanism is as smooth as butter and never catches (that is, you don't have to fight with it to get the case open). I wish that the zipper mechanism worked as good on the Rezo 30 model."},{"rating":"1","title":"camera bag","review":"This bag can only be opened by a zipper on the top. I was very disappointed, because I have an older Lowepro camera bag that opened by velcro and it was extremely easy to get the camera out. This one is useless to me. It's very hard to open the zipper and very hard to get the camera in and out. I gave it away to someone. I will not purchase a camera bag through Amazon again because it is important to see it. By the picture, you can't tell how hard it is to open. Also, the zipper will scratch the camera every time you take it out.

It is written with a lyrical style. It is not dry and boring, as are some biographies. It provides the reader a very compelling introduction to the life of this great teacher of the church. It brings the Reformation to life and helps you understand what the issues were that caused Luther to protest the practices of the church in his day. The book points the reader to the core issues, without getting sidetracked into all sort of theories and myths about the Reformation, or trying to resolve debates and arguments among scholars.This is clearly the book to begin with if you want to learn about Martin Luther and the Reformation.I like the way the book weaves photos from the new Luther movie throughout the text. It is beautifully printed, in clear and easy to read print on quality paper. PLUS it is a hardback. It is quite a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have been working at home and evaluating work-at-home resources for over six years.

I've spent lots of $$ on the latest word building tapes, CDs and books that taught long lists of words to memorize. The problem is that those words were forgotten only weeks after memorizing them. Recently while cramming for the GRE test, I discovered the \\"Discover It\\" method described in Danner and Noel's book. It uses a different approach which teaches word clusters instead of individual words, based on the learning the Latin roots of words. This approach saved an enormous amount of study time. The approach allowed me to be able to accurately determine the meaning of a word, even if I had never seen it before. This is a fantastic book. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to build his/her vocabulary, or take a entrance exam for which he wants to be well prepared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short of Learning Latin, Greek, etc.","review":"Dear Potential Reader:I have nothing but praise for Dr. Danner's _Discover It_. He has taken one of the best methods for self-help learning, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with accurate information about the origins of English words. The reader is led, step by step, into developing an ever larger and more enriched English vocabulary. I would say that anyone who works through the entire book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_.

Also, you have your typical cast passengers, the drug smugglers, illegal immigrants, dope heads, business people, etc... This movie was just out of control unbelieveable. One snake surpasses the size of the train, gimme a BREAK!!! The acting was kinda poor (altough I've seen worse), the sound was low but the action music was LOUD, that's annoying too. Also, the train looks like it was from the 1970's, so dumpy and unreal looking. I heard snakes on a plane was bad too. I guess I shouldn't have expected more out of this.

Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost.

After mounting and bore sighting, worked to get it sighted in. Groups started off good but then started widening with shots erratically printing all over. Had two other shooters check to make sure I wasn't the problem. After 50 rounds many of the shots wouldn't land on the target at 35 yds. Re-mounted to a 22 Long bolt action with the exact same results (this rifle usually puts 5 shots in a inch or less of the bench at 50 yds.)

She has a temper that sometimes gets her into trouble, a penchant for not playing by the rules, and a sometimes crude vocabulary. In this novel, she does pretty much stick to doing things by the book, doesn't curse, and don't jump in bed with anyone, but I get the feeling she might do any of those things in the other books.While the characters were all interesting, I didn't particularly like any of them. I didn't mind spending a lot of time in Kinsey's head, but she also wasn't the type of character that I wished was a real person I could be best buddies with.

The movie is rather chaotic, which may fit with the life being portrayed, but does not make for a very good movie. The lead character, played by Asia herself, flits around from one strange incident to another - partially out of loneliness, partially out of looking for love and companionship, and partially trying to find her niche in life. It's a sad story filled with drugs and wrong choices - or at least what appear to the viewer as wrong choices. Unfortunately, disconnected from any explanation of the significance of the movie, it leaves one feeling like they wasted a few hours of time watching something rather pointless.The interview on the DVD of Asia Argento sheds some real light on the meaning behind the movie and had I watched that first I might have interacted with the story differently.

At least that's what record executives at Flying Fish were thinking in the late seventies, early eighties when these two albums were first released. Unfortunately, GLITTER GRASS is only marginally listenable (3 stars), but PERMANENT WAVE is a real stinker (1 star). Both of these albums are the low points for all artists involved. Even repackaged as a two-fer, you're better off spending your money on anything else by Hartford or The Dillards. This one is for completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can you not love this compilation??","review":"I've read the other reviews of this album on here... and man!

This is the fun stuff that John Hartford was doing in the 70s... which in my opinion is his best work. Upbeat songs for the most part, very tongue-in-cheek and just plain fun. I do agree that Glitter Grass is the superior album but there are some gems to be found on Permanent Wave too. You really just can't beat the packaging of 2 albums on 1 cd like this. I love that I'm seeing this more and more lately!

I do not know much about what the Dillards might have done before, but this album was a tough listen. Hartford barely has any songs and of the ones he does have, they fall into three categories: ok but not great, appear somewhere else in a better format, or are covers. If you like country rock, then I'm sure this will be fine, but Hartford fans beware; it's the Dillards' Show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry reticle","review":"I bought the Bushnell Tropy 1x28 from Amazon but had to return it.

I matched it up with see through camo rings from a local bass pro shop and presto. I had a completely camouflaged gun that looks remarkable.This scope along with any banner 3-9x40mm is a perfect scope for a .22.

This wasn't his best work. As a matter of fact, I think it was his worst. Major? He hit it out of the park with the Amir and Kenya storyline. EXCELLENT!!! Harris? His story was fair. Colin?

I was really dissapointed in Eric Jerome Dickey's part of the story because it seemed to not have a real plot or theme. E. Lynn Harris was cool bt he seemed to move a bit slower than usual.The worst story ever written in the United States would have to be the one by Colin Channer. GOODNESS!! I tried so many times to read his last irrelevant story but i couldn't because i fell asleep due to BOREDOM. My favorite story was by Marcus Major. This was in fact a REAL story. It shows just how much bull a black woman will take from a man that she loves.

Lynn Harris and Eric Jerome Dickey are interesting and indicative of the authors' places at the top of the best-selling lists, Marcus Major's \\"Kenya and Amir\\" is, by far the best of the lot.Beginning at the breakup of a relationship, the story then flashbacks to the beginnings of the love affair and the ultimate rift that tears apart the bond between the title characters. Major has an understanding of men and women that is evident in his writing and has crafted a tale that appeals to both sexes.With believable situations/characters and sharp dialogue, he, most definitely, keeps it real.By the way, I just couldn't finish Colin Channer's sleep-inducing \\"I'm Still Waiting\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Authors Low Rate Stories","review":"These are four of the best authors that I have read but these stories were not their best.

Written by four of the leading African Ameican novelists of the past few years, it offers many intriguing perspectives on love and romance in the modern world.Especially as a fan of Eric Jerome Dickey and E. Lynn Harris (and thereby more familar with their work), I was curious as to how they would make the transition from novel form to the novella, or short story form. In both cases, they were able to pull off the character and story development very well.As for the other two contributors to this anthology (Colin Channer and Marcus Major), they have found a new fan! In particular, Mr. Major's novella left me wanting more.Here's to a job well done. In the future, I hope that many other best selling authors follows suit and treats their readers to such a sampling of their work."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Men, 4 Real Stories of Love","review":"Cafe Piel-EJD, Too short but a very nice and touching story. Nothing can explain the twisted story, you have to read it for yourself. The story of Bobby & Alejandria will have you begging for more. Amir & Kenya-MM, If you had the opportunity to read \\"Good Peoples\\" you will find out how it all started for Amir & Kenya. Myles also makes a short appearance. From reading this you get the idea that MM knows these people very well. If you haven't read \\"Good Peoples\\" BUY IT. Money Can't Buy Love-ELH, Honest is all I can really say. This often painful and touching story will have you in tears. It is a bit graphic but my eyes never left the page. I'm Still Waiting-CC, Sweet, sexy and very descriptive.

I was not impressed with any of the stories. The first one left me stumped! I am still trying to understand what the author was trying to get across to his audience. What was the theme? As to the second story, I am waiting for the ending. How long will this man sit in the stairwell - I know it is fiction, but can we have a dose of reality here. The third story is typical E.Lynn Harris, one of my favorite authors. However, he lost some of his fervor in writing this story. It did not have the substance found in his other novels. The last story is simply the worst. It was tedious and painful to read. Too detailed, nothing left to the immagination, too many quotes from Bob Marley's songs, too much of everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colin Channer brings The Realness!","review":"For real people, Colin Channer's story made the entire reading process a joy!

I've enjoyed reading all four stories, but had to choose my personal favorite of the four than it would have to be the story intitled: I'm Still Waiting by Colin Channer. This is the story about a biracial singing star, a music producer and his ex-wife of 20 years set in at first in New York then takes us to Jamaica. Each character has their own inner struggle for happiness and love. Colin has this unique way of story telling that cannot be matched. His style is metaphoric, lyrically poetic, erotic and sensual. He's very honest about what goes through a man's mind when he's in love.

I read everything he writes and this was added to the list. The Eric Jerome Dickey story was good but not what I expected from him I also read everything he wrote and this was good but it just surprised me. The Marcus Major story about Kenya and Amir was written so well. After I read Good Peoples I was wondering how the love story of those two went,and I loved it. Marcus Major has become one of my favorite authours and I look forward to his upcoming work. The Colin Channer story was the first I read from him and it was ok. To me the story was too drawn out, I just could'nt get into it as fast as the others but it was an ok read.

The band has got two frontmen and their voices go well together. Also the guest appearences from Team Nowhere groups make for great change.The song T.N., Team Nowhere, is one of the greatest track ever made by any French Metal band.Once Pleymo got away from the underground scene, they've been introduced to the entire french ni-metal community and gained lots of popularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"?Qu�� ch��vere!","review":"I didn't even realize this CD existed. I've loved Aterciopelados for years, and I always favored the nasty-punky-unpredictable EL DORADO over their more professional recent output. This is like a dream come true: the EL DORADO lineup sounding confident and creative, lava-surfing through an incredible range of styles. To hear the classic Aterciopelados thrash-snarl on 'La gomela' and 'Quieto veneno' is pure bliss. The morbid Mexicana of 'La cuchilla' has a menace and humor that is absent from the band's recent work. With the exception of her lukewarm rendition of 'Mujer gala,' Andrea's performances here are absolutely astounding. All the voices in her complex personality are heard here: the rabid rocker, surreal siren, vocal acrobat, eloquent poetess, and on the amazing 'Sortilegio' you get to hear them all. Any Aterciopelados fan should listen to this if they (like me) found GOZO PODEROSO tame and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still waitting for the cd ...................","review":"I haven't rececived the cd yet.

The last few chapters were useless and out of scope of this book. Why someone needs to read this book for difinition of HTML,XML, RDBMS and EJB etc ?

Using this leash is completely contrary to the whole idea of having a light weight riding situation and walking/running your dog alongside your bicycle. I am mystified that the manufacturers would use such a heavy metal when making this leash. Of course I know the answer. It is much CHEAPER to make the leash out of CHEAP heavy metal than to use a more EXPENSIVE light weight metal. I cannot recommend this leash to anyone. It must be re-manufactured to a much lighter weight. I view this as a wasted purchase.

Why should it bother you that he dressed up as a woman in the video for Learn To Fly, so much for promoting your album, you use a chance to get people to hear about how \\"good\\" this new album is, and you waste it on dissing one of the greatest rock stars of all time.

It has a song about killing people with Stanley power tools, and a bunch of answering machine messages from people he hasn't even met (I mean, they make a point of saying that they haven't met him).Ice's new \\"hardcore\\" career reminds me of the Monkees when they reunited in 1996, all hot & bothered about writing all the songs and playing the instruments themselves... and then Mike Nesmith comes running home from the European tour crying 'cause the press made fun of them anyway.

I did, and got a twisted perception compared to what I think of her now. This book is very raunchy and deep, and you MUST be acquainted with her writing style before reading this book. It is, though, a splendid, dark book. Weetzie Bat should be the first book that anyone reads of Block's, for it is simple and delightful. Block exhibits her versatality in this book and has a knack for describing reality, as lurid as it is.The book embodies the struggles of Laurel, who lives in Laurel Canyon with her mother. It is a bitingly emotional piece, yet, it also provokes pangs of relaxtion and understanding of what is and what is not. Laurel learns a lot about love, which is basically the thematic message. The descriptions are lush, accurate and inspiring. A good read for long-time fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingly thought-provoking and magical-realism-beautiful!","review":"great angst novel. language like ripe fruit on a hot, starrynight. all the bewitching romance and soul-searching i was craving. tarot archetypal symbols braided like jewels through the story of a troubled girl. francesca lia blockis like no other writer around. she shows us that there is magic everywhere and her characters are godesses struggling through their humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"i loved this book! i borrowed it from the school library more than a year ago and ever since i'd returned it, i can't find it and i really want to read it again! block's style is so poetic and detailed, i haven't really read her other books, because i'm not really into the short stories about girls with weird names she's written, but the hanged man is great. i love laurel's some-what tragic story, it's interesting to read about such normal seeming people and find out that their lives are more screwed up than my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better..","review":"This is a dark, interesting book, that I just finished an hour ago. I am Block fan, and Echo being my first block book, followed by I was a teenage fairy, I didnt find this book as well written. It cuts off major details and I finished it in about an hour. The book ends too fast, and they leave you guessing about her boyfriend Jack, and her other friend (cant remember name)...I think it should have been atleaset 30 pages longer. I found myself thinking that this girl is crazy for not eating. Its more \\"Dark\\" then Block's other books, but it was overall good.I reccomend this book to Block fans, and fans of dark books. I was going to stop in the middle of this book b/c it got quite boring, but i finished it for the sake of finishing it! I am glad i finished it. And being a 13 year old, I know what I like.

As a big fan of fantasy, mysticism, fairy tales, and strange teenage girls I thought for sure I'd love this book. I had read, \\"I Was a Teenage Fairy\\" and really should have learned my lesson from it.Block's writing is contrived, and boring. I felt very unconnected to the characters in this book, and thought it was excessively dull. These types of books are for suicidal teenagers who feel nothing but \\"angst.\\" It reads like really terrible teenage poetry. And, while I am well aware this book is directed to high school aged kids, I do not recommend it. It seems as though Block tried desperately hard to pour on the angst, I can just smell how dreadfully manufactured this book is.The other thing, this book was quite short. Which is probably a good thing. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenage Angst","review":"I think I'm too old to read anything Francesca Lia Block writes. Having said that, I'm sure I'm too old.Block's writing appeals to the most base sense of suffering, and therefore I can see why it appeals to teenagers. Since my taste in literature has expanded beyond a diet of angst, feeling misunderstood, and that there is nobility in suffering, it was a chore to make it through this book. Teenagers will love it for the mere fact that it's somehow validates their own overblown sense of angst.I'm sure there is a message within the pages of this book, a triump of the human spirit, but I was left with the impression that the main character would rather continue to suffer valiantly than take the high road.I also worry when reviews contain the words \\"magical\\" and \\"poetic.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hanged Man:Imegination","review":"The trauma of a seventeen-year old girl's childhood forces her to use her imagination to the fullest. By creating false events with real people, Laurel is able to hide from the truth about her late father in a world all her own using tarot cards to show her the way. The Hanged Man by Francesca Lia Block shows the outcome of an abused child when the abuse stops. The use of fact and fiction, dream and reality keeps you on your feet for the whole book.As a fourteen-year-old student I thought this book was a way for me to better understand myself because I too put myself in my own world to hide from stressful events in my life. I recommend this book to all people who feel that they are alone and have no one in their lives, especially people who have been abused in their lives.

Looking through the lens the crosshairs simply scattered. Weird. I liked the scope I paid $79.99 retail, and it appeared to be top quality. It held up well. I guess too many rounds went through it.

I heard Bill O' Reilly dismiss Chomsky as a \\"revisionist,\\" and it is sadly interesting that most critics of this and similar works simply stick a \\"communist\\", \\"liberal\\", or \\"revisionist\\" label on the author without ever addressing the points made within the work.

It is homage to James Jones, to William Faulkner, perhaps a little to John Steinbeck, but mostly to a California now almost vanished. That California is mostly the settlers' California, but it is also a California felt and known aboriginally. She writes, as always, poignantly about things dying away: but the heirs live on and the Californian sun and hills, rivers and floods, carry on- the part of eternity we can know a little of. I liked this book very much, but the reader should be warned it is not a light read and not written as completely in Joan Didion's famously sharp style as her later works."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Parable","review":"I'll keep this brief. This is one of the best novels about California since The Grapes of Wrath. A story of farmers, soldiers, husbands, wives, sex, deceit and land. Didion has a strong grasp on the American idiom of postwar America. It exposes and demystifies the dark side of \\"The Greatest Generation\\" while at the same time being fairly nonjudgemental. These are human beings, with just as many feelings as anyone else. Didion makes the characters realistic struggle to be good truly engaging and extremely heartfelt. With each passing chapter the reader feels a pang of torment knowing the characters tragic fall from grace will be unavoidable. Despite its quite depressing qualities (and there are a great deal of them, expertly explored by Didion) it is an enthralling read. If you like socially aware fiction, this is for you.Easily one of the strongest and expertly crafted American novels of the 20th century and maybe the best novel about California next to Grapes of Wrath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Efforts an Excuse?","review":"As a longtime Didion fan I was mildly disappointed with this text. It's cumbersome, swishy, and sloppy. It hints at phrases, and the sort of language she eventually uses later in her writing, but this early novel is exactly that...early. It shows promise, and is not entirely without wit, but it's weak and cumbersome plot, it's overwrought prose, and it's harlequin voice were a disappointment given her profound later works."},{"rating":"1","title":"A play on words can lead to errors!","review":"A PLAY ON WORDS!I bought the lights thinking I was going to mount them flush to my boat trailer frame.

I love Zach Braff on Scrubs and figured the movie would be good as well. In all honesty, I'm not sure why I didn't walk out of the theater. Being in a new relationship, I felt very dis-enchanted by this film and its depiction that relationships are full of flaws and lies. While no one is perfect, I want to believe in love and believe that people can be faithful for a lifetime. This movie made me feel very skeptical and distrusting. Don't spend your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"Possibly the most flavorless youth-oriented film ever made. If this movie was intended for a daytime soap audience I'd recuse myself from judging it, but I can only assume it's intended for a younger hipper audience and it completely fails to engage on that basis. The only scenes that have any flavor are those featuring Braff and Bilson, which basically consist of Braff re-enacting his \\"ideal quirky girl charms dorky guy\\" routine from Garden State, only the dialogue seems even more teenage and neither Braff's character nor the film seems worthy of Bilson's charisma.The other three quarters of the movie sets about defining the supporting characters by their contextless emotional outbursts or sheer banality, which may be a relevent backdrop for Braff's cliched \\"isn't there more to life\\" soul-searching, but the lack of any distinct personality or perspective in the dialogue makes this movie intolerably dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Awful American Remake","review":"Thanks to a superb cast and good director, the 2001 Italian romantic comedy \\"The Last Kiss\\", about a quartet of 29-year-old male friends struggling with the responsibilities of grown-up relationships, managed to strike a balance between comedy and drama and between the flaws and virtues of all characters. The American remake fails to strike that balance and the characters are so poorly developed (or badly redone) that all the people come across as dumb jerks. Zach Braff, good in \\"Scrubs,\\" shows he has limited range as an actor and Tony Goldwyn has even more limited abilities as director. Do yourself a favor: see the Italian original. This remake sucks out all the charm of that movie, ruins all the characters and plotlines and tops it off with a new ridiculous ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ways To Kill A Relationship","review":"If you're looking for a romantic movie, do not watch this! It should be called \\"How To Ruin A Relationship\\" instead of The Last Kiss. This film is about a bunch of seriously stunted young men who have the emotional maturity of a three year old toddler. The women in the film have their feet firmly planted on the ground (except the slutty home wrecker but she can be forgiven because she is 10 years younger and obviously stupid and therefore has a reason to be immature). These wonderful, long suffering women have their hands full with these jerks and you start to hate these women because they must be just as dumb to want to even be in relationships with such stupid men.This was meant to be a clever coming of age, comedic movie however there were no real lessons learnt, there were no real funny moments and I wanted to shut it off after 20 minutes but kept thinking something interesting must happen- it didn't! Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Kiss","review":"Billed as smart, witty, sexy...

Some say it demonizes men; some say it makes all women look like shrews. Some say that if you don't 'get it' you're just too young, while others say you're just too old. I think the main problem with this movie is that people watch movies to be entertained. If I wanted to experience 'real life' I would read a newspaper or watch the news. (Don't even get me started on reality tv). People can take this movie and twist it into whatever they want it to mean for them, but in the end it's just a depressing story with badly developed characters. Watch it if you want to feel bad about life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Will It All End?","review":"While this flic is generally entertaining, it fizzles when the misandric undertones become clear. Then it becomes a tired and irritating film, full of clich��s. From this perspective, here's the bottom line: Every male character is flawed. Every female character is strong and principled. The male character is unfaithful because (we assume) he is of weak moral character. When the mother character admits to having an affair, somehow it's her husband's fault. Sounds like the silly stuff drilled into our heads since the 80s. Boring. Pass on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Masterpiece","review":"Before I watched this movie, I expected it to be a bit more lighthearted. The truth is it's not. But it is deeply powerful. I was thinking at the movie's start how similar Michael was to Largeman in Garden State, but as the movie progressed, I realized just how different they really were.This film shows a more mature side of Zach Braff's acting. Not only is he funny, but he can also play a serious role.I thought this movie was an excellent portrayal of the complexity of human relationships. Like Blythe Danner said, most things in life are hardly ever black and white, and the same goes for relationships. You want to hate Michael for what he did, for what seemed like no apparent reason, but the truth is, his thought process was not as simple as realizing there are other fish in the sea.I recommend everyone giving this movie a watch, even if it's only just once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Honest and True to Life","review":"Lets get this straight, \\"The Last Kiss\\" is not a romantic comedy- actually its far from it. Like \\"The Break-Up\\" this film is about real modern day relationships. Its about a bunch of very flawed people screwing up their lives and trying to figure everything out. This film is not for everyone because it does hit home on a lot of todays's issuces facing couples. Things get depressing in \\"The Last Kiss\\" and rightfully so, because whats love without the downfall.A very good film that is getting a bad wrap from viewers who didnt know any better before viewing. If you you like films that make you think about life no matter how dark is may get, this film is for you.Also check out the wonderful soundtrack that is a great companion piece to the film. Some of the songs are great and actually answer some questions you have about the ending. Nice touch.This isnt a 5 star movie, im only giving it 5 to boost the rating. My grade is a 7.5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and witty romp about the complexity of relationships","review":"Love American style gets another take in this film. By now you probably know the plot line, but really everyone in this film is in one sort of messed up relationship, which is life as we know it. No relationships are perfect, and we all screw things up sometimes, but love finds a way of trimphing in the end, well most of the time. If you have seen \\"About Last Night\\" and host of other romantic comedies, there is no surprises in this film, but still very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing train wreck","review":"I feel that you don't have to glorify the acts of people behaving like selfish children. But that's just what this movie does. Could the characters in the movie be any more unlikeable? Is this movie meant to be a warning against doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons, or a indulgence in justifying them? I couldn't have been more depressed after forcing myself to watch this train wreck of a movie. It is the polar opposite of Garden State, which is truly sad, as Garden State is truly sublime. I have to say that I still really think Zach is a great actor, but man, think before choosing your next project please! I had to get rid of the dog of a dvd as soon as I could, I just feel guilty for the unsuspecting person that buys mine from the used rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie is terrible. Its not the idea that's so bad, but the actors are horrible. They are so overwrought with emotion, its almost painful to watch. I'm not even sure why I'm finishing the movie. That OC girl does a great job of playing the immature college student, though. I find it hard to buy her character, I don't know any girls who behave like that, but hey, I've been out of college for a few years, maybe things have changed. Spare yourself, this is 103 minutes of my life I'll never get back! Thank goodness I only rented it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"I couldn't even finish watching this childish film, which depicts all women as whiny, hysterical fiends and the guys as perennial perverts that can't control their libidos. It's beyond stereotypical and lacks any inspiration. I agree with ROSS who was flustered about the violence against the guys. It is very hypocritical when women do this. With all the education about birth control, I find it so irritating that men & women who don't want or are too immature to have kids don't use birth control. There was not one character I really liked or related to in this film, which is why I couldn't finish it. Unless you like irritating, depressing films, I'd pass this stinker. I only gave it one star because I didn't have a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Kiss","review":"I am a huge Zach Braff fan, but this movie is definitely a little too serious. The storyline was kind of weak, and it was filled with pornographic images; so be warned if you watch it with friends and get embarrassed a bit. The story is about a guy who's girlfriend is pregnant and his friends' relationships all turn to crap so he takes their advice and doesn't want to feel trapped and meets Kim, a college student. He ends up going to a party with her behind his girlfriends' back, telling her that he's with a friend, Chris. His friend's dad, Izzy's, dies and his girlfriend sees Chris at his house, wondering where Michael (Braff) went. Then all hell breaks loose. Pretty depressing, not a pick-me-up movie. There's a little anticipation at the end, but the last scene kind of sucks. Totally a gamble on whether you'll like it or not. Just overall depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do film makers make films like this?","review":"If you feel that you are WAY TOO HAPPY and feel the need to bring yourself down a notch, this is the movie for you. If you are like most people and want to be entertained, pick up something else.In this movie, every character is morally corrupt in one way or another, and you pray for the end of the film. I really don't understand the point of seeing a film that makes you feel worse than when you start watching it. One of the worst aspects of this, is the girlfriend of Zach Braff is a little over the top, and you fear she will miscarriage through the whole film. Zach Braff starts out mildly likable, but not enough that you root for his character. The only reason to root for him is to get the movie to end. Don't worry that is not a spoiler. But how can you spoil something that is already rotten!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie for those treading on 30","review":"This film adequately portrays what people in their late 20's/early 30's go through.

It is more mature and definitely more melancholy. Braff's acting was better than I expected and the story kept me interested until the end. As one other reviewer notes, you find yourself thinking \\"don't do it!\\" at Braffs character, but it's what adds to the dynamics in the film and adds the poignancy at the end. This is a good film, which is genuinely moving in places and has Braffs usual excellent choice of music.

She finally lets him back into the house and the movie abruptly ends. Add a bunch of cliched dialogue (and the guy's loser friends) and that is the movie.

While Garden State was extremely well-done, brilliantly acted emotionally raw, moving, etc., this movie just tanked.While it started off with an interesting and relatable premise: a group of friends in their late 20s - early 30s grappling with growing-up and facing responsibility versus trying to hang on to their youth (ie- having a baby vs. running off in an RV to central america), the characters weren't developed well and the acting was weak. You didn't connect with any of the characters, except perhaps Jacinda Barrett's character (she was the only one with a believable performance). It was impossible to see various connections between characters (ie- what would Rachel Bilson's character want with Zach Braff's character???) and without giving away too much information, the ending was HORRIBLE!Overall, it was extremely disappointing and I would recommend skipping it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Comedy","review":"Sadly, I think perhaps this movie would have been better received had it not been billed as a romantic comedy.

No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible dissappointment","review":"I was looking for a movie to get me thinking like Garden State did. This movie is terrible. I barely could make it through the entire 100 some odd minutes. It had shallow writing focused on people giving up on relationships and fighting endlessly. This gives all relationships a bad name. It is definitely worth skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked, that's all.","review":"Well, previous reviewer Ross takes himself a bit too seriously, but I agree with most of his points.This movie was horrible in its portrayal of men..I will never be able to look at Zach Braff the same way again. His character in this movie was unforgivable, loathsome, repulsive, and I can't believe he read the script and took the role. The other guys, same thing, mostly. The attraction on the part of young college girl for Braff's empty jerk--I don't get at all. Jacinda's parents' issues were underdeveloped, to say the least, as were most characters in this. Jacinda had the best role, and did what she could with it, but geez, it was just such a lousy movie. It depressed me. I mean, if you need to prove it to yourself, go ahead and waste the money to rent it, which thankfully was all I put into it. But for the love of humanity, don't buy it.

The book was to long, although it was only two hundred and something pages and went into detail about every little event, from the street store location to what was written on a banner.

Its very difficult to follow at times, and the author places these \\"exercises\\" within each chapter in attempt to enhance the understanding of the material. In actuality, its cumbersome and often times not relevant to the material previously presented. I could write a full review of how bad this text is, but as with the other recommendations, I would stay away from this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"This is the worst text book I have ever had.Pros:Towards the end it begins to make a little bit of sense, as long as you read it completely out of order.Cons:Poorly edited.The examples are sketchy and not organized well.The exercises are mind numbing, mostly because there is no reference point for most of them.I'm sure there are more cons, but I took the class a semester ago and cannot remember what they were. However, in the middle of the semester the instructor actually had us stop using it and found online references for everything for the rest of the course because he realized how disorganized, confusing and downright bad it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for information","review":"The one thing the book does well... It starts at the most basic level of introduction to research and goes up through statistical forumlas.The problem is the information is sloppily put together. The author knows little or nothing about logic, and this, misuses it in ways that will damage the students ability to function in reasearch if they have no previous experience. There are also lots of nice charts, that you have to fill in yourself, making this feel like a paint-by-numbers rather than a textbook.The author also lumps interval and ration data sets together. While when using formulas they are interchangable the one sentence inclusion of the two together does not give justice to the very different applications of interval and ratio data. Once again, if you take a stats class after this, you will suffer from the learning.Highly NOT Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The people said the book was in good condition...there is highlighter throughout the book along with writing inside.

Or perhaps, they are exceptional in some interesting way that fits in with the \\"superman\\" or Nietzsche?Nope. They are stories about beings who have been altered past normal humanity. This could be interesting, although it would have been nice to have had a clearer description indicating that this is the theme of the stories. However, the stories themselves are not real winners.It's not a bad book, but it is far from the Dozois' best work as an anthologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best sci-fi I've read","review":"I used this book primarily as an introduction to science fiction, and found it quite discouraging.

If beginning in Sci-Fi, I recommend you look elsewhere, and return to this once you have mastered the genre. For experts of sci-fi, this might be better.Word_Ninja"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very untruthful material","review":"The purpose of this book is for Mr. LaPierre to make as much money as he can from ignorant Americans who tend to believe him. The amount of untruthful material in here is just plain amazing! If the reader takes just three minutes to Google the UN conference on small arms and light weapons, he/she would find that no UN body has ever contemplated regulating legal sale and posession of small weapons in any of its member states. However, their main goal is eradicating illicit (i.e. illegal) trafficking. If Mr. LaPierre so vigourously opposes UN in this effort, it clearly means that his organisation supports smuggling and illegal sale of guns.This book is most likely going to be preaching to the choir. Other than really uneducated and disinterested readers, nobody else is going to buy the misinformation it is trying to present as fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read even if you're anti-gun!","review":"I just got the book so I'm not finished reading it yet but I find it very scary. The text is so thorough and extensive (it is well footnoted) that it can be tedious to read but make the effort, no matter what you personally think about civilian ownership of any sort of firearms.The details of UN actions and methods can make even a gun hater wonder if we still need to be in the UN. Continuous patterns of abuse and non-action ( much of that even reported in the mainstream media), policies set up by member states that have no love for any American make this a very scary book.The United Nations used to be a great thing, it's still a great idea, but the mess we've got now no one who loves freedom needs it.

Nevertheless, this unit found about 7 HDTV channels for all the major networks and a few others without any problems. (sadly, not our educational channel on 8) Yes, it is slow to start the decode to send to the TV, and the search for channels is slow, but once set up, I've been very pleased with the performance.

Tv could see box but samsung couldn't see antenna signal. Tried many times but it just kept saying no signal. Put coax to TV - works fine. Put coax to unit - no signal. You need a signal to even get it to tune to a channel so there was no way to manually look at a specific channel to see what might be of issue. It showed that it added channels that don't exist locally but they weren't in the channel menu afterwards. I took it back. Like everything Samsung I've ever had, quality is questionable in my opinion. $350 is a lot of money to spend on something that is dead out of the box. I am highly disappointed because most of the retailers here carry that unit or nothing for over the air broadcast - that or you subscribe to direct-tv which at $600 per year is too steep for my bank account.

The rest of the time, the film is being poorly narrorated by its writer/director. It seems as though the questions he wrote were intended more to capture his personal musings on film than to hear the answers of the Dalai Lama. I didn't even find the questions that enlightening. In the end, it seems to be more about the film director than about the Dalai Lama, which is a shame because the latter is such a fascinating human being and the latter, at least by comparison, not so much. It gets two stars for when the Dalai Lama actually does get a chance to speak and for some of the beautiful scenery it depicts. Also has a little information on the history of Tibet, but less than you'd find in five minutes on Wikipedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good.","review":"I'm a little surprised there are so many naysayers.

It offers insights into both the authors thoughts, and those of the Dali-lama.I showed the film to a couple friends, which is rare for me to do.

Fans of Pilcher's \\"Coming Home\\" will recognize some similarities, probably because Bacon was trying to write something similar.

The central idea, an ancient talisman with the power to make wishes come true, but shrinks with every desire that becomes true is fascinating and deeply philosophical and \\"human\\". I think Balzac should have elaborated more on this idea, exploring the dimensions of human desire and discovering more complex and deep characters for his novel.

Streaming media wirelessly from my PC is great..saves tons of time and money burning CDs and DVDs. Does mpg's great and most avi's. Xvids can be a pain(out of sync audio), but you can use a program called mpeg4modifier to unpack the bitstream and then they work fine too. Only 2 things bug me about this player: 1) The remote is the worst! Have to press buttons repeatedly for it to work, even when pointed directly at the player. I fixed this by buying a Kameleon(sp?) remote from Radio Shack. 2) Their support stinks. I filed an online support request for the remote, sent many follow up emails, and they simply don't respond. Overall though, very happy with the player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceedingly Thorough and Strong","review":"Though not as current as some other texts dealing with corporate communication, Argenti's book is still the best. It combines both theory and practice, never letting one dominate the other; instead, it combines them, letting their merged strengths shine. It's similar to Guerrilla PR: Wired by Michael Levine, which also utilizes the practice of public relations to great effect in examining how to attain the objective.Argenti uses several brilliant case histories in his examination of corporate communication. This text is both informative and useful. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's involved in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Drive Nowhere","review":"When I read a book, I like to know more about the plot at the end than I did when first reading the jacket cover. I knew a whole bunch of people were going to meet at a hotel to \\"discover just how small the world really is.\\" With a sappy cliche like that on the cover, I should have been forewarned. I believed in the book's potential. The weaving of story lines to get everyone to the hotel was skilled and interesting, even if every major adult character but one had an affair. However, once everyone arrived at the hotel and met, the book ended. Six people in a parking lot with four guns, and no resolution. Three ringing phones, and not one answered. This book couldn't take a sequel, but it sure deserved another chapter. All the skilled story weaving in the world can't make up for a poor premature ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yayyy","review":"This is a great anime! Once you start it you wont want to stop.

The climax is of course the battle between Naraku vs. Sesshomaru and Inuyasha, after Inuyasha gains access to the Red Tetsuiga.

But this little gem of R.E.M. throw-offs was one of the few contemporary albums I listened to at the time (repeatedly)-- and it hasn't lost any of its punch or sense of fun that it had then.

As such it provides an interesting alternative view of the band. Several of the tracks reveal a goofy sense of humor that doesn't show itself on their \\"proper\\" albums. Two examples are \\"Voice of Harold,\\" which features the backing track from \\"7 Chinese Brothers\\" as singer Michael Stipe reads a studio promotional flyer, and a cover of the Roger Miller country staple \\"King of the Road.\\" The band acknowledges its considerable debt to the Velvet Underground by covering no less than three songs (\\"There She Goes Again,\\" \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Femme Fatle\\") that are among the best performances here. Aerosmith's \\"Toys in the Attic\\" even gets a workout. The CD includes the contents of the band's 1981 EP \\"Chronic Town\\" as a (very considerable) bonus.Overall, rarities albums don't get much better than \\"Dead Letter Office.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I needed to hear lately","review":"Voice of Harold: it's real, they mean it.I remember lines like that, it much more comes creeping over me when I listen to my old stuff.

Several regional and/or chronological sections contain information based on research now considered outdated. In fact, not just 'now' but even back in the early nineties when this revised edition was published. It is a pity that because of that many regional developments remain untouched: Where is central Mexico in this book? How about the Valley of Oaxaca (is 15 pages for Classic Oaxaca sufficient on any standard)?

The threads that hold the aluminum sleeve over the gold-plated plug itself aren't milled into the sleeve - they're a separate piece that's glued in. I've had a bunch of these fail, so the threads separate from the sleeve and there's no way to fix this.

I agree that the worst song on this album could still be described as very good. Have a preview listen to Pretty Persuasion,Second Guessing and Rockville and if you like these, buy the album you will not be disappointed. I do not consider their subsequent more commercially successful albums as sell-outs as I believe REM shifted the mainstream to them not the other way around.If you fancy this album do yourself a favour and search out sadly defunct Aussie band of the 80's The Go-Betweens and although not replete with as much jangly guitar,their indie pop/rock gems such as Bye Bye Pride, Streets of Your Town and Cattle and Cane are worthy of your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic REM Masterpiece!","review":"One of the best of the IRS releases.

Not sure if it's the age of the authors or the place where they live, but literature students from la sorbonne did make fun of \\"web site\\" and \\"courriel.\\" Don't even want to get into the ways they built some sentences.Bottom line:Don't understand why this book has so many positive reviews. It is exactly like other French grammar books out there - often confusing and full of mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best priced verb book on the market","review":"The \\"Ultimate Verb Review\\" is a must have for the price. It is a wonderful and comprehensive review of everything you ever wanted to know about French verbs (and then some!). It's a wonderful review, and it covers useful expressions like avoir de la chance, faire la cuisine, etc. It also includes small sections about other topics than just verbs. It talks a little bit about how to use direct and indirect objects, about au or en before country names, and several other topics as well. I would also recommend another book by the same authors, which is the \\"Ultimate Grammar Review\\" which covers all aspects of French grammar. This comprehensive book, however, does not cover verbs as well as this book, the \\"Ultimate Verb Review,\\" does. This book is more comprehensive than the text book I am using in FRE 201, and should be able to answer all of your French verb questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"I found this one volume book on the Civil War to be excellent reading and thought provoking. It is concise and easy to read, but filled with interesting detail about the people who made the era what it was. The only failing is the lack of detailed maps showing the battlefields and the troop movements which are so important to understanding the outcome of the various battles.The author quotes extensively from letters and other writings of the era to help the reader climb into the minds of those who were doing the fighting and the making the decisions. He is not afraid of looking into controversy. The loyality of Gen. McCelland is carefully called into question for example, but in a balanced fashion.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Civil War. It does not have the detail one finds in multi volume works on the war, but it is well done and filled with enough detail to hold the reader's interest from first to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Problems with Norton Systemworks 2007 Premier Edition","review":"I bought Systemworks to upgrade my system. I tried to install it 4 times and follow their instructions. It told me to delete all of my old Norton systemworks, for which I did. Every time it comes up with a product error and tells me to try again. I then sent an email to Norton and never received a reply from them except their automatic reply back to me telling me they have received my email. My computer is worse off now then it was before I tried Norton Systemworks 2007. Norton help system just puts you in a loop and never helps solve the problems.

Freedom. When you accept Christ as your Savior you are given a freedom no one else can have, yet so many of us reject this and wallow in our selves. This freedom comes from Christ's greatest command - to LOVE Him with all of our hearts, souls, and minds AND our neighbors as ourselves. To do this one needs to be willing to have their minds transformed into Christ's way of thinking. Why bother being a Christian if I am not willing to do this? The best part of this book is that she gives practical advice and stories of her experiences. An example is what she allowed herself to read and the effect it had on her. Then how she changed this and how difficult it was! Then how God blessed her because she did this. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"deep thoughts","review":"Interesting book.

Unfortunately, we've been conditioned against the truth in favor of PC attitudes and blind partisanship. As long as they keep us divided and fighting amongst ourselves they're free to do anything they want. Ultimately the electorate is disdained and ignored.

We all felt that he should have included this in his album \\"Spin\\". Catchy lyrics and fun to dance to! And finally, the acoustic version of \\"Insatiable\\" almost brought me to tears. His voice is so compelling and I admire the influence of Kate Bush's \\"This Woman's Work\\" sung towards the beginning and end.I received this CD through an Aussie mate and I was excited to hear that he released \\"Crush\\" in Australia.

My pocket tool of choice used to be a Victorinox Tinker, but this gem replaced it as my portable tool of choice. It is smaller than the Victorinox, so it easily fits the watch pocket of my jeans (the Victorinox required a belt holster). The only drawbacks are the smaller knife size and lack of toothpick, but the addition of the pliers, file and wire strippers more than compensates. The tweezers are superior (nice angled edge, good for removing splinters) and the placement of the phillips head screwdriver, parallel to the handle (rather than perpindicular as on the Tinker), renders it far easier to use. I lost mine on the beach the other day and will order a replacement immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I have read hundreds of books and many were not worth the time or money, but this book is so bad that I had to write this review to warn others.

If, on the other hand, you're like me and searching for books that will help you along the spiritual path, save your money. I was drawn to this book on Amazon based on several \\"5 star\\" reviews claiming the book was of great benefit. Most of the book chronicles the author's life as a Peace Corps volunteer. The only practical part of the book is a short chapter that is supposed to teach the technique of \\"psychonavigation\\". The gist of the chapter is \\"Learn how to meditate\\". If you already practice meditation, this book is of no help to you. If you want to learn how to meditate, this book is not for you either.

Next night we had a heavy thunderstorm come through and the unit quit working. No power on any screen for either battery (alkaline) or AC. Amazon replacement was hassle free. 2nd unit has been running for about two weeks now and made it through a few storms. Since I work on chips that drive these types of devices I am concerned about the surge protection built into these units by 1st alert. I have had both units on surge suppressors so an overvoltage should not have occurred. Will have to wait and see if the new one will have a similar issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"We purchased this radio after sleeping through the tornado sirens during a severe storm. The radio is easy to set up and has a very loud alarm. We were promptly notified of incoming storms the rest of the summer. The radio is easily programmed. You can edit both your location and which alarms you want. This customization is critical to prevent unwanted alarms and the subsequent ignoring of alarms. So far, the alarm has gone off 100% of the time a warning was issued for our county, yet it has not produced any unwanted or out of the area alerts. The battery back-up is a nice feature to keep the radio operational during power outages. I would highly suggest anyone who lives in areas that experience sudden, severe storms and tornadoes purchase one of these radios!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Problem","review":"Great unit except....placed new alkaline batteries in it with switch set to alkaline.

Second, an earlier reviewer noted that the radio drains alkaline batteries, and I have confirmed this. On 23 April all 4 new batteries were at 1.6v. On 25 April, 2 of the 4 were at 1.6v and the other 2 (located on the right side of the compartment) were at 1.46v. Lastly, I might switch to rechargeables, but either way, I will KEEP this radio and recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable, easy to program","review":"I've had this unit through about a dozen watches/warnings now, including tornado and thunderstorm warnings, and it's performed flawlessly. The instruction manual is well-written and I found it easy to program, unlike some cheaper models of weather radios. One thing I like about it is that even after a warning or watch has been issued and the radio broadcast has sounded, the LED lights keep you alerted to whether the alert is still in force. In addition, my previous weather radio had difficulty getting reception even by the window - but this one I have in the interior of the home, mounted on the wall, and it has perfect reception, so the tuner appears to be high quality. The alarm is loud and distinct and enough to wake me up. I programmed this unit for all three of the counties that border my town. If you live in tornado country, you need something like this, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend this. Very satisfied.","review":"The radio was just as described and the directions for operating it were easy to understand. I haven't had an alert yet, but so far I am very satisfied with it. I set it to our local weather station and get an up to date weather report at the touch of a button. I have it set up so that the radio turns on when there is a weather alert in my area. You can also set it to sound an alarm if you prefer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on the money","review":"After a tornado touched down 30 miles from where I reside, I decided to purchase a weather alert radio. After weighing all my options and reading many reviews I purchased the First Alert WX-150. Setup was easy. A couple of days ago we had several thunderstorm warnings and 1 hour before they hit the watch light and alarm came on. Then 5 minutes before the storm hit the warning light and siren came on again. It's timing was perfect. My only complaint is the display is a little small for my taste but I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet!","review":"We could never understand the verbal warnings on our old NOAA radio but this one comes in clear as a bell. It does take some serious attention to program it and to understand what each light means but I sleep peacefully at night knowing this radio will alert me to bad weather. I have one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom.....lovely that it can be programmed for only the counties that affect me too!This radio can be programmed for everything from hurricanes to winter storms, floods, avalanche, etc. VERY complete! AND, the warning \\"siren\\" doesn't freak the dog out like the old one did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Radio","review":"My law office is in downtown Louisville, Kentucky and we sometimes get tornados and severe storms in the area. I wanted a reliable weather alert radio that cost under $40 and bought this one. I am very pleased with it and especially like the fact it can run off batteries or AC power (with the AC adapter). The reception is crystal clear and of course it also keeps time etc. Very pleased with the purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine - but then it died","review":"I bought this and set it up to warn me in the event of storms, flash flooding, tornados, etc. It worked really well for about a year. After that, it stopped. When it's plugged in, it gets no power. I can use it on batteries - but only for a short while (~8 hours) before it eats up on the power. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Alert","review":"Works like a champ. The alarm goes off - with ample volume - and lets you know what's happening. The directions on how to set it up are pretty straight forward, once you kind of understand the whole concept of the NOAA alarms. You can set-up for several counties in the local area and then 4 different alarms you want to be notified. Some alarms are automatically set - as for hurricane, tornado, etc. They work great, and I'm getting another one for camping and a third for my place of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after about 2 years","review":"I purchased this radio in July 2009. A little after 2 years, it now fails to receive the alerts. It lights up, it can received broadcasts after you push the button, but it won't automatically sound the alarm in reaction to a weather alert. I contacted the company and they quickly responded to try to help, but it doesn't work. I've reprogrammed it twice, moved it around the house, even took it to work to try to pick up the maintenance alert that goes out every Wednesday, but nothing works. I'm disappointed and won't purchase this manufacturer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, instructions could be better","review":"I really like this radio because it does what you want it to do and you can avoid the warnings you don't want to hear for a reasonable price. It would be nice if they included the codes for your local area in the manual. I had to find them on the internet and then figure out I needed to add a number (8 or 0 I believe) to the beginning of the code. It would also be nice if the offered the radio in different colors (black or silver). The white clashes with my bedroom, so I leave the radio hidden unless their is bad weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe Place","review":"This product is so good that I have purchased one for each of my three children, and they live in tornado prone areas and use this prouct faithfully. The First Alert is easy to program, the alarm volume can be regulated and is not frightening in the middle of the night, and can be set for only the warnings you need, like only tornado. If you have ever experienced a tornado first hand, then you will quickly recognize the value of this sweet, dependable litte item. I personally think this is the best warning device made. I hope First Alert keeps making them, and Amazon keeps selling them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Works great. Easy to program. I like the ability to get tornado alerts only.

The cover/title should perhaps be different, in order to reflect that fact. We needed a video version of the Last Supper for a children's activity, and this was a waste of money for that purpose. That said, the video is good, just falsely marketed and erroneously titled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A substandard O'Reilly offering","review":"This book has its conceptual merits and demerits. But let's give the authors the benefit of the doubt, and let's assume that this is a decent introduction to its subject matter. I'd still advise against purchasing it, as in detail it's extremely unreliable and often confused.Since I started counting, I've found an error every 4 to 5 pages. Some are cosmetic, but some seriously damage the value of the examples and descriptions. The text contradicts itself at several points; some examples don't produce the results the text says they will; some figures are glaringly broken.This book is the victim of an obviously poor editing job, for which I blame O'Reilly more than the authors. Either way, you should probably look elsewhere unless you already know enough to silently correct all the errors you'll find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly poor index","review":"I'm new to PHP and MySQL, but a programmer for over 3 decades.

When I (a) see something I want to understand better or (b) want to find the PHP analog for basic functions, I naturally turn to the index to try to find the information I need. However, I found the index very disappointing because of what it doesn't have.

You have to figure it out for yourself.2. This book is not a step by step book for beginners, you will get lost.3. The name and the reviews fooled me.

However, it has some major drawbacks: This religious organization changes the meaning of Biblical text to fit their own theology. The 'scholars' who are responsible for this contextual nightmare are not listed anywhere in the 'Bible', nor are they recognized and identified by the publisher, the Watchtower Society. This replaced the King James (The KJV was officially used up until the late 1950's). The King James led to too many questions (from the faithful) about the lack of context in Watchtower teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on Stories and Acronyms, Short on Substance","review":"I give this book two stars because it may have a few stories I can use somewhere along the way, and because it has catchy acronyms.

There are only 3 guns: 2 machine gun like things, a big cannon (which only has like 3 rounds of ammo each new level), and a stupid pistol with 7 rounds, and no extra clip to reload. The graphics are cartoony as well as the violence. There is blood, but not enough. This game was rushed to the market. It could have been alot better. Personally, i dont like this game. It has no story line, bad graphics, and only 3 weapons. This is a good game for people who like to play mindless shooters.

In it, the \\"modern Adam\\" is a composite of thief, dog & prisoner.

The book is broken up into 3 \\"diaries\\" for each man, & they all revolve around their relationship to one woman. Each portion is an interesting blend of \\"stream of consciousness\\" and psycological drama. The book becomes more & more compelling as you read on.

I also love the spiritual song Voice Of Harold with its gripping melody, churning guitars and whistling towards the end.Other tracks of note are the instrumental White Tornado with its powerful guitars, the speedy and energetic Toys In The Attic, Wolves Lower with its nervous rhythm, Gardening At Night with its lovely winding melody and All The Right Friends.Their sound appears a bit thin in places in this early phase of their career but it's rather charming to listen to the beginnings of this amazing band that later give us masterpieces like Document, Out Of Time and Automatic For The People."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This book is right up there with the best; Steele, Roberts, Collins.

Filmed by over 25 cameras, it is far over done, and the flashing images and split screens achieve the opposite of their goal, by driving my attention away from the performance, and making me dizzy enough to want to stop watching.

I bought about 4 concert DVD's before this and realized I was missing a DMB concert from my collection. I bought this assuming it would be as good as the other 4 I had previously bought. Its not. The 5.1 Channel is a joke.. The back two channels echo the front channel exactly only 1/8 the volume. Even the front right and front left channels are spotty. Usually they are assigned specific instruments according to the way the stage is set up, etc.. This does not. It simply all comes from the front channel with less and less on the outside channels.

I have no desire to watch this dvd again...unless my eyes are closed.... 5 stars for the music...no stars for the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music Bad Visual","review":"I agree with the first reviewer. I think the video editor tried to approach the editing with a music video type of style. The camera kept changing rather abruptly from one band member to another then to the audience. I don't mind the camera changes, but to do it constantly within short periods of time is quite distracting for a live performance. Also, the visual effects (the 'tri-window-thingy' and the 'audio/visual sync' in the climax of jamming session) really turned me off. Jump near the end of Two Steps and you'll see what I mean.In a live performance, I would like to see the performer's facial and body expression especially during the jam sessions. Unfortunately this DVD doesn't really allow you to do that. It Should've been approached with 'Listener Supported' style.Aside from that, the music is excellent. DMB is in its finest when performing live, so this DVD is still a must for DMB fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if your a DMB fan, don't buy it!","review":"The video editing makes the DVD unwatchable.

When I first started reading it, I at once knew that it was completely eclectic. Very different from any other written work. I'd love to review the story, but the plotline literally spirals into totally different ideas every chapter (more frequently than that, actually...). Skywriting is completely lovely, witty, hilarious, and charmingly sarcastic. Puns galore. After you are finished reading it, you'll be completely cheered up, guaranteed!

They range from laughter-enducing to beautiful, and the \\"apple pie bed\\" one is by far the cutest drawing that I have ever seen of Mr. Lennon's...!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a multi-faceted delight","review":"A scintillating collection of prose which proves Mr. Lennon's very unique and fascinating ability to play with words and the way we read them.

The combination of biographies of designers (some very ordinary people like factory workers) and ideas made this book a best-seller. It's been out of print for a while, but it still is a standard reference.Author Ericson illustrates her book with clear photographs. There is a biography of an elderly and elegant woman who has always worn--white and only white. Even at her husband's funeral. Ideas abound (some with patterns to sew from)--folkwear inspired, Asian-inspired, and funky stuff using office supplies or found objects. I wish I could show you the photos--they are amazing.If you sew, there are schematics here you can enlarge and use for sewing patterns. If you quilt clothing, there are plenty of unusual ideas.

I had already done two Pete Huttlinger Dvd's on Jim Croce and thought they were terrific. I must say,though, that I was very disappointed. I enjoy Livingston Taylor's music and enthusiasm, but I felt he really fell down on the nuts and bolts of playing his songs. He skips around songs and does not go into detail on how to play them. Some parts he seems to skip all together. It is alot of 'zen' teaching-feeling the music. This is improtant, but first give me the basics. You have to use the tab (which has many mistakes) and just watch him play to figure out alot of the songs. The last song he does not even teach at all, just plays it. This was done back originally in the 90's and maybe they have just learned how to do these better since then, but there is no comparison to the level of teaching you get on the Huttlinger Dvd's. I wish Pete would teach Livingston's songs (along with his brother's). I would be able to learn them much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work on my 3 speed Hampton Bay","review":"I bought this to replace a switch on a 3 speed Hampton Bay ceiling fan. This 4-wire switch looked identical to the original one that failed. I recorded all the wire locations (even checked the wiring on another identical working fan). I also carefully studied wiring diagrams I found online for my fan controller. I made sure to match up the correct power, ground, and capacitor wires to the right holes....turned it on, the motor hummed, but no rotation. Assuming I did something wrong I started swapping wires around...same result, humming but no rotation or nothing at all.I ended up dumping the switch and permanently connecting the wires for lowest speed without a switch. I'm 99% sure that the switch was broken, the other 1% is me doing something wrong thus 2 stars instead of 1.

No big deal for the price (Caveat Emptor) My gripe was the screenprinting of the characters wore off on heavily used keys in a couple months...Keep in mind that theres a reason these are 10-15 bucks, and purchase accordingly. the only gripe i have is the poor quality of the screenprinting...

It simply doesn't illuminate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appalling!","review":"Conquest is a leading Sovietologist; he wrote the book's first edition in 1970. Thanks to glasnost, he was able to have acces to even more Soviet archives. His research focuses on th Stalinist purges of 1927-38. Party cadres, the Army, intellectuals, foreign communists, were all crushed under the implacable CRAZY, paranoid purges unleashed by Stalin, Beria and Kaganovich. The book talks also about the Kirov murder (orchestrated by Stalin, and used as a pretext to unleash persecution of his enemies). The amount of suffering is untold. In the epilogue, Conquest presents a rough estimate of the number of victims of the terror of \`37:About 7 million arrestsAbout 1 million executedAbout 2 million died in campsAbout 1 million died in prsionBy the end of 1938 8 million people were in camps. May Stalin rot in hell as the damned soul and cursed demon that he was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good intro to this topic","review":"The last review is utter nonsense: Conquest is one of the most respected of all Soviet historians. He clearly despises Stalin, but how could one look upon his unfathomable devastation otherwise? As someone who has studied Soviet history for years, I can tell you that Conquest's writings are right in line with nearly all books on the topic of Stalin, even those by Marxists like Medvedev (not to mention the great Solzhenitsyn himself).This is a good intro to the topic of Stalinist terror. To a novice reader, it will be a bit hard to keep all of the names straight, but it will also be a real eye-opener -- you'll see where Orwell mined many of his ideas. I'd strongly recommend that all readers of this gravitate to Kravchenko's I Chose Freedom (cliched title, I know, but a great autobiography)."},{"rating":"2","title":"HISTORY AS SURREALISM","review":"When I read the first edition of this book back during the Cold War, it was difficult to believe the quality of scholarship and research effort that Conquest demonstrated throughout this book, written while the KGB was still running amok. What most general histories dismissed with a few sentences or paragraphs as \\"millions died or were imprisoned\\", Conquest gave us the names, the chronology, and the results of Stalin's paranoid Reign of Terror. Now that the archives have become more accessible, Conquest is able to update his work and further illuminate this darkest period of Russian (and perhaps world) history. ANYTHING written by Conquest is worth reading if you want to understand the workings of 20th century Soviet politics and society."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lie","review":"Conquest book is not history or scholarship but rather a well written series of lies and distortions. If the book was not dated 1968 you would think it was published in Berlin about 1938. Conquest's sources are primarily Russian emigrees who had an ax to grind or German's who were pro-Nazi. How valid would a history of the American Revolution be if it was based on interviews of British tories in Montreal in 1783. I am sure they spoke highly of Washington and Jefferson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not practical","review":"This book contains very good instructions on how to execute the techniques presented, so from that standpoint, it achieves the goal of being able to pass on the knowledge. But the subject matter is questionable. In most cases, it just doesn't seem practical to get tangled up with someone (potentially in the guard or even the mount) if a) the terrain is rough b) weapons are involved and c) there are multiple opponents. Rolling around on the ground over broken glass, trying to get an armbar on a guy with a knife in his hand and his friends standing around delivering soccer kicks to your head doesn't seem very effective. And any self defense system in which 90% of the techniques can be defeated by sticking your thumb in the other person's eye seems lacking. The sport of BJJ is great fun to watch and play with, but as a complete, battlefield martial art, it is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution !","review":"I agree with the people who say this book might get you hurt. The techniques to me look too dangerous. There is one picture that shows a gun being pulled, and the next picture, the defender has the gun (voila !!). No picture intermediate to that explains HOW the defender got the bad guy's gun. I find this book actually kind of funny. If you really want effective self defense, sign up for krav maga in your area. Brazilian jujitsu is a SPORT martial art, not a street martial art. Do you want to take a rabbit rifle to a bear hunt ? Me either. Also, no real knife attacker will make it so easy that you can do the defenses in this book. He already has your \\"defenses\\" thought through, and how he will answer them. Real knife fighers do feints and don't let you see the knife, or they will draw you one way and slash back. This book answer none of those questions, as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brazilian Jiujitsu should be left in the ring","review":"Most of theses techniques will get you hurt..(how to remove a hand from your throat...do it like royce if you want the attacker to take your windpipe with him)..The gracie techniques should be left in the ring...if you want to learn to wrestle with rules study brazilian jiujitsu..if you want to survive go elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"I am a POLICE use of force instructor.

I teach survival against armed individuals (Gun, Knife & Clubs etc), and I have to say that this is the worst of the series of books. Many of the techniques would get you killed if not seriously injured. The people who have rated this book before me saying the same stuff are telling the truth. In fact, I sold my book on ebay saying that the book was very bad, and some Gracie fan still bought it for the cover price. Do not buy this book, Royce knows his stuff in the ring.

The two main characters, Therese and Leonie, first identified as cousins, later renamed another relation, live in the same house in France. This book depicts typical childhood in France. However, some scenes described are graphic and not recommended for younger readers. This book also describes children growing up in Catholicism. Roberts is very critical of Catholicism due to childhood experiences with the Church. This book kept my attention, however, her use of flashback and media res can be confusing. If you can handle the language, criticism of Catholicism, and the graphic scenes, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Karaoke","review":"It's like paying $15 to listen to karaoke in a bar full of drunks. The picking is good (just like karaoke) but the Avetts insist on opening their mouths and trying to sing (just like drunks at a karaoke bar).

They were by far the best and most memorable of the relatively unknown performers I saw at the festival. Their talent, virtuosity and sheer exuberance is hard to beat.Mignonette contains some great songs. Swept Away, A Gift for Melody Anne, and Salvation Song are standouts. Others are good, though they don't quite rise to the level of great. There is some weirdness with sound effects and background talking on the album--the guys must have gotten a bit giddy in the recording studio.Overall, I haven't felt so enamored of a group since I discovered the Jayhawks. Looking for good things to come from The Avett Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The starter CD . . .","review":"My friends and I refer to this album as the \\"starter CD\\".

I felt like a fly on the wall tagging along on an exciting adventure across four continents and over a dozen countries. Written in a breezy style, it's a fast and easy read that's sometimes shocking and always entertaining.

Came with a sealed box. The subtitles are flawless. Scenes were shots in romantic France---Paris and Nice. The actors were great, they have delivered convincing roles. Those you want to love you'd love, those you would love to hate, you'd hate :). I would have given this a five star if not for the ending that got me a bit confused at first, I have to replay it one more time to get the point. I think because I expected another ending, typical of any Korean drama/fairy tale. I do not want to spoil it for those who have not seen it, so I would just suggest you watch it. I have read reviews later on why the ending was such, I guess it makes sense after reading those plus the explanation from the screenwriter. It is a twisted ending, so those who will watch this, expect the unexpected.

Which means that to my American voice, some of the rhymes (laugh and scarf; blouse and \\"ribons and bows\\") just don't work, and it messes up the flow.If it weren't for that quibble, I wouldn't have a problem at all.

My RWS 52 model had this scope on it for a couple of years, and about 1000 pellets, before it destroyed the scope, by which I mean it literally shook the rear lens out of the scope. I have never really been happy with the scope so I am not too sad to see it go.
