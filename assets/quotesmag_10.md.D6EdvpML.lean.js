Also, the material seems sturdy enough. The mesh bag that it comes in is convenient for storage and for tossing it into a backpack. You can steer the child by pulling on the line, like reins.CONS: I was unclear from the packaging exactly how to attach the harness to the child. The front attachment also didn't seem secure -- it was too easy to slide the nylon line through the belt loops. It was awkward to use the harness, and in the end it was easier (and less scary for the child) to ski without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Solves Mystery","review":"This book provides intriguing insight in to the world of psychic detectives; clairvoyants and mediums called upon by law enforcement to help solve baffling crimes. Anyone interested in true crime and/or the paranormal will find this to be quite a fascinating read.Aside from the use of psychic abilities to solve crime, it also provides information on puzzling phenomenon such as spontaneous combustion and poltergeist cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"An irresponsible experiment! Spay? Neuter? Leashes?","review":"This book made me mad all the way through! Who on earth let's dogs run the busy streets of Eastern Mass? Who thinks it is funny to let their dogs run, show up on someone's porch who will look at their tags and call her to give them a ride home? She does nothing scientific, but apomorhpizes quite a bit. I feel sorry for those dogs in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"Despite all of the negative comments of other readers, I really enjoyed this book. It was a very interesting look at the natural behavior of dogs. It is actually one of my favorite dog books and I would recommend it to any one facinated by how dogs think, form relationships, etc. All of these other people need to relax. She obviously is an animal lover and takes care of her pets. So she let her dog cross a busy street unsupervised...get over it!After reading this, pick up a copy of her book \\"The Social Life of Dogs.\\" I loved them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this at all","review":"I have to agree with the readers who described this book as irresponsible. The author's opinions on her dogs' behavior are just that - her OPINIONS (granted, she's entitled to her opinions). Anyone who has had their dog or cat killed by unleashed, free-roaming dogs will hate this. I also found her constant references to a dog's mate as \\"husbands\\" and \\"wives\\" really annoying (my opinion). I wish I had seen these reviews before buying this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNKNOWLEDGEABLE","review":"I had awaited this book with much interest. I was very disappointed. The author is the epitome of irresponsible dog ownership! Nor are her conclusions about her dogs in any way accurate. I am appalled at the authority she has been given."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hidden life of dogs","review":"Very compelling stories that helped me understand so much more even after being an owner of many dogs after 30 years . I realized so much that I didn't know I already knew"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not responsible but very interesting","review":"Thomas has written an interesting dog book, although no responsible dog owner should use her methods. The point of the book, however, was not to teach us how to raise/train our dogs; it was to allow us to get a glimpse into their minds. Don't follow her example, but understand her conclusions. It will allow you to better understand your dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who was going to adopt a dog...as long as they promised to list at least 20 things not to do once their dog came home. I picked this up in a bookstore and library several times. It looked interesting but I didn't buy it until I saw it very cheap at a used bookstore. The store owner told me it was great. I think I should find out where he lives and take his dogs away.I'm wondering why no one else has questioned this woman's claim that she \\"rescued\\" her dingo but left the rest of the litter and the dog's mother with a neglectful, abusive breeder. How do you rescue only one from many? She's an irresponsible owner who bought from an irresponsible breeder...and then she became an accidental breeder herself. Only she swears she won't sell them as slaves because after all she does love them. (Heavy on the sarcasm there.) Wow this woman scares me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a story - not a study","review":"I bought this book when it first came out but didn't read it until recently. I'm not sure really what I expected but this was not it. Yes the book makes a fun and touching story, but to suggest that it even approaches scientifc validity and reliability is absurd. I only give it one star because it is not what it claims to be. Read this book for fun - not to gain insight into dogs' lives. I agree with an earlier comment regarding the irritating, ever present voice of the author. She is not a particularly good writer and her ego is all too apparent. I won't comment on her irresponsible treatment of her dogs except to agree with previous observations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not a how to guide...","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with all the negative reviews previously stated. This person was very irresponsible and should not have been allowed to own dogs. As a volunteer in a local animal shelter I see many dogs in similar conditions, that have suffered from overcrowded conditions and neglect which allowed them to go semi-wild. Furthermore, as a \\"noted\\" anthropologist, she didn't even use good science. The author based her opinion on one small group of dogs, specifically one breed. Although the shelter dogs I work with are out of their element (as pets), the variety of dogs, breed traits, and individual personalities make it clear that you can't stereo-type all dog behavior by observing one particular group. That would be like surveying a small portion of Los Angeles and then claiming their opinion reflects the total population of California."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Horrendous Dog Book I Have Ever Read","review":"I don't know what planet the author comes from, but anyone who allows her dogs to roam not neutered, mate without control, kill puppies, and then justify it as if it was some fascinating experiment is really sick. And whoever the people were on the book jacket who quoted what a great book this was, they need help, too. It was a disturbing book. I hope the author will be banned from pet ownership in the future. The worst part was the author acts as if everything she is doing is really interesting and normal. It was not. Don't waste your money on this book. You will hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Penetrating Look Into A Dog's Behavior","review":"Astutely observing the behavior of her dogs by letting them be dogs, not in the laboratory but in her own environment, Thomas takes a novel approach here which is captivating to read.Whether one can apply this approaoch to your own dog or not, Thomas provides us dog lovers with a truly wild romp with Misha and Bingo and others. So refreshing that she makes these dogs come out as the individual personallties they are, not as some scientific category under the experimental methodology.Classic to enjoy and be motivated to observe and rejoice in the individual traits and behavior of our own canines."},{"rating":"2","title":"All dog lovers should read this!","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago and have never stopped thinking about it. Unfortunately, I loaned it out and forgot who has it. I am buying it again, it is that good! I won't be loaning this one!A great book with touching and amazing accounts of how dog's truly behave when we are not around.Wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fantastic garbage","review":"This book is junk. Don't buy it if you have even half an ounce of brain cells in your noggin. The remaining cells will revolt against the sicky-sweet, arbitrary, non-objective drivel forced upon them. This is NOT an insight into dog behavior. It's an insight into braindead writing and irresponsible dog ownership."},{"rating":"1","title":"the hidden life of dogs","review":"This is a biography only of specific dogs instead of a person or persons and as such is first rate, insightful and would be interesting to anyone who likes dogs, from about 10 years old on.This is so well written, not scientific, but could add scientific data to the canine pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT a training book, but a nice look at dog life!","review":"A wonderful look at the lives of dogs. This book is clearly written with the purpose of showing what a dog's perspective might be. Its easy to see how someone not willing to think could be offended at the bad example and poor training methods shown, but that is not the author's goal. A plumbing book would make a poor electrical guide, as this book is in no way a doggie \\"how to.\\" Taken for what it is, it shows very nicely, a bit of what dogs are all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Non-Fiction I've Ever Read!","review":"Ms. Thomas has done, in this book, what no one to my knowledge has done before. Countless millions have been spent on the study of various animals in the wild, yet this woman for years studied (along with their wild cousins) an animal which most of us don't observe closely--domestic dogs--and wrote the most poignant account of \\"four-legged people\\" I've experienced in years. She plucks the heartstrings and jerks the reader to tears, without the slightest intention of doing so. Like a classic movie to be savored for generations, this book is the kind one wishes to read over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish but lacking substance","review":"Prettily written, but if it's scientific study you're after, you'll be disappointed. This is one person's circumscribed experience with some dogs, full of poetic anthropomorphizing and fluffy conjecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it, hate it, hate it!","review":"I agree with every negative comment that has been made about this book. Does anyone know if there is a website somewhere debunking her phony science and attacking her irresponsiblity? She makes me so angry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Bad, Disappointing, and Disgusting","review":"I have to say this is the first book review I've writen, I just haven't been compelled to write any reviews. After reading this book I changed my mind. I was so utterly DISGUSTED by this author's total irresponsible treatment of her dogs. I have read many books about dog behavior and I thought I would get a little more insight from this book. How wrong was I? I finished the book out of sheer determination. I read all the reviews written for this book and all of the negative ones are true. She let her dogs run wild through busy streets, she did not spay or neuter any of her dogs, had many unwanted puppies (which she allowed her dogs to kill), and the list goes on. This was not a scientific experiment it was neglect and abuse. If you would like an insightful/refreshing book about dog behavior that does not involve irresponsible ownership/guardianship buy Patricia McConnell's \\"The Other End of the Leash.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Alienate Your Canines For Fun and Profit","review":"Recipe for Disaster:Get a dog for every member of the family.Don't spay or neuter any of them.Allow them all to run free for a year while you follow along, observing them as they run through traffic, fight, and place themselves in danger of death or injury with regularity.Don't establish a relationship with any of them, work with them, and train them in any way.Watch and take copious notes as they withdraw from the family and revert to survival behavior.Write a book about the experience and make a lot of money. Fool the masses into thinking that this was a fascinating experiment and therefore any irresponsible behvior on the part of the author was somehow justified.I threw this book in the garbage, where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful work","review":"I am struck by the widely differing views of this book by other reviewers. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas reminds me of someone who goes through life with more feeling than thought. If you are of like mind, you will find her book charming. If, however, you bring any intelligence to your own existence, you may find this book interesting, but you will surely find Ms. Thomas, reprehensible. This book is a beautiful & touching account of incompetence & irresponsibility. The author may well be correct in her assumptions of dog behavior, but reading her 'road to discovery' is quite simply, painful. For those who argue that the book is not about how to raise a good pet, I totally agree. This book is about how to conduct life and assume responsibility for it. We can indeed learn from the author's failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Guide On How To Be An Irresponsible Owner!","review":"Even after 14 years in animal control, I still am sometimes surprised at how well people can rationalize their irresponsible behavior where pets are concerned. And this lady made money off of it! A woman who has no regard for either the dogs nor her neighbors, I also find it hard to believe that her behavioral insights can be respected when even her own dogs ignore her \\"leadership\\" by the end of the book. A very regrettable book that glorifies dangerous, unthoughtful and uncaring treatment of dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careless Dog Owner Profits from Danger to Her Own Dogs","review":"I was saddened to read this book. On the one hand, Ms. Marshall helps us learn about the \\"hidden life of dogs\\" but she does so in an incredibly irresponsible fashion. She basically lets her dog run loose, nightly crossing busy highways and running through suburban neighborhoods, while she observes him. I found this to be an appalling way of learning about dog behavior, as she risks her own dog's life and the peace of mind of her neighbors to gather fodder for her book. For this reason only, I can't recommend this book because it indirectly advocates the kind of careless dog ownership that endangers the companion animals we should, instead, cherish and protect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for training but preaches the horrors of over population","review":"Got this book to help me understand my awsome rescued 9 year old dog. Instead I now know far too much about Misha's peeing habits and the gruesome outlook of unwanted, discarded critters. I would never let this woman look after any of my critters. After 32 pages - I'm donating it to Goodwill. Get \\"The Loved Dog\\" by Tamar Geller for a book that's an uplifting book all about dogs from someone who observed wolves behavior in the wild. AND will help you truly understand your dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portrait of an IRRESPONSIBLE dog owner!","review":"I read this book over the weekend, and it bugs me more every day. Humans have spent 14,000 years domesticating dogs; we are responsible for their health, well-being, and behavior. Marshall Thomas has neglected her duty to her dogs by allowing them to roam freely into danger, breed indiscriminantly (with disasterous results), and generally placed them and others (human and canine) at risk by allowing animal instinct to take over in an unnatural situation (11 dogs in a city house). What she has learned in the process of \\"observing\\" the behavior of her dogs is NOT worth the suffering and problems that have been caused to them and others. This book will ANNOY the heck out of anyone who really cares about their dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself: poorly researched, ill written piffle","review":"No star, really, but that wasn't an option. Ms. Thomas gives herself away very early in the book, wondrous that a dog would cross a street without looking both ways. The most elementary knowledge, kindergarten level, of canine anatomy allows for less wonder; a dog's eyes are placed much further to the side of the head than ours, which face forward. A dog has a 270 degree field of vision. The pages which follow that street-crossing revelation, pages which I was dumb enough to read, contain nothing but twaddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Failure to Communicate","review":"What a sad and pathetic example of someone who fails to establish a basic relationship with her animals, leaving them to fend for themselves. The poor dogs give up on the hope of human companionship and revert to survival behavior. A pity that this woman has no understanding of how to create a meaningful partnership with her animals, in which humans and canines love and respect each other and enjoy spending time together. The human equivalent to her \\"experiment\\" would be leaving your child alone in the woods for a year to see what happens. If you love animals, don't bother with this book. Instead, get a book about agility, obedience, flyball, or another activity you can share and enjoy with your dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, disturbing, insulting","review":"Anyone who loves dogs should avoid supporting this author. Her research is inhumane, her viewpoint insulting, and her writing condescending. No need to be redundant; former reviewers who left negative ratings have said it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole lot of nothing","review":"As much as I love dogs, this book was almost painful to get through. The description of the dogs' behavior was rather unscientific, and the author's ego was a distateful presence on each page. For a much more interesting read, check out \\"The dog who loved too much\\" by Nicholas Dodman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"A portrait of the irresponsible pet owner\\"","review":"Absolutely nothing new here. Really, what could you learn from someone who thinks it is fascinating to watch her supposedly beloved dog cross the Alewife Parkway in Cambridge -- repeatedly! As she revels in allowing her \\"dogs to be dogs\\" all I could think about was: imagine being her neighbor! (which she does, in fact, imply is pure hell). Maybe if she had learned something interesting from her supposed research you could argue it was worthwhile, although I personally have trouble with the idea of potentially sacrificing great dogs to senseless research. Everything she finds enlightening has already been (better) researched and basically comes straight out of wolf research.

Definately a game that will collect dust soon as I (strangely enough) go back to playing CIV II.

It's certainly more expansive than Klemperer/Philharmonia's Seventh on EMI, my earlier introduction to the work, and has a wonderful sense of balance in both structure and execution. Tempos aren't allowed to veer to seeming extremes from a generally deliberate and wholly satisfying median. Harmonies and counterpoints are melded well to make for a lucid, firmly organic musical journey that neither sags nor shockingly stampedes. The second movement Adagio, in my opinion the heart of this work, is sublimely rendered. The third movement Scherzo swells and ebbs with firm intensity; dynamic climaxes convey appropriate drama and sonic heft. The digital recording is bright, vivid, spacious, and not at all glary.

Yes, I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you for the full price, Decca !","review":"The one above shown is not a rating of the performance , which has been widely praised for both interpretation and sound, but it's a rating of Decca' behavior.

Even worse, it was already re-issued in the budget series Eclipse (around 7 $!) AND with a Mahler fill-up.

I was on the path of ASP at the time and found the author's descriptions very enticing. Later on, I switched server support and became a devout PHP user. I bought this book and have not found a single chapter dry. I have tried about 20 different paths for learning PHP and this book is truly an eye opener. It's very straight forward. I guess it hit me right at the correct time. I already know OOP and a little bit of the PHP basics. This is where you, as new student, should also be. If you know hard languages like Java or C++, then this book will be a breeze. I suggest reading this first, then moving on to another advanced afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of pages, low on advanced content.","review":"This is a huge book, approximately 665 pages, however it is quite hard to find anything of help in it. It's great if you are going to go through and do all of the examples, I'm sure you would learn something from it, but it's terrible when you want a quick answer, or you really need to know the details on something. I frequently find myself searching the net instead of this book because it is huge and there is no good way to find the answers. Additionally, when you do find the answers it is just a continuation of a previous example and does not explain in depth on how to use the various functions and such.In conclusion, it's probably just fine if you are a student and want to go page by page and read the book and learn by examples. But it's terrible as a quick reference, and for more advanced users needing in-depth information you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down best book on the shelf","review":"If you aren't already somewhat familiar with PHP and MySQL, you should start with Larry's other two books, then bring your knowledge of PHP and MySQL and learn how to integrate them for your applications.I have read and tried to follow dozens of books on the subjects and Ullman's stand head and shoulders above the rest because of the methodical, step by step teaching method he uses.If you don't have at least a working knowledge of HTML, you need to get it before starting any of the three books. I don't recommend Elizabeth Castro's HTML compared to some of the other HTML texts I have used.Good Luck on your idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Good Except for the MySQL chapters","review":"I'm currently using this book to learn PHP and MySQL. All was well until I reached the MySQL chapters. I initially thought I was just dumb as a brick, because I just wasn't grasping the stuff in the Advanced MySQL chapter. However, after doing a bit of Googling, my thoughts have changed a bit. I wasn't grasping the material because the author does a HORRIBLE job of explaining things about MySQL, particularly the more complicated JOINs. I found a few MySQL JOIN overviews via Google, and everything was crystal clear.So, PHP-wise, I think it's great. The MySQL chapters need some work though. It's still a good book, but have Google nearby during those chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bliss","review":"My yoga instructor often plays track 1 at the end of class while we're resting in savasana--listening brings me back to that feeling of pure bliss and awareness.

Each chapter read like an incomplete thought. In the middle of the book Mr. Matthews discusses his time in the Peace Corps and his family...NOTHING FLOWED. I felt cheated and am certain the author is capable of much more...I would not recommend the book to anyone. I would also suggest that the publication be proofread prior to publication...note page 32, second paragraph, the word \\"In\\" should read \\"It.\\" I am a daily viewer of Hardball..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris, Now let me tell you what I think!","review":"Chris,You never have to worry about Tom Brokaw writing a book about \\" YOUR \\" generation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As deep as a puddle","review":"I'd always enjoyed Matthews via his column or appearances on the McLaughlin show...this book however is fluff. After the fine biography he put forth in Kennedy & Nixon Matthews obviously took note of the loot O'Reilly pulled in and figured to get in on it. His chapters are extremely short and the analysis the same. Saying nothing at all new about either Al Gore or Bill Clinton, I found his pages on his childhood actually more interesting. Sad to say that was merely because the other chapters were so bad. A book that adds nothing to any debate goin on anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"He can do better than this...","review":"I've been watching Matthews since early '99, and really appreciate his show. He keeps things moving, cuts straight to tough questions, appreciates how personal and social psychology have a major role to play in politics, deftly mixes humor with intense conversation, and is entirely intolerant of talking points.Unfortunately, this book contains almost none of that personality.Instead, Chris has produced a quick read of generally unprovocative ideas. Each chapter ends with, \\"Let me tell you what I really think...\\". So, what, everything before the finale was just baloney? What if he started each chapter with what he really thinks, and then spent the subsequent pages elaborating and deepening those ideas.Frankly, the whole thing smacks of a TV tie-in.I wouldn't dismiss Matthews outright -- his book Hardball is a real gem (read it, if you haven't), and the show still gets interesting here and there.But this book is thin on insight, and long on fancy footwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"As lively as the \\"Hardball\\" program","review":"This is a good quick read in which Chris Matthews expands beyond some of the things you know about him from his \\"Hardball\\" show, and talks a little bit more about today's political events. Like so many other books, it probably would have been better had he been able to wait a few months more to go more in depth about the September 11 terrorist attacks, but he still touches on them, and how they changed the Bush presidency. Chris Matthews is fair. He's as opinionated, but not as bombastic as Bill O'Reilly. True, he also interrupts his guests a lot, but this book will tell you why. This book also sheds light on the media bias that Bernie Goldberg discusses in his book. Some of the things Matthews says in this book repeat what Goldberg says, without the appearance of axe-grinding. The only complaint, I wish this book were longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"here's what i REALLY think","review":"When Chris Matthews wants to tell me what he really thinks, it makes me think he hasn't been telling what he really thought before, or else, why write a book about it.

After reading this book you will know for sure what you always suspected. Chris Matthews doesn't think. He has strung together a whole bunch of homilies, many of them contradictory. He projects his own biases to the population at large. He hates Gore, so everybody hates Gore, which is why he lost. Trouble is Gore won. He won with a bigger margin than Kennedy over Nixon and Nixon over Humprey.This book is strictly for Hate Radio listeners who think Rush Limbaugh is an intellectual.What was I thinking buying this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"This book confirms that Chris Matthews is shallow, just like his estimation of the American public.

After reading his book, I wish I hadn't. I liken the experience to a big, ripe apple that tastes like water and chemicals once you've actually taken a bite.Chris Matthews is everything Americans seem to be drawn to -- sharp, attractive, exhilarating -- with nothing inside. Though, refreshingly free from ideological rhetoric (which is what attracted me to him in the first place), I found nothing more than a thoughtless nationalism, based on sentimental reverie.Chris Matthews: just another baby boomer, moved by his times, then watered down to nothing by the years that followed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a worthy follow up to Hardball","review":"If I only cared. My brother bought me this autographed book for my 27th birthday. Like him, I was looking forward to a follow up to Hardball, which I had thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, this book just rambled on listing various people and subjects with some background and then what he really thinks about them.

All she does is use the card pictures. That't IT. Oh and a mention about the \\"All the Believers\\" card.Really if you are a true lover of the Hanson-Roberts than skip this book and get the one by Susan Hansson (it's the one that comes packaged with the deck as a set, that you should tell you something)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Perfect just what I wanted. eceived quickly in the mail with no problem.

Wanting more, I purchased the book, and read further to understand what more I could about the causes of my specific swing fault.

Obviously the 2 year old is a little young for the concept, but I drew up a chore chart and at the end of the week they each get $3.00 and each dollar goes into the separate banks. I explained each bank and my 5 year old cannot wait to give her money to \\"those who don't have any\\". It's a great teaching tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intentions are good, actual product needs improvement","review":"I was super excited when I heard about this bank. We have been teaching our children the same lessons with handling money. How to save, donate, and to spend.Intentions:This bank is separated into three different sections with a different building representing each section. One for saving (bank), spending (store) and donate (church). The child is to put the money into each section for its intended use. Neat idea.Our experience:Well, I would really like to say I loved this bank, but I don't. We could not open it to retrieve the money when it came time to spend and donate. So frustrating. So, if the intent it to be able to get to the money when you want it, this is not the bank for you. But if you'd like to end up saving more money than you actually intended, then this is your bank.Decide for yourself, but a good ole' fashion coffee can is looking better and better after this experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bank, no surprises","review":"Just a basic bank, what came in the box is just like the picture and description - a bank with three slots in it.

Putting the stickers on was about 5 minutes of fun, then came the noise. Oh, the noise. I realize that any bank that isn't made of material or paper is going to be noisy, but these are...awful. Add to that the plugs on the bottom of each compartment are nearly impossible to remove (even for the grown-ups). And, strangely enough, pennies and dimes get caught in the seams at the bottom of the compartments; that's just bad design. Also, the stickers have already started peeling, making the banks look ugly.I'm currently waiting for an order I placed for three Moonjar Classic banks from amazon to replace these banks. While they might not be quieter, I expect them to be easier to get into and to be of a higher quality both in design and build."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for kids","review":"I love this bank. My daughter was given this for her 4th birthday (two years ago) and was so excited to have a place to put her money. It was a great way for her to learn and understand about giving, saving and even spending. My other favorite feature besides the educational is its capacity. It holds quite a bit of money.My major dislike was color! Great for a boys room, but it did not go with her room at all (color choices would be nice), however the need for the bank outweighed its looks.Also, it could be made a little bit more sturdy, but over all we did handle it quite a bit and it held up nicely. It didn't break until it was knocked off the dresser spilling money everywhere. I do wish that items for a kids room were a little more kid friendly.Over all I love this bank and would recommend this for all kids of all ages. I just bought 4 to give to as Christmas gift.

The quality of the paper is bad. The pages are like Pringles chips. The photographs, while rare indeed, are printed the size of postage stamps, and the book is simply a dry read. There is a lot of research in here, suitable if you were going to catalog every move Abbott and Costello made, and every bowel movement they ever took. But it's too much. The writing style is uninteresting and catalog-like. As an avid collector and fan of Bud and Lou, I was expecting so much more from the authors. It looks like a ripoff of a much better book by Cox/Lofflin: \\"The Abbott & Costello Story.\\" You'd be better off buying that book. At least it has better pictures and a more well-rounded approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it is romantic and heavy","review":"Of course everyone hears different regarding string players, and in Baroque Music it's even worse. Maisky's first recording of the Suites was heavy handed and poorly understood. I think he does no better in this new recording. If you want these Suites in a modern cello you should stick with the classic 1961 Pierre Fournier version in Archiv, after 40 years still a marvelous recording from the most elegant of cellists. But you would be wrong to think that period instruments are dry or austere. Do please listen to Pieter Wispelwey's new recording in Channel Classics, it's so vibrant and imaginative that it's a delight. This recording will get my vote as the finest recording available today, though Anner Bylsma on SONY should also be considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Version Available!","review":"After absolutely being enchanted by the Maisky/Argerich version of the Back cello (gamba) sonatas, I had high hopes for these new recordings. Not only are the tempos a disaster ( the prelude No 1 is especially hideous) but Maisky even insists upon ending each movement with his own little trill. All in the name of \\"romantic recording\\". The tempos sound contrived at best. With the exception of the Prelude to the D Minor, which is glorious, the best hopes for this CD are use as a frisbee.

This is a pound cake, made for a birthday celebration. If it actually makes it out of the pan it will probably sink in the center.

It is supposed to serve as a transition between algebra to calculus, but it fails badly due to its inadequate explanations. Many of the problems are redundant, too hard, or too easy. Each section of each chapter offers VERY few examples, and these examples rarely correspond with the types of problems presented as practice. It is littered with typos, errors, answer mistakes, and a general feel of unprofessional publishing. The formulas and important \\"boxed concepts\\" or equations are often written in an excessively complicated manner. Where it needs to be concise, it drones on excessively. Where it needs an in-depth explanation, it skips over the issue. I used this WHOLE book through junior year and found it very unhelpful. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far a very unadequate textbook","review":"As a freshman in high school, I was very excited to be taking precalculus. But as the year unfolded, so did the many pages of my textbook, and I was dissapointed. Though it does provide many challenging problems, and many examples with graphics, I was unfortunate enough to have to drudge through the year always correcting the Teacher's Edition. On average, about 5-7 problems in every section were wrong in this particular textbook. In addition, There were many gramatical and numerical errors in explanations that were both superfluous and uninformative. The begging of each section had about 10-15 pages of explanation for that section alone. Additionally, the formating and small text were both confusing and intimidating. Overall, this textbook was far worse that I anticipated. This was both the first and the last year in which my school purchased this textbook, and anyone looking for a boring and less than adequate textbook: be my guest and waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"I love this book!

I used C-clamps instead for awhile but on longer heavier boards the extensions are really wobbly this way. Also the plastic end caps that go into the round support tubes have mostly all fallen out.

Her heavily therapeutic method of Caring For Self is predicated on the falacious 'given' that the caring, compassionate individual does good in the world because he is suffering from delayed stress reaction to some warping abuse in his childhood, an event that must be ferreted out and exorcised. It isn't necessarily true: a great many people do good unto others, serve the poor, work for social justice, etc., out of a healthy love of God. But formal religious motivation or comfort resources get little credit here. The pastoral Psalms, which give many people tired from caring and doing soul-rest and comfort, are never mentioned at all. Expect nothing any but the vaguest New Age therapy-as-religion-substitute in Ms. Straubs narrow bag of secular wisdom and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"JANE FONDA'S PREGNANCY, BIRTH, AND RECOVERY WORKOUT","review":"JANE FONDA'S VIDEO WAS VERY EFFECTIVE DURING MY SECOND PREGNANCY.

There's no aerobic portion and the floor exercises are very boring. Plus, it's annoying. The 80s feel is hard to overcome.

I used it with my first pregnancy eight years ago and recently tried to exercise with it. It is old and outdated. The newer videos for pregnancy workout feature a fun aerobics segment which this workout omits. Some of the techniques in the exercises do not match what is said on the newer videos today. The newer videos I have found state that they conform with the Guildlines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. I feel safer performing movements that have been deemed okay for pregnant women. Also, in the videos I have, the instructors are pregnant themselves.

If you MUST buy this book, see if you can get the original, older version from a used bookstore or the reprint from one of the many fine sellers here on Amazon. $25 is WAY too much for a nearly 40-year-old book with a new (and a generic, highly unimaginative) cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service","review":"I ordered these shoes for Halloween, ordered a size bigger to make sure they would fit.

Interviews with High School students explore the dynamics 'fitting in' and the anger and sadness that can build when someone isn't let in to the accepted social structure. It's an eye opener for kids who may not think their words and actions make a difference.

It's quite commercial, and I think Jarre has listened to Tangerine Dream's \\"Dream Mixes\\" project before doing this album. There are few, if any, directly weak tracks, most of it is melodic and goes straight into your ears. \\"Miss Moon\\" is a cool, more experimental cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metamorphoses [IMPORT]","review":"As a die hard Jarre fan, this CD is certainly a challenge. Very different from anything he has done before you will either love it or hate it. All 12 tracks have vocals of some sort, some singing, some talking, some electronically transformed. Some of the music may even be considered \\"poppy\\". I would even go as far as to say somewhat commercial. There are catchy tunes such as Hey Gargarin, Bells or Give Me A Sign to the slower atmospheric Millions of Stars or Gloria Lonely Boy.If you're expecting something along the same line as the classics such as Oxygene, Equinoxe or Magnetic Fields, you'll be in for a surprise.

While musically the album is quite innovative (Je Me Souviens, C'est La Vie,) I bought the album based on the fact that Jarre was (is?) a synthesist who produced Oxygene, Equinoxe, Magnetic Fields, and Zoolook. I understood the album concept, alright: It's not synthesizer music. If anything, I'd categorize it New Age/World music. My rating, therefore, reflects my opinion of the music in general.

President, to a quiet little town in West Central Georgia.I have visited the town a few times. It has changed, but it has not grown a lot. It is still easy to picture the people from this book interacting with FDR.One entertaining facet of the book is the inclusion of some of the President's favorite recipes.

New VCLs, functions, and any useful information about Delphi specific messages and exceptions have been left out. This book is a waste of money for all but the beginner to Delphi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-tier coverage","review":"I bought this book however, it has no coverage on any of the new components that are shipped with Delphi 3 C/S. No Coverage on RemoteServer, ClientDataSet, Provider or any of the new VCLs that you see under Win32 palette page. As far as database applications I see no help in using this book at all.

Everythingis sorted by the parent class so if you are working with a component you can look it upand see an example of how to use every aspect ofit. This book would have gotten a 10 but thereare a few ommisions (some of which are addressedon the enclosed diskette) because it was writtenprior to the final release of the software.

It just talks empty air. It leaves you where you are, without solving the problem or giving you a hint on how to solve it. Now it's a huge book with a great title, but that's just it. The only thing it has that might like you are tiny programs or fraction of code on how to use the components, but you can get better if you surf the internet or look into Delphi's examples in the help files. My suggestion is save your money, or invest it in a better book. I just wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chuckleheaded romance","review":"I enjoy great historical fiction like The Leopard or War & Peace. For breezy reading I turn to novels set in ancient Greece and Rome, like those by Mary Renault and mysteries such as those by Lindsey Davis and Steven Saylor.This novel is just trash, and has as much success depicting the Roman Empire as do those Italian sandal films of the 1960's. The plotting and dialog are at that level or worse; the fifth century deserves more than a Rhonda Fleming potboiler.It's a shame, since Galla Placidia's story is a fascinating one, though little explored in fiction. She is one of the rare women of history who, for better or worse, were central to her times. Daughter and sister to emperors, wife to a Gothic king, then empress herself and mother to an emperor, for whom she was Regent, within a few years of her death the Roman world withered away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes Simple muisc is Good","review":"Music like this yeah it might be cookie cutter, but simplistic music is great, its easy to comprehend, and the feeling is better than some music with complex rhythums and stuff of that nature, Sometimes its nice to hear stuff that is simple 4/4 rock, I think this album is pretty solid.

Watch for the \\"sprinkler girl\\" murder scene; what thousands of dollars they must have spent on special effects! The video cover tells you the movie lasts 80 minutes or so, but it actually finishes after 45 minutes of top acting, top storyline, and top-notch FX. Another convincing and innovative murder occurs when a sunbathing beauty (with blotchy legs and homely face) gets a bottle of suntan-lotion, plus contents, rammed into her mouth. Of course she fails to hear the murderer approaching from behind, and there's not another soul on the whole of the beach to witness the incident!!! Top acting honours must go to the unseen cop who, at the movie's conclusion, sticks a fake-looking gun out from behind a door and says in a deadpan voice, \\"Police!\\" I can't emphasise enough what top stuff this is. Buy/rent/steal a copy at your peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"Well I can see that most everyone else seems to love this book, but I didn't. While it was interesting to read, most of the stories were fairly well-written, and it is of course a good subject to bring attention to, it further perpetuates some myths regarding domestic violence. I understand that the intentions were good and that they're very very common misconceptions, and I used to have them myself, but when you're writing a book like this, I think you need to really research the topic. The main misconception found repeatedly in this book was that domestic abusers simply lose control of their tempers, and that's just not true; it's an excuse.For an understanding of the dynamics of abusive relationships and the motivations of abusive men, the best book to read is called \\"Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\\" by Lundy Bancroft. Granted it's not in a story format like this book, but it will give you so much better information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Next Time","review":"Maybe it's just me, but this book got on my nerves. The stories were boring and a little far-fetched. It was difficult getting through this book, but when I did, I felt I had wasted my time.

Subject matter is perfect which is why it caught my attention to begin with, but had I opened it and read a few paragraphs I wouldnt have bought it. My problems with this book:1. I thought the stories would be TRUE stories. (I'm not a big fiction reader).2. The childrens dialect is far too grown.3. And since I'm a product of a dysfunctional childhood, I found a few of these stories too unbelievable. But I guess thats the nature of fiction.All in all, sorry I hate the book.

The Rock explosion in the 1950's was the birth of 'youth culture' as we know it. it was loud, untamed, and outrageous... Exactly what punk was in the late 70's, as a reaction to overblown arena/art rock acts.The Misfits were and always will be a mix of the following:1) 50's greaser rock2) 70's punk3) and a TON of B grade horror movies.I can't think of a more perfect way for the 'fits to pay homageto their roots than a full album of 50's classics.

This CD is one of the worst things I've heard in a while. I was ashamed to be listening to it when I got it. I ended up selling it to Bookmans for like $3 (about all its worth). For the people that thought Famous Monsters was bad... Haha, that CD is the best compared to this.Jerry can't sing. He just needs to realize that the Misfits are no more and move on. He's only sticking with the Misfts name because he's a sellout and has so much invested in it.

Seeing that so many people are trying to get rid of this cd should give you a hint of how bad it is.They really should change their name to something along the lines of 'Misfits 3000 From Outer Space'. It would be fitting to have a stupid name for a stupid band."},{"rating":"1","title":"average music...false advertising...","review":"first of all i have to say that Misfits Project 1950 is a disgrace and is nothing more than a complete joke. why this album carries the name misfits when its just jerry only and a couple other dudes from black flag and the ramones is beyond my comprehension. it should just be called the jerry only project because he's the only guy in the band that's actually from the misfits(not to mention he was only the bass player and didn't write any of the music in the original band). the misfits were one of the greatest punk/thrash bands of all-time and glenn danzig was the heart and soul of the group. its been said a million times before, but ill say it again anyway...no danzig=no misfits. skip project 1950 and get some of the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by Poor Production","review":"These are great songs and this album had a lot of potential. However, the vocals are absolutely buried and unintelligible. With this sort of music the vocals need to be waaaay up front, but they are buried.

Its just not up to the standards that made the Misfits what the are (or were). It had potential but just fell short before delivering. The DVD included was of horrible quality and for those whos first exposure to Balzac is through this DVD I can only hope they give these Japanese Horror-core guys a second chance. Project 1950 is NOT a Misfits album. I know its hard Fiends but the time to let this band die is now. If you buy this just becuase its got the Misfits name on it your only going to encourage these old farts to futher disgrace themselves and the Misfits name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun album","review":"I have been a Misfits fan for decades. I loved the original lineup and was blown away in the 90's when Michale Graves joined. American Psycho and Famous Monsters are my favorite albums. I listen to them daily. I have always supported all of their solo projects and will always be a Msifits fan. I like this album a lot. It is different and I can understand why a lot of hardcore punk fans don't like it. I also understand it's difficult to accept change in general. Yes, I would love to see the 90's lineup reunite. It would be a very happy day for me. I don't think it's likely to happen though, so I'm thankful that Jerry has continued the Misfits and hope he always does. I will be here to support them."},{"rating":"1","title":"And you said Michale was bad","review":"First off, I got this CD and wasn't to happy when i say it was 20 minutes long, second,the songs they cover here are not very strong, better choices for cover songs may have made a better CD.

After listening to these songs it made me realize just how bad Jerry is looking to scrap together some sort of dignity.

Jerry Only has put together what he calls an \\"All Star\\" version of the Misfits. What a joke. I had no problem with the Graves' Misfits. The songs were good, his voice kicked and they were less serious and more funny and that was cool with me. Guys that age trying to be mean and scary would have been dumb (can we say \\"Danzing\\", folks?). At this point Only does not want to hire anyone else to sing and is now the new lead singer and while his voice does not suck...this is just lacking. Only says he wanted to pay tribute to the 50s but truth be told he can't write a song so they did what all washed up bands do: make a cover CD. The DVD confirms what a joke they have become. However, this CD/DVD is almost fun in it's sadness. Buy it used for under $5.00 and have a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"RE: Too Short but not short enough!!!","review":"This is an album of COVERS. They are not supposed to be better than the original, but rather they are a TRIBUTE to the original artist.

I prefer the Danzig era Misfits, but actually enjoy the Michale Graves albums. I wish he would have stayed for this one, because it is just bad. It sounds like a bad joke and any minute it should get good.This really surprised me because I am a fan of the original songs, I like the Misfits in most forms, and I am a sucker for a cover song. That being said, this was the only Misfits album I have deleted off my computer after I bought.

I love the Misfits and Fifties rock and it sounds like everyone is having a ball on this one! A GREAT TIME ALL THE WAY THROUGH! PICK THIS ONE UP! By the way, the reviewer who said Jerry sold the rights to a song for a Vans commercial should remember that Only had to give up the rights to older Misfits songs to Danzig in order to bring back the band so the 'sell out' in that case would not be Jerry. I think the whole 'sell out' idea is inane, but wanted to clarify that. Who cares about a Vans ad? This is a great CD! Pick up the box set to while you are at it. You can't go wrong with the Misfits stuff on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"retire NOW","review":"This cd was the most horrible thing ever. Jerry Only cannot sing for beans. I think he's just in it for money. I used to not agree with Danzig saying that the Misfits are a joke without him but I believe that now. Michale Graves was and still is the best one... but back to the CD. I heard three songs and already wanted to break it. This is nothing like the Misfits it is so horrible. Also I thnik that he's just looking for money and a way to stay in the business and get more rich trendy people to buy all the merchandise possible. This CD could have been better... but not many CDs that came out in 2003 were even decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Are You Thinking","review":"This CD was one of the best tribute cd's i have ever had.Also for some peoples information danzig did not write all the songs for the misfits in the 70's and 80's.also samhain was the same band as the danzig band not the misfits the misfits were around before glen joined the band and until recently the main line up has been the same people, jerry only and his brother doyle were the misfts. doyle took time off from the band because he and his wife had a baby , little boris. to say danzig was the misfits is wrong they are the best punk band around and have made there mark on the music world.

The real Misfits were not about lame as* bullsh*t! Like everyone else says, what you usually hear without Danzig has lost it's edge. They lost their edge. What's the point of making music and calling yourself the Misfits when you're really not changing anything? Punk is about change. Change is usually edgy, this is honestly far from that. The Misfits changed music - they had their own sound, they were original, and nobody else had that sound. I'm saying this about alot of other bands. We're not Danzig heads, we're not kissing as*. The Misfits truly lost their edge. We're not expecting every band to always sound the same - but at least create newer and edgier music because nowadays every band sounds the same. It's all up to the original bands to influence everybody, and when you're making music that doesn't influence anyone, what's your point - money?"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I advise anybody thinking about buying this cd to save your money.

It works great on lots of different items, from crusty bread to tomatoes, to cutting the hard rind off of butternut squash. It is a little short to use as a traditional bread knife, but on smaller loaves, it will saw right through thick crusts. It is a niche product for sure, but if you are looking to round out your arsenal of knives, this one makes a good addition. It will never replace a good traditional chef's knife or a santoku style blade, but that's not what it is about. We've been very happy with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful knife!","review":"This was my first Shun knife purchase but it won't be my last!I was raised with Henckels and Wusthofs so I was more accustomed to the western chef knives, the weight and cutting power. But I wanted to give some of the Japanese knives a chance and this was a great first choice. It does take a little getting used to compared to the western knives. It is much lighter but it feels sharper, so it really reacts more to the slicing motion than the slight chopping motion that I have normally used. But it is like a metal lightsaber, it just melts through tomatoes.The fact that this is also useable for spreading mayo or anything else that comes out of a jar on the bread and can then cut the veggies is a bonus.Very nice knife, and very unique, this would be a great first Shun for your collection if you are on the fence."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MORE SHUN KNIVES FOR US","review":"I bought our first Shun knife for my husband and was so happy and excited to start his collection of quality expensive knives.

Although it works great for that and does a wonderful job when preparing stir fry, a regular chef's knife is much more useful and I tend to grab one of those rather than this, especially if I have numerous things to chop (like nuts and meat as well as the vegetables). If you have the space and money, it is a nice addition.

She was great in No Secrets - all of No Secret's songs are positive and cheerful, but all of her new songs are just bad. They're really cliche, and they talk about stuff like girls who use boys and dumb stuff like that. Also, she has another album where she's wearing a jacket but no shirt, her hair looks awful, and her songs have a lot of bad stuff. I'd love her if she'd stuck with No Secrets, or at least they're cheerful style of music, but now, she's awful! Oh, No Secrets, where art thou? I mean, I loved No Secrets cause all they're songs were good and clean, but Angel by herself is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better","review":"After I heard, \\"Just The Way I Am\\" I was expecting better out of this album, but this album is very teeny bopper!

Good try but try again please!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all hype, folks!","review":"From the moment I found out that Angel had left her four lame friends of No Secret I was excited. The most talented and attractive member of the band was going solo. It all looked so promising too. Her website had clips and videos of Angel doing some awesome material, so I expected the album to be that and more. WRONG! Drawn in by songs sampled on her website like How Can I Lie, Speed Seduction & Love Song With A Twist, I bought the album knowing these songs weren't on there. I didn't care though because I thought if those awesome songs didn't make the album, then the songs on the album must be even better. WRONG AGAIN! The album is poor! There are only about 4 or 5 decent songs, depending on your taste. The rest are heavy on the pop , love and cheese factor. Oh how I wish I could have my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad!!","review":"I went to a concert of hers at my school and i thought she was horrible and you could defintely tell that she lip-syncs.

All the songs and lyrics are very meaningful and captivating. Angel has one of the most incredible voices I've ever heard either; definitely having a voice of an Angel. Me being a huge fan of No Secrets, I was definitely going to get this album no matter what. But the album was definitely better than expected. She does not lip sync, Angel Faith is her real name, and she IS a very good role model.

Once you hear Angel belt out the first note of the CD, you know she really is an angel that you can have faith in! I usually don't like every song on a CD but this is one of those rare cases where I love every single song! The CD includes Angel's hit single, Just The Way I Am, as well as other great and unique songs. Former member of the girl group No Secrets, Angel is now rockin' it solo, and when I say rockin' I mean it! She's an inspiration to young girls everywhere, and couldn't be sweeter! Just looking at her, you can tell she is nice. Check out Angel Faith's CD Believe In Angels, Believe In Me. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She delivers again. No big surprise there!","review":"With her usual grace and compassion, Mary Higgins Clark's book The Second Time Around explores the mind of a mass killer; in fact, a good part of the book is told from his point of view. It's a complicated plot with everything spinning off from a corporate crime committed by a character who then dies in a small plane crash. As is usual with her books - indeed most mysteries, there is the sense of a clock ticking as the book nears its end: will the culprit be caught before...whatever?Very well done, and a classic Higgins plot line."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to MHC?","review":"I purchased this new hardback \\"Second Time Around\\" by MHC and was really looking forward to the read. MHC, in my opinion, is one of the finest authors of today. I have several of her novels that I've thoroughly enjoyed. She's a very talented lady. BUT, something is amiss with this book. It didn't even sound like the same author at various times in the book. One part would be flowing with extremely well-written prose, and then all of a sudden it was like WOW, where did she go and who's writing this book anyway? The plot wasn't her usual, the writing style definitely wasn't up to her usual, and I thought her characters were weak. None of this is like the MHC I've read before. Guess we all have bad days and good days. Better luck with the next one, Mary."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"As an avid Mary Higgins Clark fan, I was totally enthusiastic about this latest book. But there has been a steady downfall in the quality of her fiction, and it has culminated in this one. The book is slow, predictable and not at all gripping. The plot is exagerated. What I used to love about her work was that I could easily relate to her characters, that is what made it so believable and gripping. This book is about rich and powerful people, and bad things and twists of fate that happen to them..I mean come on..she can do way better than that.My suggestion..if you MUST read it, borrow it from someone..don't bother buying it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outside the Strike Zone","review":"This was my first MHC novel, and perhaps it was not the best one to start off with. But, given that the issue of medical research fraud interests me, I thought I'd give it a read.MHC probably spends more time talking about what her main character had for lunch than any sort of believable medical research (fraudulent or not), so I assume (very unkindly) that it was a plot device to make this novel different from all the others she has written. By the time I was done, I was thinking that I might have just read an outline for a \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" episode.So, I did not find the plot to be particularly innovative, the medical information to be particularly well-researched, or the obligatory tension-building scenes to be... well, anything but obligatory. If there was a bin for \\"Pulp Suspense\\", this would fill it nicely.Two stars for the fact I was able to finish it without throwing it out in disgust. But there were moments....."},{"rating":"1","title":"MHC Needs to take a break","review":"This was the most boring MHC book to date. I thought I would NEVER get it finished. I guess she is running out of ideas, either that or retire!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing","review":"Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite authors and I always look forward to each new book. Her last book, Daddy's Little Girl was somewhat disappointing; this book is extremely disappointing. The book is poorly written and contains some major plot flaws. As an example, one of the main characters, Ned Cooper, suffers from an infected, burned hand that is featured prominently in the first half of the book. However, once the injury has served its purpose in advancing the plot, it is never mentioned again. One day, Ned's hand is so swollen and painful he can't use it. The very next day, Ned is back to shaving, emailing, etc without any difficulty. I found flaws like this to be very distracting. I also found the basic medical and financial sabotage plot to be rather implausible. Let's hope Mary Higgins Clark returns to her full potential in her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was so not the usual Mary Higgins Clark mystery novel.

Was a disappointment to me as well as a very flat ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I've read all of MHC's novels and always look forward to purchasing her latest thriller. Usually I can read her book in a day instead it was a huge struggle just to read a single chapter. I found it to be boring and at times very confusing.

I hope her next book is better than this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second time around","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I thought is got boring at times, and the plot thin.

I like having an author on whom I can depend."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very poor read","review":"This is the second story of MHC's that I have read. I picked it up upon a recommendation, and I'm sorry that I did.MHC shows a lack of understanding for the subject matter. Her insights into medicine (vaccines are preventive therapy, not treatments), the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical development, and large business operations are way off the mark. Her poor understanding makes this story unbelievable as it unfolds.A good writer researches their topic. Sadly, MHC did not take the time and effort to do so. Because of that, her story comes off more as a bad soap opera than a mystery. If the reader is looking for a good mystery that is well written, I would recommend that they pick up any of Michael McGarrity's books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's lost it","review":"I used to enjoy Mary Higgins Clark immensely and rushed for every new book as soon as it came out, but it seems Ms. Higgins Clark has lost her \\"bite\\". The past few (for instance, the one I'm reading now \\"The Second Time Around\\") has none of the her \\"page turner, edge-of-your-seat\\" thrills that her past books have had. In fact, I can't remember the last book I read that I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last MHC Novel","review":"I decided to give MHC a try because the premise to this book seemed exciting. Boy, was I wrong!!! This is one of the worst books I've ever read....The language is so elemental and simplistic, even a 12-year old could've written this!I got tired of the heroine's silly first-person narrative (in particular, when she describes how people look and how the places she visits are decorated) and her \\"can't do anything wrong\\" luck as she goes around interviewing an endless parade of characters who seemed cut out of cardboard like herself.The story is boring and repetitive - nothing exciting happens in the first 200 pages (I must confess I've given up and stopped reading)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carol Higgins Clark?","review":"This book is so badly written and ill plotted that I turned to the cover and flyleaf twice to be sure it wasn't co-written by MHC's daughter. For example, how many times must the author describe Carley's outfits as \\"having been bought at an end of the season sale\\"? The \\"feel good\\" ending was over the top. If MHC truly wrote every word of this one, she needs to take a breather and spend time in developing a story, plot and characters with some originality. She is becoming a her own mimic."},{"rating":"1","title":"MH Clark loses a long-time reader","review":"I have not read Ms. Clark's last two books because she wrote them in the first person and I do not read novels in the first person. I think that the reader loses the perspective of all but the lead character. Call me odd; you'd probably be correct but I'm so disappointed at this change by Ms. Clark. I'll miss her since I always anxiously awaited her next work. I'll always wonder why she changed. I always say: if it isn't broke; don't fix it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing - and no suspense","review":"I made it through the book - thus, I'll give it 2 stars, but the level of writing is simply unforgivable for a woman of MHC's talent. Maybe she is just out of touch, but the \\"slacks\\" outfit descriptions alone are enough to undermine the reader's belief in the main character as a real person. This book never scares you the way the vintage MHC books did, and even when the slightly less obvious villains emerged, I felt nothing. The reviewer who felt like this was a \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" plot was dead on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in MHC","review":"Like one of the previous reviewers I checked the book jacket twice to make sure I was reading a Mary Higgins Clark book. I have read everything she has ever written, which is why I read this book, even though it was written mostly in first person form. I should have saved myself the time. I am use to her main male and female characters having chemistry and being so well written about that I feel as if I know them by the end of the book. No so here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have read all of MHC books & was extremely disappointed in this one. The plot was thin, unexciting & often boring.

It just isn't her style at all. It was sporadic, poorly written, the characters lacked the usual development, and the plot was boring. I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book Series!!!!!","review":"We own both volumes of these character training books. They are both excellent at describing each character quality. My kids LOVE them. Even my 2 year old! The stories just click with them. They really like volume two better cause the stories are more for thier age. It is out of print but you can google \\"out of print\\" books and this title.The pages look boring and colorless. I really thought my 2 and 3 year old would not be interested. I was so wrong. I think it is another aspect that helps them imagine more than be entertained by pictures. In fact I have copied the pages to certain stories for them to color. They think that is great. This is a book series I will be hanging on to for a long time. I hope to read them to my grandchildren one day (a long time from now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Character Building Tool for Younger Kids","review":"I really like this book. Each character trait has a story that illustrates that trait in the Bible, at home, at school and at play. The stories are very simple to read and it is a great book to use for younger children. The book gives the definition of each trait as well as a Scripture verse that the kids can memorize it. Our kids really like this book and we have enjoyed using it to teach them Godly charactr traits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tall on tales, short on insight","review":"How ironic that a writer whose Achilles Heel was character development should have a biography that suffers from the same malaise. I don't think I've ever finished such a long biography with so little insight into the inner workings of the subject. This book is remarkably shallow, spending page after page discussing Adams' projects but precious little space analyzing who Douglas Adams was and what made him tick. Even non sci fi fans are familiar with the chatty, insecure, name-dropping public persona Adams portrayed, but I was hoping this book would look far beyond that. Sadly, it does not, and thus showcases a man who is as one-dimensional and underdeveloped as the characters who inhabit his novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book!","review":"I bought this book on a whim in a used bookstore for $9 dollars becauseof the inviting picture of Douglas Adams on the cover. (Sadly now I see I could have boughtit for 92 cents on Amazon, though it probably isn't worth that, especially if you include the mailing fees.)I love Douglas Adams. M. J. Simpson...seems to not exactly HATE Douglas Adams. butclearly loathes him...taking every opportunity to call him \\"a liar\\", \\"weak\\", stealing from Monty Python--etc, etc. Ow! Lots and lots of lists of people and titles and dates of things that don't matter.A strange, sad, dull, book.The only part of redeeming value is the foreword by Neil Gaiman, who clearly was fond of Douglas Adams as the rest of his readers were, except for the Author of this Biography...odd that.Instead of selling this book back to the used bookstore, or depositing it at the local thrift store, I will toss it into the trash, so no one else will mistake the bookcover for a good, warm read of Mr. Adams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious.","review":"I love Doug Adams' writing, and was hoping to learn about him as a writer and a person. I think I might have been better served to choose Neil Gaiman's \\"Don't Panic\\" for this instead.I found this book to be rather tedious. I wanted to come away from the book with insight into Douglas's beliefs, personality, and inner workings, but instead, I came away with a head full of dates and statistics and names names names names names.I forced myself to keep reading, but really didn't find the book interesting until the last couple of chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reheated","review":"Like many books of this type, Simpson's is content to reheat the same tired tales while giving little (if any) fresh insight into the man behind the curtain.

It's a very satisfying collection of perky, rhythmic grooves and evocative instrumentals. I've played it over and over for the past couple of weeks and it's rich enough to withstand the overexposure. It's good background music for yoga practice, as well as for enhancing the drive to and from work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing, but not much","review":"My nephew has a 2001 Buick Lesabre that seems to be developing one mechanical problem after another. I suspect it's related to him taking the car to a \\"guy who works on cars\\" who installed a subwoofer and amp and evidently spliced the wiring into the computer wiring harness. What a dunce! Anyway, my nephew needed help replacing a couple of sensors on the engine so I needed a source for locating them. This book looked like it might satisfy that need. I soon realized I need a factory service manual and this is not an FSM. It covers so many models and such a wide model year range, it's a poor substitute. Autozone sells these Haynes manuals, but they're shrink-wrapped so you can't see just how limited they are.

I say, forget about Groove is in the Heart and think of Deee-Lite as a no hit wonder and just enjoy their albums not giving a damn about what the critics said. Who cares about hits?What you need to know about this album is that it contains messages on various social issues on quite a few of the tracks. The rest of the songs are about love.

They did get a little preachy on this album, but the music is still there. Plus, I don't mind thinking once in a while. \\"Runaway\\" and \\"I Wont Give Up\\" are both excellent tracks, and I find it hard to believe they didn't make the \\"Best Of\\". The rest is all good, but the best song here also has the longest title, \\"I Had A Dream I Was Falling Through A Hole In The Ozone Layer\\". And as intended, all their albums will leave you with one overall feeling, that \\"Love Is Everything\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so delightful","review":"Deee Lite is a fun group and they make good party music. This album, though, is quite inferior to \\"World Clique\\" in my opinion. I was disappointed by it when I ought it nearly 15 years ago and I listened to it again after many years recently and still found it lacking, though can't say exactly why.

The questions are asked in a variety of ways (e.g. crossword, blockword etc.) so that you never get bored or unduly frustrated! Each chapter deals with different aspects of Elvis' career; you are tested not only on your knowledge of his music, but also of his movies. So, if you're a true Elvis fan (like me!!!) you'll buy this book and keep it aside for that lazy Sunday afternoon!

The story then skips ahead to the end of the war when the family is forced from their home by the incoming Allies.There are some touching and heartwrenching scenes throughout the book, and the last chapter will give you chills.I liked it very much.

Buy at your peril.once on (albeit with leaking inner tube) it is quiet and does not get hot on the trainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"tough to mount","review":"The reviews are right on, I blew four tubes getting it on my wheel the first time, so thinking its me and my lack of patience, I went to my LBS and had them mount it, only to have it blow another tube after one training session.Now, I'm fairly adept at changing my regular tires and tubes with no levers or other tools anywhere, anytime, so to me the problem is that the tire is too small for any rim, just a little larger would make a world of difference. But thats not going to happen so I would avoid this tire and buy yourself a cheap one for half the price. You'll be able to ride in a few minutes, rather than days after having to go buy new tubes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous and gentle music to inspire","review":"This CD is somehow both relaxing and invigorating at the same time.

Now I know why this movie never came to my local theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real woofer","review":"I was on a plane from Shanghai to Bangkok -- stop drooling -- and I was reading a book. On the TV, I saw Tim Allen chasing an orange cat. In the course of the chase, he dropped down from two legs to four. The effects, I'll admit right up front, were great. This looked far better than the old 70s (I think) version called THE SHAGGY D.A., which I haven't seen. But even so, it sucks. I didn't need sound or subtitles, and I didn't need but 5 or 10 minutes to figure out that it sucks. True sucking is like that. (Yeah, I saw the bit with the Scrabble board. \\"I am Dad.\\" Whoop dee freaking doggy doo.) It's possible we underestimate Tim Allen's ability as an actor, perhaps because THE SANTA CLAUSE was so unforgivably bad. But even so, this movie sucks. Sometimes life is just that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Family Fun!!!","review":"This is an awesome remake! In my opinion, it's funnier and better than the original. Tim Allen does an awesome job at being a dog. It kind of reminds me of Freaky Friday. When a 300-year-old dog bites a deputy district attorney named Dave Douglas, Dave is turned into a dog. His family thinks he's busy with work. When he turns into a dog, he finally sees what their lives are like when his kids are at school, or thinking about getting a tattoo. When he turns back human, his wife doesn't believe his story, and tries to prove that Dr. Kozak is testing on animals.

The concerto No. 5 gets off to a thrilling start, and this cd never really lets down after that. Perhaps the best track on the entire disc is the opening movement of No. 16, but there is something to please every Mozart buff here. The liner notes are also very well done, including the explanation offered by Robert Levin of why (and how) he improvises his cadenzas, and for you critics out there, he blatantly states that what he plays can never even approach what Mozart did. Still, Levin comes closer to achieving what these magnificent concertos sounded like more than two centuries ago than probably any other living performer today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best served to Otaku, but good eats for all ^_^","review":"This has got to be one of the nuttiest anime I have ever seen. Nothing is sacred or safe from parody, and I think many of you will like it like that. Some have said that the Excel's voice is too irritating, and I'll admit she's made me wince, but it also fits her character perfectly. You'll just love the way she sings the praises of ACROSS (the secret organization of which she is a member) with all the enthusiasm of a stormtrooper. Along with her anemic partner Hyatt, Excel blunders into mission after mission to further ACROSS's agenda of taking over the....wait for it....*CITY*! Mwhahahahah, gotta start small after all, wouldn't want to get ahead of ourselves now would we?

I encountered a budget copy of the first Excel Saga, and found the gags pretty darn entertaining. These disks would be REALLY great if Excel's voice track was toned down just a little. It can get pretty tiresome to have to concentrate so hard on the screeching rapid-fire dialog to make sure I can make out what she's saying. The dialog is generally pretty hilarious, but just a little too over-the-top to the point that it borders on the fingernails-on-the-blackboard effect. Looks like the production company has the problem in general as well, as I also picked up Puni Puni Poemy by them and it has pretty much the same problem. The main character's dialog track borders on torture, and is pretty much a constant feature..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, the dub.","review":"I unfortunately have to agree with the reviewer that pegged the dub on this. I usually watch the dub first to get the plot down and then the sub on subsequent viewings (or the dub if I'm eating!) The point is this: the voice actress for Excel is SO shrill that after two episodes I had already gained a blazing headache. I really, really wanted to like this anime. After all, who wants to waste money?

The more you know about anime and japanese culture, the better this is. It is also NOT FOR KIDS.

I tried out both the English and the Japanese soundtracks, both were equally annoying.2) The humor is either slapstick or involved \\"insider jokes\\" about anime and manga series.

The comedy was much to dark for my tastes. I have no problems with a show with no plot, however, this series just rubbed me the wrong way from the start. There is also the whole eating the dog thing which I can not stand even if it is for comedy value. Sorry but I don't find the eating of animals funny, even if it is not really shown. Parents: don't let your children see this it will disturb them greatly. To parents and others: If you want a series that is funny and not as sick as this go get Dragon Half, Oh My Goddess Mini, or Slayers. Don't bother with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, and the Dub Was Very Good","review":"I have to say that this is one of the funniest animes I have ever seen. It's full of wacky slapstick humor, visual parodies, and tons of other goofiness. My favorite parts of Volume 1 are the Action/P.O.W. parody in the 3rd episode, and the dating simulation parody in episode 4. As far as the dub, I found it to be quite good. Jessica Calvello's Excel is just as annoying-sounding as the Japanese voice actress, which to me means she's doing spot-on work. Unfortunately, ADV's accelerated-release schedule for the series did not give her the rest needed between volumes, and she blew out her voice. There will be a new voice actress in the dub for volumes 4, 5, and 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insane Anime","review":"Excel saga is funny,crazy,creepy and appealing but do not buy this DVD from wonderbookandvideo because they will rip you off seriously!a mistake I will NEVER make again,that's what I get for trusting them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excel Saga","review":"Since I nicknamed myself as agentexcel, it should be apparent that I am a fan of the series. Here are a few points that were not covered by some of the other reviews.(1) The English dub is very good. Excel is voiced by Jessica Calvello whose maniac performance fits Excel's hyperactive nature very well. (Incidentally, Kotono Mitsuishi (Sailor Moon)is the voice behind Excel in the Japanese track.)(2) The series was created during the recent and ongoing recession in Japan. Many of the characters have problems securing stable employment. This is the reason why Excel keeps Menchi as her pet dog and emergency food supply.(3) The characters (Excel, Hyatt, Ilpalazzo) were named after Hotels.(4) There was some crackling in parts of the Japanese track. You will notice them if you are a perfectionist. To the best of my knowledge, this issue has not been addressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puuchuu...Puuchuu!!!","review":"By far, this was the craziest thing I've ever seen.

The reason I say this is because about 99% of the comedy that compiles Excel Saga is parodying and heavy slapstick. Having seen a nominal amount of anime, I was unable to perceive most of the parodies. Some of the slapstick was funny, however, most of it was just too grotesquely wacky to be humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"veiwers choice","review":"Mark Valley plays an excellent part in this movie as the hero without a past.

First, it has a safety mechanism that is so hard to push down, you almost need to use a screwdriver (or something similar). It is so difficult to disengage the safety mechanism, that my wife often cannot do it. The second problem with this torch is that it is constantly going out, even though it is full of butane. Unfortunately, every time you want to light the torch, you must depress the safety, so it has turned out to be a real pain...

Granted, his over-the-top style can be hard to take if you are a meat and potatoes kind of music fan. But if you've ever loved the excesses of say, Terry Gilliam, the Beatles White Album, classical impressionist musicians such as Ravel and Debussy, and early '70s Frank Sinatra, hey, you may enjoy this album. This is an album of excess. It's indulgent. Some of the above reviewers have criticized it for being inaccessible. Who cares if not everyone gets it?

That aspect of his songwriting completely blows me away.Now, review. The orchestration, harmonies, big buildups, and european fetishism are all there, but he adds so much that makes it worth listening to. New textures, moods, even a bit of opera in the first track.The difference at first listen is that the lyrics seem more earnest than on Poses or his debut. Not necessarily in a soul-baring way, but it does seem to have an even mix of songs which feel like they should be Cole Porter standards, and songs which are a little more lyrically askew and give the impression of having come from his life.Looking forward to Want Two..."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart-feeling and stunning duo (Want One and Two)","review":"I made a decision after listening Rufus' singing (He ain't heavy, He's my brother) over a radio program, and give a try on Want One and Want Two (the latter has his live concert DVD)when I play Want One, I am pretty stunned, even a listener over 30 years, with all kinds of genre, found he has a pretty good and heart-feeling voicemy favorite:I don't want what it is: perfectly matched voice and musicGo or Go Ahead: he sings in soft at first, and bring to high tide with 3 loud guitars, pretty goodHarvester of Hearts: singing in Jazz style, surprising goodBeautiful Child: very Disney feel, why?Want: this is pretty smooth like flowing water, the most favorite followed by \\"Go or Go Ahead\\"11:11: I can't explain how good it is, but this is my 3rd favoriteI give 99/100 points, this is an excellent CD for all (but recommended for listeners over 30)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Things","review":"Rufus's latest, \\"Want One,\\" is immaculate.

On this album, he fails musically for the first time, and stumbles over lyrics so trite and just plain bad (and I quote, \\"You walk alone in the valley of life, In the shadow of love under the trees of happiness\\") that one wishes he'd go back on drugs. Seems for some, writing about what you hope life will be like works out better than writing what your life actually is. Poses is one of my favourite albums ever, this is only one of the albums i've most been dissapointed by in my life. Let's hope Want Two goes back to the days when Rufis was indulging himself physically, not musically. Otherwise, i'll never 'want to' hear another word uttered from his mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank-you Rufus!","review":"Rufus' third album will not disappoint any of his longtime admirers and it might even bring new fans to his unique musical signature. In Want One, Rufus is keeping with the tradition of grandeur and grace. The full orchestral sounds accompanied by multi-layered voices are there along with the gorgeous, pure and simple ballads. His voice has never sounded better. Want One is definitely more accessible, although I don't know if Rufus will ever be truly accessible to everyone, than his last two albums. There are glimpses of Queen, the Beatles, and Elton John. Not bad for someone who is only thirty!Want One is my favorite of the three so far but I think that is just because it is so fresh. I will go back to alternating between all three, appreciating them all the same while enjoying their own distinct differences. Thank-you Rufus for making such great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Well to describe how I felt about this CD would take too much time so I will just keep this short and simple. I first saw Rufus Wainwright on a TV show and I heard some of his music and knew that I got to hear more of it so I did but I made the mistake of buying Want Two instead of buying Want One first. When I finally got a hold of Want One I listened to it and felt that Want Two was a lot better than Want One for many different reasons. I recommand that you buy Want One first and then buy Want Two that way you'll understand it more. I kinda thought it was hard to understand some of the storyline I didn't hear what most people said it was about but oh well. All in all it was a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art Piece","review":"This cd is worth owening. It is a work of art let me tell you. I strongly recommend it, you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album... but it's not puccini, it's ravel.","review":"this album is not bad at all; in fact, it's quite interesting. it's clear that he's a fantastic musician with totally original ideas, which is refreshing. while it's not an album I would play every day, it's definitely something to turn to when I'm in the mood. and for all of you who, for some crazy reason, think you know classical music enough to make comments, please realize that wainwright quotes ravel's \\"bolero,\\" not anything by puccini, in the first track. the entire song is based on that piece, so no, rufus did not \\"throw in some horns\\" to make it sound interesting... it was a total formula, and is definitely my favorite track. I'm begging you, do a little research before you \\"speak.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Skies the Limit","review":"This CD is simply breathtaking. It's so emotional and Rufus demonstrates such range on this album. The hurt you hear in his lyrics, and the background behind the recording of this album make this a \\"must have\\" CD for 2003.I really loved the intro for the album and the song \\"Beautiful Child\\". However, the whole CD is tight and has so much depth. Rufus has unbelievable talent and the skies the limit for him.Order this from Amazon today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dreck... total dreck","review":"overblown, hystryonic crap that sticks to your face like a killer piece of Limburger cheese and won't let go until you are dead.

Who can understand anything he sings? HE SLURS. And Oh God!, it must be so hard to be \\"Miss\\" Wainwright. Such a tragic life is documented in these lyrics that I read in the liner notes (God knows you cannot understand them when they are slurred). If you like music that makes you want to slash your wrists open then this one's for you. Just make sure your drunk, have a lisp, and buck teeth when you listen so you may understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"I recently bought \\"Want One\\" by Rufus Wainwright and after a few listens, I was absolutely addicted. I've listened to the album too many times to count and it has never gotten old. I bought his other albums soon after and loved those just as much. Wainwright has extraordinary talent and his musical style is completely unique. There is absolutely no one like him. So if you're a lover of music and innovation, you have to buy \\"Want One\\" or any of his other albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite of mine","review":"Given to me by Santa, this CD took a little while before it really became a fave of mine. It takes a little getting used to, and for me, I had to know the songs before I really got into it, but now it is a regular in my cd player. I just saw Rufus live in Chicago a couple of days ago, and, amazingly, he is better live than on his CDs. If you love his music, I highly recommend seeing him live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it get any better than this ! ?...I DON'T THINK SO !","review":"Up until recently, i had never heard a Rufus Wainwright album. I purchased his latest offering, \\" Out Of The Game \\" after seeing him on TV, singing the title track. I had to check out his back catalogue.........well, what a joy i found ! \\" Want One \\" created an immediate impression, so much so, i've ordered copies for friends. Everyone should hear this masterpiece ! It's definitely in my all time top 10 favourite albums.From first note to last, you're taken on an emotional journey, that takes you from joy to sadness...and anything inbetween. The ballads / slower songs, remind me of one of my all time favourite artists, Billy Joel...and Rufus ( like Billy ) is a great lyricist too. Imaginitive & unique.All the tracks are very special. \\" Dinner At Eight \\" is absolutely beautiful, and makes me want to cry.I would urge anyone to add this cd to their collection, if you don't, you're really missing out on something wonderful !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ace Up His Sleeve","review":"Multi-talented Canadian singer-songwriter geniously conceived double album of sorts finally gets it's release, as the first part, Want One goes the motions of Wainwright's talents and unique sense of humour, especailly on tracks such as Vibrate \\"I try to dance like Britney Spears/ I must be getting on in years\\" and the inspired Gay Messiah. For years Wainwright hasn't quite made it in the UK, but after listening to Want One, that is one mistake that will be fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop listening to it....","review":"This album is one for the ages. I simply adore it, I can't get enough of it, and someday I suppose I will stop listening to it. But that day has yet to arrive. Just buy it on instinct -- if you have an inkling that you'll like it, do it. That's what I did. And now Rufus moves me daily, for reasons I can't even explain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low smell, complete;ly lost within 2-3 days","review":"After a few days I had to put my nose against it to smell anything.

Mine also came in a wrapped in platic, lotta good it did me...my suggestion buy some at a wood store and chop it up make your own sachets and place them in pockets of clothing. Alot cheaper and works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellis Peters would turn in her grave!","review":"For those of us who love the Ellis Peters books, this was an insult and an affront. Quite simply, the story was mutilated beyond all recognition. In fact, only the character names were consistent. Changing a few details for dramatisation is one thing, changing good characters into bad ones, and changing the whole crime is quite another. If the directors had wished to write a NEW sinister story, then they could have done exactly that. There was no need to ruin one of Peters' wonderful stories in the process.Frankly, the delightful and gentle quality of the Peters' stories provides their unique charm. This engineered dark, brutal atmosphere is totally alien to the original works, and as such has no place in this series.If you love the original books, do not buy this DVD. It will leave you irritated and annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, provided one hasn't already read the book.","review":"This video has all the atmosphere one expects from a Brother Cadfael mystery. Unfortunately, it is completely unlike the book. While it manages to tell its own story well enough, the book was far superior, and it's a shame that the person responsible for adapting the book for television didn't treat it with more respect. Many characters are completely, wildly different than in the book, as is the plot. Some minor, inconsequential details were kept, and as far as I can tell, they are the only connection with the original story. In addition, anyone who is a fan of Hugh Beringar could just as well avoid this video, too, since he is hardly present--and when he is present, he is one-dimensional and has no rapport with Cadfael. Overall, a very disappointing adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood not BBC","review":"The BBC has always been good about staying with the book when basing a movie on a book. In this case, I have decided that this was a Hollywood production rather than the BBC. They took the book, ripped it apart, and glued it back together bleeding just as Hollywood so often does. They didn't even leave the names the same or the characteristics of the characters! It was extremely poorly handled from the aspect of during a book into a movie. I have never been so disappointed with the BBC than when I saw this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was awful","review":"The best Cadfael stories filmed were the ones that stayed true to the books, like Virgin in the Ice and One Corpse Too Many, those were absolutely wonderful. But this? The only thing they kept was the title, they made this an ugly, ugly story. I agree with the others, read the book and avoid this one like the plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, bad adaption","review":"I totally agree with the other reviewers. Stay away from this video and read the book instead. I understand that plots need to be summarized for video, but this book's heart was ripped out. The boy rewarded in the book for his faith and innocence is turned into a thief and liar.The story plods along and is missing the spark that many of the other videos have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important note RE: this CD","review":"For obsessive types heres a quick note.You need the import copy of this,the one that doesn't start with \\"A girl like you\\".TheUS version deletes some of the great samples (Velvet Underground,Being There,etc) on the import disk. when I DJ'd in the early nineties,this disc and the remix 12\\" of \\"sucker\\" and \\"mama told me not to come were\\" just HUGE favorites.Get \\"Bird Wood Cage\\" as well,these guys are up there with Felt as a Great Unknown Band!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Queer thought Alice while listening to her headphones!","review":"This is one of my favorite all time CDs. It needs to be listened to with headphones to truely appreciate the production that went into this CD. There is a new squelch, new beat, new melody every time I listen to it. Complex, intellectually dense, melodically difficult, but EXTREMELY catchy, funky, poppy. Maintains an incredible quality throughout a long album. The US version starts off with \\"A Girl Like You\\" and each song is distinct, but within the same framework. This is a band at it's height, riding a wave of creativity. I can't say enough good things about this CD. Incredibly weird, but incredibly REAL, if that makes sense. It's not off trying to be futuristic or psuedofunk or anything, it's just a wonderful combination of production, songwriting, sampling, and performance. And the graphic design is great, to top it off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing under-appreciated gem","review":"Like most great music, it is very hard to describe what makes it great. But I will try.The Wolfgang Press (sadly no longer together) had been slogging out records since the mid '80s. They were good, some very good. Then they created.... this. Queer has little in common with their previous work. It mixes biting, sometimes cynical lyrics with an interesting blend of dance-style music replete with Motown touches and the occasional noise flourish.Rhythmic, melodic, intense, original - and complete with a Randy Newman cover, this record deserved a wider audience than it ever received. If you enjoy truly original work - not following the dictums of any particular genre, performed perfectly and passionately, you may think this record is as great as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasinating, riviting...but in a weird way!","review":"I took a sexual devience course in college and this was required reading. I still own the book and love it! I thought that it was very organized and written in a straight forward style- no holds barred. Not for the weak stomach or anyone who even kinda gets the hebbie-jebbies by, say....child pornography. Holmes WILL describe hideous events involving all sexual deviences. What I liked most about this book was that there wasn't a lot of confusing deep analysis of peoples' psychosis. This is a good learning tool for anyone interested in criminology/psychology or sexual devience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled With Grammatical Errors!","review":"Although this book is informative thus far (only into Chapter 2), it is riddled with so many grammatical errors one would think they hired a child for an editor. I have never seen a published work so tarnished with errors. I find myself editing it in my head so as to understand the writers at times. Too bad I don't have a choice in the reading since it is the required text for my class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias","review":"This book is being used to supplement college courses, but it should not be. I cannot get past the obvious bias in certain sections. Also, the book is lacking proper citations, often rendering sections unreliable. Out of the only 10 or so citations in the first chapter, 5 cited the authors previous books (not even the raw research). This book may be appropriate for nonacademics wishing to read an entertaining nonfiction work. Students and academics should skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been around forever for a reason","review":"This book has been around since I was in college during the Punic Wars.

Arrington is an experienced teacher and his teaching proficiency shows all along the book. His style is very clear and sometimes repetitive, but that makes sure you get the idea through.Being a \\"hands on type of guy\\" I like the fact that the book explains the theory in the context of developing and example application.The UML & Object Oriented Analysis section of the book is truly outstanding, while the implementation part leaves a bit to be desired. It is also outdated as it still uses HTML production classes inside Servlets and not JSP. The second edition should fix this.Overall the best book on UML for a Java developer I have read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad definitions but good case study.","review":"This book is very weak in defining basic UML and OO concept in the first chapter. It has bad definition for concepts such as \\"classes and relationships\\". Its definition of some of OO concept is hard to grasp for new comers to this field. At first I was going to use this book for some of the in house classes that I teach. Now I have decided to use it in conjunction with other books, since I am very pleased with its case study.If we fail to have a good basic definition and miss points in definitions of such concepts as Relationships between objects, then we cannot really provide a book that can be exclusively used for learning a concept such OO and the UML in enterprise Java.My suggestion to the writer is to omit the first chapter or rewrite it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book with a few errors.","review":"This book is fairly good to treat J2EE and UML.However, there are some mistakes in the book:1)Page 11, * should mean 0 or more.

Take Down The Grand Master is their only album, released in 1996. It has 16 skits, 7 of which Harmon is credited as writer, 3 of which Schrab is credited as sole writer, and 1 more which they share writing credits on. This isn't the funniest CD ever made, but for a 15 year old collection with limited distribution, it holds up fine. Some parts are a bit dated, but other parts are still fresh. I'm a dedicated fan of Harmon and Schrab's more recent works, so I tracked down a copy of this CD just out of curiosity, and I'm glad I did.

There is absolutely no helpful narration whatsoever to let you know the intricacies of what he is doing and why and how various different maneuvers will help in different situations, etc. There is virtually nothing of substance or help here. Occasionally a pause with some cryptic subtitles is the most you'll get. Chances are if you're an advanced enough diver to figure out what is going on, you don't need it.

These are just some of the questions that Rock and Roll fans ponder when trying to understand how these musical legends made it to the top.Dennis Goodwin tackes these questions and many more in his little gem about twelve performers of classical Rock and Roll. In each viginette we find that one chance meeting, an inner voice, chicken's eggs and four dollars made the difference in moving ther performers out of the realm of obscurity.Each story is brief and captures your attention as you find out what the catalyst was in launching the artists' careers. I highly recommend this text for younger rock and rool lovers who can garner an appreciation for how \\"fate\\" can play into the hands of one's success. \\"Old\\" people who grew up with rocl and roll will be delighted about these little known stories of their favorite artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough!","review":"This video really breaks down the moves and makes them easy to figure out.

It's not that it's absolutely terrible but this is not really the true form of Motorhead. Most of the songs are not that outstanding with the exception of Motorhead and the hilarious Vibrator. They were still finding their sound at the time and shortly afterwards went through a drastic lineup change. The album was also released four years after it was recorded. I decided to buy this at a store because the price was six dollars. (You probably would have done the same). But if you want to venture into the world of Motorhead, then look at their later albums like Ace of Spades, Overkill or Orgasmatron.

Though I'm a huge fan of Will Oldham and own many of his albums and EP's from all of his various projects I can honestly say now that the main draw to his music is his voice. Sure the playing and instrumentation of his music is always acceptable, but without the voice it misses the critical impact that his other works achieve. Imagine what it would sound like if Leonard Cohen had come out with an instrumental album where it's just soft guitar playing without that nice poetic voice. If that sounds acceptable then this album is for you. In my opinion this album will probably only appeal to completists and die hard fans. If you're new to Will's music start with Viva Lost Blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy this product again..","review":"I had this product for a year now. The first few months it was great, then the problems started.Problem 1: I needed a new handle as it broke. I e-mailed Rival customer service to get a replacement piece (in black). They told me that the black handle was in stock and then proceeded to send me a white handle. I sent them several e-mails and never got a response.Problem 2: Unlike the previous review stating that the cooker just shuts off, my cooker just keeps on cooking it never switches to the warm cycle. The whole crock pot was extremely hot, I am now afraid to use it unless I am home, which defeats the whole purpose of using it.I could use any suggestions on which crock pot/slow cooker to purchase next.

I purchased it from Amazon hoping the rest of the DVDwould be similar to that one song. Wrong!! The rest is horrible not only be-cause of the songs chosen but also of the poor poor quality of the filming.It only holds a few songs and the rest are commentaries on the benefit showto come with a.o. Ringo Starr who does not participate in the music.I won't play it again and decided to just import the the song from i-tunes.Please don't spend your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Suchet is Poirot and Poirot is David Suchet","review":"There is something just so lovable about this Belgian detective and his little gray cells. What is incredible about this entire series is the attention to detail on costumes, settings and ensuring that the art-deco feel of parts of England can be recreated. I have always been a great fan of Agatha Christie and, in particular, the character of Hercule Poirot (I have found Miss Marple to be rather annoying). But David Suchet has resulted in a fan following for this character that has little to do with the original character. Each and every little flaw, trait, quirk, is played to great effect. This added to the already-flawless plots of Agatha Christie make this entire series a jewel in the crown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Collection, Set 2","review":"This collection further exemplifies David Suchet's performance as Christi's Poirot.

Besides, it reminds me of holidays so I decided I love it. It looks very appealing in an earthy natural kind of way.I used it a lot this summer keeping grilled items warm in the oven while the 2nd batch was still outside, the compartments made it perfect for serving. I serve candies, grilled stuff, sauce and rice, and a myriad of tasty treats and appetizers in it. I plan to get a lot more use out of it this holiday season, and definitely recommend it! Ritz crackers and wheat thins even look fancier when in their own sections of this dish. It is quite versitale.I also think the price is quite reasonable for the solid hand-crafted-looking-ness of this item, and am considering getting more baking dishes from this line (in other colors) for myself and as gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple but effective story.","review":"Basically, an android figuring out her place in the world, and if she can have emotions. In the end, she becomes quite possessive of her human male friend.Strictly low budget. The special effects are not that great, but then, not many are needed. For the most part, this is an android story that's been told before (think Galaxina, all the way up the new Galactica Cylons). The acting is not that bad, only a couple of sets are even needed (a lot of the film takes place outside on an alien world).The female android is attractive in a simple way, wearing a bland black jumpsuit. Maybe by altering her outfit, the producer could have made the movie a bit more spicy. LOLAnyway, this film might be worth watching once, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"The whole crew should be punished for wasting a lot of people's time... ! :)Yeah, that summarizes how I felt after watching this movie.

No Hollywood or mid range production company values. The script was probably written by committeat a bar-b-que picnic table on a summer day.The script is sparse, but the story isn't too bad. It ends as expected.I do have to say I liked the lead 'actor'. He was baby faced and had an innocent persona that made himeasy prey for misdirection.

Piano-driven, cool tunes, meaningful lyrics and mature, true voice. Corrinne's professionalism (studied music in America) allows her to bring forth elements of rock, pop, jazz and classical music. 'Everything in Its Time', 'Save Me', 'Little Superhero Girl', 'Free' are all well-written songs. 'If I Kissed You' is funny and upbeat, as well as 'The Birthday Song'. 'Angels In Disguise' and 'Let It Go' are all meaningful and inspirational. 'Every Beat of My Heart' and the title track 'Safe In a Crazy World' are a little mundane and less lustrous, but with all the other songs, this proves to be a great album that is worth your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, think about it..","review":"The time one spends listening and working on all the cassettes is probably never gained back by how fast one might be able to read after going through this program.Howard Stephen Berg is a part savant; at least that's what it seems like to me.

This book, along with Eva's own autobiographies, offers a very full and detailed view of Eva's life. However, it is so detailed that it will mainly interest those who already have a general interest in Le Gallienne and have a basic knowledge of her life.Sheehy includes many details that Le Gallienne herself never disclosed in her two autobiographies, whether they be of a romantic or traumatic nature. Le Gallienne's autobiographies are much more interesting to read, because her narrative voice is very engaging, but Sheehy is more thorough and offers insights that only a third-party could offer.I would recommend reading this book after reading \\"At 33\\" and \\"With a Quiet Heart,\\" Eva's two autobiographies, though I will admit they are difficult to come by. It is much easier to get through Sheehy's book when you are familiar with Le Gallienne's life story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tablecloth for My Kitchen","review":"This item is not only beautiful and fits my decor very well,it is a good quality tablecloth and well-priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read !!!","review":"This book was awesome!!!

Unfortunately, in the larger society, like in high school, those who are intelligent and think rationally are least likely to be represented in the mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Infuriating","review":"I could go on and on about how much I hate this book. The arrogance, the narrow-mindedness, the self-pity.I'm definitely what people would describe as a \\"geek\\" (unless I'm not \\"counter-culture\\" enough for you), yet I absolutely hated everyone I read about in this book. Apparently, from what Katz tells us, we are to believe that geeks are super special superhumans who are just too good for ordinary people. Well, guess what - geeks aren't really that unique! Yes, I personally think that they are more interesting and are people I would more likely want to be friends with, but I could hardly go around espousing it as fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I read \\"Geeks\\" and then followed it up with \\"October Sky\\" (or \\"Rocket Boys) by Homer Hickam--the story of \\"geeks\\" in West Virginia set in the late 1950's. It is by far the better story. Read it for yourself.I found no heart in \\"Geeks,\\" no real character development. No \\"Why!\\" Katz seems more interested in himself. Perhaps a son he didn't have. He has nothing to say about his daughter who is undergoing similar traumas with college and career plans.The story is about Katz, more than Jesse and Eric. I'm sorry, I wish I knew Jesse and Eric better. I don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This book serves as a reminder that geeks, although treated as outcasts, are needed by nearly all companies and institutions. Other than one chapter where the author, Jon Katz, seems to ramble on about something that, in my opinion, is off topic, the book is very well-written and easy to read. A must-read for all geeks, especially for those who are in or have recently graduated from high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This book was a great read~ I appreciated the insight and time brought forth to this real life journey of two people: which really represents much more in a larger picture.

The one thing I like about this book is how much Jesse and Eric use the internet. One thing I like the most about them using the internet is when Jesse uses Alsa Visa to find out how to tie a tie.

I admire the book's stated intent, and I was excited about the possibility of a book that gave a voice to and empowered the kinds of people I've called friends for most of my life, but in the end (literally and figuratively), Geeks is really just two hundred pages of Katz patting himself on the back. Wait until the part in which Katz almost single-handedly claims credit for healing America's disenfranchised and marginalized youth after the Columbine shootings. I'm absolutely shocked that he didn't try to find a way to work 9/11 in somehow.

As you can tell they both are geeks. I think that they should have made the story back further before Jessie was in the geek club. I think that this book could of used more action in it. It would have been better if there was less swearing but it goes with Jessie's background. I think that this book would be better for teens on up because it is more difficult for some people.

Readers should be apprised that not all geeks are criminal misanthropes who can only get ahead with the assistance of modestly talented, self aggrandizing writers. The individuals and environs depicted herein should not be construed as exemplars of all geeks or geekdom. In fact the inclusion of the word \\"Geeks\\" in the title is an editorial oversight, since this book is about the struggles of two disenfranchised young men, and sheds very little light on how their being geeks makes them different from the thousands of other intelligent, disenfranchised young men and women who are not geeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are bored... read somethings else!","review":"Tbe blunt truth about this book is that it is a poor read.

I learned more looking at the ESRI provided samples and poking around their excellent support forum and sample code web site... Just by tinkering around with ArcGIS in the time it took for the book to arrive, I built sample applications that are way beyond those presented in Razavi's book.The book doesn't really give you enough information to begin to grasp the ArcObjects data model.

He truly was a brilliant mind before his time.The movie is about the period in his life where he was doing all his research for his famous and groundbreaking book \\"In Cold Blood and his growing relationship with the killers of the Clutter family: Perry and Dick.It is a very good movie about a very memorable talented, but strange man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoffman is amazing","review":"I've loved Truman Capote's work since I was in high school, read IN COLD BLOOD when it came out, saw Robert Morse's one-man version TRU -- there's nothing like this film.

This one's a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Disagree With The World","review":"Phillip Seymour Hoffman's characterization is the only and lonely reason to see this film. Art design and some shots are OK, but the music is of the TV drama kind (sorrow represented by lonely piano accords) and the story fall flat right after the beginning. No character is really affected by the events, and I don't believe when they say they did because they're saying so. Probably \\"In Cold Blood\\" is a masterpiece, and if this movie is useful in some way is by prompting you to read that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story!","review":"I wanted to watch \\"Capote\\" primarily because of its Oscar win. It did not take me long to realize why it won best Actor. I would describe the story as both haunting, somewhat bone-chilling, but very believable.Capote's image is beautifully portrayed; he is seen first and foremost, as a homosexual writer, then a complex but very human person.What started out as a desire to write evolves into a story of compassion for the underdog, to the extent that it almost wreaked havoc with the closure of his story, the murder of a farming family.Capote is real, uninhibited, at times sarcastic, but always human.

This film shows the flaws in his character that would grow to mammoth proportions by the end of his life. The problem with this film is that 1) I couldn't understand half of what Hoffman (as Capote) was saying. Hoffman may have his lisping, nasal, girlish speech down pat but that doesn't help the audience. Raising the volume didn't help a bit. The problem was with Capote's poor articulation and low speech intensity. 2) This really isn't very interesting. Story: writer/journalist crosses the line when it comes to ethics and objectivity in order to further his career. What a staggeringly novel concept!! And the story of a murder in Kansas is not international news - it's just a senseless murder in a little town. That Capote lost his objectivity when working on it should bring nothing but a big yawn since it has no historical importance. 3) This movie is dull.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"philip seymour hoffman is flawless...","review":"in every movie he's in. and capote is no exception. i had read about the impetus for capotes book, and thought it rather grim. the idea of befriending murderers and spending four years of ones life with them in effort to write one's magnum opus seems a very, very hefty compromise. it ruined truman. how could it not?i immediately purchased a copy of in cold blood to hear it in truman's own voice. there is evidently another movie about truman's life and the writing of in cold blood that people give impressive nods to which might be worth viewing as well. the cast of capote, the cinematography, all of it a masterpiece even given the grim setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fame's corrupting caress","review":"While \\"Capote\\" structurally is a textbook-ready slice off the old American filmmaking pie -- healthy doses of foreshadowing in chiseled dialogue and little need to read between the lines -- the film's message neatly exposes the rotting underbelly of the American dream. The film, if it tends to take the life of Truman Capote and boil it down to the meaty part of the microscope slide (if you will), is little more than the mundane allegory of the poisoning of power, the Midas touch, but under Phillip Seymour Hoffman's guidance, the writer is given an almost spiritual charm. It's through Hoffman's subtle portrayal of human fragility that you find yourself empathizing with Capote, who, as it turns out, is the true antagonist of the film -- not the misguided killers due for the chopping block."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting look into the mind of an author, but not a great film.","review":"I'll keep this short as alot of reviewers on Amazon are not going to like me for my opinion.This film was interesting at first with a stunning transformation and performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Capote is brilliantly directed with fantastic visuals of the 1950's. But..... I found the film to be a bit too dragged out and very slow paced. PS Hoffman does keep you interested, as he drags you through the very slow pace of the film and slaps out a couple of slightly amusing jokes. However, Capote is a serious film that deals with an even more serious subject, but seems very dull and lifeless and in some parts very boring.I would have liked to see this film done better, with a bit more pace and character as it is a very interesting subject to take on. Hoffman good, film bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"S-L-O-W! The pacing of this film almost put me to sleep and had I not seen it on DVD and had the capability to pause it every so often, I wouldn't have stayed with it. Yes, Phillip Seymour Hoffman did a remarkable job portraying Capote, but in duplicating Capote's distracting, effeminate mannerisms and nasal, mousy voice, it was hard to pay attention to the story of the film. Clifton Collins, who portrayed Perry Smith, one of the killers, did a remarkable job which I thought was more noteworthy than Hoffman's efforts.In short, I wouldn't recommend \\"Capote\\" and I don't understand what all the hype was about.

I felt a need to get up and slap the TV set from having to listen to his indecipherable verbalizations! I could scarcely understand a word he said, frankly!

In my mind, it ranks right up there with the book.

The video offers almost no coverage of the still-wonderful gardens, which have always been the heart of the park.

In the case of Yugoslavia, their agenda was to sell us a war. It is always wise to investigate before consenting to something as drastic as war. In the case of Kosovo, because of the way the media presented the story to the US, Americans thought they had a sure fire righteous cause to bomb. Dr. Parenti, with his careful research and patient laying out of the facts, will wake up \\"sleeping\\" Americans who bought the mass media's story with the actual facts. Readers beware: your conscience will bother you if you cheered America's interference in Kosovo, a land that was traditionally Serbian for hundreds of years before Croatian Catholics and Albanian Muslims moved in. Was it really the fault of the Serbs? Read To Kill a Nation before deciding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill A Nation is EXCEPTIONAL!","review":"This work uses wetern sources to expose the gross misconseptions about the Serbs so widespread in the West.The book outlines why the Serbs were not responsible for the break up of Yugoslavia nor for the conflict in Kosovo, and demonstrates that the Serbs were the real victims of these wars.A breath of fresh air in an otherwise biased western literary community."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Worthless Bit of Propaganda","review":"This is truly a work in hypocrisy. Parenti feels the world media has chosen to cover recent conflict in the Balkans from a one-sided pro-US/EU vantage point. To counter this, however, he writes a weak, one-sided anti-US/EU account which seems to use hyperbole and strong adjectives in the place of facts or real reporting. The arguments are shamelessly simplistic and over the top - this book is unreadable if you have any background in the Balkans. Rather than waste money on this, try a book like Tim Judah's Kosovo: War and Revenge, which is a balanced account. Don't trust Perenti to do your thinking for you - he has an agenda and not many facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"What are we to learn from this book? Not much. We know that moves to stop genocide must be preventive, and mobilization of support for intervention must be accomplished through worst case scenario analysis. After Bosnia, where the same Serbian regime as the one at work in Kosovo committed genocide and murdered 250,000 persons, NATO gets the benefit of the doubt.In Bosnia, no one wanted to intevene. Why then do strategic interests suddenly emerge with respect to the much less important Kosovo? Understand Bosnia, and you find the key to understanding why we had to intervene in Kosovo, and why American leaders were at their wits end with Milosevic.Did we trap the Serbs at Rambouillet? If so, good. For it meant that finally we were not going to be stone-walled by the pathological liars who represented the Serbian regime, who tricked us time and again in Bosnia, and who never negotiated in good faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nod and Bonfire","review":"The most important American notion, besides freedom, is responsibility. We believe that ALL people should be held accountable for their actions, regardless of circumstance or time. Kosovo was proof that in times of crisis, action MUST be taken, and our collective personality of \\"America\\" once again gave us the emotion of guilt, and so we assumed responsibility. It was a conscious choice, and absolutely every single choice has a consequence, and this proved no exception. In times of war, people will die. We could only choose who. The choice will always haunt us. But what to do when our conscience lies?As for Michael Parenti, I have much less eloquent words. Those obsessed with guilt often find ways to share their msiery. I want none of his! That he should feel guilt by choosing to save Kosovo's women children over fawning for a tyrant, speaks unto his soul. A man has passed judgement for making a difficult choice.

AS a film, though, despite Jolson, who was a superstar in his time, it's dated badly, which combined with an overly melodramatic script, manages to make it almost laughable. EVERYONE chews up the scenery here, and the depricating asides about Jews and Blacks are fairly insulting, not to mention several stereotypes. The most pathetic scene? Jolson, in full blackface, looking as theatrically pained as possible, and, clenching his fits in the air, screams \\"The songs of Israel are tearing at my heart!\\" The whole thing is completely surreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic original movie with sound for the first time","review":"This is a clasic movie that was the first to have talking in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid dilemma","review":"The Jazz Singer, generally called the first talkie is still mostly silent, except for a few songs and a rather lengthy, for the time, dialogue sequence. The movie is worth the watch just for the historical value and the songs are pretty fun too.But that isn't all. Al Jolson, once called the greatest entertainer ever, stretches his acting ability to the limit here. Warner Oland is excellent as well as the intolerant but devout father. The dilemma faced by Jakie is incredibly heart rending and Jolson shows this well. Faced with choosing between his own \\"God\\" and his father's God, Jolson portrays a man trapped in a desperate situation. The one scene where Jolson really shines finds him between his mother on one hand and his boss and love interest on the other. The next to last scene is startling and brought tears to my eyes.

As long as the reader is aware that this is by no means the only interpretration of these events, the book is a valuable exercise. Still, some of the quotations could have been reduced.

Sometimes there was a dark screen at the beginning, also it was not possible to start the movie using some of the menu links. At the very end playback became jumpy. All those problems are probably an effect of faulty manufacturing, surface of this DVD doesn't look perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, yet Exciting Film that looks deep into human nature","review":"I have seen this film several times: first-long time ago, then again-on the big screen, and more recently-after \\"Talented Mr. Ripley\\" came out. I liked PM every single time I watched it...the more you watch it, the better it gets. This version of the novel is very dark and breath-taking; it is also more of a criminal drama, than TMr.R. The fact that this film is not about americans does not take away the pleasure from the plot and the cinematography. Alain Delon is marvelous in his debut role as \\"Mr. Ripley\\" (imagine, getting a role like this one for a big debut... Quite a task! ). He is as devious as you can get... \\"Purple Noon\\" is a challenging film, that takes a deep look into human psyche. It is a real masterpeice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original is better!","review":"This is the original film based on Patricia Highsmith's book. I saw it a couple of years ago and in my opinion, it is way better than the new \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley.\\" Although the latter is entertaining and suspenseful, \\"Purple Noon\\" has more charm (maybe because it's in French). I must admit though, that Jude Law was one reason that made \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" worth watching. His performance was good and it made you hate Tom Ripley (Matt Damon)a lot. But in \\"Purple Noon,\\" you wouldn't mind if Dickie Greenleaf (played by Maurice Ronet) died because Tom Ripley (played by Alain Delon) was such a babe! With the intricate plot and superb acting, \\"Purple Noon\\" can actually be compared to a Hitchcock film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting drama, beautiful cinematography! Clément rules...","review":"I saw The Talented Mr. Ripley before seeing Purple Noon, and found the Matt Damon vehicle rather tediously dark.Dark is fine, but there is a self-consciousness about the remake that ruins it, to my way of thinking. The psychological drama is hammered home, rather than understated and left to make a dramatic impact.René Clément's version is incomparably better. Not a tedious moment in the film, and many scenes of incredible beauty. I haven't read the Highsmith novel, but to me Tom Ripley came across as a conflicted bisexual in this movie. There is an understated creepiness about his sexuality here, in comparison to the Matt Damon movie where the homosexuality seems overdone and rather heavy-handed, almost laughable.And of course, this ending cannot be beat. You simply must see it. Concise and perfect"},{"rating":"2","title":"The price is much to low. Should charge more.","review":"I saw this movie in 1961 at the Carnegie Theater below the Hall. It was perfect and I would love to see again but I am too embarrassed to buy it at such a low price.

It provides step by step procedures on how to get started and what to expect. It begins with an introduction to neighbhorhood planning and why it is important. It then goes on to describe a seven step planning process that begins with data collection and ends with implementation. Though somewhat vague, there is information on how to collect and interpret data, how to pinpoint issues, and how to set goals. The descriptions are easy to read and practical for the layman, but the professional planner might find the reading a little to \\"thin\\". The appendix contains a very useful example of a citizen survey and specifics on how to perform a goal setting exercise. Overall, Jones uses easy to understand everyday language to describe what can be a complex and intimidating process. Every neighborhood group should have a copy in their office!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Need of Updating","review":"This book offers good advice to local community groups, but it is in need of a serious update. Although it is targeted to grassroots groups, it is often used by people in planning practice. Given the juvinile content of the book, and the limited consideration of current methodological standards and technology, it could result in a marginalization of citizens groups and practical planning efforts directed at them. Why do so many authors of these types of books think that citizens are stupid? Why do so many authors of these types of books think that freehand drawings are common in the urban planning profession? Why do so many authors of these books give examples of bad survey methodology to citizens? Obviously they don't understand that citizens are smart, and they are capable of presenting cogent proposals to public officials.

The aerobic section is good when the weather is bad or time is of the essence. The strength training section is something I do 2-3 times a week - it is manageable and easy to follow and, believe me, has made a differnce in my body tone. The yoga section is very relaxed and something I enjoy. It is not strenuous but I find it is a nice change of pace to stretch gently and it really calms me down, which helps keep my blood pressure normal. I have exercised since I can remember taking on all forms of it - jogging, aerobic dance, low impact aerobics, ballet (for 18 years), yoga, tennis, etc. This is the first year ever I have taken off from all that - taking a break from all the reoccuring injuries - and I feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CHALLENGING ENOUGH","review":"I have been doing Kathy Smith workouts for over 15 years now, and have several of her videos.

The text focuses on telling Chinas military history; it is very weak on topics like weapons or battle tactics. The drawings by Michael Perry are ok. The maps are primitive and not very useful. This book is the sequel to \\"Imperial Chinese Armies 200BC - 589AD\\" (MAA284).

The storytelling here is so flatly rendered that I'm surprised anyone could get through the entire book. Conn's efforts to liven up the story by paralleling the life of a modern-day lesbian with that of a Paris lesbian in the '20s don't succeed--there was simply a lot of pointless name-dropping about already well-publicized lesbian historical figures. I didn't reach the point of caring about any of the characters because none of them ever came across three-dimensionally. The book was also frustrating to read because of the lack of necessary punctuation, which led to run-on sentences in abundance.

Plans doesn't hold up to Transatlanticism, sad to say. Every song works into each other. Not only is the cd mixed so each ending blends into the beginning of the following track, but the lyrics all follow the same pattern or love and letting go. It has an extremely tight and continuous concept of heartbreak and its melodies are simply amazing. Ben's voice is also very unique and it works well for the tone of this album. Also, the instrumental is an improvement in comparison to previous albums because they changed drummers between The Photo Album and Transatlanticism. All in all, this cd has the most to offer for dcfc. If you like more upbeat and experimental music, try 1 their earlier albums, like \\"We Have The Facts And Were Voting Yes!\\". BUY THIS ALBUM!

The majority of their older stuff never caught me (certain tunes did - \\"Photobooth\\", \\"For What Reason\\") - came across as somewhat amateurish (though perhaps that amateur quality was what made them great to fans). This album is so much more explorative musically, with more obvious emotion (and thumbs up to Chris Walla for production - so crisp and clean). This is quite possibly a concept record based on Gibbard's experience.

First off, though sometimes I wish stereo SACD's had a 5.1 layer, I don't feel like I'm missing anything with this stereo SACD mix. There's so much presence in the recording it really fills the room despite being only stereo. And the louder I play it, the more beautiful the music gets.

I'm in awe.","review":"This is one of the most incredible new albums I've experienced in a long time. I found out about this band at an online radio station, radioparadise(dotcom) and bought this album based on the two tracks I'd heard there. I was pleasantly suprised to find that there isn't a clunker track on the disc.This SACD defies the rule that the better the album, the worse the sound. I recently played this album for friends of mine on a TOP NOTCH (10K) audio system and everyone was floored. They initially thought the name of the band gave them a clue as to the nature of the music. They were wrong. There's nothing \\"cute\\" about this band. The lyrics range from beautiful (passenger's seat) to the incredibly, painfully brutal (tiny vessels) and \\"Lightness\\" is the best track I've heard in at least a year.If you have an SACD player, BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best disc I own","review":"I am a huge Death Cab for Cutie and Postal Service fan. Transatlanticism is their best work. Heart-wrenching lyrics mixed with melancholy melodies are the major appeal of this album.

Everyone can relate to this album in some way and it is definetely my favorite of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, different, intelligent, and melodic.","review":"This is my first listen to DCfC, so I'm reviewing this as a stand-alone CD. When something truly different is released to the listening public I usually respond positively. Sonically this is a very interesting album. Vocals can be understood, while drums pop out with innovative production tones. This album can create a quiet emotional feeling that unleashes when the harder parts kick in. It has a dark minor quality that comes across as deeply poetic. The parts chosen by the band's members are truly complimentary to the song at large and other parts being played. I love how unpredictable this album seems. The melodies have their own rhythmical and unique style, setting the vocal approach into its own category. The lyrics, which can be heard easily, cause the listener deep thought and introspection, and can also be related to; they are not too abstract. I will most certainly continue through the DCfC catalog after several listens to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"recently discovered Deathcab for Cutie","review":"Since my two kids are in college, I stumbled upon Deathcab for Cutie on their IPODS, and only had the album \\"Plans\\".

I like a lot of different kind of music, but this 51 year old Banker is really enjoying Deathcab. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"When I first bought this CD, I didn't love it. I didn't listen to it for months afterward. I piked it up again, a few weeks ago, and I fell in love; every song on the CD is incredible. Death Cab has a fantastic sound, great vocals, great lyrics, and this is their best album, so far.Songs like \\"Lightness,\\" \\"Title and Registration\\" and \\"A lack of Color\\" stand out, especially. But everything on the CD is great. I almost never listen to any of these songs without listening to the entire CD, because it flows so perfectly.Incidentally, the artwork on the cover and inde the booklet is great, as well.What you'd call a \\"must-buy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooring . . .","review":"This band is so mind-bogglingly dull I couldn't get through the first three songs without fast-forwarding.

It is very well produced and the lyrics are OK (if your a teenager). I saw them on Carson Daly late at night and they seemed to play Ok live, but then I noticed their fan base and then it struct me. All of these reviews have to be from MTV teen-boppers. This Cd is not that great.

It honestly can change your life. The lyrics are emotionally-charged, the music is guitar-ripped and beautifully mastered. Ben Gibbard is my hero, and his words are deep and wise. I can't stop listening to this CD even after all this time. It's definately one of my favorites of all time!A few of the songs include \\"The New Year\\" (which is just a great song), \\"Transatlanticism\\" (which is slow but rather poetic), \\"Title & Registration\\" (which is a great song and a great video they have out now), and \\"Passenger Seat\\" (which is sure to get stuck in your head the very first time you hear it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best.....","review":"I personally think this CD is ok...their worst but its alright.

It's unbelievable to figure out all he can with instruments, it's often a simple use of the instruments but the results are outstanding. This album is a little different from the others and is probably going to find a bigger audience since it's more mainstream but it's great! ALl songs on this album are awesome and are the kind of songs that you will place on a movie soundtrack. Also check out \\"The Postal Service\\", which is a side project Ben Gibbard did with Jim Tamborello from DNTEL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is my first Death Cab album, bought after seeing the video for 'sound of settling' on MTV. I was expecting someting fairly pop-y. The actual album is much more sober, smart and profound than I had assumed. New Year is an incredible song. I'll be buying their previous albums soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!!!!","review":"In short I would describe this cd as great, but it goes much deeper then that. Death Cab for Cutie's best album ever by far, will have you singing amazing lines at work, school, or in the car. The catchy beats, lyrics, and sounds will keep you entranced in what seems to be a ride into heaven. If your a DCFC fan or are just looking for a great cd, \\"Transatlanticism\\" is what you have been searching for. This cd will remain in your cd player for long stretches of time.

Yes, I know how touching Ben Gibbard's lyrics can be and the words are huge improvement on that of those on the Postal Service CD. But there is more to music then the poetry a vocalist sings it is also about instrumentation. \\"So This is the New Year, and I don't feel any different.\\" What a great way to start of an album, if only it didn't sound as though it belonged on the new Blink-182 record. The heavy distortion and high pitched (even for Ben) vocals through me off guard.

The main story is the love affair between Ralf Fiennes and Julianne Moore which inextricably develops during a meeting at a dinner party. Each of the charachters seems to be familiar as they are never fully developed in the movie - the angry writer, the reserved diplomat, the amoral yet ultimately devout object of their affection. No new ground is covered here except for some of the explicit sexual imagery, which while pandering to the audience detracts from the seriousness of the movie and subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film....two illicit lovers in wartime London","review":"Watching The End of the Affair, a 1951 novel composed by Graham Greene, provided a unique new perspective of World War II England. The book presents the relationships of two illicit lovers, and a jealous husband. Using these characters to depict life during World War II England, Graham Greene is able to demonstrate what an emotion-filled era this was. Filled with strong characters and vivid descriptions, this film was enjoyable because it gives new insight into an era of history that I find fascinating, Europe throughout World War II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring romance with a twist ending.","review":"Ralph Fiennes once again suffers in doomed passion - as he didin THE ENGLISH PATIENT. This time he's thrown over for a reason thatmight have been a shocker in the fifties but comes as an unconvincing spiritual conviction at the turn of the milennium. The Cinematography was Oscar nominated as was Julianne Moore's leading performance - neither deserved in my estimation. The film is rather leaden and tacky looking - one wonders why anyone thought it would be interesting to today's audiences. The one overlooked gem is Stephen Rea's supporting performance - he does a wonderful job making a bore actually appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Disappointment","review":"I honestly can't believe I sat through this whole movie and for anyone who hasn't seen it- DON'T! This is nothing like The English Patient romance that I thought it would be. There is no chemistry at all between the two leads- Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore. In fact, there seems to be no emotion at all- certainly no love or jealousy as the dialogue would suggest. Instead, this is simply an excuse to put pornography on movie screens. The graphic sex in this movie is absolutely disgusting, not to mention the purposeless nudity. The entire movie is just really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"close your eyes!","review":"Way too much nudity. Julliane Moore is a big star these days, what with Hannibal and all, but all I can think of when I hear or see her is this movie, and I'm completely turned off.

I could hardly wait for the next appearance of the excessively courteous private dick because he was such a relief from the one-note monotony of the Fiennes-Moore love affair. And somebody's gotta explain to me the husband's bewildering actions and motivations throughout the film.

Ralph Fiennes in a WWII love story. This should have been a good movie. It was neither a love story nor a good movie. The plot was hard to follow. It was a movie about nothing.

Julianne Moore and Stephen Rea are very good. However, Ralph Fines is strangely wooden throughout. As an adaptation of one of Graham Greene's finest novels (and one of his \\"Catholic\\" novels), this movie largely misses the point.

This screenplay is so far from the original novel that Neil Jordan should be shamefaced in even admitting it is based on it. The only saving grace of the film is Julianne MOore who is excellent, but in every other respect and for the real story and depth behind the betrayal felt by Bendrix then the book must be the only choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if You Really Love Graham Greene ....","review":"I love Graham Greene, and, since college, have probably read End Of The Affair a dozen times.

It does the job, but it doesnt have the \\"wow\\" factor. It does clean up easily, but it also traps dirt, making it get dirty easier too. It sticks to carpet, but because it is a soft material it moves easily. My pets are always piling corners of the rug or even moving it in the middle so it becomes a mess on the stairs. It is probably best to use it occasionally for protecting carpet when you know it will get dirty, then clean it immediately, instead of leaving it on regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stickly a temporary capet saver","review":"This is by no means a \\"carpet\\" it's a piece of microfiber that sticks to the steps.

This DVD is a wonderful sample of a typical Sunday Mass at Our Lady of the Atonement Church, glorious liturgy, wonderful music and superb preaching. These scattered parishes include the finest elements of Anglican and Roman Catholic worship in one beautiful and moving worship experience, and this DVD is a perfect record of Solemn High Mass celebrated with dignity and majesty, a perfect gift for any musician in the Roman Catholic Church. The only negative aspect to this DVD is that after watching and feeling a part of this sublime worship (the Rolls-Royce of liturgical celebration) many musicians will have to get back into their Chevrolets on Saturday night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out dated and horribly opinionated","review":"This book is outdated and does not really have factual information in it.

Sure, it covers the basics of qualitative research, but that is only good if you can actually force yourself to continue reading. Many of the students in my class did not understand some of the concepts in the book because they weren't explained well, so when I became the T. A. for the class that utilized this text book, I thought writing out vocabulary words and definitions would be helpful for the students. This small thing made a world of a difference! My problem with this book is that it presents many concepts that are difficult to completely grasp for those who are new to qualitative research, but it does not come with a glossary! How are the authors going to make it a point to highlight certain important words and not define them?! Many of these words are hardly explained in the text and not easily found online (unless you trust wikipedia) so a glossary would have helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pages!","review":"After highlighting in the book, thus cannot return, I noticed that the book is missing pages 99 through 130!

It doesn't make sense anymore to give those mathematical details as you can hardly follow them due to the errors.For example, on page 5 it prints:If (2^n - 1) is a prime number then 2^(n-1)*(2^(n-1)-1) is a perfect number and that even perfect numbers must have this form.it obveriously should be 2^(n-1)*(2^n - 1) instead of what has been printed.

The teapot is about big enough for one nicely sized cup of tea, and the accompanying tea cup is about 10 ounces, and retains heat very well. It doesn't take up too much counter space, and looks pretty nice on display. The clean, white porcelain matches almost anything remarkably well.The only true complaints I have about this tea pot is the lack of an infusion basket or strainer on the spout (and the opening being at the top of the pot being too small to get a separate basket or tea ball), and the cusp tends to catch loose leaf tea, which can make it a pain to clean at times. The tea pot also drips, though it is a fairly small amount. All in all, this is a good teapot for the price, and great for that big cup of tea in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute teapot, wish it was slightly bigger","review":"This is an extremely cute and functional teapot.

This is a concise history that is lavishly illustrated with photos, artwork, and pretty good maps. It balances military detail of the battle sequences with background details about the major players, soldiers' lives, weapons, etc. As a popular introduction, it has its share of anecdotes, some fanciful, but that wasn't a major distraction for me. It would be a decent introduction to the battle for someone with modest familiarity with the Civil War, but I would not give it to the average teenager, as suggested by another reviewer. I also thought that the treatment of Longstreet was not overly negative; read D. S. Freeman if you'd like to see a really negative treatment. I have read 6 other books on Gettysburg so far and was happy to make this the 7th."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Lost Cause Perspective....","review":"A fine addition to the many volumes on Gettysburg. Great photos, text. This is a fine addition to anyone's Civil War library with one glaring exception. Mr. Symonds's reasoning on why the Confederates lost the battle, laying the entire blame on James Longstreet is nothing more than a perpetuation of the Lost Cause/Myth and Legend interpretation of the Battle of Gettysburg. Nearly a word for word reiteration of Jubal Early's completely fabricated version of the events surrounding the Gettysburg campaign. The discerning historian will want to seek other volumes, other \\"versions\\" to obtain a more objective and accurate story. For those reading about the battle for the first time, I would not recommend this book. Again, a fine collection of photography from the period but the author needs to read a little more on what actually happened from primary sources and not base his text on what transpired in the 1870's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photo imagery with lousy historiography","review":"Too bad the publisher could not have included text that would do justice to this volume's photo imagery. That is why for appearance and artistic design, the book rates 5 stars; however, for accuracy of historical text, Mr Symonds rates negative stars. The author advances so many myths (just two of the many horrendous myths advanced Mr Symonds are: 1) Longstreet is to blame for July 2 and; 2) Richard Ewell was given discretionary orders by Lee to pursue on July 1. Both are pieces of fiction that all too often repeated as fact) that the reader must simply consult many, more reliable texts on the battle.Need a coffeetable book to get someone's attention on Gettysburg? This will do it. Need a book to learn the facts about the battle? Don't open this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettysburg","review":"I read this before my 3rd trip to Gettysburg.

Is it about a free trip to Portugal for Malkovich and Deneuve. This strange film has more story in the printed on-screen epilog than in the 90 preceding minutes. Talky and long static shots. If you look up \\"PRETENTIOUS\\" in the dictionary, there should be an image of this film's poster for a definition. It would be REALLY interesting to know the circumstances of how this movie got made. Maybe it was blackmail. Or everyone was kidnapped and it was shot under some kind of death threat. I can't imagine Malkovich and Deneuve read the script and agreed because of the story and I can't imagine they got big bucks because it looks like it was shot on no budget. Maybe Satan made them do it. But he already has a bad name. The only Faustian thing about this movie is that it's hell to sit through.

Turns out the most interesting thing about this movie is how and why it was ever made.....now, THERE'S a theme for a movie!On the other hand, if you suffer from sleepness nights this will save you a doctor's prescription and a glass of pills, so it might come to use...You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie doesn't deserve ANY stars","review":"I do love a good art film, but man, this one missed the mark, the ball park and any point it might be trying to make. The music was insanely bad, storytelling missing entirely (oh yeah, there is no story), the lighting was atrocious and absolutely nothing interesting happens. The characters are flat, completely unsubstantial and entirely confusing.

This film is not for you, as it follows from previous reviews, you'll be very disappointed.But if you wander around seeking a real pleasure for eye and mind - you've found it.

I have tried these on 3, 7 hour flights and the noise cacellation is minimal at best. I compared them to foam ear plugs and the foam plugs are clearly better. I also compared them to a colleague's Bose head phones. No comparison!!!! The Bose set provided a drastic reduction in noise, blowing these Phillips headphones away. My in ear channel ear buds also worked better at reducing noise than the Phillips. I would not purchase these Phillips headphones with my current knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic head straps break too easily","review":"I was happy with the electronics on these headphones and bought 2 of them.

Now I'm shopping for something with a sturdier design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Cancel Sound","review":"All outside noise is still audible - conversations, power tools, vacuum, everything!The only way to cancel out ambient sound it to turn the volume up.

I've owned a few headphones in the $[...] range and decided to pick these up with high hopes. I was very excited to open the package and test out these babies.However, within an instant I noticed the very poor sound quality. Compared to my $[...] Koss pair, that is broken due to poor construction and cheap plastic, these sounded like utter crap. It was actually hard listening to music with the HN 110 on. Like a few others have said, the bass sucks, and there is no clarity or crispness in the vocals at all. I wish I could return it and just buy a $[...] pair of good sounding phones.I can't say I am an audiophile or anything, but even a child can tell the difference between the sound quality of these headphones and real good sounding ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones hurt!","review":"The headphones were at a cheap price so I decided to purchase being completely ignorant to what a good pair of headphones really were. I have a rather wide head so the headphones really hurt after say, 20 minutes. I read that nothing is truly \\"noise canceling\\" but it does the job. After purchasing these, I gave them away and bought the Bose QC2 which is a much better product than this. Of course, it cost 3x more too but was worth it. I love the feel of it on my \\"wide\\" head.If you have a thin head and just want to get the job done, buy these.If you are picky, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For small heads/ears only","review":"If you are a male with an average or larger sized head and ears you will not be happy with this headset. The cups are too small. There is no way my ears entirely fit into the cups so they put very uncomfortable pressure on either the front or back, top or bottom of my ears, depending on how they are positioned. I can't wear these more than a few minutes before the discomfort turns to pain. Otherwise I have no problem with any aspect of the product. The sound cancellation is equal or better than other headsets I have tried. Great product and a great price, but only for those with smaller than average head or ear size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really uncomfortable","review":"While the headphones work well with good quality and the noise canceling feature is nice, none of that matters since these headphones are ridiculously uncomfortable.

The main reason I bought this was to listen to music for long periods of time without the discomfort. Look, technically I'm sure its great and it got rating out the wazooo but the small things add up. The ear pieces are too tight around my ears and the headband (whatever the top connecting piece is called hurts the top of my head). When i loosen or extend the headband, the earpieces end up hang off my ears and apply pressure to my lower jawline which is not comfortable. Even hanging the headphones around my neck feels like a small child trying to choke you from behind..... very odd sensation but its feels like that.Noise cancelling .... its ok.I read most of these reviews and wanted to experience this item for myself, and found out this one sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips HN 110 Noise-Canceling Headphones","review":"Disappointed with Philips.

I wasn't looking for the best sound quality, just looking for \\"good enough\\" sound quality. On that score, these were fine. What I really wanted was very good noise-cancellation. I work from home (and sometimes at the library), and while these places *should* be quiet, that isn't always the case. One of the 5-star reviewers suggested the noise-cancellation of these headphones was close to that accomplished by a Bose. Well, that just isn't the case. I've compared the two (courtesy of a friend), and the difference is night and day. For $30 I wasn't expecting the same-level of NC, but when I flip the switch, it seems to do almost nothing. Yes, there is a difference (hence the battery is in and working), but the result is underwhelming. It manages to cancel only very low, already near-quiet hums, but that's it.If you want noise-cancellation, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not cancel noise at all","review":"This is fair to say that this headphone does not cancel noise at all. Most of the other over head headphones work similarly good as this. Moreover, the sound quality is not good at all. I ended up returning it. Thankfully the return and refund process was easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre headphones, bad noise cancellation","review":"This headphone is very unconfortable, I decided I didn't want to spend 300 for a Bose QC 15, but just like life you get what you pay for. Active noise cancellation is all but non-existent (it works a little because of the ear enclosure), it hurts to use over 30 min, and sound quality is worse than a pair of free sony headphones I got with an old discman. Either spend the money and get something good, or just buy a regular pair of headphones for less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really uncomfortable","review":"These headphones feel like a vice grip trying to crush your head. My ears and the side of my face are in pain after wearing these for an hour. Unless your head is only 2-3 inches wide, these are likely to cause a lot of discomfort. Otherwise they seem fine, and I'd keep them if there weren't so darn uncomfortable, but man are they bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nearly as good as i thought it was gonna be","review":"Ok so i was wasn't expecting this product to be anything near as good as say a Bose headset but it was hardly better than my normal (non-noise reducing) headphones.

The ear shape is odd and ill fitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work AT ALL!","review":"I ordered these a few days ago. I received them today and I've already returned them to Amazon. These didn't cancel a single bit the noise that you'd actually wanted to cancel out.For instance, with the headphones I couldn't hear myself typing on my keyboard, but I could still hear noises outside (while I was upstairs on the 3rd floor) just as clearly as ever. The noise canceling effect is the same as when your ears are clogged on an airplane. You can still hear everything, it's just slightly (very slightly) muffled. I actually canceled out more noise just by putting my fingers in my ears.BTW, I'm not totally unreasonable as to think that a product like this could cancel out ALL noise, but the fact that these headphones cancel out NO noise is unacceptable.Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Pretty good product for the price. The sound canceling is not that amazing and when the batteries go low it messes with the sound (but that is easily fixable and isn't a problem). Basically these are good headphones, have good sound, have decent sound canceling, are relatively comfortable, and are very convenient. Good seller and came as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Good Product","review":"I have purchased other noise-canceling headphones before, so I have some experience with a similar product. However, this pair of headphones actually encloses the ears rather than simply covering the ears.Overall I am pleased with the headphones, though the tightness of the headphones against the skin around the ears is a bit much after a few hours. The intention I guess is to isolate the ears, and it does a good job at that.The sound quality is excellent, with great bass and overall a good listening experience.In low light it is hard to find the on and off switch for the headphones, but the switch is designed so it is hard to accidentally switch on and drain the battery.For the price this is a great value and my wife field tested them on a flight to Europe and reports they did a good job of making the jet cabin noise bearable during her flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound and noise canceling was okay, but the build was poor","review":"Well, this head phone is not very durable as mine broke in a mid-range stress brought by my everyday-bag-handling when its stored away (yes, that's just to-and-from commute, I haven't even brought it to hiking--or maybe I just have a really large cranium because of my ever expanding brain, that's why the headphone broke).Comfort is another thing; the ear mounts are too narrow it gives me pain on the back of my ears in a few hours. The arc connecting the left and right phone is also a pain on the top of my head; it has little padding, but that's not enough for comfort in hours of listening.On the upside (which I intentionally put last), it's cheap, it sounds okay, and I can definitely notice the noise canceling, even if it's not that significant."},{"rating":"1","title":"No noise reduction!","review":"I purchased this item in anticipation of a plane trip to Europe, hoping to be able to enjoy movies.

They sound very nice, fit well on my big head, and don't bother my ears, thought they are large. (my ears, not he headphones:).The sound reproduction is pretty darn great. I use them with my sound system as well as with several different MP3 players. I live next to a fire station, the whistle gets quite annoying most of the time and these provide some relief from that annoyance.They will NOT make all outside noise go away, mainly they quiet down things like railroads and highway noise, both of which I get in abundance living where I do!I don't use them a whole lot because usually I don't think of it.I've had them for a few years and have not noticed any of the breaking parts others mentioned yet. I hope they don't break because I really like them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Comfort","review":"There is really no way to tell from the picture but these headphones are too small for human ears. Neither fits on or over the ears. They are certainly tall enough but not wide enough. No humans have this ear profile.

Could be OK for people using occasionally on short occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips Noise Canceling Headphones","review":"I have had these headphones for about 7 months and have used them on at least 3 trips to and from Europe. Overall, I have been very pleased with the performance of these headphones. They are reasonably comfortable and do reduce cabin noise during flight.

A good value at the time for around $35.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price","review":"I really think that all noise canceling headphones should be renamed noise reduction headphones. This is very much the case with the HN 110. Most of the mid range is noticeably reduced as well the higher bass frequencies. But for higher frequencies, the noise reduction isn't very strong.The sound quality is pretty good for the price. One odd little thing about the quality is that it's at its best with the noise reduction on. If it's off, the sound doesn't seem as full and a bit flat.The fit of the headphones are pretty good.

Great. I could still hear my coworkers ringtones, but well, they're not suppose to cancel the high frequency sounds. Sorry, they won't be a cure for the crying baby on a 9 hours flight!I plugged them in my computer and turned the music sound : crisp, good quality. I was delighted.BUT, one hour later, they were not comfortable anymore. In fact, they were awfully PAINFUL.I returned them right after work...!I stopped wearing them 7 hours ago, I my head still hurts!Philips shouldn't even sell them. The designer or the cost-cutter who decided no to pad those two sections did a really bad mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Built and Now Unusable","review":"Length:: 0:18 MinsI bought these headphones for travel from Target about 9 months ago. Like the other reviews, sound quaility has been okay. The problem is that about 2 months after purchasing, they started falling apart.First the side plastic pieces, then internally in the connection to the headband so they were only connected by the leather. I struggled through using them for that period.Now thin metal connectors are popping out of the leather that poke into your head. THEY ARE NOW ABSOLUTELY USELESS.They came with a fake leather travel bag that they have always traveled in. They travel in my computer bag with all other gear.Look at the video - I would highly recommend you find something else and not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"I bought the headphones to wear on jet flights.

These -seemed- like a good deal but the fit on these leaves something to be desired. The Philips look like an \\"over the ear\\" design but the ear cups are actually too small (and I have small ears). The build quality is decent but the noise reduction is only so-so and noticably inferior compared to the Sony version (granted, these cost a lot less).Long story short, spend the extra money on the Sonys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet deal","review":"A good deal for the price, and work as specified. The noise cancellation feature is definitely noticeable, although the on/off switch for said feature is inconveniently placed, and a little difficult to manage while wearing.

I Must Have Big Ears","review":"Actually, I had never given any thought at all to the size of my ears -- until, that is, I got these headphones. And the big headache that goes along with them when I use them.The earpads are simply too small and the head band too tight for comfort. No luck when I tried bending the band to enlarge it.The noise-reduction switch does seem to work well -- otherwise, these headphones would have rated one star.I've now bought a different brand. I cannot recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I got these headphones for a trip to Europe. I figured, hey, what better way to sleep on a noisy plane than with noise-cancelling headphones?! I did some research and learned that the technology is great for droning noises (like and airplane engine), so I figured I'd be set. Sadly, these didn't perform very well. I couldn't tell the difference between them being off or turned on in terms of noise cancelling ability. While listening to music through them, it sounded distant and wasn't of the best quality. From now on, I'll just stick to my ear buds and ear plugs instead. I mean, I *could* purchase some $300 noise cancelling headphones, but for the odd flight, I don't think it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Kidding, Right?","review":"I got these headphones for an overseas trip with hopes that they would cancel out most of the noise on the plane and allow me to clearly hear music. The noise cancelling is a joke. My non-noise cancelling Audio Technica M50's (incredible headphones) do more or equal noise cancelling just from their ear cups. On these Philips headphones there is really no \\"Active\\" noise cancelling as the product states. They really rely on passive noise cancelling, which is FAR from that of Bose or its decent competitors, which this is not.At $50 they make a decent pair of standard headphones, which is what they are, but you could definitely find something better for the same price. I have to say, these are a disappointment after hearing Bose's QC15 and thinking that these would even come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise cancelling stopped working after 6 months","review":"Noise cancelling stopped working after 6 months.

I use them with my ipod, iphone and my yamaha keyboard. They folded up nicely and I could travel with them. They were great when I wanted to listen to music on my computer and shut the outside world down. The only thing is, the bracket that goes over your head broke (just like my friend's pair did).

I surely long for the Bose QC 15, but that costs a lot of pretty pennies and this didn't. It blocks out enough of the airplane noise to be useful, although it's not very comfortable to wear for more than a few hours. I have to let my ears breath every couple hours for comfort.

I have been using them with my PC at work (the primary purpose I bought them for), with my iPod Shuffle and on a plane with the iPod and also just to reduce the noise from the plane's engine.I am not an audiophile, but these sound great! I had a comparable model of over-the-ear Philips headphones about 10 years ago that lasted a long time and also sounded great, and was very fond of. I got these because I wanted something similar again. At about $30 these are really inexpensive and great value for the money.I read a lot of reviews before settling on this particular pair. I was forewarned not to expect too much from the noise canceling feature. Those reviews were right. Although there is a slight reduction in the noise level once the noise cancellation is enabled it is nothing you cannot do without. Nevertheless, its nice to have. They reduced noise sufficiently to let me sleep on the plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good value","review":"I mistakenly purchased these because when they arrived I realized that they appeared to be exactly the same as an old pair of Philips headphones I had.

The noise canceling properties are negligible. I'd venture to say that most of it probably comes from the ear pads. They literally sound the same with the noise canceling on or off.

But I was pretty disappointed with HN110. I couldn't notice any difference in the background noise level with the noise cancelling feature turned on/off. Plus when I plugged in my ipod, I had to crank up the volume all the way just to hear the music. Maybe the headphones were cancelling out the music. I might have missed it, but my HN100's had a volume control dial as well, but I didn't see it on the HN110.Based on other reviews, it seems they worked out well for others, thats why I purchased them.

Switching on and off did make it sound a little different, but otherwise did nothing.So I went back to using earbuds under plain ear protection (ear muffs). I added a star, since the return was an easy process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Cheap Workmanship","review":"The sound quality of these phones is not bad, good range with live tones and acceptable bass. The noise canceling abilities are very marginal however. Where these really fall down compared to the Bose is the absolute lack of quality materials. I have exchanged two pairs and am on my third because the cheap plastic used on the pieces that attach the actual headphones to the headband. With normal daily use (I'm a designer who listens to music while I work) all three pairs developed cracks in a month or two. The third pair's left ear piece broke completely off after about 8 months. Some might say that's reasonable but I don't think that's worth the $50 I paid. I will be mailing these to Philips and see what they will do for me.

I don't think these could be effective at all onboard an airplane, which is where I would have used them the most.Here's my good old pair of headphones:Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B Active Noise-Cancelling Closed-Back HeadphonesI think I'm going to shell out the money for another pair of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope...","review":"I bought these in the store for about $60 and returned them as soon as I could.

Of couarse the head phones are not as good as the bose, but for the lower price I firmly belive they are the best you can get. I also love the comfortable cushioning that completely surrounds my ear.

They would distort at a relatively low level. I would highly recommend another headphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, great price","review":"These headphones were really a great gift to my wife. Since she travels alot for business I thought this was a fine gift and sure enough she loves them. Very comfotable around the ears, sound great in an ipod and best of all at the touch of a button you have noise canceled out around you. I will get a pair for myself next. Another great feature I liked is that they fold up nicely into a nice pouch that comes with the headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phillips Noise Cancelling Headphones","review":"I like these better than the Sony noise cancelling headphones I already have. I think these block more noise mainly because they cover the entire ear, unlike the Sony's. The pictures of these headphones belie the fact that they actually fold up pretty small. There's a hinge which folds the two earphones up towards the headband, making the whole package very compact. I was on the fence between these and the JVC headphones but I'm glad I chose these. They were very comfortable on our 8 hour flight and the battery life was very good. Overall I'd recommend them as a nice cheap pair of Noise Cancelling headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"noise canceling great for dorms","review":"when i first bought these headphones i thought they would be great for those nights in college when i actually had to get something done, and i could avoid distractions. So i sat in my room and just put the noise canceling feature on, and i thought it didnt work. I was very dissapointed. But then i figured out that it only works if i have other music playing in the headphones. (so i should have figured that out before)they have a great sound, they arent too big, and they fold up to a semi decent size, and my roommate doesnt complain that she can hear my music. They have worked well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips Noise cancelling - Buy Jabra instead","review":"I live on airplines. Platinum for life on American. Noise cancelling headphones are the best way for me to get deep sleep, besides the shades. Surest way to minimize the effect of jet-lag.Being the cheap guy that I am, I did not want to pay $300 for the Bose. I bought Jabras. 60 odd bucks. Loved 'em. Ofcourse you get what you pay for, cheap plastic and within a year the plastic started cracking.Needed a replacement and I bought these Philips. Complete and total waste of $70.

The cupped earpieces muffle quite enough sound on their own and when you turn on the \\"noise-canceling\\" there is a marked difference in the reduction of sound from outside the headphones. They fit nicely and are comfortable. Living in a small apartment on a busy main street, with a husband who likes the TV loud, I am able to tune out the racket so much more efficiently. That makes me a happy camper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tap ... Tap ... Are these things ON?","review":"My wife and I have very, very different tastes in music. When we visit out-of-state relatives I do the driving. I'd like to listen to some of my CDs on the trip, but her Ipod's ear buds let too much sound in -- she can't enjoy her music unless I turn mine all the way down.I got these headphones to help her block out my music so she can hear hers. That would be a \\"Win-Win\\" situation. I haven't tried these headphones in this situation yet, but I did try them myself, in the house. I can honestly say that I cannot tell any difference whatsoever in extraneous noise whether the noise canceling circuit is on or off.On the plus side, the padded ear cups do block much of the outside noise, and they aren't nearly as bulky as the Koss Pro4AAT headphones I use in the living room, so they may still be enough, but I'm very disappointed with the lack of any active noise canceling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips HN 110 Noise Canceling Headphones","review":"Does the job very well and, based on my limited research, the best cost/performance ratio on the market.

They literally fell apart. They're fine for light use, but if you travel a lot then I recommend you spend the money for a sturdier pair with a hard carrying case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones!","review":"I bought these for use on airplanes, and they do a pretty good job. They are very comfortable with good thick cushions on the ears. And the way they fold up is both really cool to look at as well as well-designed; folded they hardly take up any space at all. They're maybe the size of an apple or orange.I did try the noise-cancelling option and in all honesty I couldn't tell a difference at all. To me, most of the noise-cancelling comes from the phones surrounding your ears. Some noticed a background buzzing noise but I didn't hear anything; I even tried them in a quiet place just to see. Maybe my noise-cancelling just doesn't work (though the light comes on). But even without that feature having a huge impact, these are really good headphones. The only thing I'd add is a way to increase the volume on the headphones themselves independently of whatever they're plugged into, but other than that, I don't regret my choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"First of I need to disclose that I got these from Amazon on sale for $28.52.So understand when I say this is the best VALUE for your money. Are they better than the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones? No they're not but they're also not $300.The sound quality for me is good enough that if there was something better I probably could not distinguish the difference. I play mostly P2P downloaded mp3s on my iPod they aren't of the highest quality to begin with. They fit comfortably without any issues whatsover, the fact that they can be folded is a bonus. I highly recommend these for people not angry at their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Folding is the only nice feature","review":"I liked the full-size Philips noise canceling headphones. When those broke, being stuffed into my laptop bag once too much, I decided to go with the folding model. Unfortunately, the bargain price delivers a cheap product. The noise cancellation is bad, the fit uncomfortable and I preferred to take them off on my 12+ hour airplane journey than endure the discomfort. I would spend the extra $$ for the full size Philips that I found more comfortable than the Bose QC3's I had bought earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low cost option for noise cancellation","review":"I purchased these headphones as a low-cost alternative to the overpriced Bose, and am fairly happy with the performance. Audio is decent, as is comfort. The fold-up design makes them a little less bulky, but not much, and they are a little heavy, which means you'll feel them after an hour or so, or sooner with glasses. Noise suppression was modest - while it did cut the jet engine background noise, but the crying baby or loud conversation 3 rows back still gets thru. But for the price, can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine product","review":"For the price, this product is excellent. Since I've never owned a really expensive set of noise-canceling headphones, I don't know how to compare it to them. Some sound does come through but from what I've read, that's to be expected. I'm very pleased with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best noise cancelling headphone","review":"Not the best noise canceling headphones, but if you are looking for something cheap (n not willing to pay over $200) they are quite nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"i returned them immediately","review":"these headphones cannot be worn for more than a short while before they cause extreme discomfort on the side of the ears. the band presses them tightly on the sides of my head and made it painful to wearm them for extended periods.also, the noise cancelling switch is located in an awkward position behind the ears, and is difficult to switch once you ge them on your head. also, they quicxkly began making crackling noises in the music. lastly, i bought them at best buy at they cost full retail, which is rape. i reccomend somethingg liek the sennheiser pxc 300's. they are a bit more expensive but very comfortable and have excellent sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like Bose","review":"I see some have posted reviews claiming this product \\"is nearly as good on noise reduction\\" or \\"wholly equal\\" or \\"as comfortable\\" as any of the Bose QuietComfort products.Apparently those reviewers were trying to be comical. We give them that benefit of our doubt (assuming comedic intent, instead of delusional thinking).I have several of the Bose QC products, and also now have used this Philips product for a week.This product is not comfortable. The noise reduction is hardly noticeable for sound frequencies it is supposed to reduce. The ear cups are too small to fit around most ears. The pads are too stiff. This product is kinda pricey because there are competitors priced $10 less that are its equal. The real reason this Philips headset is more is that the overall mechanical design is too complex, not designed for low-cost manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"I'm not sure what went wrong between my first and second pair of these, it may be where they are made. This set, the right earpiece doesn't reduce sound as much as the left. And, both don't reduce noise in the crucial middle frequencies as they should. I'm quite disappointed in the performance of these. Also, for some inexplicable reason, they wrapped the cord into an impossibly tight roll when packaging so now I have a cord that is always getting tangled and kinked. Stay away from these. However I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because when I turn off the noise cancelling they are a decently good sounding and comfortable pair of ordinary headphones for listening to audiobooks when I'm at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"philips redesigned these","review":"philips remade these and they seem to look alot better and more durable.i dont own them but i do know that they are different now and actualy look 100% better.best buy has the new model if anyone is interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise CANCELING???","review":"Just received the Noise Canceling head phones. I was listening to our TV in the front room. I then put on the head phones a slight drop in volume about 1 or 2 percent was evident with switch on or off no big difference. I could hear the TV with or without the head phones covering my ears. The information submitted with the headphones state a 75 percent reduction in back ground noise.So I'll take them on a plane trip and see if the background in flight noise gets filtered out.At this time I am quite critical about the fact the noise cancelation feature will not wok as intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great when you have a crying child next to you on the plane","review":"The noise-cancelling feature really works. I used them on a transatlantic flight, and they block out a lot of surrounding noise, which is great when you are watching the in-flight movie. They fold up so they are compact to carry, and they come with a leather pouch. The sound quality is good and they fit well on my ears. I would recommend them to anyone who flies frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money - Doesn't Cancel Noise Well","review":"I recently purchased this Philips Noise Canceling Headset, and paid $70 for it at Best Buy.This headset is NOT worth $70. It contains little or no foam padding, allowing large amounts of high-frequency noise to pass through. And in a quiet environment with no low-frequency noise (which is what the canceler is actually designed to cancel) there's actually a hissing noise, which is probably the result of impedance caused by poorly-designed electronics.I will admit, it does nicely block automobile engine noise and outside music while listening to another audio source (with the help of a small preamp, it sounds like).However, if you want something that effectively cancels noise, go with another brand. And I STRONGLY urge you to try on different types of noise-canceling headphones in a relatively noisy environment before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"I liked these at first. They were pretty comfortable and had decent noise cancelling. Then about 3-4 months after I bought them, a piece of plastic on the left side cracked off one day and that side of the headphones was no longer adjustable and didn't fit right. I superglued it back together and it worked okay. A month later, both metal loops that go over the top of the head snapped off at the base. They were still held to the phones by the leather, but were totally uncomfortable to wear. Random pieces of plastic started dropping off randomly. I use these headphones at WORK. That means they sit at my desk when not wearing them in front of my computer. I couldn't use them more gently, they just totally fell apart within six months of purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"I had read several reviews, and I thought this product was the solution to my noisy office (air planes buzzing overhead, officemates chattering away, construction going on outside, etc.). I was so excited to have a device to turn my crappy office into my own personal place of tranquility. Boy was I wrong. The product did not reduce ANY noise. They functioned like an expensive set of headphones with no noise-cancelling abilities. I sent them back. My ear plugs did a better job than these headphones. Not sure if I got a defective product. Regardless, the thing didn't work for what I needed. I'm thinking ear plugs and ear muffs might do the trick at a fraction of the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I was expecting...","review":"Don't waste your money on these headphones as a noise canceling device! They don't do the job, really poor nioise canceling power. The size of the muffle is too small so it doesn't cover your ears, it's not so big as it looks from the pictures. If you need just a regular set of headphones then yes they do have somewhat of a nice design, but as far as you turn the noise canceling option on it actually makes the noise even bigger in your ears, especially the speach.

But for the longest time, I wanted a Ryoko to finish the trio.On February 3rd, I found this item and immediately felt eight years younger! As a Tenchi fan, she is a must have.As for the toy itself, Ryoko is VERY durable and can handle almost any pose. The only downside is that her hair is made of hard plastic, and is heavier than the rest of her. Being so top-heavy, she can't even stand or hold a pose without assistance. Still, the doll is very faithful to the character's appearance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orgasmic!","review":"I've had this book since my teenage years and it's the one book I go back to time and time again.

A few of the actors are OK, but Judi Dench reveals she has no aptitude whatever for comedy -just a phony seriousness that some take for acting. I know being compared with Edith Evans is tough but even high school productions often do better with Lady B. As has been noted, the pace alone kills this performance, but it is also true that most of the lines are delivered so as to wring any humor out of them.

Charlie Mole's score.This film is classic turn of the Century British dialogue, plot and humor.The music is 20th century American jazz that wasn't even composed in thetimeframe of the play.

And throughout the film I cringe when classic 1920'sAmerican Harlem Jazz intrudes RUDELY to disrupt Wilde's brilliant PROPER BRITISH 19th century dialogue.

In fact, I was very tempted at several points during the movie to walk out. Where to begin? Witherspoon is too old for the character. More important, anyone who thinks their dialogue is better than Wilde's should simply have written their own entire script. Some of the best lines of this play were cut completely, in most scenes, the timing was wrong. Trying to expand the backdrops for scenes was also, imo, a huge mistake (ie, instead of sticking to the interiors of the play, the boys go to a 'gentleman's club' & Gwendolyn goes to a tattoo parlour, for heaven's sake!)Bad. The whole thing was bad, the timing was *much* too slow, etc., etc.,etc. Even Dame Judi couldn't save this bloater, & I love her work.Ok, so I'm used to this play *as a play*, onstage, not messing around with any additional cutsey dialogue. But lord, it wasn't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Abysmal & Disgraceful","review":"I love this play and have seen numerous productions of it over the years including the 100th anniversary performance at the Old Vic in London in 1995 (a splendid Lady Bracknell performed by Barbara Leigh-Hunt from Pride and Predjudice). I have also read the play a few times as well savoring Wilde's wit as I would a fine cabernet. This Oliver Parker adaptation on the otherhand is pure swill.As with his recent adaptation of Othello, Parker's vision and pacing for Earnest are all wrong. Gone are the elements of quick wit, Victorian manners and high-farce, replaced by a trashy and unpleasant opium-induced rag-time catastrophe.Never has Reese Witherspoon been less charming, Dame Judy less regal or Colin Firth less properly mannered.Truly, a farce of a farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good cast wasted.","review":"Every one of the actors and actresses is an extremely talented person, and could have been good in a different production of the play. It was obvious that the director didn't understand the play, and was taking a totally wrongheaded approach to it.\\"Ernest\\" is a drawing room comedy. Hacking up the different scenes--moving from the club to Lady Bracknell's townhouse or from the country house to the church--destroys that. The tatoo parlor scene was entirely gratuitous. Showing Canon Chasibule's drawings was a total misreading of the character. Making Algy the older of the guys was wrong; if Wilde had wanted it that way, he would have WRITTEN it that way. And having Algy and Ernest getting into a physical struggle over the muffins was just wrong, wrong, WRONG--it violated the whole spirit of the play, which is the use of WORDS and LANGUAGE.I just hope that some day the same cast gets together to do this again--under a director who knows what he is doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD except some...","review":"Brilliant, lovely, impeccable casting by the entire Oliver Parker's production team.

Parker must have been mistaken for Christ sake! Witherspoon is so NOT right for the choice.

Some of the recipes in this book worked very well - we all loved the Brown Rice Fruit Salad, and the recipe for Cartwheel carrots was a hit. Recipes are \\"kid-tested\\", but my kids still can't be convinced to love okra, eggplant or spinach casserole. I have managed to sneak tofu into their diet in recipes like Tofu Spuds.

Like Leonard Malton on films and James Michener on any subject, Marsh makes exciting things insufferable. The wheezing digressions, no-nothing judgments and constant air of self-importance smother fandom's lively flame.Lester Bangs could communicate to you the flavor, rhythm, and personal significance of a song or ouvre. Marsh has no such ear, and overwhelms this project with his own wooly-brained inanity. Even descriptions of the band member's intimate, often emotional life experiences are uninvolving. Tell you what--buy the albums and just guess what kind of lives these guys had and what their motives were. That'll be a lot more fun than this quagmire."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is crap, essentially, with a few gold nuggets.","review":"Dave Marsh is the most long-winded fool ever to usea typewriter.

Maybe \\"Behind blue eyes\\" is the answer ?(Dave Marsh explains very well the the \\"Mod Scene\\" phenomenon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marsh kills the spirit of rock and roll","review":"I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that Dave Marsh's preachiness and know-it-all attitude really is a detriment to this book. Before I Get Old is well researched and thorough, the only problem is that it takes all the life out of what is one of the most exciting and dangerous rock groups of all time. Marsh really fails to capture the early days of the Who, because he seems to judge everything as the elitist American reviewer he is. In other words, he has no sense of humour and doesn't capture the essence of what made the Who what they were. Pete Townshend is quoted at length, and he can be a real bore, he does his best communicating with a guitar in his hand and writing great songs of angst, rebellion and rage. Marsh has done some good work here and there, but he is totally out in left field with this one, he really captured nothing of The Who."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm...

By the time I'd gnawed through the bone, I was ready to die. Strand has no idea how to tell a story, no idea how to resolve her plot threads. The characters are boring and there is so little time spent fleshing them out that you could care less what happens to them. Unrealistic (I know this is a fantasy, whatever!) situations, characters who are best friends with each other abondoning one another without a thought.

At least one figure appears to have been redrawn crudely.I plan to return the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Which We Serve DVD","review":"As most folks are aware, this is a classic war movie, so I'm not making any comments about the film itself; however, the quality of the DVD (both picture and sound) are rather poor, hence my only two stars for this review. I'm surprised that this film isn't part of the Criterion Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid","review":"Wonderful perspective of the English view during wartime. Might seem a little phony at times, but keep in mind this is 1942 when the world looked at things differently.DVD quality (Westlake)is OK. The picture is excellant, however, about 2/3 of the way through, there were several bad glitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Which We Serve","review":"With Britain in the pit of the Second War, playwright Coward was desperate to do a morale-boosting film, and \\"Serve\\" was the inspired result. The normally effete Coward is appropriately \\"stiff upper lip\\" as Kinross, and a young Mills stands out in a first rate ensemble cast which also includes Bernard Miles and Celia Johnson as Coward's wife. (Also look fast for a young Richard Attenborough!) With Coward at the helm as writer, star, and even score composer, David Lean handling most of the directing (and all the editing), and future director Ronald Neame the cinematography, the result is one of Britain's very finest war films, which accomplished everything Coward set out to do for his country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"Only the British can make a war movie that truly represents how their armed forces actually worked, and this one is a great example of the RN in war"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious \\"in which we serve","review":"Highly recommended,but,to many scenes of men bobbing aroundin a life boat. Little action scenes and those that were seenwere not believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good for words","review":"I cannot even begin to describe how good this book is. And I'm considered by my friends as an extremely critical (of books and films) person.On the surface, this book is about homosexuality, art, and Poland during WWII.But it goes so much deeper than that, probing and illuminating the meaning of Fatherhood, Beauty, Longing, and the Holy.Its a book influenced by Judaism, Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Nazism, Modernism, and Mysticism.Some passages, in their prose, border on the best kind of poetry. There are several passages in this book that have burned into my mind. I don't think I shall forget them until I die.If you love Dostoevsky, you'll love this book.I know this is such a bad review. I didn't even try to explain it, because it is too good for that.You really will not regret reading this, no matter what your background.[btw, due to the disturbing (non-graphic) content, I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under the age of 15.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Story for Catholic Readers (and others!)","review":"This is the second novel by O'Brien I've read, the first being \\"Father Elijah\\". Sophia House is a prequel to Father Elijah. The story is dramatic and the ideas in the book should be absorbed by Catholics (well, all Christians, but the intended audience is probably Catholic). And presenting the ideas in the form of such an accessible novel is wonderful. I genuinely liked the book although there is occasional weakness in the dialog. But keep reading anyway. The ending is dramatic and it left me wanting more. This book warrants re-reading but I think I'll go back and re-read Father Elijah first.Once again, Ignatius Press has published a book that really does matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris","review":"This is the best of all the P & P series.

Aidan did a great job in keeping up the general cadence of Austen's writing. Seeing things from Darcy's perspective was a dream come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish More Would Remain","review":"Book 3 is the best in the series for no other reason than it puts readers in Darcy's head during the most important scenes in Pride and Prejudice. I still remember reading Pride and Prejudice the very first time and being surprised at Darcy's proposal and cheering Elizabeth when she slams him. This time, I honestly felt bad for him, knowing what was going on in his head through everything. Seeing his interactions with Wickam and Lydia and his reaction to Lady Catherine's interference with his life were ... capitol! :) I feel any fan of Pride and Prejudice would enjoy this series (and anyone who has seen the 1995 A&E movie version will probably picture Colin Firth as Darcy). Now if only Pamela Aiden would write some books focusing more on Fletcher and Georgiana and what becomes of them ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh! What an Ending!","review":"I must start with a confession: This book covers my favorite parts of Pride and Prejudice so I was afraid I was going to be disappointed with how Darcy's point of view would influence the plot. After finishing the book I just shook my head at my foolish concerns.This series is so interesting. I just love many of the new characters. They add so much to Darcy's personality. And the depth at which returning characters are explored is so interesting. Pamela Aidan really was able to capture the life and times of Regency England's rising middle class and landholding gentry.This is just a wonderful conclusion to this series. I was so disappointed when I finished reading the whole series that I picked up the books and thumbed to my favorite parts and reread them.As someone who generally does not like to read sequels to classic novels, I loved the escapism and fun of this series. I recommend it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"The incredible charm with which Pamela Aidan saturates her stories is so engrossing that it's nearly impossible to set down one her novels, or keep your emotions uninvolved with those of the characters. She brings you into the story effortlessly and keeps you riveted throughout. I've only just finished re-reading the whole trilogy, and I feel like I need to start again just to keep up with the enchantment! My life without Darcy, Elizabeth, Austen and Aidan? Unbearable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it, but a little bit of a let down","review":"I expected this to be the best book of the three. Perhaps I was slightly disappointed simply because I already knew the story so well. I was so pulled into the Darcy story in book 2, that I guess I was hoping for more of him and less of Elizabeth. Certainly a surprising confession for a Jane Austen fan! By all means read the series of three books. You will not regret having spent the time as the books are well written and thought out from Darcy's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of three.","review":"This is the best of Pamela Aidan's three books. It tells the story through Darcy's eyes, and stays pretty close to Jane Austen's story. I enjoyed it very much. This and the first book in this series is all you need. She went off on a silly tangent in Book 2. I almost didn't buy this book because of that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Three Remain (but maybe there'll be a fourth. . .)","review":"These books (\\"An Assembly Such as This,\\" \\"Duty and Desire,\\" and \\"These Three Remain\\") are almost as good as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" itself! They're fantastic! Aidan's writing captures the tone and style of Austen and the period naturally without sounding forced and awkward. Her description of the change in Darcy's outlook and personality is very convincing. The plot points about the French revolution, the assassination of the prime minister, and Irish rebels add another dimension to \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Much good humor besides. Best of all, I can't wait to read more about another character she has created, Dy Brougham. Maybe she'll produce a fourth book. . . or better yet some producer will take this up and produce a movie. These are the best of the Pride and Prejudice sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Three Remain (Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman, Book 3)","review":"The best of the three. It shows the dramatic change in Darcy and the lengths that he will go to secure Elizabeth's happiness, even if he might be excluded from her life. Thank heaven Pamela Aidan does not break our hearts and gives us a very happy ending. Loved the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read!","review":"What a terrific movie this book would make - possibly a 2.5 hr. movie for TV, since theaters seem to be dying. Actually, this is not a sequel, but a re-telling of P&P; from almost the beginning of the 1794 novel. And what an improvement over the dry writing of Jane Austen, notwithstanding her genius. (Her paraphrasing of so much of the great dialogue made the book a laborious read.)Aidan's brilliance shines from the beginning and created a Mr. Darcy who is so real that we must wonder why so much was left to the imagination of the reader in the original, whereas in this version there is such compelling interest.I wanted to devour this book when enchanted by the romantic lean and hint of eroticism. I made myself stretch it over three days to make it last longer.Perhaps Pamela Aidan will consider a sequel in keeping with the main characters. I'm sure it would also be a best seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the trilogy","review":"By far the best in the series. Book 1 moved a bit slowly I thought, but I still had to keep going...Book 2 was quicker, but the plot seemed a bit strange. Book 3, however, concludes the series exactly the way it should be concluded. Watching Darcy sputter out his first proposal and seeing the inner-workings of his mind upon rejection was fulfilling, although not nearly as much as seeing him finally accepted. Even though you know how the story ends, it's plenty of fun getting there. A great take on what Darcy's side of the story may have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Three Remain","review":"This was a delightful reading experience as have been all of her books on this topic of the Road not Taken in Pride and Predjuice...please write more and tell me when they are available..Mom has been reading them as fast as i have...Thank you for a delightful read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Of all three of these novels you really only need to read this one if you are a Pride and Prejudice fan. It is so entertaining reading about what Mr.Darcy thinks. Just shows guys don't know what is going on. One of my all time faves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read a few sequels of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" from different authors such as this one, and, frankly, I found them all a bit boring. It's very rare that authors will write a sequel of their novel. Victor Hugo never did and so other great novelists. So, why bother trying, I wonder. Because it never equals the real one. I won't finish reading this one, I will rather read again \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" from Jane Austen that is so brillantly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I appreciate her effort, but how can anyone improve on what is almost perfect. Re-read her (Austen's) novels. No one can imitate her style and wit and writing and come anywhere close.

Or my tastes have improved"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"Although this volume alone (the last in the series)is longer than Austen's Pride and Prejudice, it is still great reading for all P & P fans. We know much more of Darcy's thoughts here than of Elizabeth's in Austen's work, but they are in keeping with the tone of Pride and Prejudice. The writing is good enough to keep the story moving well. The conclusion of a couple of \\"side\\" plots adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tango but only 2 or 3 song the rest .............","review":"I heard static in some song like they reocorded off an LP.

We started in Pre-k 4 with the first 2 books and completed the second two in K in about 3 months, completing 2-3 pages a day. I am glad we split the 4 books between the two grades. The first two books are great because as others said they have pre-writing skill practice, listening to simple directions, coloring, shape recognition. But books 3 & 4 had more difficult (for age level) following instructions/memorization etc. Great to wait because the challenge was perfect for her current skill level in K. In book 4, need to write short words, numbers, complete pictures and sequencing. Looking for something similar in challenge and skill practice to finish out our school year. The black and white pictures did not bother her at all.

The \\"strict tempos\\" on these CD's sound like they were provided by a digital drum machine. Some of the tracks are completely synthesized, and they sound like it -- cheeeeesy! The tracks with the trumpet (or is it a flugelhorn?) and electric guitar are somewhat better. All but one of the tangos rate one star. Some of the waltzes and sambas rate two stars. The rumbas and mambos are uninspired. The cha chas don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Alicia!","review":"There's nothing like a soul singer who plays the piano, and like Aretha and Roberta before her, Alicia Keys knows how to take possession of keyboards and work her voice around her playing. This disc, while not \\"Unplugged\\" in the technical sense, gives Alicia a chance to shine, and her playing and singing are impeccable.All the hits are here (\\"Falling\\" still sounds great, and \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" beats the original in this production), along with some clever covers - her version of \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\" is right up there with Brenda Holloway's original, and while some Stones purists might balk, I really enjoyed the version of \\"Wild Horses\\" on this project. And the closing number \\"Welcome To Jamrock\\", a Damian Marley song that features he and Keys, along with Common and Mos Def is a perfect wrap for this show.Truly great stuff, from a performer who is maturing into a true artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is off the chain!","review":"I have enjoyed this cd.

If you haven't bought this CD GO BUY IT NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a question","review":"Would Alicia Keys have a major record label is she was not pretty. There are tons of better singers, songwriters, piano players then her but they are not actrative like alicia. One more thing why did she do a duet with that sissy for marron 5 could'nt she got someone less lame and mainstream. The other guest artists on here have cds to promote so that is why they are here. If mtv is going to bring back unplugged then get bands and singers that sound good acoustic. Mtv really sucks they should just change there name to Reality tv that way people would not complain about then not playing videos that much. Mtv used to be great when i was younger i watch it all the time it was i think TRL that ruin it. Don't be suprised if next they come out with a ashlee simpson unplug cd now that is a thought that would make you cringe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwile Album","review":"Before I begin my review of Alicia's Unplugged album, let me state that in listening to music, I do not look for perfection, but rather, emotion. It is safe to say that Alicia's vocals are not of the utmost perfection on this album. It is obvious that her voice is a bit strained and she does fall flat on a couple of incidences. However, Alicia never fails to deliver raw emotion, which is always absolutely beautiful. Her versions of \\"Diary\\" and \\"Fallin\\" deliver the most emotion in my opinion and are the true gems on the album. On \\"Fallin\\" Alicia sounds as if she is simply pouring her heart out. I even welcome her hoarsness, especially evident on this track. This album can be played from start to finish without skipping a single track, and is worth buying if only for the new versions of \\"Diary\\" and Fallin.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFICENT!","review":"\\"Unplugged\\" from Alicia Keys is long overdue. I assumed that she would release a live album after \\"Songs in A Minor\\", but I guess it was worth the wait. The stand out track on this masterpeice, is obviously \\"Unbreakable\\", the lead single from the album. I think that it was a smart move on Clive Davis and Alicia for choosing that song as the first single. The rest of the album is just as good. I love the way she has rearranged some of her hits, in a way that makes them brand new again. I love it and if you are reading this, the clips on CDNOW is not enough, go get the full effect!

The chrous is really lame \\"Through The Technical Difficulties\\" what the hell? Only Alicia Keys would squeeze in something so lame and stupid. But besides this on going sample of a song that artists have using since the original been out is getting on my nerves. Come on she could of dropped something more original and well thoughtout then this Unbreakable. This is some mess her label done through together to keep her name out there and it worked. Alicia composed an Unplugged album to keep people saying Alicia Keys is so talented, Alicia Keys can sing, Alicia Keys is the best artists out today. But come to think about when was the last time MTV hosted an Unplugged Special? I am tired of Alicia Keys, she hasn't taken a real break since her debut and her singing is very average as people have been mentioning. Beyonce can sing better then Alicia Keys."},{"rating":"1","title":"New title for this should be: \\"Arrangements Gone Wrong\\"","review":"I absolutely adore Alicia Keys and her phenominal talent. I enjoy listening to her rich vocals and emotional buy in to every song she sings. BUT, the arrangements of these songs are so WRONG on this recording, it was a humongous distraction that I could not get past. It felt like I was hearing some of the songs for the first time; not something I was liking. Nearly every song was dipped in a jazz tone, which certainly did not accentuate her R&B; style. The background vocals were too funky at times and the supporting band was anything but smooth.One plus for this album was it was Alicia Keys after all. I'm glad to hear her perform, but just not these arrangements. This CD will either gather dust on my shelf or be eBayed, sad to say.Bottom line: Even die hard Alicia Keys fans may have trouble digesting this, soley on the crummy arrangements it brings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy-protection DESTROYS the listening experience","review":"I was so shocked when I saw that ugly \\"content protected\\" logo on this CD.

Knapp devotes each of nine chapters to a different author and a specific character from that author's work. All of these characters happen to be gamblers, but even the use of \\"gambler\\" is loosely defined--some of the characters could be better classified as \\"people who make a decision with some risk.\\" Most of the book's content thus focuses upon the nine authors, and how they created these characters in their works.Perhaps if I had been a student of literature, I might have found this book interesting.

I played it for her the other night. Her eyes lit up and she giggled as she heard the songs I had attempted to sing. Now she can watch and listen to them. What a great time we had.

Catchy tunes and great info!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's addicting","review":"Back when learning was fun and was filled with more information than special effects and crazy antics. All of the songs are here including a new \\"lost\\" track. Within the menu you can choose an individual video, by group (science, grammar, etc) or click on The Whole Enchilada for it to go through all of them.This is something that is good for either younger children or those who have not been subjected to the barrage of the new tween soap dramas. The information is a bit outdated with references to record players and a computer that most children this generation have never seen, however the jungles are catchy and the core material is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loven it","review":"Ok great and it also taught me a few things I didn't know or don't remember I love the money segment oh 1000% worth it a must buy for little my motto is they might as well learn while watching tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like I remember 'em...","review":"This DVD includes all of the classic School House Rock clips, plus a little more.

I've bought her books, printed work sheets for extra practice from the internet, and made her a poster with all 12 time tables to hang up in her room.

I was still using the information I learned well into high-school and beyond. I remember my freshman year, one of our first assignments was to memorize the Preamble to the Constitution, and I thought, \\"Are you kidding? I've had that memorized since I was a kid!\\" lolI was stunned to recently discover my wife had never seen Schoolhouse rock, so I bought this DVD to catch her up. Now she's humming Interjections, Conjunction Junction, and Nouns, among others, haha.The video quality isn't the greatest since these are so old, looks like VHS, but they are awesome all the same. I was actually surprised how much I had forgotten out of all these.Anyway, these things are great for teaching kids without them even realizing they are learning. They have stuck with me my entire life, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Schoolhouse Rock Rocks!","review":"I am so glad I purchased this DVD set! I had been talking about Schoolhouse Rock with my 2 sons, 14&4, and decided to just buy it! We all watched it!

Schoolhouse Rock is a classic. When I first ordered this, I convinced myself that I was getting it for the kids. Well, I think I've watched it more than they have!

What arrived was a case that was completely broken down the spine. The cover was scarred and sticky, like a three year old had attacked it with a jelly doughnut! The dvd itself has scratches, but none so significant that it hasn't played the tracks that I need. This was purchased because I teach American History. I don't have time to go through every track. When I get to them I'll find out if they work.Bottom line....never again from this seller"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete set?

If your child is older than 7, I doubt they will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest subliminal learning tool","review":"I loved watching these little tunes in between my favorite ABC cartoons as a kid. My brother missed out on this and had no appreciation for them. A couple years ago I bought a copy for myself and sent another copy to my cousin's kids. They love it and can sing every song. The \\"new\\" School House Rock cartoons do their best to mimic the old feel and style, but I wouldn't say they add a lot, especially considering how quickly technology has progressed. The stories are sometimes too simple and a little biased, but they deliver some very good basics about grammer, numbers, history and science. How can you not love conjunctions! Knowing the preamble of the constitution paid off in debate class."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good one","review":"This is a good video for kids. It worked for me along time ago. I learned the preamble from this video and to this day if I need to recite the preamble I sing it. Not only the preamble, you learn spanish, bill to a law, conjunctions.... this video is timeless.If you have kids get this for them, makes at least the basics for 5 subjects in school easier for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this for myself, err grandson ;)","review":"It's ALL the schoolhouse rock songs. I remember when they ran on Saturday mornings, originally. Some of those history ones might open some eyes, since I don't think that is the history they teach. I don't remember the bank one, or the one on the national debt. But all the originals are here, even broken down by math, history ... Get it for yourself, or use the lame excuse that it's for grandkids. It worked for me :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like I Remembered","review":"I grew up with school house rock as a kid.

To me, this collection is possible the best thing ever to share with a young child. The music is catchy, which makes learning more fun.

Now I've seen them all. Even though the lessons were made for younger kids, I even learned some things from the videos. The songs stick in your head for days after watching them, making them a great tool for memorizing things for school in a fun way.

I learned a lot from them and thought my class would too. I was right! My class loves the songs about America and watching them has resulted in many discussions about our country's history. I have also used the grammar songs to introduce concepts to my class and the songs and videos really help them better understand the concepts we are studying.

I paused for the classics \\"I'm only a Bill\\" etc, but I didn't seem to recognize most of them anymore.If you're looking to relive a little childhood, rent it first- then if you think you can live with it, buy it. Perhaps you need to check to be sure you recognize more than 1/2 of the titles too. (I 'thought' I did!) -I personally wish I had my money back. (My kids even begged me to shut it off!)

He's three, and when I told him this was a show I used to watch, he was very intrigued. He's watched it many times by now, and he knows the words to several of the songs. His favorite, to my heart's joy, is the same one I loved most as a child -- \\"Conjunction Junction\\". He would run around the house singing it constantly when he first learned it!

Maybe the single most perfect effort in the bunch (although \\"3\\" will run it a close race). A difficult concept wrapped up in an unbelievably catchy tune with witty graphics. Everything you remember it was.Elementary, My Dear -- Score: I Got Six. Snappy but rather unimaginative. dull.If all you got in this package was \\"Three is a Magic Number,\\" \\"My Hero, Zero,\\" \\"Conjunction Junction,\\" \\"The Preamble,\\" \\"Lolly,\\" \\"Verb,\\" and \\"Figure Eight,\\" it would be worthwhile.

These are some of the songs that I remember from the \\"Schoolhouse Rock\\" DVD and from watching TV as a kid in the '80's when \\"Schoolhouse Rock\\" songs were sandwiched between cartoon segments on Saturday mornings. This is for the older elementary school child. Though my Kindergartener likes some of the songs and finds the animations cute and funny, it was harder for him than his older sister in third grade to fully appreciate all of the songs. Your child will learn not only grammar, but American History as well: how the West was settled and how a bill becomes law are some examples. It is all animated with adorably sketched characters and memorable voices singing memorable songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great teaching tool","review":"I have loved these songs since I was a kid. They are timeless little songs that are easy to learn and therefore help you remember importants facts such as \\"a noun is a person, place or thing.\\"From multipication, to english, to history, this is a fun way to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost educational treasure!!","review":"I have fond memories of watching this series on ABC's Saturday Morning lineup as a child during the early 1980s. I wish that ABC would resurrect the series, as I think that it makes otherwise bland academic subjects fun and engaging. Given the questionable state of culture and education in our nation today, I think that Schoolhouse Rock looks better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!! SHR is a diamond in the rough","review":"I cherish these cartoons from my childhood. I have bought two copies and intend to buy more for family and friends.

It's a great educational video."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV education should've never changed...","review":"It's not just about growing older and reminiscing those good ol' times with television programming. This production has by far been one of the best educational programs on TV for children. It is beyond me why this was pulled from the Saturday series of cartoons.No matter how innovative today's music has become, School House Rock holds a format of music that sticks to you. Therefore, part of the lessons in the songs are embedded in your memory. Twenty-five years plus and I can still recall the wonder of learning about electricity, verbs, money, conjunctions, etc. The animation may not compare to today's modern style of cartooning, but it still entertains the viewer with an exciting and original idea. With a variety of different topics throughout history in a musical format, SHR series serves its purpose of enlightening the brain.With this said, every parent should have this in their DVD library for their child(ren). Hands down to School House Rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this as a kid, now I can pass it on !","review":"This 30th anniversary edition is the perfect gift for my nephew!

There is something wonderful about singing through what one learns. Now if school lessons were musicals, I think more students would remember their subjects better. School House Rocks gets this concept. Sometimes, I catch myself singing Conjunction Junction while running around town.

I am very disappointed by the author's work. Comparing to Jonathan Spence's books and Ray Huang's book on Ming history, this book is very boring and lack of deepness. The author has made a great effort to gather a lot of details but they are so fragmental. The author fails to contextualize Yongle and his time, making Yongle so isolated in the Ming history. Those long citations easily put readers into sleep. As an academic book, it lacks a special perspective and has no argument. As a text book, it's hard to attract students because there is no story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flavor, great with Mexican dishes","review":"El Yucateco makes a bangin' sauce.

(4) there is too much unnecessary text with repetitive info and most importantly (5) I still don't know how to set up an e-commerce solution on a dedicated hosting platform, after reading this 394 pages book in a week.

It was simply a story about a love affair brought together and torn apart by music. It's a quick read, but I found the dialogue to be clunky. I felt that Lydia (the student/lover)did not receive enough attention. I think there were characters in the novel that were close to her, other than Bernard (the music teacher)who could have been used more to illuminate Lydia's strange actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have all the editors gone?","review":"I give this two stars instead of one so as not to have the devastating effect an unfavorable review in the story has. Just kidding; actually I give it three stars for content, one star for execution. Yes, as several of the reviews here state, the dialogue just doesn't come off. It IS \\"clunky\\"; it IS stilted. Everything about the book seems amateurish. On the other hand, this is a first novel, and its author is professionally a musician, not a writer. You have to start somewhere. I think the real problem is that this book needed to be refashioned in collaboration with an experienced, talented editor, and nowadays money-games-playing stockholders consider editors an expense corporate publishing companies can do without. In any case, I read it in one sitting, and overall I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving story.","review":"This was the first of Barbara Delinsky's works that I read.

The Big E was the most decorated ship of World War II and had a charmed life. She fought in nearly all of the major naval battles in the Pacific and was awarded 20 battle stars by the government. The Enterprise was also the ONLY carrier operating in the Pacific for a time during the war. This book has good photos and the information is detailed, without being overwhelming for a basic book. (It is really an introduction to the subject and left me wanting more.) The cost of the book is quite low for so much content.

The opening score by Alex North gives the viewer the idea that this is not a comedy.It is Gable,s last film and Monroe,s last complete film. Clift would soon follow their fate also. If Gable had lived who knows what kind of mature roles he would had given. Gable was in that MGM contract for so long playing heroes and unreal people that we might forget what his possibilities could have been.The final reel has Roslyn( Monroe) saying to Gay( Gable) \\" How do you find your way home\\"?

I truly think it has been over hyped because it was the last completed film for Gable and Monroe. It was not at all a film I would picture Marilyn Monroe in. That is probably exactly what she wanted, a film allowing her to go beyond and expand her acting credibility... I felt there was more chemistry between Clift & Monroe than Gable & Monroe; so the latter pair being the hook up didn't fly for me. Marilyn Monroe is my absolute favorite but this just wasn't for me.

Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable are in the film too, it was the last film either of them made. And Thelma Ritter offers great support, and Montgomery Clift and Eli Wallach are excellent too. But I can see why Amazon stresses the contributions of the Bartons. Here's to them! (P.S. I'm joking of course. I just find it weird that Amazon's computer is clearly set up to list the actors alphabetically, and so weirdly \\"the Misfits\\" is said to star James Barton. Amazon seems to correct this alphabetical default in some of their listing. And Monroe, Gable, Wallach, clift and the wonderful Thelma Ritter are very memorable in this movie.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story, Great acting by Marilyn","review":"A somewhat unusual and sensitive story about the vulnerabilities and interplay of the three lead characters. Life has not been kind to all three of them, because of which they are kind of unhappy and disturbed inside. No point narrating the story here, that should be left for people to see.Excellent portrayal by M. Monroe - this film gives an idea on how capable an actress she was ! Great performances by Clark Gable(the horse-taming scene is memorable) and Montgomary Clift(the telephone scene comes to my mind) also. Everyone should see this film at least once - it's moving !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Film For Two Great Actors.","review":"Note: I just saw this film with XFinity On Demand.Noted for being the final film of screen legends Clark Gable (Best Actor, It Happened One Night) and Marilyn Monroe (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), The Misfits is an interesting movie. I recommend it, mostly to view the (sadly) final performances of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe, though Tuco also turns in a good performance, as does Montgomery Clift. But the stars of the film are clearly Rhett Butler and Marilyn Monroe, who was a good actress in addition to being incredibly gorgeous.This film is Not Rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie smells death!","review":"MY RATING- 7.7That's right, this mov smells death cause it looks really profetic of what would happen to Marylin, Monty and Gable. Gable doesn't look mature, he looks old and tired. I know that he insisted doing many of the stunt work, yet seeing him we believe why he died little time after. Marylin looks more from another world , the scene when she screams calling \\"murderers\\" is as if she was incriminating those who leaded her to suicide. Some fresh air comes from Monty, yet his pensive character is profetic how he would die few years later. In some few words, the title says all, it's about three misfits, that try find his place in the world.Psychological drama, that is overpassed by the master \\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf\\". Also nice cinematography, good directing by John Huston as well as excellent secondaries- Thelma Rhitter an Eli Wallach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting film","review":"\\"The Misfits\\" boasts an all-star cast and an interesting, if unusual story. The script has a few holes in it, but the colorful characters keep you watching. The last scene of Marilyn and Gable looking up at the stars as they drive home is hypnotic and powerful. It caused me to remember that both of these legends never completed another film, and that neither lived much longer after the movie was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic work","review":"If you appreciate the old hollywood style of telling a story, this movie is worth watching. It examines the relationship and mores of the time through an observor's view. You aren't tied into the internal thoughts and emotions of the characters, except by what they reveal to everyone. Gable is good as always, not having lost his spark and appeal. Monroe shows the sorrow of a tough life and the rest of the cast carry their roles with conviction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Complete Astral Traveller","review":"This book is a magnificient read and has had a profound impact on my life and how I view my life.

This DVD was cheap and I needed to tighten up my arms so I bought it. All I can say is I did this about twice and now it's collecting dust. Like another reviewer said, it is boring and the instructor talks way too much. I'm really not used to working out a lot, especially my arms but I found this too easy and way too boring. They definitely could have cut out some of the talking and made it quicker. It would be good to do if you only have a couple minutes but the lengthiness of it due to unnessecary talking makes that impossible. For 35 minutes, I expect to get a more worthwhile workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and short workout, if you want to call it one at all.","review":"This is really one of the worst workouts if have tried at home so far. A very limited number of exercises and in between the same stretch again and again. Besides the boring workout the comments are really annoying, and I can't imagine myself to use this workout regularly. When I bought it, I thought a workout which concentrates on arms would be a nice workout to alternate with my others, but at least this one is really not worth the money.Though you can use more weight to make it challenging, it is really hard to stand it repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short workout...mostly fluff.","review":"This is one of the worst workout videos I have ever used. The women look scary, the music is dull and the instructor's comments are unnecessary. The first time I used it, the comments were ok, but he spends more time explaining what exercise we're about to do than he does actually leading the exercise. When I've used the DVD again, I put it on mute and play my own music. The up-side is that the moves are very simple. Other than that, I'd definitely pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or your money.","review":"This dvd is boring and I found the host to be condescending. At most, this is a good starting point and is better than doing nothing at all. Perhaps doing this dvd will motivate you to find a better way to exercise. What I like the least about this video is that it does the least amount of workout on the underneath side of the arm; the part most women want to firm up. While I had the same idea as a previous reviewer in regards to pausing the dvd and doing 2 more rep's on my own, my second thought was 'why should I have to'? Why isn't this dvd made to be consistant, with 3 rep's for each segment. Poor editing, poor planning, and a really, really irritating host make this the least favorite workout dvd I've ever purchased. I would suggest spending your money on a dvd that is an all over body workout as you will get an even better workout for your body than this so called 'Sexy Arms' dvd can offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"only if you've NEVER held weights before in your life","review":"If you're absolutely just starting out with weights, then maybe this is an okay tape for you -- it's got the most basic, time-honored, humdrum freeweight exercise routine that exists. But if you've ever touched a weight in your life, then you're going to be bored to death with this, and the guy's got no imagination. But if you've never heard of a bicep curl before, then maybe you'll be okay with this one. You'll want to turn the volume down after a couple of tries, though -- the chatter is inane, and he just keeps talking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work out.. very talky","review":"It's hard to find a good arm workout on video/dvd and this is one of the best I've found. The guy talks entirely too much which is annoying but I fast forward over him between exercises. The set up is odd. He does 3 sets of shoulders 1 set of triceps and 2 sets of biceps. I only do 2 sets of shoulder and repeat the triceps to get 2 sets of those in too. The funniest part is that he has HUGE arms and he uses 5 pound weights. My arms are certainly tired afterwards and I am beginning to notice a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good upper body basic.","review":"The video seems like a 1980's or 1990's video.

So what's the other 15 minutes of this 30 minute DVD? Um, the instructor blabbering on about nothing. The exercises are as basic as can be, you could do them without a DVD to follow because he doesn't switch things up at all to keep them interesting , and there isn't even any music to get into. This is the least useful exercise DVD I own -- I know that sounds really negative, but anything by Denise Austin or QuickFix would be a lot more interesting and a lot more creatively put together. You can find other DVDs with several different workouts on them so that you can rotate the routines, and for the same price. Keep looking and don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Glorious","review":"Hey guys! I agree with Chris in that these are all the tops when it comes to comedy.

If you've seen Dress to Kill, Circle, or Sexie, then you might come away mildly dissappointed, as those are certainly better. These shows are obviously Eddie still developing his act and his style, but they are funny non the less (especially if you are up on you Angloisms).

I really like Guess at the Riddle because while there are hooks and pop melodies, there is also very strong experimentation. But it's not a slog like listening to a lot of experimental work.

Herbert discusses the various interpretations of how quantum mechanics describes reality. In other words, what does it mean about the underlying reality of the world to say that electrons (and all other subatomic \\"building blocks\\") are both/neither waves and/nor particles? Herbert presents eight different, yet overlapping, interpretations of quantum mechanics. The ones that I remember most clearly are the Copenhagen interpretation (i.e., that there is no underlying reality), the multiple worlds interpretation, the consciousness-only interpretation. Needless to say, all of the interpretations were, in one way or another, counter-intuitive and weird.Another point that Herbert drives home is that, however we understand reality in light of quantum physics, it is definitely non-local (everything is everywhere and everywhen) as demonstrated conclusively by Bell's theorem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This is a great book. Instead of highlighting one or two strange quantum examples, this book really tries to explain what is going on. Given that nobody really knows what is going on, this book does a very good job of explaining the prevailing theories. Other books such as \\"A brief history of time\\" and \\"the elegant universe\\" talk a little about quantum mechanics, but they left me with an incomplete view of the field. Although this book will not turn you into a quantum physicist, it will help you understand what quantum stuff is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice intro","review":"Richard Feynman noted that no-one understands Quantum Mechanics. OK. If you want a virtual understanding, this book is a great start. It is easy to read, easier to read than other books mentioned by reviewers, and you come out of it feeling you at least understand something of Quantum Mechanics. I enjoyed it so much I summarized my notes, so I could have my understanding of it on a few pages. I do that only with the best books I read. There is a very little bit of mathematics, but for those of us who didn't take 4 years of college level math, this is very understandable. I've also seen this book cited in other books that present Quantum Mechanics in simple terms. Since QM is replacing the Newtonian paradigm that our society is built on, this book is well worth reading. I wish I'd run across it in high school, I'd have read it as carefully as I read Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explore the possible underlying realities","review":"This isn't easy reading for a first quantum physics book imo, because it quickly gets to the reality interpretations of quantum physics before it discusses the physics. This can make it confusing reading, especially the first time through. If you are already knowledgeable about the quantum facts, then jump right in and explore the possible underlying realities with this book. Any discourse on the reality underlying quantum actions should be somewhat confusing - no one understands it and there are many theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST","review":"Without veering off into New Agey territory too much (hello Mr. Talbot), this book explores the scientific side of quantum strangeness. It is a bit more involved and complicated, but it is still comprehendable with some concentration. Of course, it will help if you have some prior knowledge of quantum mechanics.

They are basically the most polite and honorable people you could meet. This book is a total disgrace to Hells Angels and motorcycle club members everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"charlotte gray","review":"very interesting ww2 story of the corrupt govt. ofwar time france as well as fine people doing what should be done ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Gray","review":"Cate Blanchett shines here but the story is a little slow at times.

I'm a big fan of war stories, but I found this film to be drawn out, and at times tedious. Charlotte is a Scotswoman, selected to become a spy in war-torn France. When her cover is almost blown, she is hidden away in a remote farm playing mommy to two orphan boys.While I enjoyed the cinematography, I didn't care for Charlotte's character. Her romance with the pilot seemed superficial to me. Her convictions to help France, had all the genuineness of a dogma spouting cultist. And, I'm sorry... But if I were selected to be a spy, I would hope I'd do more than play housekeeper. Come on Girl!I had to give up half way through the movie. I just couldn't muster the interest to finish it. Perhaps if the story had been a little tighter and the characters a little more engaging....? Overall, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad !

As soon as they arrived I upackaged them both, reviewed the directions, and plugged the charger in then plugged in the battery. An hour and twenty minutes later the light went green so I disconnected and put the battery in my new camera and it was only about 50% charged!This charger was originally packaged for use with the NP-FP50 (an older style battery) and had a stick-on label added to the packaging indicating that it was also for use with the FH style battery.

The story mainly follows the adventures of U.S. secret agent John Stark as he tries to solve the strange appearances of a fantasy craft along the eastern American seaboard. Robur doesn't make an appearance until the last quarter of the book, but its an exciting read. The chase across Lake Ontario and Robur's escape over Niagara Falls is one of the most memorable scenes from the book.

Rob Halford would be proud of this band's choice in clothing. It's decent if you're really drunk or are just messing around, but if you take it seriously, I can only wonder if you have many friends.If you're going to go down the corny path but want to remain with something that kicks ass, pick up the Dio album 'Dream Evil' instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically great, lyrically, well....","review":"I agree with a few of the other reviews.

Well, that is very like this book where all the pieces are in place, everything seems okay, but the lightning never strikes! It never comes to life; you can never quite believe it. Good writers lend a kind of grace to their work and you are drawn in, seduced, involved, and you \\"live along with it.\\" These authors are workmanlike, but without that grace. If I knew how to do it, I'd be writing. But I know it when I see it and this isn't it. Nothing wrong with this plot or these characters that Louis L'Amour couldn't fix.

Usually it is only mildly noticeable in this book, but a couple of times it was straight-out winceable.If not too critical about style then this book should prove to be a great good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I have read several adventure books, but this one let me down.It didn't keep my interest and it took me months to read it on and off. Specifically, the main character was hard to believe. He starts out as a naive 17 year old young man, and one year later he becomes worldly, and a man that everyone looks to for answers. Also, some of the writing was canned and a little corny, which some of the others have alluded to. Granted, I'm not the best writer, but if I buy a book I expect to read something better that I can write.I would have quit reading it a long time ago, but spending 20+ dollars for a book makes me feel guilty if I don't finish it. It wasn't terrible, and had its moments, but just not a page turner like some of the reviewers have stated. Everyone has their own opinion, but I would save my money and try to get it from a library if you are really interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad start...","review":"I'm only a chapter and a half into this book, and already I'm contemplating not finishing it. So far Lenehan and Hackman have hit half of all known literary cliches square on the head, and I have no doubt they'll hit the other half in subsequent chapters. For all of the brilliantly written films Hackman has been in, he (and his cohort) have absolutely no ear for human speech. The prose writing is not much better. Only if you have nothing else to read, or think Danielle Steele has been unjustly passed over for the Pulitzer."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWASHBUCKLING YARN","review":"A good one with villains and heroes, adventures, conflict, great characters, and a plot that keeps you turning pages. Young Jack O-Reilly set sail on the Perdido Star and soon he is involved in storms, shipwrecks, wild and friendly natives, enemy vessels, and eventually comes of age at sea. In the meanwhile, he travels to the South Seas Islands, the Philippines and finally back to Cuba. I liked Quince, Jack's mentor and defender, and the ships's cook, Quen-Li, a mysterious fellow who's talents extend beyond the galley. The writers, Hackman, the actor, and Lenihan, an underwater archaeologist, (neighbors in New Mexico) did a fine job in creating a most intriguing storyline and protagonist, who realizes the value of justice, friendship and survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"A swashbuckling tale","review":"The novel is a change of pace for Gene Hackman who is best known for his acting roles (\\"The Unforgiven,\\" etc.). While not great literature, it is an interesting tale in the swashbuckling tradition of years gone by. The setting is in 1805-1808. The hero rescues himself and others from various hazards and improbable situations. He is, perhaps, a little too straight-laced, spurning the advances of a voluptuous native woman.The agressive hero acquires a sidekick who faints at the sight of blood, and a Chinese cook who is a little more than that. With various enemies, intrigues, battles, hazards at sea, etc., it never gets dull. The native women match the description from \\"The Journals of James Cook,\\" i.e., naked and promiscuous. There is enough sex, language, and violence to give it, at best, a PG-13 rating. It will require some re-writing to make it into a reasonable length for a motion picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study of military technology","review":"Although the story of the role of technology in the defeat of german U-boats in the Battle of the Atalantic has often been told, the role of HF-DF (huff-duff) has usually been slighted.

The sounds are generally inconsistent, poorly recorded, and not very useful. It's fairly obvious that they were compiled from various other sources, rather than being recorded specifically for this release.If you need sound effects for an extremely amateur film, and you have absolutely no budget, this CD might be useful.

This book has so many ups and downs, and really makes the reader believe in true love and soul mates. By the end of the story, I was sobbing and could not stop for at least an hour! Nicholas Sparks throws in an unexpected ending that will leave you in shock..."},{"rating":"1","title":"At First Sight by Nicholas Sparks","review":"What a depressing book. After all the time I spent reading this and True Believer I was extremely disappointed. Why does Mr. Sparks have to depict tragedy? Life is full of enough of this--we don't need to be 'entertained' this way. This will probably be the last of his books I will attempt even though I have others on my shelf. When I can't sleep for thinking about it, then there's a big problem. My heart goes out to the pregnant lady who read this before the birth of her first child."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book","review":"At First Sight tells the story of divorced writer Jeremy Marsh and his marriage to smalltown librarian Lexie Darnell. It follows the couple from Jeremy's move from New York City to tiny, southern Boone Creek, North Carolina. It follows their wedding plans, their house purchase, her pregnancy.And if that isn't enough, it throws in some paranormal events, a nosy old small-time mayor and a tear-jerking ending that feels manipulative and unoriginal.There is room on my bookshelves for simple, sweet books. But the writing has to be honest, and it has to soar, for the simplicity to work. The writing in At First Sight seemed strained. Conversations between Lexie and Jeremy made them both seem unlikeable at best and cliched at worst.When I see such rave reviews, and realize that Sparks is a bestselling writer, I think too many readers are selling themselves short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book is perfect for a light read on a roadtrip or a day at the park/beach. The characters and events are easy to follow, nothing too hard to comprehend. I couldn't give it five stars because Mr.Sparks' plots have gotten really drawwwwn out lately. I understand his need to build the story up to the climax, however...you cannot fill eight chapters with meaningless stuff just to fill the book. I like the way Sparks writes his books...just when you think it can't get worse, he tosses you a curveball. If the book had been written at a slightly quicker pace, I would've given five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ob/gyn point of view","review":"Pregnancy and delivery bear surprises we cannot imagine. I like the way the author told this surpriseful journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"At First Sight","review":"i loved this book! another great book written by Nicholas Sparks. it was better than true believerIt tells the story of true lovers that are not only dealing with marrage, moving but pregancy. Jeremy has moved to broome creek leaving all he knows to live with the love of his life, but at the same time is going through writters block and is afraid that someone close to him knows more that he does. There are happy parts, funny parts and parts where you can't stop crying.The only thing i didn't like about it was it keep skipping time, which made it kind of hard to follow and at the end a couple things where left unanswered.As the story progresses it because one of those books that everyone should read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"have not finished the book as yet, but so far loving it. Can't wait to get to the end, but hope it's a happy ending as I'm starting to be fearful due to the part I'm up to currently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas Sparks","review":"I have recently bought 7 books by this author, as of yet I have not been able to read this one but if it is anything like the other two by him that I have read I'm sure I will not be sorry. The book came right away after ordering and was in reasonable shape for not being brand new."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Romance Novel that Never Was","review":"First book I read by Sparks was The Notebook it was pretty good. I figured since I liked his style of writing I would enjoy his other books. Well it looks like that he is writing for someone from Hollywood to buy the rights for his books. At First Sight is a sequel to the True Believer. First Sight is full of repetitions like Sparks highlighted sentences from the Believer, and pasted it in Sight's when he was writing it. This book wants to be a romance novel but even for a tearjerker it's pretty weak. Both books are trying to hard to prove how great it is to live in an area where you could die of boredom and where everyone knows your business. I can understand when someone falls in love and willing to move where their new found loved one lives, but common this could be done without the syrup dripping sentiments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty great","review":"Overall, I loved this book. It kept me turning the page. I really thought it was well written. I thought that Lexie's baby was by someone else and that she was just trying to keep Jeremy around by telling him he's the father. I don't feel like Alvin's character was played out all the way. Like I said, great book overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Have I been asked to review??","review":"I don't know why I have been asked to review this book, because it was missing 40 pages in the middle of the book. I have repeatedly asked Amazon to replace this book so I could finish it, and will happily send them the defective copy... Amazon tells me that it is unavailable...but they still show it listed for sale. They bought my book at a bargain price, and now wont stand behind their product. The first part of the book was good....but I wouldn't take a chance on buying it from Amazon if you want to read the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like how it ended","review":"I was not at all happy with the way this book ended. This is the first book by Sparks that I read. I have other books by this author, but if he ends all of his books in this manner, I am not sure I want to read the others that I do have!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and unrealistic","review":"I haven't read many books written by Patterson but I liked The Notebook so I thought I would read some of his other publications. I didn't find much to like about At First Sight.The story is totally unbelievable and the characters one-dimensional. It is a boiler plate romance novel. The couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart. A wave of a wand and they both know they love each other. The happy couple then find and overcome adversity.Patterson is not a bad writer. If you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read, you won't be disappointed. If you want a realistic story and believeable characters, then At First Sight isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Nobel to Danielle Steel!!!!!!","review":"And I thought Steel was terrible! I was certainly being unjust to her because Sparks makes her a Literary Dame...I was quite sure about his writing from the tear jerking oriented, sappy and trite book names, but when my sister gave and begged me to read the book, I just made the mistake of giving a try..Now my sister deserves a good spank...probably on the head hoping that she will get more wiser next time... The prose (assuming there WAS a prose) is stilted, dialogues are hackneyed and every word felt as if written by a 5th grade pupil. But I am sure even a 5th grade pupil can pull out a better character for Doris, that boring caricature. If this is what our people is currently dying to read, then I may start writing a book which I am sure will sell millions with a little bit of sappiness and a sound marketing ploy.Drop Sparks from publishing world and save millions of poor trees! Y'know you can do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the bother","review":"This book is not a very well executed story. Characters are poorly developed and storyline is very flat. Perhaps I needed to be a much younger reader. Told from the main male character's point of view, it lacks credibility. Soap Opera's on TV are better than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious and Unpredictable","review":"This was my first Nicholas Sparks book. Regardless of some of the comments from seasoned Sparks readers, I enjoyed coming home and reading it. It's a continuation of a previous book (which you don't have to read before understanding) about a NY writer who meets a Tar Heels girl and who unexpectantly gets pregnant. They become engaged and he moves to her hometown in North Carolina, an immensely different life than he knew in New York City, thus beginning the journey of discovery of each other and their selves. It's a year in the life of Jeremy whose love, faith, career, fortitude is put to the test. He encounters it all-love, passion, anger, worry, happiness, fear, and loss. The ending is dramatic and for me was unexpected. But I liked the epilogue. I hope that Nicholas Sparks will write a sequel to this one too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas Sparks is back!!!","review":"Short review, but all I could say is what he failed and lacked in his previous book (True Believer), he absolutely made it up in this one.With all the complaints of him failing or disappointing many people for the predictable True Believer, this is one that will or should get the opposite comments.Seems like Sparks got his spark back? Hehe."},{"rating":"2","title":"at first sight","review":"This is Nicholas' Sparks best book since the Notebook, it kept me on the edge with suspense at one point and the end totally suprised me. Its an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Wow!! I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books. This one is by far the best one yet. It shows us how life really is and how we should never take it for granted. To always show and tell the ones we love how much they mean to us for we never know what life holds. I find it hard to lay your books down. I keep wanting more.GREAT BOOK!! Thank you Nicholas Sparks.Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Disappointed in This One","review":"I LOVE Nicholas Sparks and buy his books right when they hit the shelves, but this one just did nothing for me. I just kept reading it it to see if it got any better,it didn't. I was disappointed all through it and thought the ending would make up for the rest of the story but not so, I was very disappointed with the ending also.I hope the next one is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MY FAVORITE","review":"I have read all of Nicolas Sparks books & this is by FAR my least favorite. I wasn't drawn in my the characters; if anything I was drawn AWAY from them. Very tragic ending.If you want to read the perfect book, go read The Notebook. I guarantee you will love that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing for Sparks","review":"2 of 2 people found the following review helpful:I have read & enjoyed most of Sparks previous books, often looking specifically for his new books to come out. I found this book to be slow and lacking whatever it takes to hold ones attention. I did not enjoy the book as I had not enjoyed 3 weeks with my brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Sparks fan...","review":"Sad to say, I didn't enjoy this one. I have read and really enjoyed his previous work, and I am always excited to see a new one come out, but this one just didn't hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Sparks but this was my least favorite. Do not read if you are pregnant!","review":"Not his best work. I have read everything by Sparks and was so excited to get my hand on this. I usually read a Sparks book in a matter of hours to two days max. This took me over a week. The first 100-175 pages was like watching paint dry. After that it did get significantly more intersting. Do not read if you are expecting it will just add addtional things for you to worry about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah.......","review":"Not to beat up Mr. Sparks too bad, but I'm going to have to back off of reading him for a while like I had to do Danielle Steele. There comes a time when an author will have books coming out so often that the books will begin to 'lose their elasticity' so to speak. Hopefully in the future, Mr. Sparks can 'tighten it back up.' Come to think of it, I never did return to Ms. Steele....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing for Sparks","review":"I have read every Nicholas Sparks book out, and this was my least favorite. I was very dissapointed in this one. It was very slow getting into, and was extremely depressing. I'm all for a good cry from a book, but this one was beyond that. You wouldn't miss anything if you chose to skip this one! Sorry Mr. Sparks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparks has lost his creative edge, just like the character in the book","review":"I have always enjoyed his books. But I doubt I will buy another. This one was not worth the time it took to read it. It was like he couldn't come up with an idea so he just went back to his last book and continued the least interesting story line. There was nothing to be learned from this. You didn't get connected to the characters. It was just blahhhh. I'm sorry to see another author go down that path - just cranking out another book to keep his name on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful!!!!","review":"I had read two other Sparks books prior to this one, so I knew what to expect (predictable, love story). The writing style annoyed me to no end. I could only get halfway through before I gave up. Mr. Sparks, stop TELLING me what your characters are feeling, experiencing. SHOW me!!!!Jeremy Marsh has to be the most annoying literary character I have ever discovered. Grow a pair and stop whining! Do not get me started on the stereotypical Lexie and Doris. YUCK!!!! Do not waste your time. I am finally giving up on Nicholas Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st Sparks book I ever read","review":"After reading the other reviews, I wish I had read True Believer first, maybe it would have made this book more enjoyable. This was the first Sparks book that I have read and was pretty disappointed. I really felt like nothing happened throughout the whole book until the last chapter. The storylines that could have made the book more eventful were very briefly described, followed by chapters of a whole lotta nothing. (Alvin, Rodney/Lexi, Rachel) I just wasn't impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and boring","review":"I only read this b/c my daughter ordered it and I figured what the heck. What a waste of time. It is trite, predictable and just downright BAD. Dont' waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this one","review":"Like many have previously said, this book was a let down. I STRUGGLED to get through it and really did get the impression it was something he had to get to the publisher fast. If you're deciding between this and another Sparks book, go with the other one. For the first time, I found myself anxious to put one oh his books down and essentially forced myself to finish. Mr. Sparks, please go back to developing those endearing charachters, because that's what I love about your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY VERY GOOD","review":"THIS STORY WAS VERY GOOD, LOVE STORY WITH A SURPRIZE AT THE NEAR ENDING OFTHE BOOK. I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH."},{"rating":"2","title":"At first sight (Jeremy marsh)","review":"This book will stir every emotion. This book will take you to another small town that Sparks writes about. Recommend everyone to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Boring, boring, boring and boring. Chewing pale emotions and useless thoughts throughout the book. After 150 pages I honestly gave up. Something happened in the characters' life before this book, and now it's only about thinking how it would be to become a parent and what would be if this didn't happen.Disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I work in a library and my co-workers and patrons seem to love everything Nicholas Sparks writes. However from reading True Believer and At First Sight I can't figure out what Nicholas Sparks could possibly have to offer me. Should I give his other books a chance or will it just be more of the same?"},{"rating":"2","title":"At First Sight","review":"Im reading it now. Im not really a reader but this book is a page turner. It a great love story and it is holding my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite Sparks book","review":"Not a fan of this. I really enjoyed True Believer and thought this was would a great extension of that story. Not so..characters became less and less like-able as the story went on and it was difficult to feel part of their connection and great love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH NICHOLAS SPARKS!","review":"Nicholas Sparks is one of the most sensitive writers around. He creates such believable characters, I really CARE for them. I don't cry easily when reading books or watching movies, but his books always bring tears to my eyes.This book is a bittersweet love story, one you won't want to miss. The characters of Jeremy Marsh and Lexie Darnell are endearing, though frustrating at times. Poor Jeremy gets bombarded from many directions ... but ... Well, read for yourself.Nicholas Sparks does it again ... and again ... and again! Readers don't just read his books; we EXPERIENCE them!No wonder he's so popular. A fine author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable but not worth the money...","review":"This book was on the bestseller's shelf at my local bookstore. I asked an employee about how books were selected for that shelf and was told that selection is based on a number of factors including positive customer reviews. Shocking. As a number of other customer's have commented on this site, this book was not worth the money it cost. It was silly, contrived and unrealistic.The cover of the book states that the writer is one of the best romance writers of all time. I typically don't read romance novels but I can't begin to imagine that that's possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about life, love and loss","review":"I waited a long time to finally read the sequel to True Believer. I enjoyed the continuing story and wasn't sure what to expect but was blown away by the end. However, I am still and always will be a Nicholas Sparks fan despite the tragedies that happen in his stories. If you are a true fan you will enjoy this book. I can't wait for his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"borrrrrring","review":"I gagged my way through The Notebook but thought I would give Nicholas Sparks another try. I read about 1/3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","review":"I love all Of Nicholas Sparks books! He doesn't ever disappoint me, I am ready for a new one to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book was a wonderful love story that was easy to fall in love with the characters, and broke your heart during the ups and downs. If you are looking for a page-turning book, At First Sight is it! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas, did you have to do that?","review":"Nicholas, you should be ashamed of yourself! After reading two books (this one and True Believer) trying to like Jeremy and Lexie and then you pull an ending like that. Couldn't you think of something else not quite so repulsive? Let me know next time and maybe I can suggest something.I have read 9 of your books and liked most of them immensely and the characters were easy to like and understand. Jeremy and Lexie do not fit that description. I didn't care for them right from the start and the further I read the less I cared for them.I will compliment you, however, on your writing skills. Even as unlikeable as the characters were, my attention was still held through both books. Maybe that was why I found the ending so distasteful -- I was too engrossed in the book.In all honesty, I will probably not read any more of your books, at least for a while, until my mind calms down from these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MY FAVORITE N.S.","review":"This is one of the saddest books Ive ever read...and not 'happy-sad', just plain 'sad-as-can-be sad'. It was good, not great, until the end. Why torture your loyal readers Mr. Sparks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"At First Sight","review":"Love all of Nicholas Sparks books, always look forward to a new one! Good clean reading, which is hard to find these day's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect read","review":"This was a fantastic book but with Nicholas Sparks as the author there was no doubt. He continues to be one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"the same story over again","review":"I didn't care for this story at all...I felt very manipulated by a formulaic bittersweet love story. It seems that this author has a formula where death (there's the bitter) is always involved and then something sweet comes of it in the end. However, just because a story tugs at one's heartstrings doesn't mean it's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what America reads?","review":"This is my first forray into this authors' work and, for me, the \\"Sparks\\" just didn't fly. I'm sure this is by design, but the reading level within is hovering at about the 5th grade standard. Said attribute is especially disconcerting because one of the main characters is a writer yet lacks any discernable command of English. I felt the dialogue was extemely mundane in a scenario where I felt- even assuming the 5th grade formula were in place- the author had opportunity. The Doris character could have been far more colorful and I was never convinced a writer was ever part of any conversation. Both the punctuation and sentence structure are excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The relationship from hell","review":"Just like Jeremy and Lexie's union, this book is really rather a waste of time. It puts you through a relationship from hell with no rewards in sight even if you manage to reach the back cover. This couple's courtship and marriage is a dispiriting affair peppered with doubts, lies and Lexie-laid emotional minefields that no intelligent man (as Jeremy was portrayed to be) would have tolerated for 10 minutes, never mind 277 pages. Even the poor old baby that the two managed to conceive during one of their few better moments didn't escape the misery that casts its shadow over all of this book. Threatened when in the supposed safety and comfort of Lexie's womb, doomed to be labeled a killer when it pops out, then inhabited by the restless spirit of its dead mother, this baby has been dealt one tough hand. Frankly, we would all have saved a lot of time and effort if Jeremy had stayed put and divorced on the Upper West Side."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"This was a gift for my daughter. She enjoyed the book very much. The condition of the item was just as described. The packing and shipping were done well and the book arrived in good shape. Thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I never read it","review":"Hi, I bought this book in September and just finished it in January. I know there was not as much time to read because of the holidays...but I dreaded picking up the book, it did not hold my attention. The ending made me raise my voice to I dare him write such a cheap ending...and all that detail about the prgenancy itself..to much info. I will not give up on him and I do have the Wedding on my desk right now, I still have faith, Take your time we would rather have less of really good writing, then a whole bunch of cra..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love/Hate","review":"As in True Believer, for me the these two just did not jell for me. How does one love in one week, when they spent so little time together? I could not get this story line. I hated the ending. Too tragic. I just have to admit that after reading most of Nicholas Sparks books, I keep hoping he will give us that happy ever after that we sometimes need to believe in. He does admit to writing tragic books and I guess after reading all but two of them, you'd think I would have gotten that already! In A Bend in the Road, the characters do get together and I'm sure somewhere down the road there will be a sequal and one will die! I guess when the end of True Believer ended so abruptly and nobody died, the sequel just had to have tragedy. But I think True Believer and At First Sight could have been one book. Then True Believer would have ended just like all the others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparks worst novel","review":"Although I didn't love True Believer I liked it enough to want to read the continuation of Lexie and Jeremy in At First Sight. I read about two thirds through and then just skimmed the rest of the book because I lost all interest. I don't mind a sad ending (loved The Notebook and A Walk to Remember) but the plot line was so dragged out that I was completely bored. The details of the pregnancy did not make for good reading and were too drawn out. The ending couldn't come fast enough for me--definitely his worst novel and I have read them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and poorly written","review":"The book is bad. In fact, after about 1/3 of it, I'm giving up. The internal dialogue is adolescent in its immaturity, and it is frustratingly repetitive. Where the story is going is obvious from the first chapter, and when I flipped ahead to see if it was as trite and predictable as I thought, indeed it was. Take a pass on this one. I recommend The Curious Incident of a Dog in the Night-Time--which also has a story that is without surprises, but is a very well-written book from the point of view of an autistic boy who offers amazing insights into \\"normal\\" behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to N. Sparks?","review":"I have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books. Im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote At First Sight. Like me, you probably loved all the characters in his previous books. He makes every character in this book NOT loveable! I kept asking myself, who am I rooting for? Do I care if things go well? The best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book - could have been a story in itself. I miss the old spark."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG BIG FAN OF MR. SPARKS","review":"Although Im a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks this book & its prequel True Believer 1 arent among my favorites. They just didn't have me all in. They did have some great characters in a very charming town but they just werent as great as some of his others. I still liked it! Just not as much as most of his others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"made me tear up","review":"nothing like reading a book & crying. great sequel to True Believer. I couldn't put this one down either. nice job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story...again!","review":"Nicholas Sparks is the King of surprising you with where he takes his stories. You think you know, and you are a,ways wrong as Nicholas throws on a surprise! Thanks Amazon for carrying his books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipped thru this one","review":"I didn't care much for the first in the series, and this one wasn't any better. What has happened to this author? It was just dragging on, so I skipped to the end. Actually I liked the end, it was the whole middle that was boring. Glad I got it from the library and didn't spend any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardback didn't come with paper cover","review":"I received the book within about a week, which was expected based on my shipping choice and since it was around Christmas. The book itself was in good condition, but there was no paper cover included. Since the book was advertised as \\"like-new,\\" I expected to have everything included, not the least of which would be a paper cover for a hardback book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I love Nicholas Sparks, don't get me wrong, but this is not his best book. Good, yes it was good. I enjoyed reading it. It just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to Nicholas Sparks novels","review":"I've been wanting to read a novel by Nick Sparks for some time, but when choosing my next book, somehow always passed on his. This time around i was determined and chose \\"At First Sight\\" randomly from his titles.The beginning didn't grab my attention as with some other novels, but i read on. After a few chapters i still was not attracted to the script and found it harder to follow along. Both main characters, Jeremy and Lexie, had weaknesses and were unrelatable. I found myself disliking them both at various points in the book. I did like the grandmother's character Doris, she seemed more realistic and did not annoy me. The plot was simple and many plot lines were not developed enough. I always felt like there was an intro and an end, but the body was missing.I am dissapointed in this novel. My expectations were much higher for Nicholas Sparks, he has an excellent reputation. I will try another one of his titles but i would not recommend reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another formula book","review":"The first 2 or three Sparks books that I read were pretty good. Entertaining and a mindless read that didn't take a lot of brain power. I passed them on to my 16 year old and she loves them. My objection is that they are all the same story with mostly the same characters. The names are just changed. Since my teen still likes them, I buy her the new one that inevitably comes out every Christmas. But you know your in trouble when you go to the book store, can't remember the authors name, so describe the story line to the clerk and they instantly come up with Nicholas Sparks. My description went something like this. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, girl dies. Not to mention the Christianity plug that is inserted more and more into every book. I am seriously wondering if Sparks even writes his own books anymore. If you really want to read these books, borrow them."},{"rating":"1","title":"what","review":"I was given this book as a hand-me-down by a coworker, and having heard about this author, I decided to give it a try. This was my first Nicholas Sparks book, so I read with an open mind and none of his other works to compare to this one. I found this story insubstantial and somewhat filler-ish, and wondered if Mr. Sparks always wrote like this.It is not until I come onto this site and see the reviews here that I realize that this was a continuation of another book. Given the disappointing ending to this book, I have no interest in reading the other one. I was prepared to give up on this author after this book, but after seeing some of the reviews here, I think I will read one of his higher-rated books and give him another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than True Believer","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read True Believer first and then started this one. True Believer was good but long to read. I couldn't really get into the story. Loved the characters but struggled with the writting of it. But I have this wierd thing that even if the book is slow I finish it because I can't handle not knowing what happened. This book moved alot easier. Loved the process of them learning about each other. And CRIED like a baby! Good book...defiently would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparks keeps your interest!","review":"This was my second book by Mr. Sparks, the other was \\"The Lucky One\\". Although, I noticed some similarities in the storylines or characters, I still enjoyed it very much. He does an excellent job of building his characters and putting enough twist and turns in the story at the right time to keep you wondering and interested.My next book is \\"A Walk to Remember\\", although I have already seen the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have by-passed this one","review":"The other reviews say it all.

If his name wasn't on it, I wouldn't have believed he wrote it. It's wordy, predictable, unbelievable, and just bad. If you're a Sparks fan, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Read","review":"I am glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of buying it. I was very anxious to read this book, but very disappointed in it. The characters were flat, and the plot seemed totally contrived.I had a very complicated pregnancy and doubt that the doctors would have let Lexi carry the baby to term. More than likely, she would have had a C-section before the due date. If that had happened in the book, then everything would have been ok, and Nicholas Sparks would have written a much more realistic book.Do not waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"We need new authors!","review":"Does it seem, to anyone else that once an author hits the best sellers list, they stay there no matter what fluff they churn out? I really enjoied Sparks earlier work, but come on, two books about these poor pathetic people who just want a happily ever after.To be fair, Sparks is an honest writer, and he has the ability to make people feel. I saw it comming and still got all misty. But I don't endorse it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapponited!!","review":"This was my very first novel by Sparks. I was soo looking forward to a good tear-jerker love novel, since I know of his work because the \\"The Notebook\\", the movie. Instead, I was very disapponited. I seen the ending coming and I agree with another comment, the main female character, made me mad, leaving me not to feel for her at the end. Mr. Sparks, I don't want to give up on you so soon but I think I need to come back to you at a later time. Any recommendation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"200 pages of overused cliches later ...","review":"After reading this book, I feel like Nicholas Sparks woke up in the middle of the night and went \\"aha! tearjerker moment!\\" and then quickly slapped together a story in order to get his \\"tearjerker moment\\" published. He could have easily done away with the first 200 + pages of the book, possibly leaving a better story at the end. I liked True Believer (enough to look forward to this one, anyway) as well as a few of his other books. This book was unsatisfying, the drama felt forced and the dialog dry. It was full of cliches', which made it feel poorly written. If it were his first book, perhaps I would be a little more understanding, but he's written so many! Any writer worth their stock should know to avoid the phrase, \\"And for the first time in what felt like forever\\".Very disappointed in this one. Would not recommend it, will not read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Nicholas Sparks, but needs to eliminate Femal Character","review":"I really like Nicholas Sparks books, and this one was pretty good, If you are gonna read it, read True Believer first this book is an extension of that story. I liked this book except i could not stand the lead female character Lexie in this book. It kind of bothers me that even when she's in the wrong ( which she is a lot in the book), the male charcater, Jemermy ( who's point of view we read it in) always end up apoligizing even though Lexie's the one being a jerk. I see that a lot in his books, the girls are always right even when they're wrong they always end up flipping it around. It's just worse in this book than the others. It got a little annoying, but other than that it was a good book, I loved the ending. I would suggest it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Through With Nicholas Sparks","review":"** CAUTION - MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!! **I started out as a Nicholas Sparks fan. The first few books I read of his were excellent. I felt he had the ability to provide a lot of dimension and insight into his characters. \\"The Notebook\\", \\"The Wedding\\" and \\"The Bend In The Road\\" were perfect examples. Unfortunately, I think he's beginning to run out of ideas. Too many of his books end up with a major character dying. Sorry - I even think I'll pass on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"At First Sight","review":"I have read all of Sparks' books, and have liked most of them, but this one was such a disapointment to me. The non-original plot of a story line, the added wannabe creepy mystery about its characters, and the horrible ending were anything but enjoyable. Why let your leading lady die in the end of the book? I would have enjoyed it better if she had lived and it was candy and cake for everyone as they lived happily ever after....yadda, yadda, yadda... How sad for Sparks' readers to have to be put through what can be called \\"dental surgery\\" of a book, sorry, Nick, but this one was not your best. Don't bother reading this one...it's going in my garage sale pile for a $1...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a lesson here","review":"I read this book cover to cover once a year or so and am always amazed at what I've missed in previous readings. Ms. Thomas eloquently shows knitting as the skilled craft that it is. Kudos to Dover for publishing it and its companion, Mary Thomas's Book of Knitting Patterns, at such a reasonable price. Mary Thomas is THE Knitting Goddess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concise little gem","review":"As with many Dover books, this one is information dense and packs a lot of detail in a small space. It covers a wide variety of knitting techniques and the accompanying hand-drawn diagrams are straightforward. While other knitting books may overexplain a technique to the point of confusion or boredom, this one is economical and precise. It serves well as a reference guide and learning book.Not only is it of value in terms of technique, but it serves as a wonderful primer for the history of knitting.The only caveat is that if one is an absolute beginner with no background in knitting, then the \\"Knitting for Dummies\\" books is easier to digest.All in all, a wonderful find at a wonderful price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great basic!","review":"I have a bookshelf of knitting books, and after reading over and over about Mary Thomas and her books, I finally broke down and purchased them. Wow! Am I impressed! She did an amazingly thorough job of writing, and of illustrating her volumes.

Quiller approaches the job in his usual efficient (albeit grouchy) style, but finds himself outsmarted ... at least for awhile.Quiller is a well-defined character: independent, even anti-social, perhaps suffering from a (perhaps justified) superiority complex. The other characters are more like caricatures, but the enjoyment of this novel comes from the intricate, twisty plot and from Quiller himself as he tries to out-think his adversary. Quiller is an intellectual spy, but there's plenty of action to offset the thinking and scheming. Fans of espionage/thriller novels should enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiller in Bangkok","review":"Quiller is the best. Attempting to prevent the shooting of a British Royal touring Bangkok, Quiller demonstates his expertise with a long range rifle. He is folled, and the Royal is kidnapped. Quiller saves the day by not making a shot in the final scene. Beautifully crafted suspense, from the master- Adam Hall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"What started as quite interesting, turned out to be rather mundane. Quiller, super-brain and second in world-importance only to The Person, fails to foresee what most readers would have guessed from the beginning. Never once does he suspect that when everything goes ever-so smoothly, something may not be quite as it seems. When I bought this e-book, I was thinking of \\"The Quiller Memorandum\\" which I remembered as very good. \\"The Ninth Directive\\" didn't come close to it, in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trademark house set from one of the USA's finest DJ's","review":"If you like house, you've definitely heard this disc. If you don't know what house is, this is the one disc you should hear. Farina starts off this set with three ass-shakin' deep house tracks: \\"Flame,\\" \\"Dreams of You\\" and \\"I Know\\" and then eases his way into a funky and groovy house set starting with \\"Feel your Body Talkin'.\\" Personally, I like the first 15-20 minutes of this album the most, especially \\"I Know,\\" which is an underground classic. Yet, the rest of the album is very good and would pack any dancefloor from Chicago to San Fran to Atlanta."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Chessmaster program EVER, so far!!","review":"This is the best version for the chess player who wants to improve his game. Everything happens on a layout that you like (lots of ways to customize). You can layer different windows that are relevant to you and remove others. Cool Windows such as 'database','captured pieces' or 'coach'. The database is a useful, but cumbersome tool. Some windows are limited in how they can be sized, and this is an irritant. Overall it is very good. CM7000 was a drastic change to a product that just needed to be refined. Jazzy, Polished look to 7000 but you must navigate several \\"rooms\\" to access all the features. To quote CM itself, \\"Yikes!\\". My son has serious concerns about CM8000 / Windows 2K compatibilty, but I have yet to try 8000 myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"We call it Wed Wock West !","review":"Bad title. Who can say it? It's either Red Rock Rest or Wed Wock West. Everything else is Wonderful. The opening scene where Nicolas Cage gets into clean clothes for his job interview is my old fashioned idea of sexy. The story builds the character of an honest man down on his luck who gets entangled with a murderous bunch. Even so, there is a fair amount of humor. I watch it regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Nicholas Cage Fans","review":"\\"Red Rock West\\" is a very, very quirky film, which never steps outside the bounds of hard reality. This is one of my favorite (small) Nicholas Cage films. There are no special effects here. Everything is carried along skillfully with the pure acting talents of its four main characters. Cage gets caught up in a somewhat complicated plot between a married couple who both want to murder each other. Adding to the threatening mayhem is Dennis Hopper who is in top form as a killer-for-hire. Who has the upper-hand at any given moment shifts around, but other than Cage, it's topsy turvey over the motives of the married couple, and exactly what Hopper will settle for. The ending is right on the money. The moral of the story may be that if your a down-on-your-luck drifter passing through Texas, you might want to think twice about any easy jobs that seem to fall into your lap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rewarding and richly subtle viewing experience.","review":"One of the best and most under-rated modern film noirs around. The cast are exemplary - Nicolas Cage is at his down-trodden best. The score is also fantastic - combining the mood of a noir thriller with the style of a western. Forget 'Last Seduction', this is John Dahl's masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caged Cage","review":"I love the simplicity of this neo-noir story's concept: an apparently, \\"honest to a fault\\" guy, tells one, seemingly innocent lie and finds himself trapped in a nightmare he can't extricate himself from. Very thought provoking - or so I think. Early Cage, at his sympathetic best; sexy, carnivorous, Lara Flynn Boyle (shoot me!); J.T. Walsh, as menacing as ever; and Hopper, not long after \\"Frank\\" in \\"Blue Velvet, and real, real good.\\" I think this was Dwight Yokam's film debut and he's good. No wonder he got other rolls. Lots of surprising twist and turns - keeps ya guessing.I'm sure lots of other reviewers bored you with the details, so I'll conclude with my 2 cents worth. It won no major awards, but I enjoyed every minute of it. However, why doesn't J.T Walsh get more credit? Way scarier than Hopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Rock West","review":"The sponsors of this movie really blew it by not releasing it in the theatres in the United States. They have a gem on their hands that they did not recognize.The story with all the twists and turns is great. All the actors are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent neo-noir","review":"The Bottom Line:The supporting characters steal the show a bit from flat leads Nicholas Cage and Lara Flynn Boyle, but Red Rock West is still an enjoyable neo-noir from John Dahl (Kill Me Again, The Last Seduction) which doesn't throw in arbitrary twists to cheat the audience and is consistently interesting; all things considered, this is an entertaining piece of filmmaking.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real sleeper of a thriller with many twists!","review":"This much overlooked little gem is on par with such films as Blood Simple,Fargo and One False Move. First time director John Dahl(The Last Seduction)also co-wrote this twister. The movie effectively keeps the viewers interested throughout the many plot twists. A stellar cast and a terrific small town setting add to the movie's charm. Do yourself a favour and add this baby to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific flick","review":"Very enjoyable movie. Does not require a lot of thought on the viewer's part yet is not a stupid movie. Great cast. Nicholas Cage, Lara Flynn Boyle, Dennis Hopper, J.T. Walsh. All work well together.

This book was the most relevant and useful.As it focuses only on the OT, it is not conclusive, but it does draw upon conclusions.

It's a really good (for TV) science fiction movie from the early 1970's. Irwin Allen uses some of his cast from his earlier TV series which is nice. Okay, some of the sets obviously look like models but it's still a fun movie from the \\"Master of Disaster\\" who, with this movie looked to be testing the waters so to speak for making his big screen disaster pictures later on. This burned on demand dvd may be as \\"official\\" as it's going to get.

Again, the starring female was not as beautiful as former Miss America Lee Meriwether, but she was quite attractive.

The title reeks of \\"gun nut\\" in all its negative connotations.I would suggest reading a book that is unbiased in discussing the politics of \\"gun control\\" and tries to dispassionately examine the topic rather than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Chords","review":"This product is music only, not instructions.

This book is being passed around my worksite now. The only one who didn't relate to it was a homosexual. All the others recognized the signs, symptoms and results of trusting the fairer sex.

You can add several pictures to a single page and then print them....whoopeeee. You don't need any help because that's basically all it can do.The problem is, as I had with another ArcSoft product, the fact that their software seems to tweak your OS a bit. After installing Photoprinter and rebooting, I noticed a mild power flicker that wouldn't go away. Processing speed seemed to also slow dramatically. After uninstalling, my OS went back to normal. I decided not to risk a second installation.I'm not sure why the previous user recommended this software because it has few redeemable features.

It is in the lower city at the foot of the stairway leading up to the Chateau Frontenac. I know because I was there in 1946, staying in that hotel in the very room the Cagney checked into. My parents and I had to vacate the room very quickly because Cagney was abruptly checking in. I always thought he was staying in the room at that time, but, having seen the film for the first time, I realized the room was filmed for that sequence. The outdoor cafe that was shown as Cagney was approaching the hotel was constructed on that little place outside the hotel. I was ten years old. Cagney was very curt with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Love Jimmy Cagney and B/W movies, but this one felt a little flat.I won't divulge any spoilers, but the title is misleading... it only makes sense in the final few moments of the movie.

This film demonstrates clearly that Cagney was one of the worst actors of all time. He is so wooden. He even walks stiffly. The others characters are so sterotypic that it is comic. The only good acting jobs are the German spy and French mayor. In addition, there is an off screen narrator with a strident, metallic voice who makes a bad movie even worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloak and Cagney go together . . .","review":"13 RUE MADELEINE is one of Hollywood's last stand against the Axis--a post WWII film that explains our cloak and dagger OSS effort which helped whip those sneaky Nazis. The Cloak and Cagney go well together in this film. Cagney captured my pleasant attention since for once he was acting and not making a bully of himself. 13 must be measured against its' historical contribution to movies. It does help explain the American fear of Nazi and Japanese spies at the onset of WWII. We, in fact, had no credible military intelligence until the OSS. As Hollywood's attempt through this film to continue WWII should have rated only 4 stars, however I gave it the extra 5th star because the German soldiers were not portrayed as inept morons.

No, the songs here are not Mozart (or Laurie Berkner), but they get my storytime audience moving and counting, and many of the songs lend themselves nicely to motions or flannelboards.

He uses the wording of the Constitution itself, as well as background sources, to support his arguments. For example, he explores the debates and compromises of the Constitutional Convention, and he uses amendments considered but not passed to explain the intentions of our Founding Fathers. His discussion of governmental infringements upon the Constitution begins early in American history and ends in the present day. Such an encompassing work is admirable, but Napolitano's structure is easy to follow, and his writing style is engaging.

Its a remake of epic drama by Kurusowa else I would have given it a 9. M Rajan is very good as 'Yadav'. Film has fantastic background score. Even though its a remake its a good remake. This is Raj Sippy's first film. After this one he made 'Josh' which is another Amjad Khan film. If you are an Amjad Khan fan then this is a film to watch.

It will make you laugh at one moment and cry the next. I am not a woman and after reading this book (at my wife's request!) I have a new understanding for the way woman are and the way they view their own virtue. Being a man makes you forget how much women in general have to strive to be virtuous.

You'll want to take their hands and help them. And there are some characters that you just won't like at all! Some truely mean people.This is a quick read and a very enjoyable, hard to put down book.

Jack is lonely and loves Ruby the first time he sets eyes on her. So when Ruby's unfaithful/abusive husband John dies from an accident, the two get together and marry. They share a few happy years together until Ruby comes down with lung cancer, and dies. Jack is so grief-stricken, he cannot move on with his life, and the book continues that way at the end more or less.I wouldn't waste my time reading this book when there is much better reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you have the time?","review":"I read a great deal and most all gifts to me are books. Being raised in the south, I love southern literature. This book failed to evoke any response in me except that I felt that I was wasting my time in finishing it. It was sad and hopeless, as am sure it was meant to be, but the characters were under developed and failed to connect with me on any level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I kept waitng for something to happen.

Boy, was I in for a shock when I read the first couple of pages. I was instantly depressed, sad, and ready to close the book for good. Even though I finished the book, I didn't like it. I really didn't sympathize or relate to any of the characters. The story was touching and had a good plot, but I felt it could have been written better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Laugh out Loud Book!","review":"Took a couple of chapters, a mere two dozen pages or so to get my bearings, but once I did, I flew through it. I laughed out loud and read aloud to my husband and sons the phrases and images that made me laugh till tears leaked out the corner of my eyes. I saw something of every widower I've ever known and hold vivid pictures in my mind of a place I've never really been to. The grammar is a little difficult, but at least it's consistently first person and uniform throughout. I loved it and will doubtless read it again, or at least those parts that touched my heart. I only wish there had been more of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching story","review":"I read this book because of the Oprah show. I am glad that I did. It was a very touching and moving story. I became entangled in the characters' lives. It took me through a range of emotions from sadness to joy. It is a book I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and monotonous","review":"Although a short book, \\"A Virtuous Woman\\" kept me occupied for a while mainly because I had to persevere to finish it. I never did finish it as boredom prevented me from doing so. The linguistic style was very colourful although it became rather irritating after a while. This of course may be because I know very little of the culture of the southern United States and thus found it difficult to empathise with the characters. However, I found it depressing and lacking in depth and had to resign myself to the fact that I was never going to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching in its sweetness","review":"Sweet little story of a Jack and Ruby who after 25 years of marriage have to deal with the inevitability of Ruby's lung cancer.It's narrated by both Jack and Ruby, and put together beautifully, in one chapter Ruby describes her past, and the next, Jack hiring a helper to look after him after her death.There are many poignant parts of the book, Ruby cooking and freezing food for Jack to eat after she's gone, and Jack sprinkling their bedsheets with her favourite powder, hoping to entice her spirit back.It's genuinely a sweet love story of two people who, despite the odds, found each other and comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"This is a very slight novel providing a glimpse into the lives of a few people, but no real insight into any of them. I guess the main feature is the unlikely love story between two of the protagonists. None of the characters came to life for me and ultimately the novel is totally forgettable. I was left thinking so what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could hardly wait to finish this book","review":"I was glad it was short. It should have been a quick read but it wasn't. I labored to get through it. I was determined to finish to get my moneys worth. I was very disappointed and bored. I realize it was written in the narrative style but I found it too simple. The story line jumped around too much. I found it irritating. I can't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"O.K. I read it, all of it. I'm still waiting for the point, because it's obvious that it wasn't written to entertain. At least, I hope not. Sheesh what a B-O-R-I-N-G read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time waster","review":"So, let's see. A virtuous woman is one who'll marry anyone who asks her to, one who'll leave considerate parents without a backward wave because a man with an attractive face suggests doing so, one who decides to take up a distasteful habit to prove she's capable of vice. Each of the characters in this one-dimensional book is either exclusively good or exclusively bad. That choice of character template is lazy and insulting to readers who're aware that humanity can't be sorted so effortlessly. This review is based on the first ten chapters of the book. I wish I'd had the good sense to quit reading beyond chapter one. This is the last book I'll select based on its inclusion in Oprah's \\"list.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in my book club...","review":"I found this novel to be dull and tedious, despite the fact that it should have been a quick read. While it is touching in parts, overall, I found it to be uninteresting. You can keep this book in your book club, Oprah. It is no longer in mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was \\"so what\\". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - Listened to it on CD","review":"I listened to this book on CD - an UNabridged version. It was wonderful. Gibbons writing style is well suited to listening to the book. Tom Stechulte did an excellent job showing Jack's compassion and love for his dying wife, Ruby. Check the book on CDs out at your library and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have passed","review":"I read this book after reading her other novel Ellen Foster. I liked Ellen Foster very much and I would recommend that novel, but this one I do not know. The language was difficult. Gibbon's technique of switching back and forth between Jack and Ruby was difficult to grasp. Many times, I had to re-read to understand what was going on. Basically...I did not get it. The story lack depth and completion of some loose ends. The most enjoyable parts were with Cecil and Miss Mavis. I laughed aloud during those two sections but other than that I could have passed. If I had read this one first, I do not think I would not have touched Ellen Foster, which was worth the read. I read this on the recommendation of Oprah. I know she is not the official word on what to read but I put a lot stock in what she says and this one did not cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, esp for an Oprah recommend.","review":"Certainly not terrible, but I am at a loss why Oprah picked this for her book club. Never cared too much for characters, annoying dialogue and narration, just a forgetable novel for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never did find the virtue.","review":"I found this novella extraordinarily long and tedious. Seriously, I have read War And Peace twice (the Garnett and the Maude translations) and it reads faster than this...this...The characters were two-dimensional; the language was glib and trite. It had no editing (there were SEVERAL grammatical errors!). The theme lacked importance; that is, I could never see past the tedium of their lives and their love for each other seemed to be a misplaced greed for need--\\"what will you do for me.\\"If someone handed this book to me and told me to read it I would suspect them of some sort of devious intent and a basket full of hidden crimes.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just going \\"nowhere\\"","review":"This book seemed to drag.. and drag.., nothing was trully happening and it just ended !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the virtuous woman?","review":"There was not a single virtuous person in this book from what I read. Jack was the closest to it and he isn't a woman. I read this book because the front had Prov 31 and I falsely assumed that the book would have a christian foundation at least. But alas, no virtuous people or woman and certainly no Christ. a shame. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but Sweet Little Story","review":"\\"A Virtuous Woman\\" is a short novel about an unlikely married couple who really make it work and come to depend on each other. The woman, Ruby, is 20 years younger than her husband, Jack. Ruby is dying of lung cancer, and the story is told by both Jack and Ruby in alternating chapters.The writing style is similar to that we loved about \\"Ellen Foster.\\" It's a fast read. But be careful. Don't read the ending on a bus or in a carpool, and have plenty of tissues on hand.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Virtuous woman","review":"I really did not care for this book very much at all. I found it to be pointless. It is a quick read but at the end of the day what was the point? I am not sure. I did not connect with the characters and when it it all said and done felt like who cares???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"Jack and Ruby love each other, although it is an odd match. Although poor, they are noble in their way.What bothered me about this book is the alternating chapters between Jack and Ruby's telling of the story. The chapters also jumped around in time. The disjointed presentation prevented me from identifying with or caring about either one of them. It's a love story and another Southern novel that emphasizes the social and economic importance of owning land. That's it - no real message and nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a love story, but wow...","review":"Hard to imagine anyone other than Kaye Gibbons writing a story of simple love between two people with troubled histories - and bringing it off with such beautiful panache. Told principally in flashbacks as Jack Stokes is grieving over Ruby's death, the tale of their dissimilar backgrounds, courtship, and improbably successful marriage is written with unsentimental straightforward power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Breathtaking, and Perfect","review":"This novel is a beautiful and breathtaking masterpiece. It is a light novel, but will leave a major impact on you when you are finished with it. I would consider it a General Fiction, set in the South and in the Country, with down-home people. I think this is Kaye's best novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unenjoyable","review":"I don't know, maybe I am missing something, but it appears to me that Ruby and Jack's relationship was based on need, not love. Love is not cooking 3 months worth of meals for you spouse while you're on death's door, or missing all the house keeping someone did for you after they are gone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found the book to be touching.","review":"I found the first half to be sweet but slow . The ending was excellant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human nature is the same regardless of money, race or location","review":"In the end you just have to feel empathy for Jack and come to understand that for all his simple ways he was in fact a complex man capable of deep emotion. That point is brought out time and time again for all the main characters who on the surface seem to be card board stereotypes and then we are fooled. Even Tiny Fran you understand that underneath her meaness was her sole desire to be loved by anyone. This is a quick and absorbing read but don't be surprised if you turn the last page wishing for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet my expectations....","review":"I'd heard good things about this book.

I suspect that that's because the CR-V instructions would be too involved - you have to disassemble the interior of the bottom and bottom-left part of the cargo area to get to the plug in the car's wiring harness that connects to the trailer harness. The seller's Customer Service has not responded (not yet, anyway), but I found information elsewhere on the internet that enabled me to install it, albeit with some difficulty.As I said, it works well once installed, but I'd recommend doing your research before buying instead of after, as i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Fun Bedtime Story","review":"No Bed Without Ted is a delightful lift-the-flap book about a little girl who won't go to bed until she's found her ted. The rhythmic text and comic-like illustrations make this a really fun book to share with a young child at bedtime.My four-year-old daughter enjoys reading this book at her bedtime. She likes lifting the flaps to see if ted is hiding under them. She thought that the surprise ending was rather funny too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond silly!

A few weeks later I ordered a copy and immediately began using it. With a couple of exceptions, everything I've made from this cookbook has been a little off, flavor-wise. Although I still love this cookbook, I use it as more of a guide, since I know I will have to make some modifications in order for the food not to be bland. I do not recommend this book for anyone who is somewhat uncomfortable in the kitchen or just learning to cook. With the blandness that I've found in many of the recipes, an inexperienced cook may believe they've done something wrong or be afraid to experiment. But if you love having a basic recipe and then making it your own, I would recommend this, as it has definitely helped me cook more healthy foods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title says it all !","review":"Title says it all !

These early songs were a catalyst in the group's initial success with appearances on such shows as The Smothers Brothers, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour. The Ed Sullivan Show and American Bandstand. With each member's unique talent, this could have definitely been a 2 CD package. As a fan I wanted more of the memories of the original members. But for those that recall the most radio heavy aired tunes, they are included right here. I also appreciated Todd Everett's seven page history of the group's evolution and update of each band member."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why omit some of their BEST in a \\"BEST OF\\"?","review":"Is it lunacy or pettiness that motivates a label to fail to release one of the BEST songs of The First Edition?

And it ought to be in every First Edition \\"best of\\"--it was one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Album","review":"This album features music recorded between the years of 1967 and 1974. It is a fine collection of great songs. I do agree though with some of the other comments that this group made a heck of a lot of classic oldies and it would be great to see more of them on compact disc. As it happens most of the groups material has at some time or other been on CD, but not usually in the origanal album format, but as part of many complations.Great classics that didn't make this one include \\"It's A Crazy Afternoon\\", \\"Then I Miss You\\", \\"Mamas Waiting\\" (Rogers later did this as a solo act - i think that version is even better), \\"Goodtime Liberator\\", \\"Mission Of San Nohero\\", \\"Calico Silver\\", \\"Hurry Up Love\\", etc, etc.Notheless this CD is great and features all eight of the bands top 40 singles such as \\"Reuben James\\", \\"Heed The Call\\" and their world beating chart-topper \\"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pickup good - preamp great!","review":"This thing is perfect for church (or other live venue) pianos: sounds good and is almost invisible.

Great for the studio!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the lift the flap version","review":"This book is okay for everyday objects, dress, ball, tricycle, but not for learning colors. The name of the objects as well as the color are listed instead of focusing on the name of the color being addressed. Also some of the colors were not very well defined, for example, pink was so dark it looked almost red and the red shoes looked pink, the shade of gray used was too dark, nearly black, and too many of the objects had more than one color (ball was blue and white, coat was black and white) instead of being a solid color to go with the color that page was focusing on."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"We have this book for our baby and now give it as a gift to anyone we know having a baby.

The downside is that many of the photos are one inch square...hard to take in all the design efforts that went into the cover art, which is what this book is all about. Another minor complaint is that some of these covers have extensive ring wear, obviously from being a part of the author's own LP collection and not from the original films used to produce the covers (Hipgnosis still has ALL their transparencies, yet I guess it was easier or cheaper to not contact them and ask permission to use the originals).

Ali is to stupid to even put on the shoes let alone tie them. (By the way, I love that analogy. I plan on using it whenever I can). I usually enjoy Jance's books but this one just doesn't measure up and I doubt that I will read any more of the Ali series. I didn't even finish it, and that's rare for me. I found myself talking back to the audio version because I couldn't believe that anyone would do the stupid things she did. My next one is the Beaumont series, hopefully that is more suspenseful and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A web that quickly falls apart...","review":"The first half was pretty good and kept me thinking, but the last half was really bad and nearly left me labotomized.

This read was a minor stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the blog!","review":"I read all of the Alison Reynolds series, and found the whole blogging part just annoying. It was like the writer was trying too hard to show she was up on the latest computer fad and was just wholly uneccessary. Same thing with Patricia Cornwell in her early Kay Scarpetta books. Most people know computers these days, we are not impressed that you do too. It's overkill."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a steamer!","review":"Phew! Avoid this if you possibly can. Her work is generally top drawer. Not this one! Slow, non-believable characters, transparent plot, inane heroine - this one's got all the elements of a non-read.

Jance book I could not finish. I had read the previous Ali book, and was not too impressed, but since I have always liked J. A. Jance, I tried this one.The plot is silly and unbelievable and contrived. No one getting a divorce would hang out with the \\"new\\" wife like Ali did here. I find it hard to care about any of the characters. I have a 100 page rule, if I don't like a book after 100 pages I stop, but I did go past that here just because of the author. Not worth your time and far from her best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is preposterous","review":"The author should, first of all, avoid any plot that involves legal matters. In another book, she included a private judge, without understanding how that concept works and ignorant of the differences between a private judge and a sitting judge. In this case she includes the time-honored, and non-existent \\"reading of the will.\\" This allows her to have the wife and her intended successor in close contact in a meeting with attorneys present when, in fact, clients would never have been present at such a meeting. Although attorneys for both parties are present, the heroine is allowed to do and say stupid things, all to her detriment. In fact, throughout the book (I've only read a third of it and won't bother with the rest), she acts stupidly, all contrary to her best interests and to common sense. I can't take any more. I suggest that others not even read page one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I sat down with this book and found it difficult to stop reading!!! So I just kept at it because the book just kept getting better and better...If you're interested in a great plot, with just as terrific subplots, twists and turns, pick up Web of Evil---just remember NOT to have plans that will take you away from Ali Reynolds!I am a great J.A. Jance fan as I have read (almost) all of her books (need to do some catch up on the Brady series), but I have never really found any of her books lacking in excitement or a good feeling of family.For those of you out there who might be new to any of Ms. Jance's series, I highly recommend any and all of them and to begin from Vol. 1 of each!!AND ENJOY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoyed this book.

I felt the protagonist, Ali, was very poorly written. She is presented as a bright, talented, ex-TV anchor--someone who should have a good head on her shoulders. Yet her actions are not those of an intelligent woman but rather those of an immature adolescent. The plot was not believable. I never felt \\"inside\\" this book, but always an unbelieving observer. Read the J.P. Beaumont series instead and give Ali a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Web of Evil","review":"I have never read any of the Jance books that aren't exceptional and I am really enjoying this new Ali Reynolds series.

I knew I was in trouble when the reader used three different tones for Ali's mother in their (Ali's and her Mother's) first conversation. In addition, if you are going to pronounce really complicated words like bougainvillea you should look up the proper pronunciation. (This is sarcasm in case the point was missed.) This story and level of writing is so sophomoric and pathetic that by the time April and Ali are in the kitchen, I am cheering for April and the story goes downhill from there. As a fan of the early Beaumont and Brady series, (the latter stories have been horrendous) it almost makes me think someone else is now writing for her. I will never purchase another Reynolds's story or anything read by Karen Ziemba.

I thought Stephanie Plum was too stupid to tie her shoe laces but Ali Reynolds is too stupid to put the shoes on! She does everything she's been told not to do, goes against advice from far smarter people, and just ignors plain common sense with a self rightous attitude that no one is going to tell her what to do or not to do. Then she has the unmitigated gaul to play the \\"poor me\\" card when she gets in over her head - again and again and again.....And the writing was so awful I couldn't believe J. A. Jance wrote this book. The same inane information is repeated over and over as if either Jance forgot she had already told us, couldn't think af anything new to say, or thought her audience was as stupid as her character.

I can't feel sorry for her when she won't even help herself. This started out good, but boy is this (or she) stupid.

The writer, Nance, must hate women. This lead character was written as a real jerk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"J.A. Jance Lite","review":"I won't repeat the plot. I've read all of her Joanna Brady series and most of the JP Beaumont series, and I found myself wondering where is J.A. Jance in this book?

This book is readable, but just barely, seems to be mostly fluff with little substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a mystery, but also a look at divorce","review":"I give J.A. Jance her share of credit in eventually bringing out that many divorces have two sides. Ali Reynolds calls the husband she's divorcing, who turns up dead before the divorce is granted, \\"Fang\\", shades of Phyllis Diller. However after venting her anger at husband Paul's cheating, she does eventually see how she may have contributed to the bad marriage. At any rate, this is an engrossing mystery. Ali does become a prime murder suspect although Jance points out that the LAPD is doing its job in considering other possibilities. The author obviously targets her stories at a female audience, but as a guy, I can still enjoy many of her books. I especially enjoy the emphasis on Ali Reynolds as an internet blogger in this series.I also enjoy the Sedona, Arizona, locale for this series as I lived in the Verde Valley area for a few years.All in all, an enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Web of Evil","review":"This story started out like a chick story, but soon we were engrossed in the story and could not wait to figure out all the twists and turns till the mystery was solved.

But this album shows a lot of her weakest material. A few of the songs from her '88 and '90 albums lack the excitement of the selections from her '87 debut album. They're surprisingly bland. Tiffany didn't have the conviction that her rival competition, Debbie Gibson, had. I would have liked an 18-song collection to have shown her variety from the MCA albums, not this limp, mediocre, badly thrown together album from 1996. It looks nonexistent for a compilation.

I used it a couple of times a week off and on throughout the summer, but last week it stopped working. It lasted about three months before the gears stripped out. Not a very good lifespan for the money I paid for it. Will I buy another? No. I guess I'll go back to moving my sprinkler or paying more for something that will actually last longer than 3 months.

Easy to set up and use. A few words of caution for its use:1) Be careful having it travel close to delicate plants. The force of the water two feet from the arms actually shredded some of my canna leaves. 2) The sprinkler will bog down in mud because of its weight.

I asked for a supervisor hoping she'd understand that I paid extra and needed this quickly. With NO apologies or sympathies offered for costing me extra or for the inconvience, she cooly said 2 weeks was the best they could do because they were so backed up. I guess with that type of business, losing one customer like me doesn't matter to them, so beware if you need replacment parts or your order arrives with missing parts!I am upset and disappointed with Nelson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working correctly","review":"Have had this product for only a month and have used it four times.

If I read the information provided with the product correctly, it has a high setting that is supposed to move at ~40' per hour and a low that is supposed to move at ~20' per hour. The first time I used it, it seemed to work fine but then it slowed down dramatically on the second use and is now very slow. On the high setting it now takes the unit I purchased ~7 hours to go 75'(~11 feet per hour). During the last use I heard a clicking sound from the unit as it moves (barely). I do not recall if it made this same sound the first three times I used it, but I believe there is a problem.

I just ordered a transmission last month, and in 3 weeks it has already broke, so I called them like I had in the past when I had a problem with a replacement part, in a nutshell, I was treated terribly, told I was out of luck that I would have to purchase another transmission.

This new ramp system with the button on the bottom of the tractor doesn't work. The tractor would hit the button like 80% slowing the flow enough so the spinner would stop spinning. This stopped the tractor, meaning it just sprayed the same exact patch of grass until you noticed it.Sad.Amazon gets 5 stars though for taking it back and paying return shipping on a freaking 20 pound hunk of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good product","review":"I bought one of these tractors a couple of months ago. I used it about 3 times per week with a 100 ft hose. I like that the radius and speed are adjustable so I can control how much and where the water is distributed.

On one occasion, it jumped the ramp and ran until it hit the fence.

This sprinkler has little evaporation due to the way it waters. Water sprays in a stream from the ends of the watering wands and not from multiple holes which create a lot of fine spray which can evaporate before the water hits the ground.

Don't know if they can go in the recycle bin.There are a lot of reviews complaining about the gear problem.

The tractor can even follow the hose around gentle 10' radius curves. The little ramp clips on the hose and has a folding ground spike to keep it from slipping. When the tractor reaches the ramp, it pushes a shut off valve on the belly of the tractor. Very simple and effective. Part of our ramp finally snapped off, but it still works. We've never had a problem with the tractor. The adjstable spray wands allow you to regulate the size of the area covered. I suppose it can drag about forty feet of hose before it slows it down. That probably will vary depending on the depth and density of your turf and how straight the path is.You won't be disappointed; this is a time-tested classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, useful, and labor-saving","review":"I moved into a new house recently, with a big yard that's half sod and half recently-seeded dirt. Like a previous reviewer, I've been spending most of my free time moving sprinklers around.This travelling sprinkler was a gift from my father-in-law. It looked like a novelty product that the kids would play with, but it's become one of the most useful lawn care devices I've ever owned.I set mine up as soon as I get home from work and let it spend a few hours watering the sod while I have dinner with my family, take the kids to their sporting events, etc. It does a great job and gives excellent coverage, with very little effort from me.One note: as it says in the fine print on the side of the box, don't use this on a recently seeded patch of soil. I tried that before I saw the warning and the tractor got stuck in the mud and dug a trench across the back yard. My fault completely, but watch out that you don't repeat my mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too slow for large yards.","review":"The throughput is too low. I have a metered water timer. When I set the time to 2 hours using a oscillating or pulsating sprinkler, it takes 2 hours. With this Rain Train set to 2 hours it takes 4 1/2 hours to apply the same amount of water. It takes twice as long to water the same amount of grass. The other problem I've noticed is that yellow stopper device that turns off the rain train doesn't work. The tractor sits too deep in the grass and catches the bottom side of the stopper. I have not been able to get this thing to stop yet. The tractor turns well until it is dragging a lot of hose behind it, then it tends to go off track(hose) more easily.Where I have found good use for this sprinkler is my side and front yard. For small areas, the rain train is ideal. You can set the sprinkler to water an area as small as 15 ft and up to 55 ft. Of course, the bigger the area, the less water that gets applied per application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad nylon gears","review":"I sent an inquiry a few days ago to the company, and have not received a response.

I live in an arid area where we have to water if we want to sustain foliage, so this type of traveling sprinkler is excellent for the convenience it provides. In my experience with this sprinkler, it wears out after a few years. Also they are delicate, you may have to reattach the wands from time to time.

I would buy another should the need arise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Satisfied","review":"I bought this item because of its reputation. At first I was very pleased with the item, it was making laps around the yard, and seemed to be doing great. So one night I drug my hose around, and made my nice track, and put the shutoff about 15 ft from the end of the hose. Well, I got up the next morning, and it was still going. It had come off the track, and had run into the flowerbed. Needless to say it was stuck. Just so you know I was using a 5/8\\" heavy duty hose, so I really wouldn't think it would jump off track. Now the gears are stripped and I had to order a new motor from Nelson. Cost me $23 for a new motor. Oh and did I mention this was only 2 weeks after I purchased the product. I love the product, and the concept just hate the plastic gears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love this sprinkler.

This was a bad idea and did not work. As soon as the ground beneath the Rain Train was damp, the front wheels started to sink into the ground. Before long, it stopped moving forward and the front wheels were completely sunk in.Because this thing is pretty heavy and the front wheels are very narrow, I cannot imagine this being usable for new seed-based lawns. Maybe it would work fine with sod.I will clean the mud off and store it in my garage until I have grass and try again and update my rating (probably next spring). Back to pulsating rotary sprinklers!

Then it started leaking a huge amount of water out the bottom and didn't have enough pressure coming out the sprayer to keep it going.I took it apart to try and find the problem. I was surprised that only the front body of the sprinkler is metal. The entire rear assembly, including the housing, wheels, gears, and all internal parts are made from cheap plastic. The molded housing that connects the water from the hose coupling (on the outside) to the sprayer (on the inside) had cracked and split, allowing the water to leak out inside the sprinkler.It was apparent from the damage that the housing had cracked from some force on the hose coupling. I have been very gentle with this sprinkler, and not abused it, or torqued it by the hose. Most likely it was from the force of dragging the 100' hose around, which is what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad they cheapened a good thing","review":"We've had a Nelson Rain Train for years. Each one lasted for years. We are on our third one. The others worked like a charm. The front wheels were heavy metal as were all working parts. Now we have purchased a real pain. It's hard to believe they could cheapen it so badly. We never know whether it is on or off since it will turn itself off for a blade of grass. It doesn't stay on track so we never know where it might have transported itself. We can't leave it alone for a minute. Now, after reading some reviews, we understand it might strip its gears at any point. Should have read the reviews before we bought but thought we were getting the previous quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO LITE TO STAY ON TRACK","review":"My sprinkler was purchased from Amazo.comThis is my third Walking Sprinkler.

I built a new house so my yard has been tilled and I planted new seed. The problem that I experienced is the raintrain gets STUCK. What happens is the raintrain waters in a circular pattern but when it travels to where it has already watered it gets stuck. It looks like they would have designed it to only water behind the raintrain. It may work better on an already established lawn but I do not recommend this product if you are wanting to water a new lawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet","review":"I have used many different traveling sprinklers since I was a child and this is the best I have ever used. I currently own two, the John Deere which I have owned for 5 months and a Nelson 1865 Raintrain which I have owned for around 7 years. Even after its time in service, the Nelson is performing much better than the JD.I am a former military member and have had to take care of many different lawns and this sprinkler has worked well on all of them. The ability to adjust the speed of the movement and the circumference of the spray has been a lawn saver on many occasions. One of the best things about the Nelson 1865 is its ability to pull long hoses. I currently use a 150 ft hose and it has never slowed the sprinkler or pulled it off track. At the current price, you will never find a better bargain for a poor man's auto sprinkler system. I love this thing so much I have decided to order anther one to replace the John Deere."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"i'd have given it 0 stars if i could. the gears are made out of plastic, and are prone to stripping if the tractor is not used in optimal conditions. i broke mine 3 times (returned each time) when it would get stuck in the mud, against a small rock or something similar. when used in optimal conditions, this item works, but i'd recommend getting a rittenhouse instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sprinkler","review":"I love this little tractor. Once I bought a long, actually very long, hose I can lay the hose round my lawn and let tractor go, then the tractor will follow the hose around the lawn by itself. I can put it in action then do my thing, and come back in a couple of hours or longer (depending on the speed you set).The only thing I think it can be improved is the speed. Even I set it the fastest, it still goes kind of slow. I know the designer of the sprinkler wants to make sure the sprinkler waters the lawn thoroughly but I wish that it could go a bit faster. Sometimes I don't want to soak the lawn that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"better as an anchor","review":"I have had this sprinkler for 2 years or so. I find it agravating as heck. I cannot leave if it is on. The ground needs to be flat and hard for it to traverse, or it will sink in soft, or muddy dirt, or just get stuck. The sprinkling effect only covers the outer radius of a circle, rather than the whole area of said circle. I am looking for a better unit. 1-star is the lowest they had to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but doesn't get the job done","review":"I bought this sprinkler to deal with a newly seeded lawn that I needed to water daily. I liked the idea that this sprinkler can move through a relatively large area unattended. I dislike this sprinkler because it \\"jumps\\" the hose regularly (even though it is laid straight, nothing in the way), it's gears on high-gear stripped after half a season and finally it's just slow to cover the area it is trying to cover - my old sprinkler (back and forth fan style) put just as much water down in less time so even though I would have had to move it a few times - at least I could water the lawn in an evening.

Will be ticked if they don't pay postage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good option for large areas to water","review":"This is an innovative product that is easy to assemble, set up and use. Really clever design.The good:1. Waters large areas of lawn and eliminates the need to constantly move hoses and sprinklers.2. Ease of use.3. Auto shutoff4. Powered by water pressure.5. Adjustable in terms of pattern and amount of water to be added to lawn.6. Really good price for what it does. Appears to have high quality construction and parts.The bad:1. Probably not great for newly seeded lawns. The weight of the hose will soon be too much for the tractor to pull and it will get stuck in the mud. It needs the root system of established grass or sod to maintain traction.2. Occasionally jumps the guiding hose and goes rogue. Not sure why.3. Rarely shuts off prematurely if a dirt clod or bump is big enough to push the shutoff button.Overall I am very happy with this item. It allows you to water a lot of grass without having to move hoses or even be present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept sprinkler - poor reliability","review":"I bought this sprinkler in 2008 to water an acre or more of grass, only to have it 'derail' and get stuck - subsequently stripping the cheap plastic gears.

I bought a super expensive hose thinking the hardness of it would be difficult for the tractor to ride over, but it still jumps the hose. I bought a super cheap hose thinking that maybe a lighter hose behind it will make it easier for the tractor to pull and won't pull it off track. Neither worked. EVERY time I use this thing I have to watch it or I end up watering the neighbor's lawn. Today when I tried it with another new hose, thinking I'd finally bought the perfect hose for it, I came to check on how it did with the first turn and found it in the middle of the street watering the street.

Too many typos to recollect. They rushed this book to press to make a buck - I paid the price in $ and misery wading through all of its errors. What was really bad was all the instances where the authors did not know what they were writing about - not just typos, they had no clue what they were writing about. Tim Crouthers and Luther Stanton are two authors that I will definately stay away from now on. Live and learn. It's very difficult to study for a test relying on a source that provides no confidence. A happy note - when I realized I had been taken, I redoubled my efforts and passed Workstation. Of course, I attribute my success to the Microsoft Press books I purchased, not this rag. Bad call New Riders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coverage of the material but terribly flawed.","review":"This book appears to have gone to publishing without ever having been proof-read. The material that the authors cover is fairly well organized, however there are numerous errors in the text.At times the authors contradict themselves, and at least 20 of the practice questions give an obviously wrong answer. There are also instances in the book where editing comments remain. On page 290 for example, there is a line reading \\"???Is it System Event Log (as above) or System Log (as below)?\\" - obviously a line that was not supposed to appear in the final text. Even the inside cover is in error - it lists 10 steps for passing the NT Server exam (not the NT Workstation exam).Overall, I don't think this book does a adequate job of preparing someone for the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING STAY AWAY","review":"This book was actually a hinderance to gaining an MCP qualification.

An incredible voice, great lyrics, intense, orgininal, and adept guitar playing, rock solid drumming, and pristine production from Steve Albini make this album a must. I think that what I like most about listening to this album, however, is that it connects me to my memories of seeing Shannon Wright live.

The bits are well-made and we expect this kit to last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case doesn't even hold up","review":"I tried to order this twice, but both times it arrived with a cracked case. Whether it's on Amazon for subpar packing or the carrier for unnecessary roughness is of little consequence. If it can't hold up in transit, it's not going to last long on the work site. The tools appeared to be okay, but wouldn't expect them to last long. Probably a decent set for the casual homeowner with light use, but I don't recommend this for any serious project. I returned both and went after a DeWalt set that had 10 fewer pieces at the same price point.

But if the towel rack is falling out of the wall, you need to run some cables, or the cat is tearing up the furniture and you've had enough, this is a great starting point. Has a little bit of everything so you can do at least one of something to find out which bits you'll want to buy higher quality versions of later, and I think this is the best approach when you just want to have something handy for small home improvement projects. I wouldn't recommend using these on anything harder than wood or sheet rock. Actually, driving screws into wood has already completely destroyed one of the torx bits in this kit, but the drill bits seem to be ok. I'd recommend it to a friend.

Installation was ok but it took two of us. The motor is very quiet and the remote control operates it with ease. It actually comes with a manual switch, an IR remote and a RF remote so you can choose which to use. The picture quality (used in conjunction with our 1080p 3D Optoma projector) is excellent.

If you watch it, you'll see why. But it doesn't matter. While they don't use all the computor animation Disney uses, he (The artist. Can't remember his name.) managed to make the art work breathtaking. (Well, not really.) And this movie would have a 'R' rating if not for the lack of cursing. So pay attention to the rating parents.

The animation is great, the characters are awesome, the whole storyline is sweet! There is a good message behind it--not to mistreat nature. Of course there's blood and mild language in it, that's why it's rated PG-13, don't you think? Of all the characters, the wolves would have to be the best! Word of advice--if you want you younger kid (hey, I'm 15, not a kid!) like 7 or so, and you want them to watch a kiddie anime, may I suggest Pokemon? Maybe even Hamtaro? Hayao Miyazaki-san is a genius! He likes to emphasis blood, but he has a good messange in his creations.

Will Disney give us the option for a subtitle version?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie","review":"I am a complete anime freak and could not wait to see this movie. I heard about it from my friends and finally went and saw it. It was better than I ever thought it would be. I told everyone about it and now that it is coming out on video, I will be the first one to get a copy! This is the best movie! You must see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be gorgeous, but...","review":"Miyazaki's epic, Mononoke Hime is a wonderful work of filmmaking. The story and imagery are masterful.

Just trying build my collection of anime. Really enjoyed this one and is really great for the kids as well as the big kids. Some really great directing going on. Came on time is good shape. Thanks again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Surprise!","review":"I didn't think I was going to like this lesser known Miyazaki film. I don't know what was wrong with me - I've liked all his others. \\"Spirited Away\\" is my favorite of his more popular movies. This story didn't look anything like that.And it's not. This story is about the struggle of nature against human civilization, and man against animal, animal against man. Its message is very real today.Beside the underlying story, what really had me taken was the thought put into this tale - all these interesting things you might never think of. A young girl raised by wolves (and she rides them!), and animal \\"bosses\\" or elders that are enormous compared to their followers (reminds me of typical video games where the boss is huge). The art was beautiful, just beautiful.I've got the urge to watch this movie again, just to \\"live\\" in that world for a couple of hours once more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's side is he on anyways?","review":"I used to really like this movie. I remember it as being a metaphor for how human beings have destroyed the environment and polluted it, instead of living in harmony with nature. But now that I watch it over, it seems Prince Ashitaka's only real concern is for San. His unwillingness to pick a side irritates me.Anyways, creative movie, interesting. More spiritual and different than western animations. I recommend watching. Also, the best part of the film was the deer god/night walker - he is so cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely little thing!","review":"Absolutely thrilling, It is such a breath of fresh air to watch something so beautiful. A story of values, rights and wrongs which in essence, becomes a battle within itself. I don't think there will be another story told as wonderful as this one. I would go so far as to promise you that you will not waste your time or money on this little wonder!You should watch with an open mind. There are many lessons to be learned. Greed and Forgiveness are two important ones that we all could learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mononoke:an original","review":"Princess Mononoke is one of the best animes ive seen in a while.It's very easy to keep up with and understand.It is also a very original anime.About the only bad thing about Princess Mononoke is that,at times,it starts to lose interest,but always ends up regaining interest and then some.Princess Mononoke will have you hooked from beginning to end!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Anime","review":"This is an incredible anime, not only because of the quality of the animation but the story is solid and there are several twists that anyone should be able to appreciate. I usually do not recommend anime films for those who aren's familiar with the type of animation but this is a film that should be seen by all that like a good epic. The action is well-placed and at times just unreal enough to make it even better. The dub-job is amazing with an all-star cast from Hollywood and in my opinion is one of the few dubs I prefer of the subtitled. Definitely a must-have for DVD since you'll want to watch it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"All i can say is \\"WOW\\"","review":"First of all, i enjoy watching anime once in a while. I will rent them every now and then but own none.. except for this one. It is truely amazing and unique. The story catches you almost right away, like a few minutes into the movie and you are already saying \\"wow, this is gonna be good\\". the animation and detail quality is much better than the average anime. The music gives great atmosphere and sets a perfect mood for the film. Don't expect an all out blood fest but it does have its share of great action scenes. I must emphasize though on the extreme quality of the story. Thats what makes me really love this one. This is currently my favorite movie, next to the StarWars trilogy of course :) (episode 1 was ok..)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting movie to say the least","review":"This is one of the few movies I've watched where there was never a clearly defined villain. The main conflict (forgive me if I stay general because I don't want to give anything away) in the movie is between humans that are fighting for land to mine and the forest that is protected by animal gods. The animal gods fiercely defend the forest from any invasion by man and man continues to invent ways to help annex more of the forest by any means necessary. The animation has some absolutely amazing sequences but has a PG-13 rating for a reason. Some of the battle and after battle scenes are very gory. This movie is not meant to be seen by young viewers. I can honestly say I've never seen anything quite like it and can easily recommend it to any animation or anime fan that is 13 or older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Mononoke","review":"This remarkable film caused my husband and me to do 2 amazing things. First, we allowed our 13 year old daughter to go out to a movie with us on a school night, and second, when we found out it was only going to be released on DVD at first, we ran out to buy a DVD player and a TV that was DVD compatable! I am not going to go in to detail about the film, because it has all been said here by others. Just buy it! It is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring and most violent movie EVER.","review":"How in the world did this get into Roger Ebert's top?! This movie made no sense, it was completly boring, and it was just too violent. Really, you lovers have no taste. If that director could've put an actual story in it, make it cool, and use less gore... heck, I would've loved it! Eh, but it never caught my attention... \\"Castle in the Sky\\" caught my attention. So here's good advice: Don't show it to anyone under 17; wait; don't watch it at all... unless you need something to put you to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"When I watched this for the first time on STARS(Ok,ok. So I didn't buy the DVD.Big deal) I was VERY disapointed. When I heard about it and people were like, \\"Watch the most popular Japanimation(Uggh!I HATE that word!)movie in America! It is just so perfect, I thought,cool! I'll have to watch it then!So I waited...and waited...and waited for weeks to watch Princess Mononoke and when I FINALLY got to see it,I relized that,to me, it was of the most boring movies I have ever watched! I didn't even watch the whole thing!So please people, don't get this movie! Rent this first if you must see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning....","review":"For the love of god do not buy this movie. I cannot stress that point well enough. While I understand how the fantasy elements may have wooed other reviewers, for me, this movie ended my fascination with Japanime. From the mindless plot to the super-environmentalist charachters this movie is a dud all the way through. If you rent or buy Japanime looking for action and violence, (things that I am sure many people think of when they hear \\"Japanime\\") not a sappy plot and some of the most insipid ideas ever, you should stay away from this movie. But, if you're looking for something that really is that laden with mystique and faeries and other annoying pieces of fantasy lore, buy this movie. So, let's recap shall we? If you like action, like me, this is the most God-Awful creation ever to find its way into your VCR. If you like fantasy, i'm sure you'll love this. Just a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"can u get any more blood in this movie??","review":"the artwork was spectacular, but the story was lacking and the violence was terrible even for an animated movie. it even scared my 18 yr old sister who has seen R rated movies! the story anyway was stupid, and they just have too much blood!!! it makes me cringe at the sight of this movie! seeing people get their arms and heads chopped off with much graphic gore. and this one animal had blood spewing out of its mouth and nose! crud this movie is too focused on blood and has no good moral. i wouldnt suggest this movie for anyone and discourage people watching this movie for it has no good moral on right or wrong"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped, it's not as great as you hear","review":"Mononoke Hime is a childs movie (Ages 5-12) plain and simple. It is not a great movie. The story is about plant-like and animal demons terrorising the humans becuase the humans are abusing the earth (Not a really a bad plot). The story also revolves around some preteen kid and girl. To sum it all up, this movie is boring and dull which is why Disney picked it up. I've been watching anime for years and i'm certainly not some fan who just got off from watching DBZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING BUT A BLOOD AND GORE SHOW!","review":"THIS IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN, I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING GOOD ON IT, I ONLY SAW ARMS FLYING AND HEADS!, MAJOR JOKE!, I LOVED THIS FILM!, IT'S FULL OF ACTION, WELL EVERYTHING, YUP, THE FILM IS A BIT SLOW AT THE BEGIGING BUT LATER ON THE FILM BECOMES MORE FAST PACED, ALSO THE STORYLINE IS GREAT, THE ANIMATION IT'S ALSO, I RECENTLY READED THE ONE STARRED REVIEWS, AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THOSE PEOPLE WHO RECOMENDED \\"NINJA SCROLL\\", OH MY GOD!, THAT FILM HAS A LOT MORE OF BLOOD, GORE THAN THIS ONE!, A NOTE TO PARENTS, I RECOMMEND THE FILM FOR KIDS 10 YEARS AND OVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Video That Dared To Show It's Face In Anime","review":"Princess Mononoke Was Boring,Disgusting,And Dissapointing.My Boyfriend Said To Me,\\"This Is My Favorite Anime Movie.\\" \\"You Should Really Watch It Sometime.\\" Boy,Was He Wrong!

It comes in at about 2 hrs 20 mins, yet so much of the movie is painfully repetitious that this could easily have been trimmed to 80 mins. The American voice-overs are AWFUL. Minnie Driver is passable, but every other actor makes it sound like a school play. They're hammier than a side of pig. I can't believe anime has evolved so little since \\"Akira\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly not as good as I expected...","review":"Princess Mononoke is a really popular movie... just see all the positive reviews about it! I rented this movie, then recieved it as a gift from a friend. The story itself is good... although, I was not very impressed and for me, it \\"dragged\\" alot. It is kinda scary for the younger ones I would say... and for me, it wasn't that great at all like I said. I rather not give the story away so I won't say to much but... I would not spend my money on it. I would buy it if I were you first... as with any movie, that is how personally I do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic? I think not.","review":"When I first heard about this movie I was very interested in seeing it. Namely because everyone was telling me how epic it was. Well I consider myself a huge anime fan so I wanted to check it out. What I found was however was a movie riddled with enladen old messages like \\"women's rights\\" and \\"peace making skills\\". This DVD might have been made in Japan, but its messages are fully American-which makes it absolutely boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Plot, Great Animation","review":"The plot of this movie is incoherent. The characters are not particularly likeable nor do they inspire the viewer's care, sympathy, or interest. The movie's point is that we are poisoning the earth with our hate, pollution, corruption, greed, deceit, and pride.The animation is good but very unoriginal. How many times have I seen worm like monsters invading human bodies in Japanese animation? It seems like Japanese animation MUST have one of those scenes.It seems the movie creator is trying to spread its shinto/shaministic religious beliefs, which is one of the reason why the movie is so incoherent to the western mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new landmark in the world of animated movies","review":"My standards for animated films have certainly been raised after watching this. I saw the English version of this in theatre, and almost every single aspect of this movie was astounding.When it was translated, the lip-syncing was completely re-done, and quite a bit was done to ensure the \\"meaning\\" was preserved (See their web site for details)The artwork is simply amazing, the story is an instant classic. This is definately the best animated movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible display of Anime!","review":"This movie is amazing! It has the best animation I have ever seen. Period. When it was playing in my city, I enjoyed it so much that I went to see it twice in the same week. The story is complex and entertaining. The English dub isn't bad, in fact, compared to most Anime, its quite good. However I'm still really hope that the DVD release has a subtitled version as well as the dubbed version, and that they keep it in widescreen (most DVDs are pretty good about that). Anyway, thats about it...if you get a chance to see this movie...don't pass it up. You won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Want good anime?Don't watch this","review":"Sure,a nice cartoon to get people happy but this is not the most greatest movie...I love anime just as much as the next person but i can rate what i want:[Looking for a movie that has action,not puke ugly violence,and a nice plot...SEE POKEMON FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!Digimon too:)Or any other anime tooooo(i don't really know a whole bunch of anime movies)Mabye sooner or later there will be a gundam wing movie,a dbz movie,a cardcaptor movie or even yu-gi-oh! movie(yes,i like that show with some kid and others who battle with duel monster cards.Reminds me of the days when i used to battle with pokemon cards...I still would but no one around to)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Princess Mononoke","review":"This movie sucks. I have a 11 year old daughter and 7 year old son, and the level of violence in this \\"cartoon\\" was simply unacceptable.

It was lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Mononke, an amazing film!!","review":"Hayao Miyazaki has used an ancient Japanese myth and turned it into a brilliant and entertaining film. The story goes well and move swiftly leaving you amazed. The characters all seem to have a different story to tell and connecty with each other easily. It is a magical film that can easily be entertaining even though it is most probably enjoyed more by 10+ Anyway I loved the animation and I feel it deserves a 5-star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!!!!","review":"I heard about this movie from a good friend,so on the weekend of my birthday I rented it.To be honest I thought it was going to be stupied but boy was I wrong. The animation is great, the story is a wonderful tale of man vs nature. At first it starts out kind of simple, a young man startes out to find out if someone can lift a cures given to him by a demon/god. Then as he travels on and meets princess mononoke it get more complicated and trilling. being an anime fan I didn't ecspecte it to be to childish but never ecpected this. This is a great movie for action seekers. Actuly this movie has somthing for everyone, it has just the right amount of action, comedy, and even a litte romaince but not over doing the perfect mix and noware near childish. There arn't many movies these days for preteens/early teens that don't over do some thing but this movie is perfect. Even boys will like it.(my brother loves it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, This is my new favorite....","review":"This is the greatest movie I have ever watched.

The animation is superb, with some very beautiful effects and tableaux that will take your breath away. The action scenes are also very well done, and are frequently riveting. This is a real film, not a kiddie cartoon; and it takes advantage of the potential of its medium like few things this viewer has ever seen before.The impact of the film is limited however by poor development of the plot -- it's not that convoluted, it's just inadequately presented -- which makes it essentially impossible to follow. And some of the characters' voices are so quietly and murkily recorded that you simply can't make them out. It's unfortunate, because it really mars the movie.Having said that this is a unique achievement that certainly bears watching at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST movies I have ever seen","review":"This movie is one of the best anime videos that I have ever seen. It's compelling story drew me in and the character design is flawless. This movie erned it's 5 star rating.

Like I said its a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing...creative anime","review":"This is the probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. True, it is a little gory and bloody, but the plot is amazingly creative and interesting, although a bit confusing. I loved this movie and watched it six times. The characters were well represented and the storyline is very interesting. However I thought the name \\"princess mononoke\\" was kind of corny because it only appears once in the whole show and was probably just used to give it a good and attractive title. this movie is very interesting and good anime, and i would highly recommend it to anyone, although the bloody scenes may not be great for little kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best anime ever","review":"I just starting about a year ago to go into other anime other than DragonBall Z. I've seen DragonBall, DragonBall Z, DragonBall GT, and some of the new DragonBall episodes just coming out in Japan. I've also seen Blue Sub 6, Gundam 0080, Gundam Wing, Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz, Tenchi Muyo, Tenchi Universe, Tenchi in Tokyo, (some Sailor Moon to kill time), and Outlaw Star, and am now searching for new anime to watch. This was my first pick that I found to rent. This is one of the best anime I have ever seen. Of course, I'd rather watch it in Japanese with English subtitles than English dubbed. I would recommend this to all beginner and moderate anime fans out there. I can't speak for true anime fans since I have not gone as far with it as others have. In short, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Masterpiece, great work of art and Inspiration!","review":"This movie is so great, that I don't know where or how to start. I'm sure you already know the story by reading other people's comments, but I would just like to imphasize on it. This movie was so breathtaking that I have loved it ever since I saw it in Japan in 1997. I loved it, and now I love it even more. In fact it wasn't just great entertainment but very inspirational on the conflicts between man and nature, war and destruction and love. I HIGHLY recomend it to any nature lover(such as myself), animation fan or anyone. If you think all anime are the \\"same\\", think again. This may have some blood and violence, but thats what the story is about. You cant block all the bad stuff out from the world,like Miyazaki said.This is surely a great work of Miyazaki and I hope many people will watch it and learn from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully done","review":"amazing animation, great voice acting and story. some blood and gore. recomended for all anime fans. not a long anime but not short"},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"Sent as a gift and the person liked it for christmas this year.

PLEASE VOTE for the production of this incredible work of genius and art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Poetry","review":"The images, story and themes of this exquisite film are all top notch and I am delighted to have it in my collection. Or to put a more measured value on it: If I had to choose between the Ring trilogy and Mononoke, I prefer Mononoke. I loved the 3 Ring movies, but this is art. I think it is worth the price.The sense of wonder you can get from this film is a lasting one. Anyone with an open mind and heart will enjoy it immensely and will continue to enjoy it with repeated viewings. I don't want to start describing it in any more detail, but the film is not for every taste so I'll just say, SEE THIS FILM if* you're open to eastern traditions and ways of thinking.* you're open to seeing a great film that doesn't fit into narrow confines of any genre.* you're an adult who understands that good and evil exists in all of us.* you're willing to look at greed and violence in thoughtful ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's one of my favorites","review":"Princess Mononoke is a great action, mystery, and romance story.

It's pretty gory actually I was surprised i have been able to watch pg-13 movies since i was like 7 and R since i was 10 so i wasn't like shocked or anything but for a cartoon it was quite violent.

The art is beautiful, and I've seen both the Japanese version (with english subtitles) and the American version. I originally thought that the director was taking for granted that I might understand some of the Japanese legends, but just about all of my Japanese friends said they didn't understand it at all, either. They likened it to a Japanese \\"Roger Rabbit\\" --another film that is really poorly constructed and has lousy animation. Japanese animation often looks beautiful and is well choreographed--but they still can't tell consistantly coherant stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"More ecological and antihuman sentiment than I can bear","review":"I attempted to enjoy this movie for the animation and voice acting but simply could not because of the glaring antihuman sentiment of the film.All of the human characters in the movie, save for the protagonist, were either portrayed as mindless drone workers or hatred-driven dictators out to destroy the \\"intrinsic value\\" of nature. The protagonist was the only human portrayed as a morally good character, mostly because of how she was defensive of nature rather than her own kind.If you have esteem for yourself and others of your own species, you should probably avoid watching this movie; you most likely would not enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy did Spirited Away too..................?","review":"I am at a loss for words on this movie. I saw Spirited Away and could watch it over and over for all the charming characters and animation in that movie. True, there were many interesting creatures and many things that were almost dream-like, BUT, thinking I would get the same type of movie........I hesitantly rented Princess Mononoke. The animation was just not up to par like Spirited Away, and the story was just so hard to make yourself understand that I just had to turn it off 3/4 of the way through. And I really wanted to like this movie too. But its unfair to take anyone's review and make a judgement, just rent this one before you buy it....you might only be out $4 instead of $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over it","review":"The only reason people like this movie is for the visuals. The story itself is confusing, stupid, and all around not very good. The main character messes up things time and again and you slowly lose any sympathy you originally had for him. Add to that the fact that no one learns anything in the end of the film, the evil humans are still evil, the dumb kid is still just as dumb. One of my friends recommended this too me so me and 2 other people sat for 2 hours trying to like it. When we told my friend we all hated it she said \\"But wasnt it pretty\\" and truth be told thats the only reason anyone would like this film. If you wanna see something pretty then watch crouching tiger or something, at least that had a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch is withOUT audio...1star for animation.","review":"This movie didn't make any sense to me, except for the tree/nature hugging undertone. It seems all over the place with storylineS. I wouldn't be able to explain what is the movie about if I had to. Is it about the kid from this long lost tribe and his coming of age? Is it about Iron Town and the exploitation of nature and its resources? Is it about giant wolves and pigs/demons?...among other possible themes. I didn't get it. But the animation sequences get the only credit, in my book. I say rent it first then decide if you want it in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borring, Miscast Voices, Too Long","review":"I first saw Princess Mononoke when it came out in theaters. With all of the hype, I was expecting something wonderful. The first thing I noticed was the good animation. The second thing was the flat, miscast voice acting. The third was the bleeding heart mumbo-jumbo story. Half way through the show I realized that I didnt care about any of the characters. The wolves were boring. The male hero whispered all of his lines like he was too cool to show any emotion. None of the monsters sounded cool (Not even any extra snorting for the attacking worm infested pig!). The best performance goes to the princess. Joe Bob didnt sound anything like he looked on screen. I dont know, I love anime, but I got so bored that I walked out before it was over. Don't believe the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a complete...let down!","review":"I waited enthusiastically to view this \\"opus\\". The animation was phenomenal. The audio was a bit lacking, but the story blew me away. It was that good? No. It was far worse than I could have ever envisioned. The last 1/3 of the movie and the ending in particular left me searching for words. I was dumbfounded that this tripe could receive a good review, much less the almost universal praise that it had been given just after its release. In a word, shocking. I have intentionally left out specifics as to not ruin it for those who have not seen the movie. Believe me though...it's that bad. Borrow it from a clueless friend and judge for yourself, if for no other reason than to see what astonishingly bad cinema looks like."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Princess Mononoke\\" - Excellent!!","review":"\\"Princess Mononoke\\" is a fantastic film for pre-teens through adults. Highly recommend this movie if you liked \\"Spirited Away\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Miyazake Film","review":"This is another fabulous film from the gifted Mr. Miyazake. It makes you laugh, cry and ends by filling you with hope -- as do all of his films. This was one a huge hit in Japan when it came out and was only eclipsed by another of his films, Spirited Away (which is also wonderful, by the way). 5 stars all the way and 4 paws up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"princess mononke","review":"one of my favorite movies. i just had to get another copy when a friend moved away after borrowing it with out returning it. a great family movie if you don't mind showing kids some killing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie (not just anime) I've ever watched!!!","review":"I remember seeing this over a decade ago at an Anime club film event at college. I had to take a midterm halfway through the movie. But the story was so good, I actually decided to skip my midterm just to finish the movie. It is really that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie in foreign language","review":"I thought that I was purchasing a movie with English spoken. It turns out that that Chinese and Japanese are the spoken languages with English subtitles. Great movie nonetheless. Seller misrepresented this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirited away combines with My Neighbor Totoro","review":"The first thing I thought of this movie after I watched it was: this is spirited away mixed with My neighbor totoro, but not in a cutesy way it was more filled with action. It is like Spirited away because of well the spirits lol and it is like MNT bc of the forest god. After I watched it; I wanted to watch it again, it just has brilliant animation, compelling storyline, and great characters and character development. Anyone who loves Miyazaki's films, but prefers a more mature story such as Tales from Earthsea would really like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latest information regarding japanese language","review":"I have just read the following on DVDTalk: \\"Talk about making an impact!

Together we influenced one of the biggest studios in Hollywood! Congrats DVD talkers!\\" I hope this information is exact and that Princess Mononoke will finally be released with the original japanese track and english subtitles in addition to the dubbed version. I have already preordered my copy at Amazon. If this information is false, I can always cancel my order, but there really still seems to be hope for anime fans..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite movie Good Deal","review":"Absolutely love this movie, Ordered it on DVD for a pretty good price and I've watched it 6 times since without any problems"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Mononoke: A must see","review":"What an amazing movie with great anime! Princess Mononoke was one of the greatest movies ever and it would have been even better if it hadn't been so violent. Despite the made up creatures, this movie was really realistic. I could see something like this happening in real life; humans fighting amlessly. Yeah, I could see that. Man, I hope that doesn't happen. Well, the creatures in this movie are pretty cool; giant wolves, gods, demons, and battle boars. What a movie! Anyone twelve or older must see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good and Complete Story","review":"Princess Mononoke is a very well animated movie that is complete in itself. It has a theme of peace rather than violence, and a respect for nature, though I would definitely say it's gory enough (and so deserves the pg-13 rating). On the whole, I'd say it's a superior work in anime, and the plot is easier to follow than most. Good for those fairly new to anime as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Miyazaki's Finest!","review":"I've always been a fan of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, but really this is what started it all for me! 1999, Princess Mononoke hit theaters, I was there just for fun with some friends, but this movie somehow impacted me, and then I became like the greatest fans really, I have like every movie he's done! This movie has an awesome, interesting, magical story, about a forest god and everything, action packed, oooh it's so great! ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god it buetiful!","review":"When I first heard about this movie I had almost no intention of seeing it. Luckily my family and I had to go to Chicago right when it was in the one theater there so I decided to drag my faily along and see it. Everyone liked it, including my dad who thought that he'd hate it. When I showed the DVD version to my friend a few days ago he like it too. The both sited the same reasons, great artwork, and buetiful active backgrounds. What I mean by that is that the backgrounds actualy looked natural, instead of the static backgrounds which are so common in anime. Do your self a favor and grab a copy of this outstanding movie, whether or not you like anime, you will definately like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Best Movie Yet","review":"Never in my life have I seen a movie so spectacular than this one. No other movie comes even close to Princess Mononoke. If you watch the movie you will get enchanted by it. The great viual effect will astound you. I would recomend anybody to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miyazaki Does it Again.","review":"Hayaou Miyazaki never ceases to amaze me. Allow me to add my accolades to the list. The story, the characters, the dialogue, and the visuals make for a complete film, and only complete films make for classics. Punk kids and English majors alike can find much in this film to appreciate. It is an experience.Unfortunately, like many Japanese anime films, the ending of this one felt weird or awkward. The only other negative comment I have is directed soley toward Disney: JAPANESE FILMS MUST BE IN JAPANESE! It seems senseless that with all the DVD's capabilities, this one will neither include the film's orginal language or 5.1 Dolby Digital. What a waste of an otherwise great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"I've seen the Japansese translated, and the english dubbed, and i must say that they did a horrible job translating this Anime. In japanese it is probably one of the greatest i have seen, but the english was butchered, substituting words so it would have a more North American appear i suppose..one such obvious change was \\"the great forest god\\" or whatever he was called in the tranlated, as opposed to \\"Shinigami,\\" or god of death, in the japanese....and the term Mononoke isn't even mentioned in teh dubbed version"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great anime","review":"Princess Mononoke was one of the first anime I've seen, and is still one of the best! The plot is original, interesting, and does not follow the \\"fantasy formula.\\" The voices (Billy Crudup, Claire Daines, Billy Bob Thorton, etc) fit the characters perfectly, unlike several animes I have seen (Serena in Sailor Moon...). The music in Princess Mononoke, composed by Joe Hisaishi, is astouding; I also recommend the soundtrack. The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I thought the ending was rather rushed and could have been better. Overall, Princess Mononoke is definitley an anime worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well made film","review":"While the themes are none too subtle, the film itself is a spectatular example of what a movie can do. I thought the english dubbing (even though I prefer subtitles) was very well done, and of course the visuals are stunning. I highly reccomend this film to almost anyone, even those who aren't too interested in Japanese animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, what thrills!!!","review":"When I first watched this movie, I was really scared, but in an exciting way. The second time I watched it, I couldnt beleive how aweome it was. I was dissapointed because I only got to see it two time because we rented the movie. I want to buy this movie as soon as I can. Great Film!. ps: this is not,I repeat not, for small kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"Great movie with subtle undertones dealing with Western Culture and Society. Great back story for any environmental type. Great story line with moral to the story. Adult like material , not for children under the age of 16. They would not fully understand or grasp the true meaning of the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Classic Miyazaki, any anime fan should see at least once. Beautiful animation, great story and above average voice acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of Grey","review":"The movie is beautiful, with wonderful scenery. The story is not for little kids, although my five year old loves it. Unlike the more normal fare that kids are exposed to, in this movie there are no bad guys or (all) good guys. All of the characters have reasons for what they do, and all show signs of honor and courage. The fact that they are in conflict makes the story much more interesting.Watch the movie. Just because it's animated doesn't mean it's for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"It had a good story about with some strong themes. Predominating themes were love, honor, man vs. nature and nature vs. machines. The art was beautiful. There were some elements of comedy, and of course the gore (oh, there goes that man's arm!).The movie is essentially about a man who kills a demon but gets infected by it. In his search to find where the demon originated, he becomes caught between two different worlds-nature's struggle against man, and the society where the people are good but are hurting the environment.Actually, for the movie to be called Princess Mononoke is a little strange, she's the secondary major character. It's more about the young man. Overall it was a good movie. I rented it first, which is what I would recommend with all Animes because everyone has different tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"It was the most wonderful movie I could ever hope for! My friend recommended it to me, and I was very reluctant to see it. I'm not a big fan of anime. I always thought the animation was choppy and storylines bland. This completely changed my mind. Princess Mononoke is the best movie I have ever seen, anime or not!( I've seen almost every movie from Terminator to Sense and Sensiblity) I loved how Miyazaki never created a bad guy. The most obvious one has good motives, and by the end of the movie, you're left wondering if this was a movie or a play of real-life relationships. It didn't have the classic good vs.evil plot we've all seen with every movie. It displays real friendships and issues. Fantasy fan or hard-core realist, you'll love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite anime","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I had been waiting a long time to see this movie and I'm glad that I did. The animation was superb, the plot was excelent, and the characters were great. There were awsome battle sences and even a bit of romance. The only proplem was that there were barely any special features on the DVD. When I get a DVD I always look foward to the special features. Besides that everything was perfect. I wouldn't reccomend this movie for young children because it contains mild language, violence, blood, and some scary sences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good but long movie","review":"The sound track was originally what got me to watch this movie. {I'm in fact listening to it now} The music has a touch to it that has both combat feeling and that shivering feeling you get when your character is in serious trouble or in such a tremendous situation.I liked the animation and the story was pretty good. They did seem to drag it on a little bit in the end, but overall I'd recommend getting this on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOODY FANTASTIC!!!","review":"I've been a fan of manga/anime ever since i can remember and as manga/anime goes this is one of the best. Captivating scenes, beautifull music. The story is brill also, as well as the characters.You get a few giggles when watching this but then you also feel sadness. All mangas/anime should be like this the story, the music, the characters.ABSOLUTLY FANTASTIC!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I ordered this movie as a gift for my sister who loves anime. It arrived to her safely and earlier than I expected. The movie played perfectly and the cover looked good as new, even my sister commented on how pretty it looked via phone. Thank you, this made a wonderful birthday present!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Mononoke","review":"My personal favorite of all the Miyazaki films. Great story -- Neil Gaiman did a most excellent job of writing the English version! -- wonderful visuals and great soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Anime Movie I Have Seen in a Long Time!","review":"Princess Mononoke is simply the greatest. Interesting characters, compelling plot, amazing visuals, and a masterful soundtrack all make this the best. Looking for something to buy your Anime-lover in your family? Get this DVD. I guarantee you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"I really loved this movie, although once it ends it leaves you wondering what was that all about. But if you just stop and think about it for a few minuets it should come to you. Ive seen in some of the other reviews that some people didnt like the fact that there was no clear cut \\"bad guy\\" or \\"good guy\\" in the movie, but I think that is what makes the movie so great. I mean think about real life, most of us are neither bad nor good, just somewhere in that grey area of both. And thats how it is in the movie, yes some of the people do bad things, and you hate them for that, but then, they do somting good, and you forgive them, isnt that how it works in real life?? I really love anime, and after I saw this movie, I loved it even more. This movie is really worth it too see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and a refreshing change from plot-less movies","review":"What I love best about this movie is that it allows people to come to their own conclusions. Not only is this wonderful to watch for its music and animation, but it also has a quality to it that the majority of movies today lack. It makes you think. There are so many intricate layers in this story that each time you watch it you catch sight of a few more meanings that you didn't see before. If you have been disappointed with movies that seem to lack focus, or plot, or message, or if you are tired of watching regurgitated ideas that hold no more value than that which is on the surface, Princess Mononoke is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Display of how our world is!","review":"I have experienced some of the things that Miyazaki has put in \\"Princess Mononoke\\". For example, i've had to step into fights and then get rejected by both sides. We ourselves are demons in a certain view. We hurt others when they're in the way of our dreams or whatever. For example, if I wanted to rule the world and my friend opposed me, I would hurt him. Miyazaki is clearly showing this and that's why I give \\"Princess Mononoke\\" a 5-stars rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Mononoke","review":"This is simply an awesome film. It is the only film I enjoyed so much that I wrote the studio (Studio Ghibli) and thanked them for making it. I'm even now on the lookout for future works by the studio and the movie's creator, Hayao Miyazaki.There is just nothing better out there. This is an amazing tale with beautiful animation and a grand plot. If you haven't seen this I command you stop reading this review and go get a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homage from James Cameron","review":"I just watched the DVD today, I probably not the first person to mentioned this, so here goes. 25 minutes into the movie, I said to myself, haven't I seen this movie like in the last 6 weeks, OH YEAH!!, It's AVATAR ! the story line, the characters, the overt themes, the forest background, the little faires. Enough said, I still enjoyed both films. By the way I just found out that James Cameron is a huge J-Anime fan. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I would like to start of buy saying that you don't have to like anime to like this movie. This movie as you might have heard it the top grossing movie in Japan, and for a good reason.Mononoke is the best movie you will ever see. period. There arn't any bad guys but there arn't any good guys eather. I think that you should order this movie now. It's perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the greatest animes ive seen","review":"this is a great movie with a good amount of action and a great story id have to say that this is a must have anime for any anime collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very few movies I would consider worth 5 stars","review":"For those not familiar with animie, the first 10 minutes may seem a bit extreme in the violence area, beheadings and all. However, this movie is fantastic for the whole family. My wife loves it, and so does my 3 year old daughter (This is the only movie in my animie collection that I let her watch). Every scene is very well done. A gripping story, well done character interaction, multiple sub plots, and fantastic cinemetography, all add up to one of the best movies I have ever scene. There are probably only 10 to 12 movies I would give 5 stars to, and this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than akira!!!!!","review":"I Love anime and so i got this and akira and Princess Mononoke blew akira away!watch this movie now!It rules!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure anime in it's brightest form!","review":"I love movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki. This movie I hadn't seen so I presumed it was good. The critics said it was good, so I bought it at my local Target for 20 dollars. It was worth every penny! It was probably one of the absolute best movie by Miyazaki. It was rated PG-13 for the graphic war scenes which got better and better! I love this movie! You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of all TIME!!!","review":"This is just an amazing movie the artistry is amazing, the plot has historical accuricy, and has just the right amount of funny to make this move worth while. I can never get tired of watching this movie! I praise Mr. Matsuda on this movie of movies. It is not just anime it defies all boundrys of filmaking. I would give this movie 10 stars out of 5 if I could. But I can't so I'll stop on this note... WATCH THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Mononoke","review":"Beautiful movie. Superb graphic and soundtrack. Classic fairytale in an unconventional style. There is always movement, and in the slow parts, it's setting the story. Excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great anime film from the mastermind, Miyazaki","review":"I finally got to watch \\"Princess Mononoke\\" on DVD. I was blown away!!! What can you say about Miyazaki that hasn't already been said? Beautiful, breathtaking, fantastic, wonderous... etc!!! I hope there are many more such films coming from the pen of this visionary of film. It is a must see for all fans of Japanime and especially of Miyazaki."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archtype breakaway-the ultiminte","review":"This movie is by far the best movie I have seen in my life, with the semi runner up Nasicou and the vally of the wind. This movie does not quite leave a clif hanger, nor does it quite say happily ever after. I my mind, this is one of the most attractive features, the thing that keeps me coming back to watch it again. It is almost as if reality warped and life turned awsome- i recomend this movie as a must see for life. And if you are currently shoping for younger children, this movie as some animated vilince, but the plot is ment for all ages. this movie set my daydream experince on an all time high. I love this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't regret not seeing this anime after life","review":"As simple as emotions this anime is all about, it's full fill of it.The main carecter is the best carecter i have ever seen in my life, it really presents the MAN personality. The graphics are amaizing, the back ground sound is fantastic, but the subtitel is really bad it just flashs, so if you are going to watch this movie (buy-rent-borrow) it and that is what you are going to do PICK the english version of it.Actually guys I find my self out of words to talk about an anime like that.I JUST CAN SAY DO NOT REGRET NOT SEEING THIS ANIME AFTER LIFE"},{"rating":"2","title":"The opposite of lacking.","review":"This is a stunning animation that managed to combine the essential components of a classic hit in a captivating way. It deals with many issues that rather than interfere with the overall plot or are simply be integrated with it, Princess Monoke's many issues, if anything, amplify the central plot. I was truly surprised by the independence that it shows from any other animated film that I have seen, which is a rather high number, and I think that if or when you see this movie you will be moved and captivated beyond your expectations. I definitely recommend this movie for \\"every one\\" of all ages (with a warning of few adult phrases)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous! Anime at its best!","review":"Princess Mononoke is one of the best anime films I've ever seen. Each scene is breathtaking. When I saw this for the first time, I hadn't heard anything about anime. I was introduced to a whole new world of filmmaking, one that I didn't know existed. I would recommend this to anyone, and if you liked it try movies like \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" or \\"Nausicaa.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Three-Hour Epic","review":"The animation was beautiful but the story was way too long; it just seemed to be a comedy of tragedies. That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie for liberal tree huggers","review":"If you think Man is evil and you're a tree hugger, you'll love this movie. Tried to watch it for pure entertainment but couldn't because it was soo boring. Thought it would be a good anime to watch because of all the STARS, guess all the STARS came from tree hugging liberal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice visuals, but very disappointing story","review":"The visuals and animation technique were up to par for anime -- lots of beautiful and intricate things to look at. However, I was very disappointed with the story and the character development. Most of the time, the action just didn't make sense (unless I'm missing a lot of fairytale background that Japanese kids grow up with), and the characters were so, uh, two-dimensional that I felt uninvolved nearly the whole time I was watching. Perhaps Princess Mononoke got better reviews than it deserved because of the big-name cast and the relative lack of knowledge about anime in the American market. I'd rather have watched Bubblegum Crisis again than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Month of Miyasaki","review":"This month cartoon network is having a month of miyasaki program so every staurday night I go in my room to watch the movie. I had been waiting all week for it because it had demons & wolves & stuff on the commercials & I love that kind of stuff. When I watched it it was better than I had expected but your little brothers & sisters might not like it because it has people having thier arms & heads chopped of, ect. But for older kids IT's GREAT!!! So I think you'd like to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"This is an amazing motion picture. From the by-hand anime, which seems to be a fading art, to the undeniable and powerful messages it cultivates through seemingly basic storytelling, this epic journey encompasses so much thought and compassion it is overwhelmingly ideal in so many ways. A must have for anyone who appreciates the art of film. *bow*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Mononoke","review":"Sophisticated, hand-drawn animation and an epic storyline about the conflict between ecology and the industrial ambitions of mankind turn Miyazaki's film into a marvelously potent parable. This unusually thoughtful and transporting tale never falls into a simplistic portrayal of good and evil, but rather asks how man and nature can live in harmony. Set in mystical, long-ago Japan and populated by wood spirits, nature gods, fierce demons, and other marvels of mythic dimension, \\"Mononoke\\" is a rare visual treat for dreamers of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Brilliance.","review":"A brilliant story that manages to be exciting without resorting to endless bloody violence. Don't get me wrong, I like hack and slash as much as the next guy, but it's nice to see a story that does things in a different way.The animation itself is beautiful, and the english translation was done by Neil Gaiman, so the dialouge is witty and clear, unlike many other transations of Japaneese films.If you haven't seen it, you should really try this. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Miyazaki spectacle","review":"being of Japanese-decent myself, i have grown up on anime and in the Japanese culture, and perhaps have a deeper understanding and appreciation than most. however, one cannot help but be taken in by this movie and it's amazing scenes featuring a captivating imaginary world.a great adventure and spectacle, it's a must-have for fans of anime and/or fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"One of the best movies I've ever seen animated or not.

His personal journey to find himself and to reach a deeper relationship with a woman he is attracted to from the beginning is a bit unique. He's a drifter who's never asked much of himself, and it's interesting to see him step up to commitment and to stand up for what he knows is right. The romance is good, but so is the character development of the hero, and a little of the heroine. The wild horses are also spectacular. The story makes you want to be there. It makes you wish for wide open spaces and a lifestyle that only a few get to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem!!!","review":"Such a wonderful book!

Julia had a lovely personality but there was no real tension.You KNEW the Pollaks would never buy the ranch, you KNEW that K.C would never cheat on Julia with Dawn.

Just as the main character is the synthesis of a curious alien and a self-indulgent human, Man of Two Worlds is the synthesis of veteran writer Frank Herbert with his less prolific son, Brian Herbert. The best way to enjoy the novel is to read it as if it is Brian Herbert's book, because you won't have all the expectations going into it.

If I am browsing through get it now items, I have to go back to the main menu, go to get it now, and then find the next item I want to look at for every single item.

It reminds me of a sidekick that I wanted for a looooong time, but my parents wouldnt get it for me.I bought this off the plan and it cost me a lot but I am happy with it.For those that want to check their emails and stuff with this phone it will cost you a $20 subscription and the games are like $5-10 (so I didnt get either of them for now) but overall if you are into pic taking (I ONLY take pics of sceneries) I would recommend something cheaper. The real fun thing is the texting keyboard, which I like.

Their customer service is the absolute worst of any of the carriers imo. Their reps are rude, they change information each time they talk with you and don't deliver upon their promises. The phone may be fine, but the service of this carrier is just absolutely horrendous. It's not always about the phone; it's about the service provider as well. Verizon does not stand behind its products and after spending a minimum of 10 hours for the last 6 months every month without satisfactory resolution I feel compelled to warn others who may be considering them"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"The stars are stuck.

The \\"speakephone\\" is a pain....when it is closed, in a case,on your hip and you are in a room full of noise , it is hard to hear it ringing. When you put the speakerphone on when open and try to talk to someone the person on the other end asks you to turn it off you are breaking up. The other thing about this phone is that the internal pics you assign to an individual caller are so small you need a magnifying glass to really see them....LG could have utilized the full screen for those of us with the over 40 eyes. I am thinking of purchasing the new jawbone headset and hoping that it syncs properly. But overall for the price it is a great phone. BUY IT AND TRY IT maybe it will be different for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It shut off un-expected two times in one week","review":"I bought this phone two weeks ago.

I am returning this phone to Amazon.Apr. 05: Amazon's service is great and sent me a replacement unit before I sent back the bad one. The new one seems OK.

It dosn't have the hook that other Garth records do.. If anything could save this record its the duet with George Jones.Its not his best work.. .

Sorry Garth.. nice try.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Its not his best CD, but its very good, and for the first time Garth Brooks has made a CD that actually comes from his real life expierences. His other albumns seemed a bit fake related to this one. This one is very real, and you can tell the heart and effort put into this album. Every song is heart felt, and his duets with George Jones and Trisha Yearwood are superb. The Storm is a great piece of work, and nothing like The Thunder Rolls as the prior reviewer said. Wrapped Up In You is a classic, and Big Money is a good fit to the album to help lighten up this edgy album. You can tell all the pain and frustration he has been going through these past two years. This is a have for your record collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's time....","review":"Perhaps after all these years, Garth Brooks is finally right. It may very well be time for him to ride off into the sunset. While the material on this disc is generally good, the typical slick production of Garth Brooks' albums strips it of a good majority of its honesty. If Garth's producers would lay off and just let him do a stripped down album of music, these songs would sound wonderful. Instead, this disc comes off as that of a country singer who longs to sing folk and rock, but feels obligated to tip his hat to country. It just sounds forced and tired. The songs taken individually are good, but they just don't hang together well on this album...he can't seem to decide whether he wants to do a pop album or a traditional country album. While I don't necessarily hope that Garth retires, at least a good long vacation is in order for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a way to go out","review":"Its a B Double E Double R U In. What an album, this has something for everybody, and its like in the recording of this album, Garth said to himself, Im going have fun, but I have a message to, the last song sums up what all Garth fans are hoping. \\"When you come back to me again\\" Lets hope Garth doescountry music needs and music needs him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roped the Wind","review":"As a big fan of Garth's, and living outside the US, I gladly paid the (...)

But I remembered that when I first don't like an album it is because it doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard and it takes a few times until you can sing along with it. Well, after about the 3rd or 4th time I just fell in love with this terrific album. I'm not sure if I like it as much as \\"Sevens\\" but it is a close match.There is such a variety of song types here that all could be a radio single. My favorite would be \\"Thicker Than Blood\\", \\"Why Ain't I Running\\", and the old America song, \\"Don't Cross The River\\" which is better than their version.I'm glad I picked this gem up and you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have done without this one","review":"I have been a Garth fan for a long time. I have just about all of his CD's, have seen him live, and look forward to his new releases. However, this one I could have done without. I think he is out of the groove or needs to create a new one. His work is drifting from the formula that made him a hit. This CD was very disappointing. There was nothing gripping about it. I particularly disliked Beer Run, an annoying song. I will keep it next to the Chris Gaines CD in my storage rack. Maybe it is time for Garth to retire for real, he seems to have lost some of his creativity and is a bit out of touch with the emotions that make a song memorable... like \\"The Dance\\". Maybe when the dust settles in his personal life and he matures more he will gain new insights that he will be able to put into words, or songs of his own again. Until then, I will definately listen before I buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When you come back to me again","review":"Boguht this CD just for the last track 12 When you come back to me again.

He has managed, once again, to put out another great album using the same formula he's used in every other album: catchy tunes and meaningful lyrics.I've never been able to understand why critics insist on a performer constantly \\"pushing the envelope\\" or \\"changing things up.\\" I've heard this lable put on everyone from George Strait to AC/DC. Its time they put it to rest.It isn't just marketing that makes people go out and buy Garth's cd's, its because his albums are a quality product and people appreciate that.If you like country music and you've liked Garth's other album's, you'll like this one. It's worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant cd!!","review":"I have been a Garth fan for 6 years now and I have loved every minute of it.

I fear Steven is following Amy Grant down the path of godlessness and late night talk show appearances. When I saw Amy showing cleavage on Leno a few years back, I just about lost it. I said at least three prayers for her soul that night. I never thought I'd have to pray for SCC. I truly believed his soul was true. But now we have to contend with \\"All About Love.\\" \\"All About Selling Out To Satan\\" is more like it. There is just no place for godless junk like that stupid Proclaimers song on this album.

Granted it takes up the theme of love , mainly to his wife but I feel this was a very self indulgent effort and one that should have remained a private one. The songs just don't cut it and the bottom line is after hitting his stride this album really threw many SCC fans for a loop and one that I think many haven't gotten over when you look at the sales of the last 2 albums , which are stellar by the way.

It's a good starting and reference point for the novice right to the pro and its money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it!","review":"I've been searching for a good C++ book for a number of months and came across this book by chance. Al Stevens' style is clear, concise and easy to follow. Within a few days my knowledge and understanding of C++ has increased considerably due to his easy-to-understand elaboration of some not-so-easy-to-understand concepts. He deals with the latest Ansi C++ standard and also includes an easy to use compiler for hands-on manipulation of the example code. He deals with concepts like vectors and lists and dequeues that many other C++ books simply overlook. He builds on simple ideas step by step and repeats important \\"must-remember\\" ideas regularly to keep the reader in touch with what he is trying to do. I am surprised this book is not rated higher by Amazon as it certaintly is one that should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"In this book, Percy isn't opposed by Chauvelin, really, but instead, has to deal with a femme fatale, instead.A young woman ends up in the bastille because of a complicated story involving the execution of her father. When the mob releases her after the storming, she goes the other way, and becomes a feared agent of the blade, and is in fact nicknamed after it.She works to take revenge on those who wronged her, and their families. This is where the Pimpernel and company work to try and stop her and save the innocent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An expanded version of a beloved guitar album","review":"What a wonderful album this is.

Starring several popular low-budget horror hotties of the era, it was an execrable exercise in padding out newly shot nude scenes with film clips from directors Wynorski and Ray's arguably slightly better works. If you've already seen \\"Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers,\\" \\"Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama,\\" \\"Night of the Demons,\\" et al, then there's no reason to watch this. None at all.

I wouldn't recommend this if you have wide feet. My bf has narrow and long feet (he always tightens his sneakers as tight as possible)so this worked out perfectly for him.What I love about this is the cushion and that it stays in shape even when you're not wearing it - so easy to slide your feet in!My current one is a soft microfiber one which I have to wiggle around to squish my feet in the slippers. Small difference, but big plus for the scuff slippers.the patterns inside reminds me of British boy's uniform.. don't ask me why, but adds a hint of classiness to the design. + I can tell it's quite durable. durable enough to occasionally wear it outdoors.

I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to listen to","review":"Whoever paired Johnny Cash with the producer and backup musicians on this album ought to be shot. \\"Overproduced\\" is an understatement on a number of these tracks.\\"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\\" was the big single on this album, but it hasn't aged well, tinkling synthesizers and guitars with special effects sound especially jarring with Cash's rough hewn voice.Trust me, you buy this album, you'll listen to it once....but I'll wager you don't listen to it a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info!

I remember when this (un)expected CD hit the stores + shocking (sort to speak) the music world. Twelve tracks of the beloved Mr. Boone giving metal / hard rock classics his personal touch. I'll say this much for Pat Boone - he came up with an idea that certainly was completely original. I mean - he took songs like Alice Cooper's \\"No More Mr. Nice Guy\\", Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\", Guns 'N Rose's \\"Paradise City\\" and Ozzy's mainstay \\"Crazy Train\\" (to name a few) and had managed to make them sound entirely like a different song altogether. Too much of a crack-up to give a one-star rating. Deserves a two-star rating for the novelty alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Pat! (And it's funny!)","review":"People that don't like this don't have a sense of humor,I think you can find something funny about ANYTHING,even my beloved \\"classic rock\\" can be made fun of!It's very funny in a \\"Plan 9\\" kind of way!Pat Boone's faltering voice has seen better days, and the fact he got in hot water over this tame,innocently-bad,funny album is freakin' hilarious!Play Pat's \\"Enter Sandman\\" at the (very) end of your next (Halloween?) party!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Concept Album Ever","review":"Seriously, if the concept is how to arrange a ton of rock songs into snappy, Frank Sinatra-esque arrangements this albums is top notch. Not only is it totally hilarious hearing Pat Boone talking about \\"getting stoned\\" on his long way to the top if you want to rock and roll, the production values are outstanding. I will literally snap my fingers to some of the gems on here. Even the songs that don't seem to fit work in some bizarre way (like Love Hurts). I cannot recommend this album any more. It is truly a high water mark of our civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"More twisted than William Shatner doing Mr. Tambourine Man","review":"I had thought that William Shatner's renditions of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" were the apotheosis of twisted cover tunes. I was wrong, incredibly wrong, Pat Boone serves up 12 of the most twisted cover tunes ever done, including a big band version of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" that probably has John Bonham spinning in his grave at 33 and 1/3rd RPM. The brassy, big band arrangements, backup singers and Boone's mumbling vocal stylings combine to form one twisted album that's an absolute howl. Fans of this sort of thing can only hope that a collaboration is in the works between Boone and William Shatner. Now that would be an album even funnier than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Left to the Imagination","review":"Trust me, what you imagine this CD might be like is a lot more entertaining than the disc itself. If the idea of this project appeals to you, pick up LOUNGEAPALOOZA or ANYTHING ELSE. You'll thank yourself, if not me.This thing might be worth having for the orchestrations and the backing vocals, which are darned decent, but our Mr. Boone is a total loss, even as a joke.If you've heard the world-class lameness of his AIN'T THAT A SHAME (He wanted to record it as ISN'T THAT A SHAME but even Pat had to admit it just didn't work.), then you already know he can't sing rocknroll. The bizarre thing is that he can't sing SWING, either. Mr. Boone's legacy seems fated to remain, \\"See the USA in your Chevrolet.\\" Ah well. It's more than I ever accomplished."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Oddity","review":"If you think the idea of Pat Boone attempting to sing heavy metal is bizarre, just listen to this little horror. Howver, as comedy, it is somewhat entertaining, with the same mixture of hilarity and revulsion to be found in watching \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" or \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\" Musically, it is absolutely dreadful; however, in fairness to Mr. Boone, the worst cut on this disc is vastly superior to the best of anything ever done by Wayne Newton, although that is not saying a great deal; the same claim could be made for the Chipmunks. Be that as it may, this is a moderately enjoyable work of comedy for those whose tastes lean towards the weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly. ...","review":"Pat Boone has just killed metal. I can't even bring myself to describe what he did to Zepplin. In fact, when I heard this thing, I wanted to grab my entire music collection and run, screaming in horror, for the nearest cliff. And what's with that album cover? Is this guy for real? The mere concept of this album is downright amoral ... I give it minus 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't pick the right metal songs","review":"Pat picked too many mainstream metal songs to cover here. It would have been cooler and more ballsy to have picked songs from bands like Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, GWAR, and Goo Goo Dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH my gawd, is this stuff legal?","review":"I love Pat Boone and I'm hoping this album is tongue in cheek. It not, then it's arguably the worst album ever recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears, oh no, my ears!","review":"This presentation of Mr. Boone's deserves a 1 for effort, a 5 for the best bad thing I've ever heard. He made of mess of Little Richard's \\"Tutti Fruitti\\" way back when. So, in keeping with such destruction, he went after our precious metal hits. Funny stuff, though. I keep thinking of the those sad off the strip casino bands trying to entertain folks who just want a $1.99 breakfast and a win at the nickel machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is worse than I thought","review":"I thought that Pat Boone was going to eschew his sqeeky clean image and sort of goof on himself by doing metal (of course \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" is not metal but... whatever). Instead, the arrangements do justice to Nelson Riddle. A good goof on himself would have been Ibanez guitars roaring with the distortion petals activated. Rather, we get a 1940s big band sound. If this is a goof, it is a subtle one that went right by me. I actually think the guy was serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh????

The songs are rearranged in a big band style, which doesn't really work, although \\"Smoke On the Water\\" is kinda fun. For someone that was one of the original rock and roll stars, Pat still has no feel for singing rock songs. Some people might think this album is \\"so bad, it's good\\". I'll admit that listening to one or two of these songs can be amusing, but after hearing a whole album of it, I'm saying \\"enough already!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, God, Why?!","review":"Pat Boone singing heavy metal songs? No, unfortunately, this isn't a joke, this is all too real. This is really Pat Boone singing Metallica, Judas Priest, and Van Halen songs. I'm not an expert on theology, but I'm pretty sure this is a sign of the Apocalypse. Actually, the Judas Priest one isn't too bad, but the rest is pretty horrific. Hey, it's cool that he, of all people, has enough respect for this kind of music to do this, but you know, sometimes, when you get an idea to do something, you gotta consider the possibility that it's just not a good idea.

Presenting Professor de Quincy's conviction that consciousness exists down to the level of single-cell animals and beyond, Radical Nature is a intriguing study offering a transcendental viewpoint of living things.

I used to wonder why humans have made such a mess of the environment, now I know why. And de Quincy lays it all out step by step about how we can get back on the right track.

Fortunately I found were I can purchase just the nibs for the Cross Century 2 pens and so I'll likely pick up a very fine nib in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect pen!","review":"This beauty arrived!

Perhaps because of the scarcity of material (he recorded comparatively little), the material on this album is not always totally felicitous �?e.g. there are moments when the accompanist is going in a different direction from the singer. However, there is much to enjoy, particularly the Fiesta por Bulerías at the end with Romerito, El Borrico, El Diamante Negro, El Sordera and El Sernita.Guitarists are Paco de Antequera on two tracks, Manuel Morao on the rest.The total time is 40'00\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, emotional read","review":"if you like the deeply emotional reads that can drive you to tears, you'll love this book. unfortunately for me, i like more light-hearted reads. while this was technically a great book, it won't last long in my memory bank. there is really nothing wrong with it, but i found myself getting bored after Catherine and Michael get together. the tension of forbidden love was great, but the momentum was gone when their love was not so forbidden. nonetheless, i am a picky reader, and i know most other readers will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent. could not put this book down.","review":"I HAVE READ ALL THE FALLEN ANGEL SERIES.THEY WERE ALL INTERESTING WITH A SENSE OF HISTORY.

That is, until I learned from a lecturer about its mistakes. There is a picture in the book captioned as being of Pickett when in fact it's another man altogether. You'd think someone who did their research and wrote a book on this man would at least get that right. In another part of the book there's a quote from one of Pickett's men. The author edited the real quote and ended up leaving the last part off trying to portray Pickett as a drunk.

Her accusations are both silly and shameless, and supported by nothing more than the common misconceptions about the General that became popular after the war.

Romance","review":"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!! I first saw this movie on TV as a kid and I never forgot it. The ending haunted me. But I really enjoyed watching it again. Who knew Joan Collins could ACT? She brings a quiet determination and yet a fierceness to her part. And Richard Burton? I gotta say, it would be a tough choice as the movie shows. I understand that he did not want to do this movie but he still is Richard Burton and he graces anything he is in. Cy Grant, who died this year I believe, had a very distinguished career in Great Britain and was a well-loved figure, I understand. He brought dignity to his role. But of course, this being a movie of 40 yeas ago or so, you knew his fate right off. But it's kind of like the \\"Red-Shirts' of Star Trek. Oh well.

Maybe, Martha. . .","review":"Sarah Canary was required reading for this year's Bluffton Univ. Eng. Festival. Karen Joy Fowler was the guest author. Upon reading the book, I immediately thought of Calamity Jane as being Sarah Canary - but her name was Martha. She died of syphillus, so going crazy toward the end was quite possible. Until meeting Ms. Fowler, I never considered Sarah an alien and I didn't read the book with a dry sense of humor. Having met and spoken with the author, I look forward to reading the book again. She can really weave a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, Unclassifiable Ride","review":"Reading this book was an odd experience. The historical setting was convincing, the characters strange and alive, the commentary disturbing. Sarah Canary herself is an enigma; we never discover who she is or why she's here, but those who meet her are held captive by her spell. The novel bogs down in the middle, but the end is heartbreaking and inevitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd And Compelling","review":"A very odd and compelling story. I found it difficult to believe the actions of most of the characters in this story. B.J. was the most believable. The workings of his mind were interesting to follow, being humorous at times and insightful at other times. The main pull of the story, for me, was to find out what is Sarah Canary and what happens to her. I was disappointed in this regard, as this issue was never satisfactorily resolved. It was an interesting story, but failed to answer the many questions that were raised throughout. The book seemed to dissipate rather than end. I would be interested to hear a discussion group's insight on this book. Maybe there is something I am missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quirky, unclassifiable book, but not my bag.","review":"I would recommend this book to literary types, anyone who like the movie \\"The Piano\\", & maybe even Northern Exposure fans. This book skirts many genres Western, science fiction, fantasy, quest novel, & mainstream literature without really belonging in any of them. The moments about oddball history were my favorites. Also Fowler is willing to show the negative sides of feminists(In fact I thought the feminist character was rather unpleasant & as exploitive of sarah as anyone) Although the feminist agenda is there & I think that's what turned me off. (I remember all the \\"sane\\" white males being unpleasant, but that may not be true.) The idea that the eccentrics are ,perhaps, better people is appealing & the book has a certain charm.

I kept waiting for something, anything to make sense. Alot of rambling on and on about oddball historical events in the past that had nothing to do with the actual story except the fact that the story was oddball enough. And who was this Sarah Canary? We never find out! We never really find out why she is mad, where she came from, where she was going. We only catch her in the middle of her journey where she runs across several other oddball characters that are not endearing or interesting.

She is dubbed \\"Sarah Canary\\" because she has no English, and possibly no language at all: her only means of communication is a peculiar warbling song which does not seem to mean anything at all: and thus, people who encounter her interpret it through their own experience and filters.In SARAH CANARY, Karen Joy Fowler takes the reader on a haunting journey through a long-forgotten time and place, where Chinamen are almost as alien as women who cannot speak, where spiritualists have the power to command huge audiences and change lives. Yet, it is a time and place with repercussions for our time and place, and the book resonates with contemporary readers.The mood and feel of SARAH CANARY stays with you for a very long time after you've put the book down: you may find that you want to go back and revisit it at a later date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross Starred Lovers","review":"Favorite Movie of all! -It consumes you as if it were real.

Now that I've seen it for the second time, I don't even think it is ok. I guess when I was younger, I either missed or wasn't so bothered by the way Robert Redford's character treats Barbara Streisand's, not to mention the way he treats his daughter. He just leaves Katie right at the point when he finds out she's pregnant with his child. And at the end of the movie it appears that he has never kept in touch with either of them. This bothered me to the point where I just couldn't have any sympathy or any positive views about Redford's character and, without this, the movie doesn't work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Is there anyone out there that agrees with me that this movie is big disappointment?

I am a person very easily moved by human experiences, fictional or real. This movie did nothing for me. I couldn't lose myself in their lives.

I normally can't stand love and drama, but in this movie love was the thing that brought the characters together and tore them apart. I thought the writers were very clever on how they showed a very passionate driven compulsive relationship with a guy who lives for the moment and everything comes easy.

How about the rest of the cut scenes? Legend has it that there is much more.2.Barbara's commentary is good but I really think she could have added a lot more. What about the screen play she supposedly was interested in that was, in essence, a part two of this movie entitled \\"the way we are\\"?3.Redford is absent on the disc because of \\"scheduling\\" problems?

You can't help but feel that Streisand and Redford are close friends of yours. Every line, gesture and action on their parts rings true.No technical wizardry or special effects (save for a beautifully remastered tape) are used or really needed. Barbra never looked lovlier. The 40's style made people finally forget about Barbra's unique look and realize that she is as beautiful as her voice . . .

Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford shine as a couple of polar opposites who are doing their best to make things work despite their differing political and economic views. Through it all, and despite their differences, their love for each other keeps them together year after year while they try to make their relationship work. The love story is beautiful, well told, and difficult not to enjoy.

She has a strong personality in real life and the director allows her character to show it full force in this film. It's a classic that needs to be seen more often. It is more of a chick flick I think.

The \\"New\\" recording has some fine performances and the new song \\"Crazy\\" is cool, but \\"Next Time I Fall In Love\\" is so synthy and schmalzy compared to the very moving \\"Only You,\\" which can only be found on the German soundtrack as one song (it was changed after London).

I am wondering what happened to the band that rocked Slane Castle? I won't rehash all of the negative reviews that slammed the video and editing as they were spot on. Blu-ray? Puh-lease. DTS sound and video on Live at Slane Castle was mind blowing, as was the performance and set-list selection by U2. Unfortunately that was not the case with this concert and you can really tell that this was the end of the 360 tour because they all looked and sounded tired. My hat is off to the engineering and logistics that went into the set and production. I can't imagine what that probably cost and took to haul that thing around from concert to concert. Hopefully the guys get some much deserved rest, fire whomever talked them into this over-the-top circus set approach and come back out with a real Blu-ray experience that we don't have to throw into the 'I want my money back' DVD pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment...","review":"Having been to the Boston/Foxboro 360 show, I was pumped to see that this DVD had been released and couldn't wait to relive the show. Bottom line is that this looks like a 2 hour commercial or a music video. The director and/or producers are not at all concerned with attempting to document what it was like to see this amazing concert but make it a point to show us what fancy editing and camera magic they can do. It is \\"cleaned up\\" so much that you can't even hear the audience at all for the majority of the show. The only thing good about this DVD is the setlist, but it is painful to watch. Hopefully, the band releases another DVD of this tour and direct the director to make it more realistic looking with some great shots from a crowd standpoint. There is not even an intro segment that shows the amazing stage in light, the gigantic crowd, or the band even coming on stage. I would pick the Boston 2001 or even the Pop Mart Tour DVDs over this one any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Longtime fan here since Boy.I was at this show, and this actually makes the concert seem better than it was.Bono's voice has been \\"touched up\\" quite a bit here, he's definitely on the downside of his career.Same quibbles about the the picture that others have stated. Definitely NOT of the caliber of other Blu-Ray Music videos, particulary Rush Snakes and Arrows live isBetter extras than last few releases.Better direction than last 3, Hamish Hamilton butchered those.Not on a par with Pop, Red rocks or ZooTV.Oh, and a completely mystifying decision as to why the ACTUAL show opener 'Breathe' is only here as an Extra, that's just a stupid juvenile decision.For completists only"},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 Ain't What They Used To Be","review":"I saw U2 in 1992.

Now, I need to pay to return it, and re-order the two disc version, which has that song on the second disc. I love U2, but they should have included all songs from the concert on the 1-disc version.

This release truly confirms they are this era's most incredibly over rated bands and are mediocre at best. Having been decades since the release of \\"The Joshua Tree\\", their last brilliant offering, U2 fans have become a hypnotized lot, buying anything that this long, since \\"gone\\" combo churns out for a quick buck.

For a band that's always changing and taking new risks, isn't it time the front man did the same?The promo tour for NLOTH started off well with Bono looking mean and moody in eye-liner. Then people start bitching that a rock star in his late 40's can't do that (completely ignoring the fact that Iggy Pop, Dave Gahan and Michael Stipe still do it) and surprise, surprise, the googles are screwed back on for the tour!Next time you take them off during \\"City of Blindling Lights\\" Bono, throw them into the audience for good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD and U2 suck.","review":"U2 sucks, always has, always will, and this dvd is horrid.

I had looked forward to watching this on blu ray, and should have read these reviews first. This is by far the worst concert film I have ever seen. It has the quality of an amateur 16 year old videographer. Too many cuts/edits/jerky cam/zooming in & out. Very distracting and completely removes the viewer from a concert experience. I would expect this kind of camerawork for a music video, but not for a concert film.Can't finish watching it. Headache-inducing. 2 stars for the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost makes up for missing the concert","review":"I was one of the many who had a ticket for this concert summer of 2010 that was postponed.

The pre-order price was the lowest anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing show, poor quality video","review":"I received this and The Bruce Springsteen, London Calling BluRays the same day. After watching Springsteen I couldn't even sit through this. I seriously don't see how this could have been shot on HD equipment. The difference between this and the Springsteen concert is like the difference between a DVD and a VHS tape. Heck, The Who, Live at Kilburn, which was shot 33 years ago looks better than this. Strangely, some of the bonus material (specifically the making of feature)is of far better resolution. The 2011 leg of the tour, where the band replaced some of the weaker new material with songs from Achtung Baby and Zooropa was far better. This video could have been improvedhad they waited for a later concert after the show and setlist had been perfected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult","review":"This is an insult for the buyer.A video-cassette has a better picture then this .I gave it one star for the excellent soundtrack.You have been warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mala Imagen","review":"ESte en un buen concierto pero solo por las canciones, en lo que se refiere ala imagen es horrible para ser blu ray, no vale la pena la compra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother paying extra for Blu-Ray","review":"I give this a 5 for the marvelous DTS soundtrack and a minus 1 for the horrendous video. For a group that is supposedly on the cutting edge of multimedia, the video on this blu-ray looks like one of my old VHS tapes from the early 90's. Dark, grainy, and off-color. I should know because I attended this concert. Having seen clips of the upcoming Springsteen dvd which is in true HD, I plan on returning this in exchange for that as soon as possible. What a shame. Wait for 2 months when this appears in the bargain bin at Walgreens."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting more based on the hype...","review":"I had high expectations for this Blu-ray release, but now having seen it I was very disappointed. There's nothing wrong with the concert, production values, performance, etc. but the video quality was atrocious. It was not at all what I thought I'd get. I guess I was spoiled I just got through watching Foo Fighters live at Wembley (a reference Blu-Ray DVD)and that Blu-Ray was spectacular for clarity and detail.

Well, I did not give 5 stars for one reason.

Good show and was really looking forward to this release since I was part of it. Was I disappointed.OMG the amount of shaking there is in this video is just amazing. There is some massive jerking going on in this video. The video is not smooth at all. Very very poor quality considering this is the biggest band in the world right now. My theory on this, well here goes: As you know this show was broadcast live on YouTube and and I think they just used the same cameras for this release. I was next to one of the cameras and believe they were not exactly the HD cameras you see ESPN crews using.Anyways sound wise it is decent, but video quality wise it just appears that it is buffering all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, not good.","review":"What is it with U2? I've seen them, I don't know, maybe 10 times since '87. Every show was completely amazing. I've always appreciated when they've reinvented their sound (well, maybe not on Pop) and am even a big fan of No Line ... (and it seems like I'm in the minority here). But, when I saw them in New York last year, I couldn't believe it was the same band. The sound was absolutely terrible and the performance was so lacking that, for the first time, I regretted spending tons of money to get great U2 tickets. I've never seen a band just go through the motions the way they did that night. I understand that they're getting older and all that (by the way, not an excuse - look at Metallica), but a band in their position owes it to the fans to maintain the standard they've been setting for the last 25+ years. Sadly, U2 didn't do that on the last tour and definitely not on this DVD - while the sound is ok, the rest of it comes off like a cheap cash grab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"After I found out the release date for U2360 and placed my order with Amazon, I watched the mailbox daily in excited anticipation of the arrival of my new Bluray. I was at the opening night show in Chicago and loved the show but was too far away to enjoy it fully, so this disc was to be the up-close-and personal version for me.It's not. I can't evevn sit through a whole song. The audio is quite excptional, but the video quality is horrible. The frame rate is so foul that it seems like the hardware is at fault. Based on other reviews (and swapping back to other movies) it seems the effect in intentional. While I can appreciate artistic vision, this is not that. It's just plain impossible to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 is always the BEST!!!","review":"Fast shipping. Thanks. Great product. Will do more from this Seller soon.

Unlike the other guides, the Lonely Planet Guide to Spain was not useful or helpful. Although I travelled to Spain in 2005, the 2005 edition's information concerning prices for lodgings, food, transportation and attractions was already out of date. One wonders when it was last updated. Moreover, the book is bulky and poorly organized, making it difficult to pinpoint information.

Lonely Planet Spain does not seem to contain any details that don't have to do with hotels/hostels, restaurants, or public transport, or other practical topics. We were more interested in soaking up the flavors, the ambience, and the culture of the country and its people, its customs and traditions, its arts and its music.

If you want a super gentle liver \\"petting\\" formula, then yeah, use this product. I say \\"petting\\", because this formula absolutely will not cleanse your liver.If you want a liver CLEANSING/REJUVINATING formula, look elsewhere. You'd have to take 20 pills per day of this formula, to get the same effects you'll get from a good chinese herbal formula, such as liquid preparations of Chinese Bitters, Coptis, Gold Coin Grass, etc.The only good thing about this formula is that it's available on amazon here for about $7 less than I bought it for in my local vitamin store, lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Time or Money...","review":"Although I rather enjoyed reading this author's book about Frank Sinatra some time ago, I can't say the same for this book.

Ms. Kelley also dwells on the Prescott and George HW days a LOT more than the current President's life and career. Seemed like she was getting tired of writing the book, towards the end, last 50 pages or so, just 'wrapping it up' and getting it over with.

They are not interested in getting news from multiple outlets, all over the political spectrum. Instead, they are interested in just drinking Kool Aid and calling themselves informed.This is one of those products. It is largely BS and is intended to prey on the hatred and flat out ignorance of extreme liberals in order to make a buck.

I don't know if Lafcadio was the first of his children's books to be written (probably not) but it was the first to get published, and IMO, it is the best of them all. It's a story of a lion who becomes the darling of the human world but eventually loses his identity--is he an animal, or a human? Of course, there are all these sly cracks at how wonderful and amazing Uncle Shelby is, but hey, it's the author's license....But I can't say who would love it more--children or adults. So I will say it appeals to absolutely everyone and that all should go read it. That should work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lafcadio Rocks","review":"This book be so crazy! I loved it since I was a kid. I love Lafcadio and his actions. His very fast actions. Like eating the hunter and growling when he doesn't get wants. Very quick, spontaneous, and funny.

Would not charge again on the Nikon MH-21 charger. Purchased after market charger just in case it may have been due to Nikon charger circutry check for Nikon chip in battery. Still would not charge on after market charger either.

From \\"Mein Heir\\" with its start and stop piano and stomp to Liza's \\"Maybe This Time\\" these songs are pop staples.

It was defintely worth the wait! I can see why they have titled the CD \\"The New Classics\\", for each song deserves that description when performed by Julie. Many singers have fantastic voices, but I've found many of them sing as if they have NO idea what they are singing about. Sure, they reach in their vocal \\"bag of tricks\\", but in the end you're left empty. Not with Julie singing the songs! She pulls you into each song with her, and when she's done with you, you know that SHE knows what she's singing about!

There are 5 really good songs on here (tracks 3,5,7,8,11), but the rest really aren't that great. I just can't believe all the hype this is getting through the net and magazines?? Are they listening to the same album? Clipse's mixtape \\"We Got The Remix\\" is 10x better than this. Check that out if you wanna hear some classic Clipse.

Listen rap fans: the problem with many full-length hip-hop albums is the obligatory 49 tracks per CD (not to mention the 12 interludes and 18 hidden bonus tracks) where you're sure to find loads of filler and -- as a result -- be turned off by what could have been a masterpiece had it been whittled down to a select few songs. The average pop CD contains a total of 12 tunes, so it's refreshing that Clipse didn't conform to the usual hip-hop excess (and created something of a classic in the process)."},{"rating":"1","title":"broadway elevator music","review":"This CD is not a good one if you are looking for the tunes as you would hear them in the musical.

The majority of the stories here are, unfortunately written with a heavy handed, unsexy style of clinical sex that is anything but what I'd term \\"erotic\\". Juvenile descriptions of faceless body parts entering other faceless body parts does not equal erotica. There was little story and even less characterization here and the \\"vampire\\" tales were mostly rehashes that have been done far better by other authors. My recommendation is to skip this one, save yourself a few bucks and if you're looking few a few chills and thrills pick up a Hot Blood anthology (edited by Jeff Gelb) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a lot of room for improvement","review":"I have read this book, but while it was a simple read, it leaves a lot of room for improvement. Cinnamon Roses is the best story by far. The others, while interesting reading, are not all that well written. This would be a good book for your collection if you are a rabid fan of vampire stories, but if you are a discriminating reader, skip this one. Anne Rice's books while not overtly marketed as Erotica have as much sensuality as this, and a delightfully well done story line to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"nelson 5200","review":"Biggest piece of junk I've bought in a long time.

The harmony on the vocals, the music, and the lyrics are all great. If I had one criticism of the CD it's that it is too upbeat through almost the whole thing. A couple of songs (in particular \\"Into Your Head\\") get a little bit of a downshift in mood.

I tried wearing it over a thin long sleeved shirt to get some protection, but the shirt just bunched up and still irritated my skin. And of course the item is non-returnable. So buyer beware!

Though Lisa is not the criminal, nor is she the crime solver, this is her novel: it is about one person's quarrel with the world and her suspicion of those who populate it. It's a challenging mystery, densely populated, with a surprise ending. My quarrel with the book is that it is rife with opportunities for interesting character development and psychological insights, but none of the characters are ever fully developed, and the reader is left with impressions and shadows, not the sharp edges of well-defined characterization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"This is a MUST HAVE product for anyone win piercing.

One such airman was Bill Grosvenor, who crashed in a field in Flanders. Although Grosvenor was one of those who didn't make it safely back to Britain (though he did survive the war), the film revisits many of the venues of his wartime itinerary, and, more importantly, those members of the Belgian resistance who came to his rescue, including the two Dumon sisters, Andree Antoine Dumon and Micheline Ugeux Dumon. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"This is an excellent story of how ordinary people risked their lives to help an American pilot.

He seemed to me to be more like the kind of guy who would be persecuting nerds. College is full of beer-drinking, burping, low-life \\"party-dudes\\" like he is portrayed to be.

I contacted Deltran's service department and they treated me like I was an idiot not listening when I told them what steps I took and telling me to retake those steps. Then they \\"forgot\\" who I was so I had to start over with the communication and press for a replacement. Deltrans response was for me to pay to ship it - roughly $8 - and include a check for $8 to ship it back to me and maybe they would replace or fix it.

There is no overriding theory presented that allows one to gain an understanding about how to frame and solve problems using Analysis services nor about what kinds of problems can and can't be solved.

In this age of plastic and synthetic I am quite surprised that the membrane can not take chemicals very well. The piston pump does not have a membrane so would probably do better.The membrane kit is $19.95 and very difficult in my opinion to replace; this indicates a poor design, meaning, It should be a simple thing to replace something that you know will have to be replaced.I bought a Stanley backpack sprayer, will report later on that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maintenance shocker","review":"I have owned this sprayer for about a year now and the unit has clogged up somehow, even though I'm normally pretty careful to clean after each use.

The brain fog diminishment started to appear after 1 month and stomach/bowel normalization took about 2-3 months to really kick in.

Ask enough vague questions and something will click with someone. Yes, I was a skeptic. Having stumbled upon the Crossing Over show I was quickly enamored, often left in tears as I watched the readings. This book focuses on his own early skeptisism and the evolution of his abilities, his failures, his successes and his own search for signs from his late mother. Is it all staged? I'd have to have a reading myself to be 100% convinced but by doing as he asks \\"opening your mind\\" and keeping \\"a healthy skeptisism\\" I have come to believe in the possibilty.

More about his ego and how many people he had to get to know to make it big. Sadly, he states in his book that he would never charge prices based on what the market will bear - but his private readings are $750.00 which means he has given into the mercenary side. My goal was to study metaphysics and spirituality - and this book is about how to get your own television show.

The first 60 pages contain a less detailed autobiography than the one which can be found in \\"One Last Time.\\" The rest is all about his rise to success and I could really not care less about that. \\"One Last Time,\\" although not successful when it first came out, was much more interesting - all about his development as a psychic/medium, his eventual adopting of it as a career, what he actually does in a reading and a number of stories about people he has helped. Although \\"One Last Time\\" is apparently out of print, there are still plenty of copies available online, and much more worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing Over - what a ride!","review":"One of the nicest things about reading John's work is that it is very conversational. That makes it easy to read and a little easier to appreciate just how difficult the whole process was and is. There was certainly no 'magic' in this latest experience. I cannot imagine having to endure such an emotional ride just to get the tv people to understand they really didn't have any control over 'destiny'. The fun part is having them come to their own realizations - I got several good laughs out of those excerpts.

A must-read for believers and skeptics alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Edward's Best","review":"I love all of John Edward's books, but as he goes on to another book, it seems better each time.

He describes spiritual matters like a high school student writing a termpaper on a topic he hasn't researched enough. From a person with several years of psychic work behind him, this was very disappointing. He either has nothing to say or he simply doesn't know what he's talking about and is trying to [immitate] it. In either case, he is an extremely poor writer and he didn't hold my interest.A couple of the anecdotes were slightly interesting, but most of it is just pointless fluff, in my humble opinion. If you want personal anecdotes of a psychic medium AND some basic info on the afterlife, James Van Praagh's first book is a much better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as \\"One last Time\\" or \\"What if god were sun\\"","review":"I'm a John Edward fan, but didn't enjoy this book. In fact, I couldn't finish it. I loved \\"ONE LAST TIME\\" and \\"WHAT IF GOD WERE THE SUN\\". This book is difficult to follow because too many names are introduced, too much technical lingo. You need to take notes just to keep it all straight. I understand it's an auto-biography and in life, several people cross your path, but this was just too much.

When I picked up the book and read the back cover, I couldn't wait to get home and start reading. I was disappointed though, the book says, \\"the story behind the stories\\" which leads one to believe it was about the 'behind the scenes' stories of the readings he has done on real people. This book seemed just like an autobiography of John and how he got his show. I do like him very much but really didn't expect to read about how many TV show executives he went to and how many meetings he had to have in order to get his show. Don't get me wrong, the book was not a total disappointment, maybe it is just the way the book was marketed.

The second half is excellent. I too expected more real stories of people making contact with the other side. I was disappointed by that, but I enjoyed the book. I have read many books on grief. Is there anything new out there? Is there anything that deals with losing a grown child. I can't find anything that is written from this prospective. Any help with this would be appriciated.

John Edward does not go into to much excessive detail about Heaven, but that is what I liked about the book. I felt it was honest. John describes his journey as a medium and the journey of his television show in a way that is entertaining. He tells stories of real people he has helped. I read a book by Sylvia Brown and felt she went way overboard in details of the other side and how life and death works. It left me feeling like I just finished a true con-artists book. John's book was the opposite. It made me feel confident that my loves ones are still here with me and that I will see them again some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look behind the scenes of a modern phenomenon","review":"I read this book because I've often heard (and thought myself) that what Edward does is shamefully exploitative. I was curious to see if he had an elaborate \\"vision\\" of the afterlife, a la the always ridiculous Silvia Browne. I was really surprised with what I found. Edward seems like a genuine, sincere, and likable guy. The focus of the book is his personal rise to fame, which seems to be attributable to hard work and chancing to meet and impress the right people - sort of like anything else. He is very convincing in his assertions that his goal is to help people first and foremost, and the money and attention has simply followed. Personally, I'm not convinced of the existence of his spirit-world \\"Boys,\\" as he calls his guides, but there does definitely seem to be something unique about this man, and whatever the source, he seems capable of some remarkable things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life","review":"\\"Crossing Over\\" was the first book of three written by John Edward that I read. It is in fact this book that prompted me to read his other two. \\"Crossing Over\\" is more than just a collection of psychic medium readings that have been preserved by John and investigated after the readings. It's an autobiographic work as well and I found it most pleasurable to not only read this work by John but found myself being part of it as well. I found that I was brought back to many of my own memories as a young boy and young man that I could have just as easily been a very close friend of John's as we had grown together. So similar that in fact I'm now curious about my own phychic abilities as well. One word of warning though, don't read this book without tissues near by; your going to need them.

However, the content does not convince this reader of the validity of Edwards ability to communicate with the deceased. Crossing Over pursuaded this reader that Edwards strong point is the power of suggestion rather than paranormal capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"wake up sheep","review":"My goodness, how John Edward changed my life. First he told me how I had someone close to me pass away once. How did he figure that out? He is not of this Earth. Then he told me how my grandfather misses me very much. Profound!!!

From then on, I raided libraries finding every Asterix book I could lay my little fingers on, and when I reached high school, the French versions of the books were given to us as a fun way to become familiar with the language.(I didn't like that much. I didn't want to struggle through trying to understand Asterix, I wanted to read through and laugh at it. But it was still a better idea than the rest of the stuff they threw at us.)This edition of the book is still excellent, and still funny. It's missing a few details compared to the original, as some other reviewers have commented, but it's not the kind of thing that new young readers will notice is missing.

This fact, however, offers no excuse for the writing style of this book. The use of the present tense serves to obscure the meaning of references to the present day. In the text, does \\"today,\\" mean the year being discussed, or the year of writing? In additon, Fitch mercilessly peppers a paragraph with names, only to use an imprecise pronoun in attributing a quotation. Who was it that said that again? Random comparasions to other writers, (i.e. anne Sexton) spring up in one sentence, neither led up to nor substantiated. Bare facts are laid down side by side with purple prose and phrasal flights of fantasy.In short, the self-consciousness, name-dropping, and obscuring of facts makes this book only slightly less obsfucating than the writing of Nin herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAP HAZARD RESEARCH","review":"There are many things that are just factually wrong in this book. I recommend reading \\"Anais Nin : Literary Perspectives\\" by Suzanne Nalbantian. This is a book that is actually written by people who studied and/or knew Anais Nin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not her best work","review":"Sandra Benitez continues to evolve as a writer, and has certainly avoided the trap of writing the same book over and over. This novel begins in the American midwest, and with a much more conventional feel then her previous works. But it then move into Mexico, and starts to pick up the latin magic of her earlier books. The story also becomes deeper and more nuanced, and thereby more compelling. Always marvelously written, by the end the story is a compelling mixture of midwestern solidity, psychological insight, and Mexican mysticism. It combines the very American dissection of a family gone bad with the overlay of latin magic revealing the facts. This helps to maintain the uncertainty about the outcome and the sense of discovery much longer than a more conventional American novel would have. This was not the Benitez work I liked the best, but it is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy story, maybe interesting if you're Oaxaca bound","review":"A friend recommended the book after hearing that we were going to visit Oaxaca.

After having tortured myself by sticking with it to the inept end, I can only conclude that there must have been a tear in the fabric of the universe letting through the readers of Bizzaro world to write them, because this book stank. The premise sounded intriguing, but the actual plot, and I use the term very loosely here, was dull, had poor focus and little substance. The ending read like the author suddenly tired of writing the book and just abruptly finished it off. Instead of a mastermind, Mission impossible like plan that would actually be needed to take a major cruise liner, especially after the Achille Lauro, this book describes essentially a walk onto the ship that you'd have to be brain dead to believe.

This is not a refrigerator though the packaging and the description here call it a \\"portable mini-fridge\\". Indeed it is technically not refrigerator at all since it does not have a condensing unit but uses some type of capacitors to make the temperature inside the box a bit lower or higher than outside of the box. It doesn't really cool things and it doesn't really warm things though it is also described here as a \\"Cooler Warmer\\" That seems a bit more accurate since it can cool things a bit and warm things a bit though it certainly cannot cool a warm can of Coke to drinking temperature nor heat up a can of soup.

The back wall of the unit gets pretty cool, but the inside cavity does not. I finally had to return it and was told I'd only get a full refund if the unit was defective. They ended up charging me a 20% or so \\"restocking fee\\" for the return and said they tested it and that it worked fine for what I had been trying to use it for. I respectfully disagree.

One area though I wish was more clear - how the \\"real estate agent\\" Sloane got involved with the Rollins family in the first place. There is a very short explanation, but I wish there had been more. Also how he got involved w/one of the supporting characters (Lizzie) is pretty vague.

Sedgwick creates a set of characters that have some depth, although with the exception of the lead I don't find myself caring a great deal about them. Some might argue that the early chapters of the book read like a text on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and possibly passive aggressive behavior, but it comes across as authentic to the characters.Some plot holes are apparent, but what is a mystery if you can't suspend disbelief for a brief moment.All in all a recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"B+\\" for effort, \\"D\\" for execution","review":"Many listeners are just so thankful that The Band have received this tribute that they're afraid to criticize it. The Band had three things going for them: great songs, great musicians, great singers. So here we have the songs, but too many of them come from the second album. The forgotten gems from the later records remain forgotten. I'd like to hear someone like James Taylor do \\"The Moon Struck One\\", or hear Bruce Hornsby do \\"Saga of Pepote Rouge\\" or hear someone perform \\"Livin' In A Dream.\\" Next, a lot of the music is too polite. They're afraid to rearrange the songs (for example, \\"Acadian Driftwood\\"). Third, fully half of these cover versions feature very weak vocals. I'm sorry, \\"Whispering Pines\\" is a beautiful song and Jakob Dylan doesn't have the vocal chops for it. I can think five other versions of \\"I Shall Be Released\\" that are better than this one, and about the same number of cover versions of \\"The Weight\\" that are better than the one included here."},{"rating":"1","title":"band lovers beware","review":"sub-par effort on most tunes, possible exception of the jack johnson cover. buy the originals - as a die hard band fan I was very dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Efforts","review":"Most of the songs on this album are lifeless, note by note renditions of the originals. There are a few exceptions. Steve Reynolds has an interesting take on Stage Fright that brings a different nuance to the lyrics. Rosanne Cash nails Unfaithful Servant and Jakob Dylan's version of Whispering Pines is right on target, too. The Roches, while covering the song pretty much by rote, bring a treacly sweetness to the lyrics and in doing so leave out the sense of dislocation.Amongst the rest, Josh Turner, Trevor Hall, Bruce Hornsby, and Guster all range from downright terrible to terribly disappointing. I can't help feeling that another group of musicians (Tweedy, Farrar, Cary, Adams) would have done a vastly superior job.Buy The Band's boxed set instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother","review":"While some of the performances are good, why bother listening to this when you can get the original? Unless you are giving a song a new spin, I just don't see the reason to redo it and copy the original??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Good As the Originals, But Still Great","review":"Of course these renditions aren't going to be as good as the originals. As noted in some of the other reviews, the Band's strength lies in more than just great songwriting; their performance skills were special and really cannot be duplicated. That being said, this is a very good album. Almost every song is done justice, except for the so-called Allman Brothers Band. Death Cab for Cutie's \\"Rocking Chair\\" and Guster's \\"Wheel's On Fire\\" really add something new. The Roches \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" sounds like Robbie was thinking of them when he wrote it. It seems like Buddy Miller's time on the Sweet Harmony Traveling Review was time well spent considering how much he adds to Lee Ann Womack's \\"The Weight\\". My Morning Jacket's \\"It Makes No Difference\\" is surprisingly close to the Band's without being a slavish imitation. Even the lesser performances are worth a listen.Please note that the order of the tracks as posted on Amazon is completely wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Changes!!!!!","review":"I think this is a wonderful realistic book! I'm glad that there were changes in the BSC members lives because things can't stay the same in life forever. The plots in the BSC books were getting old and boring!

How can you be friends forever if they are all dropping out of the club? And why all the sudden does she have to bring extremely immoral ideas into the situation. I was a little upset about 13 year olds seriously dating in the old ones(I thought that was a little do mature for 9-12 year olds), but now she has stepped beyond the girls having boyfriends, Stacey's father is now considering having a live in girlfriend.

This creates jams immediatly, and clearing them out takes more time than just cutting by hand. It baffles me that this product was engineered so poorly.

I chose this based on the Cuisinart name and wish I had taken it back the next day. Adjustments are difficult and the blade is not at all sharp. It is almost like slicing with the back side of a knife instead of the sharp side. Look for another brand!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And plastic in your food...","review":"I agree with every negative comment above. Here's one that I didn't see yet: Some of the little spikes on the guard are just a hair too long, so that they break off and land in your food when you get to the end of whatever you're slicing. The good news is that the blade is so dull, you'll probably have given up on the machine long before you get to the end of whatever you're slicing. What a sad waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Very similar to other reviewer comments. Took it back the next day. Between the knob getting in the way and jamming the sliced food to the terrible design of the handle, this mandoline should be recalled.

It was terrible! I couldn't believe it was Cuisinart! I assumed my 80-yr-old mother had broken it until I read these reviews. In my home I use a simple circa 1940's metal slicer that I purchased in a thrift store (10 years ago) for 50 cents, and it included the original box, which is cool to display in my kitchen.

It's hard to believe that Cuisinart would market such a horrible product under their name. We kept ours for over a year and doggedly kept trying to slice potatoes for french fries and thin slices for chips. It could do neither function well and we were continuously having to stop and try to pry big chunks out of the slicer. I love to cook but this thing made me want to run out of my kitchen screaming. It is the WORST kitchen tool that I have ever used. I wish that I could have given it a negative star, but go by the reviews.

Now I wonder how Cuisinart let this slip through their engineering design section. Its gripper thing that's supposed to hold the veggies (or whatever) has such short spikes that the veggies slip off. I finally reverted to the gripper from my old cheapie one. The blade on the Cuisinart shreds, rather than slices -- very dull and clearly not well thought out. It's difficult to clean, tends to rust if left to dry by itself, and simply doesn't do what it is intended to do. Way, way overpriced.

At first I thought, \\"maybe I need softer vegetables\\", but carrots, onions, bell pepper? Nothing slices in this waste of space at ANY size. I have never in my life come across such a poorly designed product. I trusted Cuisinart and now have lost that trust. I would not send this to my worst enemy. This is a tool of the Devil.

The first one was a plastic $20 \\"As Seen on TV\\" model, and it FAR surpassed the Cuisinart. The stainless and plastic Cuisinart came with no directions, but having had a mandoline before, I knew how to use it. It immediately and repeatedly jammed, and shredded the plastic nibs on the guard as well....it shredded the plastic nibs better than the jicama I was working with, and shredded them so finely that they shavings could not be picked out of the jicama. I was so disgusted that I threw the whole thing away rather than wasting my time washing it to be able to return it. Don't waste your time!

This product is a huge disappointment. It is hard to use and you can only slice baby carrots and celery length wise as it is not engineered correctly; the carrots slip and fall down length wise when you try to slice them and then when you do slice them length wise, you only can slice 1/2 of the baby carrot leaving the rest stuck in the food handle and it is not setup so that you can slice the entire baby carrot. What a waste. There also needs to be a 'blank' or 'fill in' where the julienne blades are to be inserted as the slices just get caught up in the gap. It also does not feel very stable when you use it; you have to press down so hard to make the cuts and that is not a good thing when you are working with sharp blades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Injured!!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS MANDOLIN!!!

It looks simple to use and is stainless steel. However, I found that this device is the most frustrating gaget I've ever used. the Knob that holds the blade in place is ALWAYS in the way of any item being sliced and the force at which you must push the item being sliced is too much. I tried balencing this over a bowl to keep from catching sliced items on the knob but no avail, every item jambs in this. I think that cuisnart should buy all these back from anyone that has them. I too would give less then 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but not equal to cheaper plastic units","review":"Would not slice sweet potatoes as the cutting blade is not sharp enough.

To add insult to injury, the retailer where we purchased this is now going out of business and not accepting returns! Have written to Cuisinart customer service, and have yet to hear back.................... found a great mandoline @ Sam's Club, pedrini brand- never heard of them, but it's great and it beats Cuisinart's product in every way possible.

Except for all the stainless steel, there is nothing good about this slicer. Previous reviews have covered the awful design and cheap pieces so I'll just second them. Do not buy this off of Craigslist, or from a thrift store, or anywhere, new or used, for any amount of money.

Anything larger keeps slipping off the gripper.

They decide they are meant for each other after a 5 minute conversation about not much of anything. The writing doesn't make up for the lack of interraction between them. The \\"passion\\" falls flat and most of the book is taken up with a drawn-out conflict about whether or not the hero is crazy. What's crazy is that this book took over 300 pages (paperback), and that I read the whole thing. This reads more like a Harlequin romance, all fluff, no substance, and no charisma or sensuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The story has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it was horible. Most of her novels are great and others are an easy read, but this one was not. The characters see each other and fall in love instatnly without saying more than two words to each other. The hero is not likeable, his chracter is undeveloped and he seems like a wimp. The story doesnt revolve around their romance at all and they barely have any scenes alone in the whole novel. The brothers get annoying at some point and so many unbelievable events happen. I read the reviews before I read the novel and thought it couldn't be that bad but it was. There's a little mystery at the end and even that turns out to be unbelieavble and dumb.

The whole situation with this book is the 16 uncles hold a grudge against Lincoln because of something he did when he was 10... 10 for the love of it all. This book has no flare and I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money or time on this book.

I long for the humor and shining characters of her old books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel to Man of my Dreams and Love Me Forever","review":"First, of all I love Johanna Lindsey. I have all of her books inhardback. Second of all, this is the lowest rating I have ever given. This story is the third story after \\"Man of my Dreams\\" and \\"Love me Forever.\\" I truly enjoyed the previous two and was all set to enjoy this one, but I simply could not get into it. There was just not enough interaction between Melissa and Lincoln. All the attention seemed to be focused on the brothers/uncles (who by the way I got tired of immediatelyafter their introduction.) I was so frustrated by the story that I would just jump ahead whenever the brothers/uncles appeared. Then I just stopped reading it completely. Lindsey is one of my favorite authors and I will definitely get her next book in hardback. I just couldn't get through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pursuit","review":"I use to love Johanna Lindsey's books, but her most recent ones are just tripe! This one is no different. It seems like she is just trying to get books out quickly to make money. Her characters in this book are dull and lifeless. I didn't root for Melissa and Lincoln to get together because I didn't care! Then there is the whole idea that Lincoln could be dangerous because of something stupid he did at age 10! Come on and get some new material that is worthwhile! I don't think I will buy another Lindsey book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not her best","review":"I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to read this book, wait for the paperback! The Pursuit doesn't even come close to Johanna Lindsey's other stories. The characters immediately like each other and want to marry - boring. On top of that, the focus of the book is the feud between the uncles and Lincoln. Unfortunately, the basis for the feud is lame as well. Melissa MacGregor's character seems under-developed throughout the book. She almost seems to be a minor character next to the uncles. There isn't a real pursuit in the book - just a few obstacles (uncles) along a relatively smooth path. This really was a hard rating - I own all of her books and have never rated any of them below a three - I rated this one a one. Johanna - If you need to write a story about previous characters, please return to the Mallory's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the magic","review":"I've had to give a one star rating, but really it didn't deserve any - it was dire. I find it hard to believe that this book was written by the same author as the Mallory series, Once a Princess, a Priates Love, Fires of Winter ... etc. The Heir was the start of the rot, but this has taken it to the pits.

After all, they meet and fall in love within the first 60 pages of the book. Most of this asinine (pardon my use of the word) book is dedicated to the idiotic antics of Melissa's uncles keeping her away from the \\"crazy\\" boy they haven't seen since he was 10!!! Who in the world could believe this plot? I was very disappointed. I was hoping for more more romantic tension between the characters and less slapstick from the MacFearsons.I am a huge fan of Ms. Lindsey, and I know that she can write romance that sizzles. This doesn't even fizz. I was glad to visit characters from her former stories, but otherwise I don't think she did any justice to Lincoln and Melissa.Please, Ms. Lindsey, give your fans more of what they like from you.

I don't know about anyone else but I would assume a 29 year old 'man about town' would not blush when his aunt mentions a girl he likes or that he should get married. What happened to a 'hero' who knows what he wants and goes after it. Lincoln acted like someone's little brother who had yet to be taught the ways of the world. I just did not like Lincoln's weak personality.The thought that all of the conflict in this book was because of a fight that happened between two 10 year old boys 19 years ago was frankly pathetic. I kept waiting for there to be more to the story than that, but there never was.I will buy Ms. Lindsey again but certainly not in hardcover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the pursuit","review":"I have never written a review before but I am so disappointed in this book that I feel compelled to warn Lindsey fans that they should not waste their time by reading this one.

The whole situation with this book is the 16 uncles hold a grudge against Lincoln because of something he did when he was 10... 10 for the love of it all. This book has no flare and I wouldn't advise anyone to waste there money or time on this book. The only reason I can come up with as to why this book was published in the first place is bacause it is by Johanna Lindsey.

Nineteen years later he sets his mind to marry the niece of those 16 brothers and they will not allow the marriage due to what happened all of those years ago.

The Puruit sucked the whole way through. I want the hour and a half I spent reading it back.There could have been a decent story in here about a girl who has already made up her mind going through a season anyway, to please her family and learn about society. Instead we get a wooden hero and a cast of unremarkable secondary characters... oh, and no romance to speak of. Lindsey drops potentially interesting plot points like last year's Old Navy fashions, and then throws in every bad plot twist she knows in the last 100 pages.Almost nothing happens in The Pursuit. The entire plot is overtaken by the kudzu-like MacFearson brothers. They're like a circus act.The Pursuit is a sad excuse for a romance novel. I'd give it negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring","review":"Unbelieveably boring, I kept waiting for this book to pick-up but it did not, which left me very disappointed.

Maybe she should re-read some herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Implausible","review":"It's always a bad sign when I start flipping pages foward in a book, looking for something to happen, and it didn't take very long into this book before tedium set in and I was looking ahead. Unfortunately, there wasn't much to find. It annoys me very much when period authors use 20th century concepts like drug reactions and psychobabble to motivate their characters. It simply doesn't ring true, and as a reader, I feel insulted that a writer expects me to suspend disbelief to so great a degree.Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh it was okay","review":"I was thrilled at the thought of reading more about The Macgregor's after Love Me forever I was expecting something with a little more of a kick than wht the Pursuit had Melissa had spirit there was no doubt about it but the author din't do a go job in explain why she was they way she was usually her books are about a couple fighting the love that they have for one another but in this one melissa's loved ones were causing the problems. Lincoln the hero seemed more like a boy that thought that the whole world had wronged him in the end he excepts he was acting childish toward the McFearsons and he lets things be.

I can't waste my time or money on her books any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is It Lindsey's fault or the Publishers?","review":"The book was awful and boring! I think publishers want the authors of today to spit out one or two hardcovers a year, assuming, (erronously) that loyal fans will simply read any garbage put before us. Anyone who bought this JL book did get suckered, I guess, but we romance readers learn quickly from out mistakes. JL should be held somewhat accountable, I suppose, after all, it's her imagination, or lack of, that gave us this story. Lincoln was definitely whiny, and babyish.

I don't think there has been a book that I haven't liked...Well except for this one. To put it nicely. It [STUNK]. There was no plot. Most of the book focused around the Lincoln's (the main character's) emotional drama. In reality, im not even sure you could even call it a romance. It's more like a \\"I'm a whiny boy that can't grow out of my childhood. Waaaa. Woe is me.\\" You get my point.

The first two books of this series were actually quite good. I would give Man of My Dreams a 5 Star and the other Sherring Cross after that a 4 star, but this? Ick, terrible. Deep down I wanted to see a love story between Melissa and Justin (the son of Megan and Ambrose). The plot was silly, a regurgitation of crazy uncles protecing a lovable niece, if you know LIndsey's Malory series you know what I mean.

As a sequel to LOVE ME FOREVER, you would hope it would be filled with the same humor and stirring passion. Instead, it is full of annoying uncles with confusing names and endless nonsense about how Lincoln was a \\"crazy\\" child. Didn't we all do crazy things when we were kids? Does that make us crazy as adults? Hardly. The premise is utter nonsense making it quite a disappointing novel. Ms. Lindsey's past few books lack in quality making me wonder if this author is burned out in romance writing. Perhaps if she followed Julie Garwood's example and changed genre, she may find a breath of fresh air to write a book worthy of her talent.Reviewed by Miriam van Veen"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the silliest book that I've ever read","review":"I have read all of Lindsey's books but her most recent plots have become less and less believeable. I kept asking the question why Lincoln wanted to marry into a family of idiots? Secondly, how could anyone judge a person on an act committed at the age of 10? Also, when her father heard the reason for her uncles' objection to the marriage, why wasn't he objective enough to dismiss the a 20 year old incident that occurred between children? Finally Lincoln's mother's rationale for ignoring her son for all those years was absurd.I give up. This is my last Lindsey unless someone gives one to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Can't Seem to Pick This Back Up","review":"I have read every Joanna Lindsey book and have loved almost all of them. I have tried numerous times to finish this book and I just can't get interested in it. It goes nowhere and there is no romance, no chemistry, no classic Lindsey. I have bought the last few Lindsey novels in hard cover form and I have to say the last three were a disappointment and not worth the cost of hard cover. I will wait for the next book to come out in paperback. Don't waste a penny on this one-wait for the used book sales.I tried, truly to force myself to finish this one, but there are so many other good books and so little time, that I think I will read the last chapter and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME AND ...

They know when they meet that they are destined to be together so Lincoln gets permission from her father to start the courting ritual. But then Melissa's troup of uncles interfere. They think Lincoln is 'crazy' because of an incident that occurred during their shared childhood. So the rest of the book is the family talking about how they think he could hurt Melissa if we went over the bend again and her arguing that he would never do that. Oh, my God, 389 pages of it!

I think that reader's pins are very likely to damage my CF cards if I insert and pull my cards very frequently. Then I decide to get this brand-name reader, with $20 at bestbuy (not a very good price). And I am very satisfied with the product. When you insert your card into the reader, it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader. Just half of the card is inside the reader. So I don't need to pull it very hard when I want to get the card out, it comes out smoothly and I no longer worry about damaging my card.

Now, if she could only act, that would be another star right there. However, Heather's lack of believability is not the biggest shortcoming that this movie has to offer. On the cover of the rental box it claims \\"Thrill-a-Minute\\". If they equate this to the thrill you get when having your teeth pulled, then I would have to agree, but otherwise, I don't see where that statement applies here. The movie starts out slow and never really picks up. And, the ending... yeah, like I didn't see that coming! (\\"So I Married An Axe Murderer\\" does it better). It's very predictable except for the fact that there isn't any resolution between the two lead characters in the end. That wasn't predicatable, just dumb, very very dumb.

Graham recieves faxes telling her that Fiennes is not who she thinks he is and she starts to have suspisions. Fiennes is also a big hero to many and he also has a book about him because years ago he saved some people on a mountain climbing expedition but three didnt survive.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But what makes a bad thing worse (and it can't get much worse than this script) - much worse - is the constant repetition of lugubrious strains from the dreadful soundtrack at every turn in the story. So painful was the effect of listening to this riff, that I finally turned off the sound entirely [...]. The action was easier to follow from that point on (which covers how I felt about the screenplay as well). I feel sorry for Ms. Graham, who was raised under the iron fists of backward Mid-western reactionaries, much like Hilary Clinton a generation earlier, and who really makes a sacrifice everytime she disrobes in a flick. But, I guess there'll be some consolation for her when her folks come around begging when they can't afford health insurance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Me Softly","review":"Appropriate title for a real sleeper. This attempt at presenting an erotic thriller has more climax in its sex scenes than real suspense. The film amounts to being nothing more than a disengaged soft-porn film. The story is so utterly superficial and psuedo-intellectual that you will fall asleep even with these filler erotic scenes.The movie seeks to capture the theme of an unaroused woman who seeks a more exciting man in her life and encounters a writer-mountain climber to fill her passions. She soon feels that she got more than than she bargained for which is certainly not how you will feel watching this movie.The story is capricious and pretentious, the script is tedious, while the acting is as devoid of all emotion as a Kevin Costner monologue. The actor playing the adventurous mountain climber seems to be too bored with life to even bother remembering his role or utter a single passionate line.Don't waste your time or money on this one, it will kill you softly without a doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I hate being critical of this film because I love B movies, but this movie is bad. Really bad. Heather Graham is a beautiful woman, especially nude, but other than that this movie has nothing going for it.

The only reason this movie gets two stars is becuase Heather Graham does great in the sex scenes despite the director failing to focus on her sensuality and just settling on getting her naked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Now!!!","review":"Although I'm not a member of the Heather Graham fan club I was willing to give Joseph Fiennes another whirl after his utterly sweet performance in \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", sadly I could only laugh at this drivel that wishes to mascarade as \\"noir\\" and it isn't even grey. The dialogue must have been rescued from the waste basket of a B movie writer reject. As for satisfying our prurient desires it doesn't rise to the occasion what with the high school amateur acting, ridiculous and predictable plot ... you get my drift. Watch The Weather Channel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartless b*tch","review":"Two stars for Heather's almost-complete nudity, but that's about it. The way her character so callously jumped ship on her loving boyfriend to run to the arms of a mysterious stranger after just seeing him on the street is unforgivable.That sort of storyline is not going to win any guys over, since she makes herself out to be very coldhearted from the get go, and it's a bad influence on women who might think this film glorifies and provides encouragement for that sort of wretched behavior.She had a good life going for her, and fell prey to that typical female urge to ignore her comfortable existence and \\"see what else is out there\\", not realizing, as happens so often to many women, that she'll regret it for the rest of her life.Note to women who may be considering such actions: it's not worth it. Open your eyes to how good you've really got it, and imagine how miserable you'll be when your plans fall through. You'll be left with nothing and no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This movie is a reason why I don't go to movie theater anymore.

The plot sounded interesting, but the lead actress was blank. She lacked character...it was embarrassing to watch her. Her lines were stupid...actually comical!

A lonely bachelorette who falls head over heels in love with a mountain climber. However, his past seems a bit shady.

There's even a brief bondage scene! My goodness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be worth watching, with the right viewer's attitude.","review":"It is not like any of Chen Kaige's other work. Heather Graham is a bad actress. The attraction between the leads is unconvincing. Some of the lines the characters take so seriously that it's funny. So, yes, if you approach this with the right attitude (i.e., it's not an erotic thriller--it's a comedy), you'll thoroughly enjoy it. It borders on camp in the Showgirls and Flash Gordon tradition. Otherwise, stay away--far, far away.There is a lot of sex, but it's not really that explicit, and it's definitely not exciting. Heather Graham's moans are exaggerated and phony. The humping is unconvincing.

This is one of those movies where you don't have to do that as most folks with an IQ above 30 will have the ending correctly guessed by half an hour into the movie.The leads give it a go here but the plot doesn't do them any favors as it is never presents believable characters or situations. The London scenery and Graham give the viewer a little to watch as the trite tale unfolds. It's not a bomb but 2 stars is all it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heather Graham almost makes this worthwhile -- but doesn't","review":"Heather Graham was, as always, incredibly sexy in this film.But alas, I agree with other reviewers who noted the plot here is rather thin. And the demands on the actors' talents are not very high.And for me, the denouement left me unclear about just who had done just what, as explanation of the mysteries that develop in the course of the story. This in particular left me unsatisfied.

You will absolutely love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNDER PENNSYLVANIA SKYS","review":"The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack, a grey-necked Pennsylvainia steel town's hopes and fears are a musical noir that only wants to see the town's high school trophy football go through the field goal.

Life is like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great but not bad.","review":"All the right moves was not bad or great. Football movie with Tom Cruise who acting is not bad. Not his best or worst.

But the movie paints itself into a corner - it winds up hinging on whether or not the high school football coach will forgive his star player for vandalizing his home. Hardly riveting drama. The blue-collar town mood of ALL THE RIGHT MOVES seems realistic. Actress Lea Thompson plays the most All-American young woman I have ever seen on the silver screen. And the film does not exaggerate the kooky love-hate relationship sports fans have with their teams, if you recall what happened to pro athletes Bill Buckner and Mitch Williams after they blew big games. See ALL THE RIGHT MOVES on television, where it's good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it enjoyable fluff in the day","review":"But now somehow just the sight of Cruise's face makes me jump to change the channel.

Craig T. Nelson plays a villian coach who makes a simple coaching mistake during a tough football clash. The coach has a well thought out game plan, until the last play of the game. He ends up costing more than his team's winning against a top-ranked foe, he loses his respect among the team's unsung defensive leader. Cruise works well with co-star Leah Thompson as well as Sean Penn. At times this story may seem unbeleivable, but in many ways it is so true to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remembered this from the theaters and couldn't find it.

Lea Thompson made her film debut, while Craig T. Nelson was outstanding in his potrayal of the head football coach. For those who grew up in the 80s, this is a definite cult classic and well worth the viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Tom Cruise Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"This movie will touch your heart.

This movie is highly evolutionary, the narrator makes it a point to discuss the origins of life three separate times and make claims that I don't believe are true. My advice to the film makers would be to leave this controversial subject out of the film. If you want to learn more about evidence for creation, one of my favorite resources is drdino.com.

Sadly, most of what's shown in the movie won't be new to the audience, particularly if you've seen any of the plethora of nature movies and television specials that have been released over the past few years (a cuttlefish is a cuttlefish is a cuttlefish), but it's still beautifully photographed and looks great on the big screen.While it's lovely to look at, however, Oceans is more than a little tedious to sit through.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"My dad and I watched this, and he made a smart desition.

This DVD is for the true Willie fan, true fans love to see Willie perform his songs differently every night. Willie is at home here performing in Texas. If you have seen Willie's Amsterdam DVD from 2000, this is a great update to see him 3 years later. I saw Willie in November 2003 and this DVD is not far from what I experienced actually being there.

In short, we have lifeless, bloodless cover versions of pop standards that by themselves have been regarded with disdain by many listeners.This impressive compilation contains a bounty of those sweet violins and voices in a style that has long since passed its usefulness. The best moments are campy and unintentionally funny, as when Mantovani attempts \\"contemporary\\" hits by Nillson his ilk. This is orchesetral music for people who have never benefitted from a grounding in the classics. Compared even to outfits like Sounds Orchestral, the sound is drab and musty.

His songs \\"I Got Love If You Want It\\" and \\"I'm a King Bee\\" are also recognized classics, although they are perhaps better known for their cover versions by British Invasion groups. Slim's songs are enjoyable, although he did tend to repeat himself. For example, both \\"Little Queen Bee\\" and \\"Buzz Me Babe\\" are rewrites of \\"I'm a King Bee\\". And he did rewrites of his other popular songs, too. But such a thing is common in the blues field, so he can't really be faulted for that.

However, the word redemption is a grand misnomer- nothing at all redeems the main character and the author's note that claims we all have something of Monroe within us is blatantly offensive. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong part for my Passat","review":"I used Amazon's part finder filter and looked for a brake master cylinder that would fit my 1995 Volkswagen Passat.

The tubes do look fun, maybe for a hamster or a bigger rodent but the 2 mice we have had in it don't like the upper portions of the tubing. I am looking online now for a better option. The tray that pulls out for cleaning is a nice feature. I have been putting pieces of paper to line the bottom of the cage because the wire isn't supposed to be good for the little feet. The shredded stuff falls right through and is awful to try to remove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, too week when laying on top of radio","review":"Kind of works if I hold it up kind of in the middle of my cab, thought of wraping it with wire to go out to the antenna.The problem is it's too cheap at under 8 bucks to ship it back to them.Maybe I'll add an extension so I could tape it to my antenna.

The music really sets the tone for the show in a way that other shows can't or won't. A lot of shows will used licensed music and that works great if you pick the right songs. If not, it just looks like your trying to plug a band. With the ability to create a score for a show or scene you can get much more personal and craft specifically for that moment. Michael Giacchino has done that marvelously in this album! He really captures that feel of Fringe with uneasy moments and deeply emotional parts as well. Some of my personal favorites from this album are \\"Transfusion Triumph\\", \\"The Equation\\", \\"The Dreamscape\\", and \\"A Destroyed Life.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!!","review":"The crystal on these watches is prone to break for no reason.

Also, I find it difficult to fill. It has to be hanging to do so. I have my feeders hanging high to prevent squirrel and chipmunk access. I usually fill my feeders straight from the bag.

The novel reads like something right out of today's headlines even though it was written in 1990. In this book we have a detached President who lets his arrogant Secretary of Defense start a minor war to distract attention from a brewing scandal. We have defense contractors who care more about profits than patriotism. And as with Iraq, the war doesn't go as smoothly as the Sec Def thought it would and a lot of young marines get killed.

Buy it (and check out my other reviews for more in-depth comments on varied Tzadik releases)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing vocally!","review":"Am I the only one out there that finds Cummings' performance to be wholly disappointing this time? His voice sounds nasal, and unusually strident. And wouldn't it be cool if we could hear some new material after all these years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording engineer ruins recording.","review":"Burton Cummings voice may be strong but you can't hear it clearly. It seems as though this is a bootleg recording and the microphones are in the middle of room. The echo makes everything muddy, it's everything that is bad about a live concert. Shoot the sound man, he ruined the artist and stole your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"flawed gem","review":"He is what he is. I, too, wish the sound were better. Geeze, it's just piano and vocal. It is NOT hard to make that combination bright and balanced. I also wish he would screw around less, and I DON'T mean the Gordon Footloose thing, which is GREAT. His waaaaaing and wanga wanga ing are not necessary. If he does that to cover for his diminished range it's doubly not necessary. THE voice is just so damned beautiful.I once was a Road Manager for a Band that opened for the Guess Who, and as they prepared to do a sound check I was marvelling at the sound Burton was able to get and when I looked to check what they were using for vocals realized it was his live, un-amplified voice. I will never forget that.Anyway, the mix of songs here is neat and I was pleasantly surprised to hear that his ego problem (EG: American Woman) was not present. I don't know how many times you can 'bless a crowd's hearts', but I think he found the limit.I'm glad I came across this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is horrible!","review":"I am a true fan of Burton Cummings. This LIVE version has his best work with the audio quality of a gym. I bought this for the songs and got a high school rock band version, instead. Worse off is that there was no indication on the jacket or the description that this was going to be the case! Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the voice, the player, the setting","review":"Here's a good idea, invite one of rocks most interesting and polished singers/pianists and have him perform in a wonderful hall for a small crowd and record the show as if everybody was over at Burton's house for a cookout. Bring your own Yukon Gold and you're all set. The recording is warm and EQed so all of BC's voice inflections and \\"soul\\" comes through and you can here how good a singer and player Burton still is. Being a long time fan and a professional musician myself it was refreshing hearing the music in a way that reflects how these songs sounded as Burton first wrote them or learned them. I love the \\"record\\", The Rod stewert Maggie Mae tune is almost worth the price of the disc by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"robert plant rightly calls burton the best singer in rock","review":"this is a tour de force for cummings, the best singer in rock,period. cummings has a huge ego, but somehow it's disarmingbecause he's so sincere and funny. from dream of a child to albert flasher to sour suite, this is filled with amazing music and some insight from burton - really sorta like VH1 storytellers. enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A special time with Burton Cummings","review":"I found this CD very enjoyable as I have been a Guess Who and Burton Cummings fan for many years. It is sort of a personal touch and your really get a good sense of his music and what it means to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome Album; finally available in the U.S.","review":"I bought this album in Canada a year ago, and now I can order it for friends here! This is Burton Cummings at his best, and it personifies why the Guess Who were so very popular in the 70's! From his solo work to his band work, all the songs sparkle with the power of his voice... to me he has a voice right up there with Sinatra when he sings \\"I will sing you a rhapsody.\\" A must buy, \\"unplugged and alone\\" type of album."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME OF THE BEST UN-PLUGED MUSIC YOU CAN LISTEN TO!!","review":"I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THE \\"GUESS WHO\\" FOR MANY YEARS. THE MAIN REASON WAS BECAUSE OF BURTON CUMMINGS' VOICE. LISTENING TO ONLY HIS VOICE & HIS PIANO PLAYING IS JUST WONDERFUL. ONE CAN REALLY CAPTURE HIS SOOTHING AND ROCKIN VOCALS AND YHE ABILITY TO CARRY A CONCERT ALL BY HIMSELF. THIS CD IS A MUST IF YOUR A FAN OF BURTON & THE GUESS WHO. IT WILL PROBABLY BRING BACK MANY MEMORIES......IT DID FOR ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't listen to it....","review":"I was excited when this album first came out, but didn't keep it for long. For some reason, the iconic Canadian singer/songwriter/pianist was going through a phase with so many annoying vocal ticks -- throwing in ya ya's on songs, etc. -- that it ruined the experience, especially as there is no music besides his piano work to distract you.Indeed, when \\"Runnin' Back Thru Canada\\", the double CD live reunion album by Burton's band The Guess Who, came out a few years ago I hesitated to buy it for this very reason. But relax; the strange vocal mannerisms were gone and that package is brilliant. I'd buy it over Up Close and Alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING film!","review":"This was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen.

This book lists out every little detail about fighters. It also contains some nice illustrations. If you like to be a fighter, you must get this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Good Value","review":"TSR's Complete Book of Fighters is one of rare 'kit books' that will go a long way to enhance any fighter, be they PC or NPC. For the most part the kits themselves aren't well balanced against each other, but on their own they are quite good and would require a minimum of tweaking to bring them into line with each other. For example, the Swashbuckler kit is vastly more powerful than the Peasant Hero kit as far as bonus abilities, skills, etc. Plus the additional background for non-magical or a fighters only campaign is interesting. It is a solidly written book with loads of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Ya Livin? Large & In Charge!!!","review":"DRAMA, DRAMA, DRAMA!!

I've read the reviews, therefore, I'm going to continue reading the book. Hopefully it will get greater later, but right now, I feel like it was a waste of money. I was in the bookstore the other day and picked up a book as soon as I saw that Jonathan Luckett was the author I put that book down like it was hot.

And I didn\`t really enjoyed it but I don\`t hate it that much... I was captured by the front cover of the book.. what did they say about don\`t judge a book by its cover..

A handsome french hopelessly in love with her... Had the best days of her life in a weekend in paris.. The story just sounds too sweet to be true.

This book is easy (and at points, fun) to read, but it wavers between funny and dumb. The ending leaves something to be desired, and everything is a little too neatly wrapped up with coincidences. It certainly does not make me want to go to Paris (except for the Rodin Museum). Weekend in Paris strives for the tone of a Sophie Kinsella novel without quite getting it.

Completely without wit or charm or intelligence. The reader is *told* that Molly's smart because she's been to university, but there's absolutely no evidence of it. In fact, she's perhaps one of the stupidest heroines I've every had the displeasure of reading about. Not to mention that fact that she's spineless. I felt like kicking her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it as a Travelogue...","review":"I do like Robyn Sisman's books. I've read most of it. However, this book lacks intensity and depth of characters and plot. The plot is too contrived, against all odds, characters from the past pop up with synchronised speed to tie up loose ends. It goes totally against the natural rhythm of the pace of normal life.All the characters seem on high, running on a carpa diem or seize the day mentality.One redeeming point is that it captures the Parisian bohemian spirit well, the French laissez-faire and their hedonist attitude on leisure pursuits. It reads more like a travelogue. If you have never been to Paris or have been and liked it, you may wish to enjoy some armchair travel with the vibrant description of Parisian life.I hope the next book by Robyn Sisman would be a big improvement over this one. \\"Just Friends\\", her earlier book remains my favorite and hope she can surpass her brillant mastery of \\"Just Friends\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Picture","review":"Looks like Amazon may have the wrong picture of this product.

I got a replacement unit from SanDisk and it had *exactly* the same problem. Even just copying pictures to the card from my PC and then back onto the PC, results in corrupt images. The only constant in all of this the fact that the images were originally shot with the same camera (a Pentax) but it's hard to imagine that the camera that created the JPEG files could be a reason for the corruption.Online tech support tries to be helpful and they are prompt, but can't do anything but keep sending me replacement units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Mac!","review":"I ordered this based on the good reviews.
