So, as opposed to the Tony Curtis classic, which is basically a fictionalized version of these crimes (like how Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a fictionalized version of Ed Gein), this film is very low budget, but director Mike Feifer is vetren in the serial killer movies field & ol' Bud Bundy himself David Faustino does, in my opinon, the greatest, most accurate depiction of Albert De Salvo that was ever on film. Overall, a good little film."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We were on a serial killer kick and decided to check this out and it was very slow. Also, it seems to lack some information. From the movie Albert was jobless and in a somewhat disfunctional marriage and was paid to appear in police line ups. It only shows Albert killing one woman. The rest are done by other people. Yet, it mentions that the 5 original victims were older and the others were copycats. So Albert didn't kill every one of them...but only the one? Anyway, when the police arrest him the movie doesn't show why or what evidence they have on him. The police just pull him over in a car and the next thing you know Albert is in jail. It would have been nice to have been shown the reasons. Also, the movie never cleared up why exactly Albert was so attached to his prison roommate. The acting was ok. It was interesting to see the young man who played Bud Bundy in a much different role."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUD BUNDY CHOKES","review":"This \\"untold story\\" of Albert DeSalvo, who claimed to be The Boston Strangler suggests that Desalvo really wasn't guilty and was merely a conman and pervert. It has been assumed that Desalvo was not the Strangler due to evidence collected later and the case remains unsolved.David Faustino (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) is miscast as Desalvo. His perfomance is a caricature of method acting with little polish or maturity. I just didn't find him convincing at all. Ditto to Andrew Divoff as the world-weary detective, Kostas Sommer as Desalvo's co-conspirator and possibly more, and Corin Nemec's turn as the sheisty lawyer. Writer/director Michael Feifer has little artistic vision or sense of creativity.

It is mildly entertaining as a book, and the artwork, while flat and lopsided, is bearable. However, the accompanying CD is shamefully bad. I recommend skipping the book and buying one of Guthrie's CD's for children. The songs are much better when Guthrie sings them and accompanies himself. The music on this CD is as flat as the artwork in the book--no more banjo, please! On top of that, the mediocre musicians are accompanied by the Half Tone-Deaf Children's Chorus. The fourth track on the CD is a long, inane \\"discussion\\" between the book's artist and some children who are much too young and suggestible to have anything interesting (or even cute) to say. I recommend not wasting time on this package at all. If you do buy it, keep the book and turn the CD into a frisbee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth 80's Style","review":"William Pitt is my uncle.

Great job Uncle Will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I am a Firm believer but I find this DVD is just awful. I should've listened to another review that said that this was good if someone is a choreographer. There are so many changes and moves that I dropped the leader & was doing my own thing half way through the workout. This DVD doesn't show Libby very often so beginners (or those attmepting to catch onto the moves) are lost as well. Everytime she said, \\"new move coming up\\" I just CRINGED. Good for advanced Firm users, but not for beginners or intermediates. My opinion of course. Also, I didn't have the slanted box, but even without it I was sweating. I MUCH more prefer Cardio Sculpt Blaster, and would not give this DVD to a friend. It's going to the thrift shop at my earliest convenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy other FIRM workouts instead","review":"As others have mentioned, the FIRM workouts are generally fabulous, but this has the weakest instructor of any of the many FIRM workouts I've done. Another reviewer mentioned that some of the sequences are impossible for someone \\"with no dance background\\"; I have an extensive dance background and found the routines virtually impossible to learn, especially at the pace at which this instructor leads the class. She offers no actual instruction on how to do the moves; rather, she leads the class like a square dance caller, yelling out names of moves that someone would only know if they are experienced at step aerobics. In addition, the camera work often means you're not seeing the instructor's moves completely or from an angle where you can actually figure out the footwork, even if you slow the DVD down. There are much better FIRM workouts out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try ANY other FIRM workout--this one blows!","review":"I have been working out to the Firm for years, and it's usually easy for me to learn steps on new DVDs. However, this DVD has the most ridiculous step portion in the beginning, to the point where I still can't follow it AT ALL after a few workouts. This is my least favorite BY FAR of all of the Firm workouts I've done. Also, if you already own Ultimate Calorie Blaster of the Transfirmer series, don't even bother buying this DVD. It is practically the same workout in a different order. I am giving up on this DVD. Maybe someone at Goodwill will want to break their ankle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Express Cardio","review":"I love The Firm series but this dvd was such a huge disapointment the film quality was so poor and the sound was terrible!! Also she does all of the exercises facing the other way so it's hard to follow her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but not that bad","review":"Some might argue that this isn't true cardio because one segment incorporates slow-paced weight training, but what else would you expect from The Firm? It does keep my heart rate up there. As others posted here before you can probably use a regular step with this video. I'll admit some of the moves (especially if you're not familiar with The Firm) are hard to follow at first and I still get tripped up occasionally. It's got a huge variety of moves and some good music tracks to keep me going and sticking with it. I also like that it's only 30 minutes since cardio is not my favorite type of exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for dancers or the extremely fit.","review":"I love the Firm. I hate this DVD. Not only did I nearly break my ankle about 5 times and fell off the thing so many times I lost count, there are NO \\"practice steps\\". They just start spinning from front to back over and over without telling you what they're doing. I am not hand and foot coordinated. I have trouble making my arms and my feet do different things at the same time (I know that sounds stupid, but I have not a single dance bone in my body!! lol). I say dance because the movements are fast, spinning (literally) and akward (sp?). I just hate it. Exercise is supposed to release happy endorphins, not make you feel hopeless or angry!I'll stick to the other Firm workouts that I can modify. This one's going to a friend much more coordinated than I!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls Look Unhealthy","review":"I'm a huge fan of The Firm anything, even with challenging choreography. This particular one made me almost turn it off before it got started. When the instructor introduced the other girls, two of them look so unhealthy that I didn't even want my daughter (7) who normally \\"dances\\" with us to see them. I'm all for looking trim, fit and healthy, but you could see these girls' bones. Not a good example for me to aspire to, nor my sweet daughters. I ended up turning it off before it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"There is absolutely no explanation of any moves, so when the instructor gives a cue it has no meaning. By the time you figure out what you should be doing they've gone onto something else. I tried to just watch the DVD, and I had trouble following the moves just watching it. Apparently the \\"express\\" part of this DVD shoots right past all the usefull information. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I loved the \\"old\\" Firm videos, but this one makes me change my mind about ever wanting to try the new ones. The cuing is inadequate, the moves are too complicated, the sequences too quickly over to do any good, and the production values sloppy. No wonder Anna Benson broke off from this company -- I will stick with the old Firm releases!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, company sends unwanted product","review":"Buy the firm and you will be sent a large number of unordered videos along with unordered vitamins. BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Fit - NOW!","review":"I love this workout. It's just over 30 minutes, so I have no problem squeezing the workout into my busy day. You get such a great workout in a short amount of time. You get results you can feel & see.I don't feel I am that coordinated, so some of the steps seemed a bit tricky at first. After a couple of times though, I was a pro and had the steps down no problem.

However, the company has been very misleading in its list of supported platforms and applications - and if you browse their forums you'll see what I mean - all the inquiries and problems go unanswered. This is why ultimately - this very expensive paper-weight deserves only 1 star. They've been misleading people for over a year and a half now with the dangling carrot of true mac support - but it still hasn't come.

Plus the kindle edition had issues which made reading it even more annoying. I returned it for a refund considering it was $9.99!! I am not sure what people that gave this book 5 stars normally read but this book has me shaking my head & doubting reviews on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"the writing style is what ruined this!!","review":"I have to be honest - I really wanted to like this book after reading the reviews, but her use of appositive phrases is extremely overdone and very annoying. Maybe it's just a personal pet peeve since I am an English teacher, but she interrupts almost every sentence with a thought interjected into the middle - ugh....a good technique but not for almost every line! It makes her sentences jilted and slows the flow of the reading...I had to abandon it. I'm sure the plot is solid, but to be considered a sophisticated writer, you need to have more than one trick in your bag concerning style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary romance.. in Alaska","review":"If you enjoy contemporary romance with a touch of thriller in the wilds of Alaska, then you might want to try this romance story.Lou Calabrese, Hollywood screenwriter and Jack Townsend, Hollywood hunk and action star are lost in Alaska after a helicopter they are in goes down in the far reaches of Alaska. They survive the crash but will they survive their dislike for one another?

In fact, I put this book aside after reading around forty pages and then picked it up again a few weeks later, determined to finish.When I did pick it up again, though, I was quickly intrigued and I finished it in less than a day. Still, in my opinion it was only worthy of four stars.

The nice thing about this book is you look in the index for the task you are having a problem with and you go right to it. Instead of having to guess which section to read in the Windows help.

It is very comprehensive, well structured and not too long (compared with other ones that I have been \\"forced\\" to read). On the other hand it can get pretty dense and boring in some chapters and it is just a \\"basic\\" reading. I mean that it only explains concepts, why they are important and gives examples but that is not always enough to give an extended answer to a question such as \\"Why are presidential systems predominant in Latin America and what are their advantages and disadvantages.\\" or stuff like that.In the overall it is probably the most useful book on the list of recommended readings for a course in Politics, in fact, it is the typical \\"backbone\\" for such a course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, yet very sophisticated book","review":"I purchased this book 3 years ago while planning our \\"dream\\" home, to be built in 2000. It has been not only an outstanding resource, but through it I contracted with the author to design our kitchen in our new home. We have just completed those plans and they are FANTASTIC. The kitchen is well laid-out for not only my wife and I, but we also entertain quite frequently with guests who love to help in the kitchen. If you contact the author (or visit his website at donsilvers.com), he will tell you his preferences on appliances. By and large, he distains any equipment from the major manufacturers (GE, Whirlpool, etc.) because they are prone to breakdown. He prefers Wolf, DCS, Dynasty, Sub-Zero, and Miele. The char-grill he mentions in the book is no longer made by Thermador, but several of the manufacturers listed above have built-in BBQ grills in their ranges and cooktops. We are very happy to have found this book and worked with Don Silvers. Bon Appetit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinarily useful.","review":"This book gave me exactly what I needed. I had been planning my kitchen myself, because none of the kitchen designers I went to had any ideas about cooking. They missed the whole point of a new kitchen, which is to have the area work with you, not against you, and gave me beautiful plans which I could see would not allow me to prepare foods in any volume or cook them properly. This book is cogent, well organized, and shows me what I didn't understand and how to make the kitchen really help me be the best cook I can be.

Mr. Silvers not only covers all the elements of designing a REAL kitchen (i.e., one that actually works well) but also has some terrific tips for cooks (like storing knives in your block upside-down, so as not to dull them as you pull them out; or keeping your tomatoes in the butter compartment so they're not too cold; and many, many others), not to mention a fantastic recipe for mango chutney chicken. He has a unique perspective on the history of kitchen design, and delivers it all in an funny, quirky, inimitable manner. The only problem with the book was that, while he covered all the elements of kitchen design (work flow, storage, choosing materials and appliances, etc.) there could have been an additional chapter on putting it all together. I certainly would have enjoyed reading more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource...","review":"If you're stuck in a \\"kitchen work triangle\\", then you're stuck in the 1950's.

The camera's also compact and has a nice clear LCD to view your pictures. Finally, this camera is quick; quick to power up, quick to focus, and quick enough to take pictures on the fly.

It's mostly just a bunch of cars sitting around having long conversations about topics that are completely out of range for a little boy. Jealousy, being in love ... forget it!

The only negative for me (and what kept it from a 5 star book) was that I really wanted to see Jos use all that training he got. It may seem childish, but I wanted to see Jos kick some butt and become a leader. I felt a little cheated because that never really happened. There is certainly room for a second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"warchild","review":"This is a great read! action from the first page. It's taken me to another realm. Love the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most compelling genre debuts in quite some time","review":"Karin Lowachee has written a marvelous debut novel. One of the most engaging and exciting debuts since _Ender's Game_, way back in the mid-80s.In _Warchild_, Lowachee has written a startingly good mil-SF yarn. I'll forgo any plot summary here. I'm sure it's available elsewhere on this page. Suffice it to say that Lowachee's novel is not only one of the best SF debuts in 2002, but it's one of the best SF novels of the year.The plot is exciting. Lowachee's aliens are fascinatingly different. The three-way conflict between space pirates, aliens, and Earth Fleet is convincing and compelling. Lowachee writes most of the novel in first-person, though the opening section is, daringly, written from a second-person perspective. This is a compulsively readable book. I was hard pressed to put it down.By the end of the novel, I was ready for more. Here's hoping there's a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Already reading it a second time,can't wait for a third","review":"Karin's done a spectacular job here of writing a SF war novel that isn't so much about the war going on between humans and strits as it is about the toll war takes on its combatants.In Warchild those combantants -- military, civilian, alien and sympathizer -- are children. Youths whose idealism is fuel for death and destruction. She tells the story of Jos Musey, a newly orphaned 8-year-old, and follows him into captivity aboard a pirate ship, a brief respite on an alien planet, and back again amidst humanity. Throughout the book resonates with a tone that makes you want to sob with sympathy for Jos. The abuses he suffered with the pirates aren't shown in gory detail. Jos speaks in second person, distancing himself from them in the novel's first section. This didn't happen to him, it happened to \\"you\\" instead.I bought the book as soon as it came out and I'm already looking forward to reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel","review":"Warchild is an awesome read for those who like sci-fi tales with aliens and space travel. If you have read the Gap Cycle by Stephen R. Donaldson, it is like that, but better! It is compared to Ender's Game, but they are only alike in 2 aspects. 1. They revolve around alien war with children involved.2. They are awesome books to read.The first 100 pages or so are done in 2nd person. At first it is hard to get through and some may not want to read it because of that. After the first section, she changes to first person. Those who read on are rewarded greatly with an excellent story based around a child caught in a war between humans, space pirates and aliens. (it sounds corny, but it isn't :) This book will be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked good first novel!","review":"For a first novel, this book is amazing. I thought she did a great job created a future and a setting for this story, as well as an amazing job with the strit's (the aliens the human government is in conflict with).I really liked the main character Jos and his mentor Niko and thought the villian, Falcone was written solidly as well.

I contacted the mfr. Sunjeen, Inc. to inquire on getting the replacement part. They do not sell internal parts and told me I would have to buy the entire handle for $56! Not no, but hell no!

The Dremel I purchased cost me less than the $56 for their damn handle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe quality is slipping?","review":"I had one of these machines that I loved and lasted years. I replaced it recently, and though I've had it a while now, it really hasn't been used that many times, and has already broke. The plastic collar that holds the drill bits is practically crumbling apart. In looking up if there is a way to replace that part, I came across these reviews, and it makes me wonder if the quality of this product is slipping. Anyway, apparently, the only way to replace this little nothing part is to send the entire unit back to the company, and let them determine what is wrong with the machine. It does not appear that I can just purchase the part I need. I find this to be more of a hassel than it's worth for a machine that wasn't that cheap and lasted so short of a time. I will say the power is good on it, but I think I'm going to look to see if there are good reviews on a cheaper unit, and cut my losses with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"not being able to buy the original(discontinued) battery operated (AA type) nail genie, I finally bit the bullet and bought this product.

Some people must find it motivating to read 100 stories stories about other people losing weight, but I don't have a lot of time on my hands and prefer to get the main points without all the fluff in between.

After having the baby, she ate less and exercised more and lost the weight!\\" No duh!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. After my second pregnancy, my husband bought me this book because he knew I wanted to lose some weight. I found the book very inspiring. It gave me a lot of wonderful ideas, everyday things that I can do to get rid of those postpregnancy pounds. The most wonderful thing about it is that they are interviews with mothers just like us, who did it. It talks about the quality of the food we eat, the importance of exercise, the need to relie on friends and family, and thousands of little tips to help us through it. And it is useful the minute you find out that you are pregnant because there's a whole section on the pregnancy itself. When I became pregnant the first time, I was already overweight, so the pregnancies are not entirely the reason why I wanted to lose weight. This is why I'm looking to buy the mother book WIN THE FAT WAR. I'm sure I can learn things from that book too.Believe me, you will not regret buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up and read this!","review":"This was a lyrical dream to read. I like the way the author puts us in the mind and in the life of the main character. The action is a little weak, especially when it picks up towards the end of the story, but the mood he puts you in, the images he creates and the relationships you get to observe make this a nice read. Going over his words is much like taking in poetry. The character development was very strong, even though I really didn't like the main character, I was really able to feel how his issues impacted his life and in part why he went through the story the way he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully written, but...","review":"This book is beautifully written and I love the descriptive prose, but I couldn't get past the first one hundred pages. I think it was clever the way the author displayed thw text for dreams in a different font..at first. I soon found that I couldn't tell when Bertrand was dreaming or not. I'm sure the author did this intentionally, but after page 100, I just got tired of it. I became so tired of the long, drawn out, discriptive dreams. There wasn't enough interaction between the characters for me. I tried to hold on and finish the book, but I couldn't. I peeked forward on some of the pages, but all I saw was more drawn out dreams. To me, it was repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended for insomniacs","review":"One of the previous reviews, defensive, spiteful and jealous in tone - Colson Whitehead really IS all that - reads as though it was written by the author himself.

I decided to pick this up at a nearby store -- the design was interesting, seemed like it'd work pretty well... unfortunately, I was mostly wrong. The design is nice, and definitely doesn't look as bulky as a regular capo, and the ratcheting is a good concept as well. The biggest problem -- it doesn't fit with various neck types, and as a result, a lot of the time only 5 out of 6 strings will be held down... but for those that ARE held down, they aren't exactly held down very well.

The problems with the show is that it tries that formula of mixing quirky family humor for the grown ups with cheap gags for the kiddies but it becomes just one big mess. Also, the children are pretty horrible characters, there's nothing to empathize with especially since they look SO modelled over market research. (Perhaps a comment of the shallow nature of the current video game industry? Unlikely.) They're just smug and self-absorbed but always painted as better people than the parents in the show. UPN's way of trying to be hip I guess. Patrick Warburton is the saving grace of the series and I guess there's a few game references in the first couple of episodes to validate your taste.

In fact, using the radii, I calculate 69.17 miles at the equator and 68.84 miles at the pole. Am I missing something?The books on Lewis and Clark always leave me with a celestial navigation question which someone may be able to answer for me. Meriwether Lewis was instructed in celestial navigation before heading west. He was to take data at key junctions to establish longitude and latitude.

Their voices are very good and their sound is unique. This is NOT a rumbera salsa cd where you are gonna wiggle your butts off and do turns till you get dizzy, HOWEVER, the music is sweet and their lyrics are sweet as well. This cd is very danceable but its more of a slow salsa dancing cd. Very romantic and I just love their voices! My very favorite song on this cd is \\"Anhelo\\". Oh my god!!! This song is unbelievable with the most beautiful lyrics. The singer (Wilmer) rocks this song! I can not stop playing it for the life of me.

Seriously, the soft parts are TERRIBLE; it sounds like a cross between Lifehouse and DC Talk.Overall, its probally the least worst of the new Hardcore bands to ever have floated up from the toilet of horrible music, but its still disgustling bad, especially since they rip off one of the greatest bands ever; Opeth.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craziness","review":"This has to be the most original sounding band I have heard in years.

Almost every song starts of sounding pretty much like straight death metal, but some of the songs on the CD breakdown into beautiful melodies. The melodic breakdowns take them in an emo direction. I dont know about anyone else, but I didn't think that death metal, metal-core, and emo could be mixed, but Between the buried and me pulls it off well, making them one of the most original bands I've ever heard.

In many ways I'm glad people are ignorant to this type of music because it really deserves to own the niche it specialises in, and how this band specialises.No description is really necessary, it's just absolute organised chaos, right from the word go with pounding unconventional, blazen riffs that keep on coming. These guys really know how to get into your skull and stay there. This is the type of band that will keep you headbanging for years cause there's simply nothing like it.Silent Circus is definately not to be missed.

The writing consists of nice large letters and smaller typed descriptions of 'bird treat' or 'sugar maple', 'round-pointed spade' or 'downy woodpecker'. The last four pages of the book are an indepth look at leaves, buds, roots and sap, bar, seeds, etc. Great book to read to kids in the fall days.

Secondly, the voices are rather irritating, with distracting sibilant eses (sssssss). (I listened to the introduction and part of the first unit.) Ideally, a program would include a way to visualize your sound pattern on the computer compared to the sound of the native speaker, but this just suggests you record your voice and compare the sound-- it's very hard to hear the difference if these vowel sounds are foreign to you, that's why visualizing the sound pattern would help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great English Audio CD","review":"This audio CD is worth every penny you paid for it.

A gray flexible ribbed washing machine hose fit well to the black piece for a drain, which we hooked over our toilet tank to reuse the water for flushing.The little tabs that came with the sink to hold it in place work very well.

While reading about the \\"hip\\" hang-outs of the 80's, such as Michael's, as well as the cheezy attributes of the 70's, like giving one's children names akin to fairy tale characters (Aurora), did stir some amusement in me, they failed to redeem the novel from its over-all tedium.

I do not blame myself for this. The plot was confusing and misleading. The relaxed tone of the main character caused me not to take the story too seriously. Therefore, the ending \\"blew\\" my mind. I wasn't expecting such a depressing read on my summer vacation, and if I could turn the clocks back in time, I would have chosen a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Nonsense","review":"This book was not what I had expected. I went in thinking it was a story about a woman that lives through a nuclear war and eventually finds happiness. Yes, but that only happens in the last 15 pages or so. And that part is so breezily covered, it is absolutely ridiculous.The rest is portions of her life, in no particular order, filled with new age EST type claptrap, and farfetched relationships. A few of those portions are somewhat interesting, so the book isn't a total loss.My recommendation: Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound","review":"The quality of the sound of this video is poor--the YouTube video is MUCH better--we would not have purchased it had we known of the poor sound--very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was reluctant to purchase this DVD due to Amazon's new policy of not listing the contents of CD/DVD's. If the contents were listed, I never would have purchased it.The only reason I did purchase it was because it was by the Morman Tavernacle Choir, which I love. This Christmas Concert contains none of the traditional/classic beautiful Christmas music you expect from this melodious Choir. In addition to very vew Christmas songs by the Choir (or any other music), the DVD is dominated by the guest artist, Brian Stokes Mitchell. Although he has a beautiful voice, he sang very few Christmas songs and too many other songs. I purchashed this DVD to hear my favorite Choir singing my favorite Christmas music, not to hear Mr. Mitchell. If I wanted to hear him, I would have purchased a DVD by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Concert!","review":"I was fortunate enough to attend this concert in person and have purchased the DVD as well. This concert captures the true spirit of Christmas. Brian Stokes Mitchell is an incredible talent. He truly is one of the worlds greatest vocalists. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, as always, is fantastic, and Edward Herman's narration of Longfellow's Christmas is very moving. It is a show the whole family will enjoy, and is an instant classic that will be enjoyed year after year. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ring Christmas Bells","review":"This is a visual and audio extravaganza that is truly breathtaking !

Truly brings the Holiday spirit into your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best recording","review":"Not a bad show, just a very poor recording. Who ever mixed this show really screwed it up. The guitar and bass could not be heard at all, where even a simple tapping on the ring of the snare drum would completely distract you from Dwight's singing. Picture quality is fine, I think only the most hard-core of Dwight's fans will truly enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I love Japanese horror as it so often blends a sophisticated story into some of the most frightening cinematic moments in the genre. This collection is slow, boring,very cheaply produced (all video-no film) and not in the least bit scary. It looks like a college project."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare and tasty organic treat","review":"Nocella's ingredients are very simple: hazelnuts, honey, and cocoa powder, all organic. It tastes very good and is not overly sweet like many other \\"hazelnut\\" spreads.

The world of job-hunting has passed this author by. There's lots of generic info about starting a home-based business, but you'll get killed in the real world if you try to pass yourself off as a job-search expert based upon what's in this tired old tome. Can't imagine why it's still in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Effort From This Author","review":"This book started out with promise; however, it has a lot of problems, which previous reviewers have already pointed out. I would like to add that the editing was very shoddy as well. At one point the word \\"grizzly\\" is used to describe something gruesome, when the word should have been \\"grisly\\". This kind of mistake pulls me out of the story, and makes me lose respect for both the editor and the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok a bit boring","review":"Well I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, this book wasn't as good as the previouse books I've read by this author. I also found that the heroine was a bit too much. I didn't really warm to her at all. I liked the hero although he was just a bit too much of a hero. I couldn't see real people in them at all.It took me a while, several days to get through this book. I kept putting it down and read several books in between. This book does have a sequel which is Pip's story I am hopeing that her story will be an easier read."},{"rating":"1","title":"tiresome","review":"A book about the magic angels can bring is fine, but this one kept repeating the same concepts about God, His angels and fate. The hero was sooo good that he couldn't possibly be real. On the other hand, the heroine was always in a bad mood. I can't understand how Will could stand her. All in all, it was very tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring","review":"I agree with one of the reviwers....this book is rather tiresome. The hero does not really have the qualities I prefer in a, well, hero, but he's quite okay. Now, the heroine is another different matter.... she's always in a sour mood, always snapping, always bad-tempered. A harridan. I got irritated with her. Very slow pace, long-winded - I found myself skipping pages, just to get to know the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I think that many of us have been \\"paying it forward\\" since seeing this movie.

The only part of the movie I thought was that great was when the black guy (don't know his name) started yelling at the nurse to help the guy's daughter. It was pretty much the only funny part in the whole movie. The actors were pretty good (even Bon Jovi) but not enough to save a boring plotline. I thought Trevor's death was just unnecessary, and like some other guy here said, it blew the whole theme of helping people. The kid tries to help some other kid, and he gets his guts cut up. Really makes me feel like going out and changing the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore All Critics!!!","review":"Please ignore all critics when deciding wether or not to see this film. It is one of the most heatfelt an intriguing films of the year with superb performanced by Kevin Spacey, Haley Joel Osment, and Helen Hunt. It's about a little boy who comes up with a plan to do one good deed for one person then they have to do good deeds for 3 more people and so and so on eventually making the world a better place. It's funny, sweet, and sad and is one of the best films of the year. Every actor is truly commited to their role and I have never seen Helen Hunt give such an outstanding, honest performance. Yes she was fantastic in As Good As It Gets but Oscar worthy..maybe not..this performance should have been nominated. I was very touched and moved and considering the events that have taken place in the world recenltly with the terroist attacks this is one film that will make you think and it may even get you to do a good deed for someone starting your very own Pay it Forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you award 'Negative' stars","review":"Horrendous! For anyone who truly loved the book (and I really did), this was the most terrible sort of betrayal. Helen Hunt - let's face it, she's a TV actress. Her Oscar role just happened to fit what she does...every time. Next to Kevin Spacey (also woefully miscast) she's very thin broth. And, I've come to believe that Haley Joel Osment is, like Hunt, a one-trick pony. Admittedly, the book jumps back and forth in time, and would have presented a difficult adaptation [although, I wonder if Quentin Tarrantino could have handled it?]; but, the story was so twisted out of shape that you tend to lose the meaning.One of my Worst Movies of All Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood screws up what could of been something special","review":"What could of been a great movie, ended up being the usual Hollywood quest for green. Let's take a great story and throw in 3 very talented and respected actors and have them play the same exact roles that made them great. This is what this movie boils down to and I just couldn't and wouldn't see past it. This movie could have been something really special, but instead, artistic integrity was traded in for what supposedly \\"makes the world go around\\". What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this movie 2o thumbs up!!!!!!!","review":"This is a movie everyone has to see!! Great acting by Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osment. Pay It Foward is one of the best movies I've seen since the last ten years. Good Plot, Good Story and Sad ending. While i as watching this movie I laughed and of course got a little wind in my eyes as It got closer to the ending. Pay It Foward is a movie about a 12 year old boy who gets a social studies project to come up with one idea that can change the world forever. Of course since the teacher doesn't think this project could actually make a difference in the world Haley Joel Osment does just that.... I'm not going to say more except that this movie is NOT a rental it's a SALE, defenetly buy this movie, you won't be dissapointed!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you deserve better than this","review":"a great idea, followed up by terrific performances is destroyed by the filmmakers. I personally like to blame the director, Mimi Leder. The ending totally panders to the audience, willing you to cry, to feel sorry for the characters. It lacks all thought and willingness to take hold of a world changing idea-- the centerpiece of this movie-- to try and show that world can be a better place than it is.To top it off, the final shot is STOLEN from \\"Field of Dreams,\\" a film with beauty, honesty and hope-- a long line of headlights, plus people holding candles (CANDLES, oh how hopeful!) as a tribute to what they hoped this movie could be, but utterly failed to be.Avoid it at all costs. \\"Pay it Forward\\" is a hoax."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good and the bad","review":"This is such a wonderful story and could even be a true to life story. But I was SO DISAPPOINTED that it will not be one that I can retain for my personal collection, nor let my friends and family experience, because of the extremely foul language and the explicit sexual scene. I thought of how easily this film could have been \\"cleaned up\\" and the message and story line would not have been diminished in the least. If you have children watching I most assuredly would not recommend it, but as an adult the noted contents of the movie ruins it for me as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie review","review":"A very moving movie, a wonderful story, everyone could learn something from this movie.

I have watched it several times and the ending still brings me to tears. A very emotional movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The producers filmed a wonderful movie, now pay it forward","review":"This isn't the most emotional movie throughout, but the cast and storyline make up for it. The writers offer many great twists and turns; one minute, lives are wonderful, the next, lives break. The acting is wonderful. Had the casters chosen anyone other than Haley Joel Osment to play Trevor, \\"Pay It Forward\\" would have been spoiled. He proves that he's one of the few child actors with talent. The make-up team brilliantly desplict Helen Hunt's character as a struggling stressed-out mother, as does Hunt obviously. They make Mr. Simonet's, burns look as if they belonged to Kevin Spacey's. One may think at first glance of this movie that it's low budgetted. There's much more put in this than it appears. That's a good thing. One will end this movie with a new sense of hope and fulfillment. There's no disappointing scene.And....if you've read this, you must pay it forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishing for edited version!","review":"As a 7th grade educator, I would LOVE to be able to show this wonderfully motivating and thoughtful movie to my classes, furthering our discussions of doing nice things for others and remembering how important each and every one of us in the grand scheme of life.I long for an edited version of this movie, as we are unable to show any movie rated over PG. The sex scene, Helen Hunt in her blue bra and a few others could have easily been avoided, in my opinion, and reached a much greater audience, the age that really needs to see how we all affect each other's lives. As it is, I can only relate the ideas to my students, when what I really desire is to share the visuals that this tremendous movie provides, reminding my often self-centered students how we need to remember to reach out to the world around us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie was ok, not great, but ok (maybe 3 stars), until the end. The end was terrible. First what happens to the main character. Then the whole stupid part with the candles--is she supposed to feel all better now because people are standing outside her house with candles? I don't think so. I know people in the theatre with me thought it was really poignant, but I thought they just tacked on a depressing ending to make it seem more weighty.If you don't like sappy, maudlin movies, definitely pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again!","review":"Cowardly exit. They must start from the end with these films, and work their way back. Where are the writers? Anyone got an idea for a new ending? One more of these and I may stopping watching movies.===Five months later: I HAVE stopped watching movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great film","review":"Normally I would give this film 4 stars for having a great theme told through a well crafted story with solid acting. It loses a star for being racist, and another for an unnecessary plot development that spoils an otherwise enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerned with Language","review":"I had seen this movie several years ago, and I can tell you, the meaning of the movie is outstanding! However, this particular version must be a remake, and they have added \\"adult language\\" and in my opinion, it ruins the whole movie. I recommend selling the \\"filtered\\" version so that kids can watch it. I wanted my children to learn from the values of the movie, yet had to cut it off when the vulger language started rolling.I would buy the \\"filtered\\" version that came out several years back, but do not recommend purchasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay It Forward One of the Years Best","review":"Pay it Forward was one of the best movies I have seen all year. It features an all star cast which includes Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Haley Joe Osment, and it delt with problems that a lot of people across the nation deal with. Such as the problem of abuse of people and of substences. It showed how a lot of America's families opperate. There was also that idea that has stuck with of paying it forward. It was a exallent movie with a unpredictable, and sad ending. I would encourage you to buy this movie or if not buy it go out and rent it because this movie is without a doubt one the must see movies, or at least one of the best that has come out in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it possible?","review":"First of all, I don't know what most people are expecting from this movie. But to me, it is all I can expect. The movie asks a question \\"is it possible?\\" The idea behind it is probably a little bit naive to some peole, especially to those never do more than routines. It does not just put out the message, it actually dissects the problem people have to do what they think they should do. Watch it and you will know what I mean. Even you don't think through the movie, you will still be touched. And the cast is perfect. Even though the end is not too thoughtful, it is touching in some way."},{"rating":"2","title":"draws you in and doesn't let go","review":"As soon as Kevin Spacey's character turns around and faces the camera, you know your in for an incredible movie. Pay it Forward delivers the goods. The emotion exuding from these three actors is timeless and believeable. The ending is unexpected. All three actors deserve academy awards. This movie is truly a 5 star classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It could have been better","review":"This was an excellent movie, I must admit. It goes into important issues such as domestic violence, bullying, and alcohol abuse. Not to mention the theme of the whole movie- undeserved kindness. The actors are wonderful but the director should have been someone else. The ending is absolutly horrible, it brings the whole idea of paying it forward seem unsatisfying. The bottom line with this movie is watch it. It's worth the money to rent it. Everyone should see this at least once, because it discusses such important issues. And it is entertaining. Kids should watch this too (I'm 14) because the ideas of school violence touch so close to home. So rent it with your family (not little kids, of course) and watch PAY IT FORWARD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE SHOULD BE A SEPERATE RATING SYSTEM","review":"On the jacket of the movie it sound like a great feel-good flick. But there should also be ratings included for endings such as SE --sad ending. I HATE sad endings. Forget the message, I want to walk out in a good mood! No doubt the acting was great and the story was even great, but ruined for my best friend and I by the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Chick Flick","review":"I don't usually like Chick Flicks, but Pay It Forward was a compelling story and kept me watching to the near end. Then, for no good reason, the ending breaks what could have been a really good story into nothing more than a gratuitous event with no apparent objective other than to make every woman in the audience break into tears. It added nothing to the story and soured me completely on the film. A nice film (and this from an Action Film kinda guy) goes to waste for the last few minutes. A waste of time, except that Hellen Hunt is in it. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not play","review":"Piece of garbage. Would not play in my disc player, threw it in the trash PIEC OF JUNK! SUPER ANNOYED to have to type so many words before you take my rating!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay It Forward","review":"I loved this movie! It shows how one act of kindness can turn into many great things to brighten a person's day. Yet there were parts that were a little hokey but overall it is a family friendly movie with many good points. I recommend this to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Anyone Really Change the World?","review":"Great movie dealing with some hard-hitting issues that are so prevalent in our society today. Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, and Haley Joe Osment perform wonderfully in their lead roles. This is a movie that asks the question, \\"Can I really change the world?\\" Those that change it are usually the ones that need their world to change.(Spacey) gives his middle school class an inspiring first day assignment to change the world, unsuspecting his students will take him seriously, one student (Osment) meets the challenge and devises a plan. The ending has an answer to the question."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Favor","review":"This movie gives us a reason to keep trying to make this world a better place to live. If we all could REALLY TRY I believe that we could all make this a better place to live. In this movie we see all the dreams of our child hood come alive, we want the world to be perfect for everyone and this movie brings back such good feelings. A MUST SEE MOVIE. I believe that you will all see a little of yourself in this movie. Best movie Ive seen since The Green Mile. All we have to do is BELIEVE IN ONE ANOTHER INSTEAD OF JUDGING. I believe that is what the movie is trying to say.*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies! I don't know how many times I've watched this movie, but I am sure I will watch it again!! Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Haley Jo Osment, and Jim Chieveziel gave amazing preformances!! A MUST WATCH!!! (if you haven't watched it yet!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd-rate imitation of a good movie --- don't be fooled!","review":"A lot of people found this to be a very inspiring & emotionally moving film. Surprise surprise, that is exactly what the studio's marketing plan was hoping you would think. Their marketing strategy seems to have paid off quite nicely.Do not mistake cloying, manipulative drivel for compelling story-telling. Do not mistake maudlin sentimentality for emotional depth. Do not mistake the emotional sucker-punch (to borrow from another reviewer) of an ending for irony. Remember these things and you will find this to be one of the more contrived, manipulative pieces of tripe to blight the big screen in a number of years. It's not the worst, because one can always point to \\"Patch Adams,\\" but it is still pretty damned irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best film in 2000","review":"Well, the Oscar comittee proved itself again: besides Zimmer didn't get the win for the hands-down best music, the best film for the season didn't get even a single nomination.

It may even change your view of life, and then a few other people's for the common good.Paul"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't give it 0 stars","review":"I can't really say it better than the previous review who called it manipulative and sanctimonious, but I want to reinforce that characterization. This is tripe of the rankest order. I watched the movie because I had read an excerpt of the book, and it seemed sincere and goofy, and I was in the mood for some sincere goofiness one day. But this movie is bloodlessly cynical and manipulative. Why Hunt and Spacey did it is beyond me, but Henry Fonda made \\"The Mad Miss Manton\\", so..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay it Back","review":"Terrible Movie! Helen Hunt looks like a witch.

That's all I got out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer in need of serious professional help","review":"Okay - so you have this great premise of making a movie where people do good deeds. And its billed as this great movie where people help each other and \\"pay it forward\\" (as opposed to pay it back) by helping someone else. The movie is really not about this fantastic concept. Instead, what it turns out to be is a docu-drama about how everyone in the world (or at least, everyone in this movie) is either a drunk, the abused victim of a drunk, or both. You see torture, neglect, denial, and everything else that you thought this movie wasn't. The pay-it-forward aspect is a sub-plot, and is really lost amongst all the depressing \\"life\\" going on. A complete WOMBAT (Waste Of Money, Brains, And Time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay it Forward","review":"It was a gift which was never received but I'm sure it was in excellent condition as stated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sweet film with a bad ending","review":"I loved Pay it Forward through out. The performances by Haley Joel Osment and Helen Hunt as son and mother are strong. Kevin Spacey is great as well a scarred teacher who Osment fixs up with his mom.Pay it Forward has a nice peace on earth storyline through out and is just a nice movie, until....it hits the end where it throws a very unneeded sob ending at you. The end is still sort of sweet in a way I guess but it just doesn't belong. If it wasn't for that I would of easly called it one of the best films of 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid acting, disjointed storyline, horrible ending","review":"The performances by Osment and Hunt are worthy of praise. Spacey is simply not given the opportunity to do much in this movie (not much range or depth to his character). The story kind of hops around, but does do a good job of getting the audience emotionally involved with the characters. This movie may have earned 3 to 3 1/2 stars if it were not for the absolutely pointless ending. I won't give anything away, but you are made to pay dearly for your emotional involvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific. Perfect example of Hollywood's exploitation of emotion","review":"I know I'm in the minority here, but regardless of the quality of the performances (and they're fine), I *despise* this film because of how its creators cynically manipulate legitimate audience emotions for fun and profit. Without spoiling the film, suffice it to say that the writers clearly felt that a simple, straightforward message wasn't extreme enough for their purposes, and so they essentially grafted a wholly unnecessary element onto the story just to jerk a few more tears out of their viewers.Film is certainly a wonderful medium for engaging audiences and helping them explore and experience emotions, but when it's done as it is in this film, it feels much more like exploitation than artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"STORY WITH A MESSAGE","review":"IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND A PLEASANT CLEAN MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.

If you cry easily, beware of this movie, you'll fall into a coma triggered by an emotional breakdown. I'm not kidding.The cover lies, I tell you. You see the smiles?

The movie is very good, I have never seen a bad movie with any of these three wounderful actors...Given the times,the Premise/Idea of this movie is more revelant today, than when it was first released. I had to see it again, but had forgotten the Tear Jerking part..I am going to go watch it again, so shoud you,... buy it youll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving story","review":"This movie pulls at your heart strings but still is a feel good movie. Makes you believe that there are good people still out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good Part Is In The Commercial","review":"A movie like this is based solely on the premise, not the story. The story just fleshes it out. Without giving anything away I can say that the acting performances here are the standard ones you'd get in any of these actors' movies. Kevin Spacey is very much like Keyser S?ze, Helen Hunt was just like in As Good As It Gets, Haley Joel Osment might as well have been seeing dead people, etc. The only real acting surprise here was Jay Mohr, who usually plays a tool actually pulled off a great performance. My advice is to save your money, rent this movie or check it out at the library since the whole premise is given away in the movie and the acting isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"Sorry, I can only muster one word for my overall summation of this movie - STUPID.Beyond that, when the director TRIES to make the audience cry, most of the time the movie ends up being over the top and campy- I guess those two apply to this movie as well. Okay, it was stupid, campy, and over the top.Rent \\"Old Yeller\\" if you want to cry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironical","review":"How ironical it is that, whenever non-Christians stumble onto the teachings of Jesus Christ, so long as the name of Jesus Christ is removed from it, they suddenly trip over themselves in heaping accolades on this \\"new\\" philosophy.

I thought the Amazon-staff would know that Iceland is in Europe and we use Pal-format on our DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise---Overly Sentimental and Average Movie","review":"I really wanted to like this film. The director Frank Darabont was responsible for one of my all-time favorite films--The Shawshank Redemption. It features three outstanding actors--Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Hayley Joel Osment. So why did it seem like such an unnecessary mess? I think all of the actors were badly miscast in this film and the film's promising premise gets lost in bad dialogue and a poor storyline. Too bad. A story of people trying to do good deeds for people they don't know is a great one. Overall, I think it's a waste of someincredible talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Don't let the picture on the box fool you. This is not a feel good movie. The movie is built on a premise of paying it forward that has the potential to be a great movie, but the ending will attempt to break your heart and only outrage you because the writer(s) chose to use an ending to evoke emotion in a cheap, insulting and underhanded way. Without giving away the ending for those who still want to see it, be prepared to be disappointed. The descriptions of the movie, the cover of the DVD and the promos all lead you to believe that this is a feel good movie, it definitely is not. The idea this movie was based on, paying it forward, has great potential but the direction the end of this movie takes negates the core of what paying it forward has to offer. Why would anyone pay it forward if this was the outcome???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put It Back!","review":"An interesting premise goes south quickly in this stinker. I like Spacey and Osment, but I feel that Helen Hunt is way overrated. Every cliche in the book is trotted out here and the predictable heartstring-tugging is unbearable. I didn't cry, sniffle, or feel otherwise emotionally moved by this film, other than to switch it off at the end feeling cheated. Do yourself a favor and watch \\"Life is Beautiful\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is terrible and horrible!","review":"I bought this movie cause I was told it was a good movie? I wish I didn't cause I feel I wasted my money on it! I couldn't take it back cause the store doesn't accept movies that are open cause people can make copies of them! Who would want to make a copy of this movie anyway! The acting is terible, except for Haley Joel Osment, He tries so hard with his part. That is the only good thing about the movie. The story about paying it forward. Several scenes in the prison could have been edited out and just way too much cussing and it totally ruined the movie for me!What other terrible things can I say about this movie! That is why I am selling it on amazon.com and maybe somebody eles will like this horrible movie! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay it forward.","review":"The movie was good, but I am not rating the movie, but the seller.

This seller I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but....","review":"This was supposed to be an inspiring film about doing something good for other people (and telling them to do the same to others and so forth). It DOES start out promising enough, but it is too disjointed, too meandering and some confusing scenes (such as a drunk woman helping a brazen thief to flee from the cops...huh?! That's doing a good deed?) And what's more (spoilers warned!) the character Trevor (who came up with idea for \\"Paying It Forward\\" program) was killed at the end defending his friend from the bullies. How is it encouraging the viewers to step out and do the compassionate deed for others at risk of their lives? :/I'm sorry but I don't think it is really a very good movie, even with best performances that actors such as Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment gave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, fun, and wow... the actors","review":"This movie was recommended to me as a result of Amazon's recommendations and it is by far the best movie I have seen in awhile. Spacy and Helen Hunt are amazing in their respective roles. It also stars the same kid from \\"The Sixth Sense\\" who is just a phenomenal kid (I sure hope he is able to avoid the same curse that other child stars have endured...)This movie makes you believe in your ability to make a difference in the world. It does so without judgement... It does so with some pretty unlikely characters. You come away with a renewed purpose in life and the world around you... and you actually can enjoy the poignancy and humor. Of course, it will also rip your heart out in the process.This movie has the potential to touch you and want you to become a better person and to make the world a better place. It is not for the faint of heart but it should not be missed, either.[NCJAR]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwrenching performance by Spacey","review":"this movie deserves 5 stars and a reward! all the main actors/actresses gave a emotional feel to the screen! especially kevin spacey! his charaacter pulls at your heartstrings and leaves you grabbing at a tissue to wipe your tears with! he himself deserved a reward for his character in this movie. and he was my favorite!!!!! the ending will leave you ripped up inside as well but i wont spoil it! this movie is a MUST SEE! but i must warn if you get emotional or get INTO a movie you may want to sit back relax and have a box of tissues nearby! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definate MUST SEE!","review":"WOW!

WATCH IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Crying Shame!","review":"This should have been a great movie to watch with your kids. However the ending of the movie ruined it. Any inspirational thoughts or feelings you may have had were replaced by an incredible sadness. Not only that one of the first thoughts I had was, is this alcoholic Mother going to start drinking again? If you want a happy ending to this movie don't watch the last 10 minutes.

It skips over many of the basics of the sport. Wrestling is a very complex and difficult sport, and although you must start somewhere, the book fails to recognize this aspect. This book also doesnt flow correctly and is out of order. Overall I would rate this book a one star, becuase it is too simple and most things are obvious even to a beginer."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring book","review":"This book is so boring that I am wondering how anyone could even finish reading it. Maybe it's hard to make the subject interested to read in a text book. If you want to read on your own to get some wisdom on software engineering, pass this one. If your professor picked it for class, that's another story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring textbook I've ever read","review":"Reading this book is really a torture. The author tries her best to beat around the bush and use complex wording to make a very simple point become a very convoluted \\"theory\\", or patiently explain each and every tiny common sense no matter how obvious that is. Plus, in a lot of places in this book, the conclusion drawn from the analysis does not appear to follow the logic. Moreover, it is very disorganized too, not only from one section to another, even from the beginning of a paragraph to the end, you'll be like \\"I thought we were talking about something else ... \\". The writing is so dry that you'll be so easy to doze off. Although Software Engineering is probably not as fun as EJB, do we really need to make an already boring subject less fun to read? Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be better","review":"It is quite complete. The main issues are all there. And it isn't too difficult to follow. But the structure does wobble a bit. It also fails to galvanize the reader. It is a bit of a sleeper since it just presents one technique after the other. No sparkle, inflection nor much motivation. Right now I'm halfway through (chapter 6) and I will finish it, cause the subject matter is all there. But I wish I had another book to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying this book is WASTING money.","review":"This book is not worth buying for the following reasons:1) The book fails to explain the concepts clearly.2) It is rather confusing and boring; the chapters on important concepts are not clearly laid out.

Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Studio Pro 1000 Cables","review":"I cut two different lower price monster cables and learned, the lower price cables have smaller gauge wire. The higher price Monster cable have larger gauge wire. The studio pro 1000 for speaker cabinets (on your stacks) is a must, because this makes a dramatic difference. You should use at least one studio pro 1000 somewhere between your amplifier and guitar. I use one 12 footer from my guitar to the effects. I found that using more studio pro 1000 cables only made a slight difference. There probably is not as much energy transferred to the front of your amp. It depends upon your usage. If you need to acheive higher decibel ratings with greater clarity you might want use more of these cables. Personally I have three full stacks and very often I have more power than I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even 1 star","review":"Not even adequate. This book is so poorly written as to be incomprehensible. Where was the editor? Where was the copyeditor? Fascinating subject, but don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing: Poorly edited and not true to its title","review":"I would not get this book if I had to do it again. There was apparenly no editing as the book repeats itself in multiple places (how many times do I need to be told that two streets intersected -- in the space of two pages? This sort of thing occurs half a dozen times). The content itself is underwhelming: One section of the book is a shallow laundry list of the philosophers who graced the city. Then there is a long section on Cleopatra (read Michael Grant on this topic instead), then a better discussion of Alexandia's role as a theological hotbed prior to the Arab conquest. It really fails to do justice to the rich history or Alexandria as the capital of the Ptolemys and its role as an entrepot for thoughts and commerce. Look elsewhere for a good book on this city."},{"rating":"1","title":"History, Not!","review":"Mr. Vrettos treads lightly over 1000 years of history in a 200-page book filled with anecdotes, legends, and some well-worn and generalised facts which do not make for real, serious, history. Furthermore, as evidenced from his writing as well as the bibliography he credits at the end, there is a total lack of modern research. Reading this book would be a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed it","review":"An accessible history of Alexandria, and a pleasant read. Not intended for an academic audience, but nevertheless, not dumbed-down either. The chapters on Antony and Cleopatra are especially exciting. Other highlights include brief biographies of Alexandria's prominent scholars, and a detailed history of the Pharos (lighthouse).Vrettos has a nice, lucid, prose style, and the chapters are never convoluted or boring.My only complaint would be that more maps are needed, especially of Greece. I found myself digging into other books to find the locations of some of the cities and provinces Vrettos mentions. Perhaps this will be corrected in a future edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Boring mystery set in Reno when it was still the divorce capital of the US, all about love and murder among the rich and reckless set. I didn't finish it. The only reason I got these books by Leslie Ford is that I had her confused with an author I HAD enjoyed. But these are dated and dull, full of stereotyped characters and cliched plot elements.

Record and play quality is excellent on SP and LP modes. With the up-convert feature and when used with HDMI cable, the picture is near HD-quality on a HDTV. My only gripe is that the remote control needs to have a Direct Navigator button instead of Menu button. Too confusing when you're used to seeing a Menu button on most remotes.

Was very pleased with the ease of operation and many different ways to burn dvd's. Unfortunately after about 200 dvd's the unit ceased to operate. Fortunately I had saved all the paperwork on the item. When looking over purchase date I noticed the warranty had expired in the previous month.Beware of a unit with many features like this one. I ended settling on a Toshiba of lesser price, purchased the extended warranty to insure at least a couple of years of use. Happy to say after 300 dvd's Toshiba unit is still plugging along even though it doesn't have as many features and the ease of operation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD burner. Upconversion quality, I am not sure....","review":"There are enough reviews on this so let me just add my part. Certain options are hidden to much in the menu. Like turning on Subtitle. My previous Panasonic DVD player had a remote control button for this.So far the recording is very easy and works well. I have not had any bad DVDs burned by this device. Frankly the up-converting aspect makes the picture too red and I do not see the difference with standard Progressive scan. I bought it for DVD recording and it works better than expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works, it's great.","review":"Had this unit for about 8 months now and have taken it twice for warranty repair. When it works, I love it--especially the FR function. It always records wondefully--but it can ruin a disk when finalizing.After owning it for 3 months, it started to make a grinding sound when finalizing. Then the finalizing process failed--the device reported the disk was unreadable. It can't be the DVDs--I use several major manufacturers. The burner fails on all types and will fail in the middle of a batch. The repair place fixed it the first time. Now, three months later, it did it again--ruining about 50% of the DVDs. I took it back and the repair place said they couldn't duplicate the problem. Brought it home, it's failing, and I'm very frustrated by the unreliability of the device. Time to contact Panasonic, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is overpriced at Amazon","review":"If you go to the Panasonic website, you will see this listed at $199!

These only go to 1000 whereas the foam dice go to 1 million. They are much better for teaching place value. Also, the picture on this set gives you the impression it's a game. It's not, just dice. The cost to returned them is more than what I paid, so all I can do is warn a potential buyer and be wary of Amazon's descriptions. I'm surprised Amazon didn't offer me some kind of discount on a future purchase.

I had figured by the time I bought it (in 2008) DA 6 or 8 or something like that would be out by now, but it stopped with DA 4 unfortunately.The game is fun and a great change, as other reviewers have said, from the norm. I don't play a lot of video games. I probably would if more were like this. Fun, not too serious, and relatively easy to play. The commentary by the deer, Bambo, is great although it would be nicer to have some more because I think I've heard evertyhing in the two years I've been playing it about 20 times. A newer version would, in my opinion, have an endless supply of one-liners and smart alecky comments.I give it five stars because it IS fun to play, it IS funny, and it IS unlike anything else I've played. I don't know that I'd pay $75 for a copy of the game but since it is the last one made and if you are a true collector of games you'll enjoy playing over and over, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pictures are good, I guess","review":"If you want to see pictures of the early milk mustaches, this book is for you.

When I think digital photography, I'm thinking of the art of photography, taken with a digital camera instead of a film camera. That's all.Photo editing, to me, is different. If you are looking for a book explaining aperture, exposure, shutter speed, f/stops, etc., this book only has 41 pages on those subjects.There are 354 pages total (not counting the glossary) and 194 of them are on the photo editing Elements program.I found myself skipping and skimming and flipping for more information. As if I had missed something, I would find myself going back and re-reading and still being let down. I wanted a book on taking better pictures, not taking OKAY pictures, and fixing them later with an outside program - and maybe that's my fault with the definition I have in my head. I didn't want a book on Elements, as I don't have that program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Photography for Dummies by King - Review","review":"Very, very basic. Even the \\"technical info\\" was very basic and offered little technical insight. All digital editing information is from the single prospective of Photoshop Elements - a great plug for Adobe - though nowhere on the cover is it stated that the book's editing tips are based soley on this single editor. Maybe a third of the book was devoted to editing so a third of the book for those without AP Elements software is of very little value. Not much to learn from the book unless you have never owned a camera or taken a snapshot - in that case this book would likely have some utility to get you started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro, but do not expect miracles","review":"This is a good intro book for those not familiar with the topic or those who need a quick refresher.

As one of the women interviewed in the book says, \\"It's not the men [I dislike], it's the roles.\\" I wouldn't be surprised if there are also plenty of men who want to stay single for similar reasons --independence, privacy, and not wanting to play a role in which the tedium and/or pain outweigh the rewards."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply delightful","review":"I have not read a book as good as this for quite a long while. While Shearer's craft is exquisite and the way she interweaves the stories together is amazing, it is essential to bear in mind that the book's intention is not to tell you _A_ story, but rather, allow you to participate as a family friend by directly showing you their thoughts. And that is what makes the book delightful. Like a box of chocolates, it is best consumed one at a time, and you needn't start in any particular odrder. As much as all the stories come together to make up one whole, they are, in their own part, lovely tales on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Page Sermons","review":"This devotional is easy to read and the fact that it is totally Scripture makes it so precious.

This is such an amazing, phenomenal intense page turner that will stay with you for a long time after you've finished it! The plot is the most original one since 'the genesis code' and the writing is soooooo fine that i found myself slowing down just to be able to savor each and every word but the suspense is soooooooo intense that you just want to read it fast! Don't let the Nazi references in the editorial reviews turn you off.....i almost didn't read this amazing book because of that....because this is such a fantastic book! and the Nazi stuff isn't intrusive at all! soooo please grab this immediately and just wallow in over 500 pages of incredible writing and nonstop action!

Cannot wait for his next one.....sooooon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Premise Followed Through","review":"This book hooked me from the very start. What would happen if a happily married father of one was hyponotized and recalled an earlier life as Adolf Hitler? Author Boyll puts together a chilling tale of how the media will take an incident and create news and what this can do to the life of a family. While far fetched in some aspects, you can quite literally picture seeing this on \\"Current Affair\\" or \\"Hard Copy\\". The writing is extremely well done and the characters are fully realized. I would recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"so implausible I stopped reading halfway through","review":"reading the reviews here you would think this is one of America's great works of fiction... did people read the same book I did?the \\"what if Hitler were reincarnated?\\" angle is a great start, but the Nazi Youth/find his bones subplot wasn't compelling and didn't resonate with me at all -- I found myself counting the pages until those sections ended and the rest of the book picked up again.I made it about halfway through before I finally gave up. I could live with the unsympathetic characters and unrealistic situations, but yet another implausible plot twist was the last straw. I skipped to the last chapter just to find out how it ended and I am SO GLAD I didn't waste my time getting there.I think Boyll has potential but tried too hard to make it \\"exciting\\" and \\"gripping\\". instead it just got over-the-top and pointless.bottom line: you better REALLY like German history if you want to enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarcely entertaining...","review":"Was it a page-turner?

By the time television journalist Alan Weston crosses paths with booze and bikers, I was hooked by Mr. Boyll's ability to flesh out his characters. The action throughout develops from the truth inside each of us. There is a good sense of timing and full development of all the scenes. Katastrophe is well worth the read.

It has over 20 pockets including a large pocket on the back which is not pictured. Great vest for photographers and field biologists alike.I got it primarily for biological field studies. Now I have a place for everything: kill jars, aspirator, pocket net, collecting jars, compass, GPS, maps, pens, pencils, spade, notebook, field guides (large enough front pocket for \\"The Sibley Guide to Birds\\"!), and more...I use the back pocket to shove a rain coat in. The epaulets and raised neck portion come in handy for carrying binoculars or camera around your neck (a feature that is lacking in all of the field vests that I have been browsing).A lot cheaper than other field vests yet has just as much or more room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"This vest is made a very, very light weight (meaning thin) cotton.

Life is good. Until he tries it on: There is about twice as much vest as Manly Sweetie, alas. Enough vest that a tribe of pygmies could come over and take shelter with him. That much vest.It's going back.MS is of the opinion that an XL will keep pygmies from moving in, I'm not so sure.Will get back to you on that.

The one is at the bottom. I bought this after a trip to India wore out my last one. This vest was taken on one long trip to Peru and included a 10 day stint in the Amazon. After that it was only worn occasionally around town and now a short trip to the Delaware Bay. Right now two of the pockets are tearing out at the seams. Several of the small (seemingly useless?) pockets sealed by Velcro cannot even be opened as the Velcro has become so tight that it would take ripping the fabric. One of the front pockets has both a top opening and then a diagonal zipper along the front? I have no idea why.Anyway the bottom line is that this vest is lousy quality and I'm putting it out for the 'Alley People.' I'll buy another Columbia or Travel Smith, both of which have been good products in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Photographer's Vest","review":"This vest is well made and tailored for a loose fit.

While I didn't read every single story, the ones I did read, I absolutely loved. Probably my favorite one was the one where Starscream looses his memory and ends up spending a surprisingly peacefully day with the Autobots. Great character development and inside look into one of the most infames of transformers. I also loved the last story, which retold the Beast Machines episode \\"Bad Spark\\" through Megatron's eyes. This book was clearly written by fans who truly know the Transformers universe. I just wish there were some more anthologies like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Account Of A Fascinating Life","review":"I agree with one of the other reviewers who found this biographercold and unsympathetic. I'd go further and say this is the worst type of academic writing; a lot of facts and documentation are brought out, but the writer simply isn't talented enough to give it vitality. Instead of attempting some sort of personel interpretation of Zelda's life, Milford gives us overlong plot summaries of Zelda's fiction. No analysis! Just the facts! She treats the deaths of both the Fitzgeralds with the compassion of a coroner. People with Nancy Milford's limited abilities shouldn't be writing biograpies. The reader is given a depressing work on a talented artist, and wounded soul, that passes on no understanding, no sympathy, and no appreciation. How horribly bleak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Interesting read; it is more of a biography type of book, but it keeps you pulled in because of Zelda's character & the life she and Scott Fitzerald lived. It may help to read The Great Gatsby or one of his other novels before reading this book to get an understanding of how he relied on Zelda."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that's hard to put down.","review":"You can read this very quickly, but it's so captivating you'll wish there were more.

I actually finished it. I read 100's of books a year, and this has to be one of the top 10 losers.The story line had potential, but there was little, if any, continuity. There are many questions left unanswered at the end, which is unsurprising as the author tried to sum it all up in 1 page. It actually feels as if the story DIDN'T end.I haven't read anything else by C. N. Bean, and I admit it's possible his other works would be more to my liking - but this story read like a Dick and Jane book. This guy needs to read Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" for a few tips.

Personally, I'm slightly offended the artist put this under Bossa seemingly serving financial motives, but if you can over look that (which I can't),maybe it's the right thing for you.

It floats and works well. It keeps the birds away. My concern with all gator guards is the eyes are made of plastic reflectors (not glass) which dulls within two years. The gator will then lose it's effectiveness because it's the glare of the eyes that keeps the birds away not the gator head. So far I'm pleased with the product but would love to find one that has glass eyes not plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"I purchased this scale and have yet to get any kind of number. Everytime I (or anyone) gets on the scale it says \\"Err\\". Now, in the troubleshooting section of the instructions, it says that if you exceed the 330lb weight limit, you will get this message. I am only 180 lbs. My two year old is only 32 lbs and it gave her the same message. This product is junk. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Platform cracked after 4 months","review":"I only weigh 180, but the plastic cracked right in the middle on the rear of the platform after just 4 months of daily use. I always step on it gently, and stand on the gray foot pads. After it cracked, I soon realized that standing on the gray pads isn't centering your weight on the unit, and does indeed put more pressure on the plastic frame in the back, since there is nothing to support it there. I can still use it, sort of, if I stand directly in the middle of the unit (ignoring the gray pads, and leaving my toes on the white part by the digital readout), but I get less accurate readings this way. I see no point in taking advantage of the lifetime warranty, because the new one would probably break again just as easily -- why bother with the hassle?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"We bought ours a little over a year ago at Target to replace a scale that we've owned for many years but the old one got damaged during a move. The Taylor worked for a while, then displayed \\"BATT\\". We have purchased several brand new batteries for the Taylor scale and with each new battery, it displays \\"BATT\\". There's been no resolving this issue and the Taylor is getting tossed out.Garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly inaccurate","review":"Not sure how/why they are still selling this scale.

Not sure what they're talking about since every time I use it the weight readings I get back vary by 6lbs in the same 3 minutes I'm using it. Absolutely horrible, good scale to get a ballpark figure for your weight, but not the choice for people who are trying to accurately keep track of weight/weight loss progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction","review":"The scale stopped working after two months of use. I'd recommend a higher-end model or a different manufacturer. If you do buy this model, save your receipt and warranty card."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Inconsistent. Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this scale a few years ago thinking that it was good. I would always step on the gray rectangles and get different readings each time. I just did it about 3 times and never thought anything of it. Now that I'm serious about my weight loss (p90x) program I am noticing more and more that this scale is inconsistent. I can barely step on the gray rectangles and I would weigh heavier than I am. If I ignore the rectangles and put both feet near the middle I weigh less. I'm one month into my program and there is NO way that I only lost 2 pounds. Not when I can actually see I've been losing inches. So it's time to spend another $20-$30 dollars on a non-taylor scale. Yay! Not"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this scale a few months ago from a local Target and it worked fine at first, but after only a few weeks it would only say \\"ERR\\" whenever we used it. Thinking it may be an issue with the battery, I replaced it. It worked for a few days after that, but now it just stays blank when someone steps on it. It stopped working altogether.

This isn't your five pound a day, morning vs night argument. Half the time, when I stand on it, it won't give any reading - the numbers will run back and forth, and then it will go blank. Flat floor, carpet, wood, tile, doesn't matter. We have tried everything we can to get this to give a consistent reading - as in, at least within 3 pounds the same in five minutes - and no go. I have no idea if I've gained 20 pounds from when I bought it two months ago or lost 10, or if I'm the same weight! Absolutely useless. I'm finally writing this report because today was the last straw when it gave me a reading that was 22 pounds different immediately after standing on it. It's time for a new scale and a new brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional at Best!","review":"Compared to the other consumers who have written terrible reviews, my experience hasn't been quite as bad. My scale works(worked), but it does give out different readings one after the other. Usually if you stand on it about three times in a row you can get a good idea of your weight which is good enough for my purposes.I noticed in the description that it suggests the battery may last forever, but my battery lasted about a year and a half. I came to this site trying to find out it it gave any indication of where to buy replacement batteries because I would hate to buy the wrong kind. After reading the other reviews I may just replace my scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent readings","review":"This scale gives wildly inconsistent readings. It varies by as much as 4 pounds depending on what part of the room it is in. You can't even get a reliable 2 out of 3 readings because they vary so much! I bought this scale when it was just $15. Now they're charging more for it??"},{"rating":"1","title":"I get angry every time I think about this scale","review":"This electronic scale is more innaccurate than having random people on the street guessing your weight. Apparently I can lose ten pounds within five minutes (even standing in the same place like the directions call for). I could not get a consistently accurate reading for the half hour I tinkered with it. I wish Amazon had \\"0\\" stars so I could have given it that. Taylor should recall this product and be ashamed that it ever put it on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the weight-sensative","review":"The style of this particular bathroom scale is up to standards, but like with non-digital scales (< forget what the word is there) the number changes everytime you move, breathe, and or step off and get back on.

If you've read as many of Judith Martin's books as I have, some of the information given here is repetitive. It is, however, information that will never let you down in a social situation or leave you feeling guilty or ashamed of the way you acted if you follow her guidelines, so it definitely bears repeating, especially for those who suffer from Genetic Social Nerdism. Miss Manners is not only absolutely right, all the time, but she will explain to you WHY she is right, and you will have to give up in the end and admit that she is the ultimate authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally worthwhile...","review":"Witty and readable, this book addresses a great many communication dilemmas -- especially those posed by new technologies such as email, mobile phones, and pagers. And in the middle of this, Martin still finds time to tell us how to have our personal stationery monogrammed (in case we ever need to.)As a professional grammar nerd, I wish there'd been some reference to the effect that spelling and grammar have on one's credibility -- but I suppose that even the pickiest etiquette expert couldn't class \\"R U OK\\" as *rude*, precisely.And why on *earth* does Martin persist in condemning engraved/printed birth announcements as a modern vulgarism, when Emily Post approved them wholeheartedly in 1924?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"I wear black tight every day of my life and am constantly searching for thick, opaque, sturdy tights that don't wear out faster that I can replace them.

Many of the companies listed have moved or gone out of business. She has tear-out postcards for mailing to list distributors or consumer databases. I had to double check every address on the internet, and many had changed. The best internet source for up-to-date business addresses seems to be the Better Business Bureau (BBB).I thought this book would tell you the inner workings of the consumer mailing list industry, but all she says is that there are 50,000 different mailing lists out there, and you can get off of some of them by sending out the postcards attached in the book.Buy another book instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money!","review":"As several other reviewers have stated these batteries start out strong but fade very quickly. For the first 4 or 5 charges they performed brilliantly, powering my digital camera with ease and allowing me to take many photos. Then came the sudden drop in performance. I was lucky to get 10 quick shots off before the batteries died.

That's probably bad for the batteries. Many toys etc. now require odd numbers of batteries, and you can't charge odd numbers of batteries! Very disappointing. Also, there's only one battery charge indicator light for all four batteries, so detecting problems in one or two batteries is difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I opened the package and plugged in the unit, following all instructions.

They worked fine for a while, but recently I had a second battery fail so I am now down to two working batteries. I'm using a higher end La Crosse charger, so I can't even blame the failures on the cheap recharger provided w/ the set. I've since gone w/ the Sanyo Eneloops and am having much better luck w/ those.When buying rechargeable batteries the idea is that you can reuse them over an extended period and these just don't seem to perform. I'd recommend you spend a bit more and get a better quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctions","review":"This charger is very sensitive and malfunctions periodically where it won't charge even Energizer batteries let alone other brands.

This happened to a previous pair and each shoe was fixed by the shoemaker with reinforced leather [...]. This gave them an additional 6-12 months of usage. Now the same thing is happening to this pair. I'm not going to fix this pair because of the second major problem with them, the shoes scratch and shed their color by almost looking at them.

I got a nice e-mail back from someone who assured me I would receive the printer, not the toner cartridge. After all, he checked it out himself. I knew I would receive the toner cartridge and I did.

The book is an extension of the online work with more details about our hero's trials and tribulations in his quest for stardom.My biggest gripe about the novel is how many unnecessary references to name brands are mentioned here - how much did they pay the author to subsidize this work? I didn't really mind the name-dropping of other bands, at least that gives some pop culture reference to the music scene he's aspiring to join. Its just a bit much when he writes about the can of Coke or the Honda Element, etc. I don't remember getting a discount on the cover price of the book in exchange for product placement. There is a time and place for name dropping especially if it enhances the story, I don't feel like most of them accomplished that.Sorry for the rant. This is a good read, don't get me wrong.

It's really not about fat people. It's about eating, dining, snacking, and then starting all over again. It has a wonderful food orgy sequence that's written so well it should have won an award. It's really a love story with over-eating as a backdrop. Lots of eating. Dom DeLuise is perfect in the role. Ron Carey, the \\"I got it\\" guy from HIGH ANXIETY is great. Mrs. Robinson should have stuck to her chores as director and let someone else play her part.Do not eat before you see this film.Do not eat after you see this film.Eat while you see this film.I had a chocolate fudge pudding cake stuffed with fresh bananas and topped with whipped cream and strawberries with a medium size scoop of pistachio ice cream.

He plays a fat man (really he's not that fat in the movie, more like chubby) who struggles with his addiction to food. He goes on a strict diet, but it only fuels his hunger until he falls in love. Dom D. cries a lot in this movie and talks about food a lot. He does a pretty good job of making you hungry. I have to admit that while watching it I had cravings for donuts, cake and ice cream. Dom D. makes the movie worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"For people who love food and love Dom","review":"This movie has been a family favorite for years.Anne Bancroft wrote, directed and starred in this film and unfortunately it missed its audience.If for nothing else, buy it for the \\"Chubby Checkers off the wagon\\" sequence.It's hysterical.Sure, it's uneven.

I'm not sure why we stayed - but money was tight so I'm guessing I was praying it would get better. It never did. I eventually got over it - after a few months of therapy.

Dom DeLuise and Ron Carey are the brothers and Anne Bancroft is the sister. I believe Dom and Anne came from the same neighborhood in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.

There is not adequate information on KSA writing and putting together a total government-ready package. For this level of material, the book nudges you toward using the publisher's consulting / writing service, which is on the expensive side depending on what positions you are going after.Overall, it's a good book to get started with. You may need additional help down the road, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Federal Resume Guidebook","review":"The Federal Resume Guidebook is more for those who have never ever created a resume on the federal government job website than it is for assisting with writing with KSAs. In my opinion, this book is a really basic book for only those who are new to computers. Luckily, I checked this book out at my local library, because it was not at all what I was looking for. The book shows readers what a typical website job listing on the fed's website looks like, as well as, the screen for the resume builder. The book displays several general resumes to give it's buyers ideas on what to place on their resumes. As far as KSAs, the book encourages you to look deep at your work history and skills and how to best formulate it into a KSA.

It's a shame the information provided is incomplete, especially since it's done on purpose as a way of hawking their other services and books. Based on their relationship with the Washington Post, I figured they provided a valuable and quality service. Nope. The resume writing process included a strong sales pitch for the books.

I was in a love-hate relationship with the SF-171 and never felt comfortable with the OF612. The federal resume is a dream come true."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"This version of this book is extremely outdated. The book was written before the restructuring/consolidation of USAJOBS as the main source for federal employment, before President Obama made changes to the hiring process, and before the competition for government positions became so fierce (ex: the global financial crisis, the end of the war and veteran's preferences for those who completed service in Iraq). It is apparent that the author does know the ins and outs of the federal hiring process but, I'm not sure if a lot of the suggestions she makes in this particular version of the book are applicable to the current system of hiring. In particular, I wish there was more information about hiring preferences that impact if your resume is even read, and how to make your application stand out from the (literally) hundreds of other applicants. I'm not sure if the updated version of this book is beneficial, but I would say, skip this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"The title is potentially a little misleading, since beyond superficial similarities it really has very little to do with the Theosophy of Blavatsky and Besant. Steiner really forges his own path, and a quite interesting one at that. This is really the book to start with if you want to understand Steiner's thought and worldview."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION","review":"UGH, why didn't I read the other reviews before I bought this edition?

I find myself going back to the book every couple of months as I make connections to my life and gain more understanding of the book. I find this book to be an essential part of my quest for self-actualization. Steiner uses the scientific method to explore and explain the various facets of the human being. His exploration of the modern topics of life, matter, feeling, thinking, the sensible and the supersensible, show that he was light years ahead of his time (1909?). If you are looking for the meaning of life, then this is the book to start with. If you wish to learn more about the Truth of thinking and cognition, the you need to buy his book The Philosophy of Freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this edition","review":"This is a review of the General Books edition of Teosophy, and not of the content of Teosophy itself. The General Books edition (at $8 here on Amazon) is obviously a scanned version of the book, with no apparent proof reading after the text recognition (OCR) was done. The result is a book with lots of typos, and some pages are pure garble. Reading Steiner is hard enough, so stay away from this edition unless you totally have to save the few extra dollars to get a read-through version."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS VERSION OF THE BOOK!!! READ MY REVIEW!!!","review":"This book was made by scanning an original version and then binding the scanned copy. They say they do this because it keeps the cost down which is fine by me. The problem is, if you have ever scanned a document you will find that the words in the scanned document often get jumbled and the document has to be edited so the sentences can be corrected. THEY DID NOT EDIT THIS BOOK. I REPEAT, THEY DID NOT EDIT THIS BOOK. They say they did not edit this book so that they can keep the cost down. I DID NOT FIND THIS OUT UNTIL AFTER I BOUGHT THE BOOK AND READ THE DISCLAIMER THAT IS WRITTEN INSIDE. Reading Rudolf Steiner is complicated enough but try understanding a book where the sentences are jumbled up and make no sense.

I can say that it is one of the most important books I have read. What I read here will stay with me for a long, long time. There are two stories being told simultaneously here. One story is the remarkable chronicle of a family's love and loyalty to each other and what they did to survive. The other story is the horrible chronicle of Nazi Germany's plan to eliminate a people and the acts and unbelieveable cruelty of individual Nazis. No detail is left out. It boggles my mind that this could happen only 6 years before I was born. Read this book and it will help you better understand both sides of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family that stays together...","review":"This book came to my attention from my aunt who, along with my mother, is mentioned in this book. I was unable to put the book down because based on what my mother had told me I knew what I was reading was true. There are many true holocaust stories but this book is different because it translates the experiences of the Garfinkle family into everyday living terms. I've read many holocaust books but this one stands apart and should be read. I wish every family was made with the same glue that held the Garfinkle's together. If you want to be moved, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This book was so good, it really brought the holocaust to life. I had never read such detail as to human suffering. It's amazing how Helen and her siblings survived at all. The ultimate in human strength. Suzy captured all the families memories in a very understandable format. It is wonderful she was able to document this record of one families history to preserve it. May this story remind people of the future to never let a holocaust happen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading no matter who you are.","review":"I've never reviewed a book before, but I feel compelled to say something about Sara's Children. I'm also not Jewish and I don't know if my interest in the subject is morbid or not -- anyway this book is one of those books you can't stop reading. Suzan takes you on a journey with the Garfinkels that, if you are lucky, you will never experience for yourself in real life. I've, of course, heard about the Holocaust all my life but never have I felt like I've experienced any of it. This book changed that. The scary part of it is the realization that any one of us could have been a player on either side of the fence. You can feel the mass brainwashing that took place during that era no matter what your genetic background is. I recommend this book to anyone who would be interested in readiing firsthand accounts of what took place. The only bad part about this book is it is NOT fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"engrossing","review":"i happened upon this book, quite by accident, by seeing a notice that the author of sara's children was appearing at a local bookstore and that it was about the garfinkel family in poland...having the same last name certainly piqued my interest..i rushed out to buy this book and was mesmerized...this is a chronology of a family's life and you feel like you're living this history and events with them....Ms. Hagstrom has written a book with great detail to the actual events that took place and allows the reader to be on this harrowing journey with these children...in the midst of all this tragedy and sorrow, you read about what made it possible for them to survive and the courage of certain people that allowed them to keep on going...it's an unforgettable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A miraculous story","review":"Sara's Children is about the survival of 4 sisters and 1 brother before, during and after the Holocaust. The gradual signs of anti-Semitism are presented in such a subtle and realistic fashion that it's chilling to read. The psychological terror they endured in the camps almost seems worse than the deprivation. In spite of the horrible, depressing subject, this book is uplifting and inspirational because you come to know this loving, courageous family. The fact that they had the strength and faith to survive is nothing short of a miracle. The Garfinkels story needed to be told and they are fortunate to have had Ms. Hagstrom tell it. Her journalistic background really lent itself to the telling of a story such as this as she chronicled the events in such a clear, clean and gripping way. It is very well researched and she has done a wonderful job in reaching her readers.This book should be recommended reading in high schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"History, Up Close and Personal","review":"Many years ago, when I was a student at USC (the University of Southern California), I met a history professor and scholar who happened to be a Holocaust survivor. His graphic description of what he lived through inspired me to read about the genocide of Jews. I became so saturated with knowledge, I stopped reading about the Holocaust for a while.Sara's Children is different. The survival of five children in one family is very unusual -- almost unheard of. The story of what happened to the Garfinkel siblings' entire family and hometown provides, on a small scale, the entire history of the Holocaust -- an event that should never be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"Once I began reading this book I could not put it down. The reader gets an accurate feel for what life was like for these five siblings during their ordeal in the concentration and labor camps. The authors style of writing makes this difficult subject easy to read. It was educational and was a lesson in the strength of the human spirit. I would not hesitate to have my ten year old son read it. It is a piece of work we should all read. I especially appreciate how the author cross refrenced material in the book and the extent that she went to validate her findings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"I thought this book gave a terrific insight into the conditions in Poland,pre-war and continuing throughout the war; from the small town of Chmielnik to the big city, Lodz. It followed one particular family but was also inclusive of other Holocaust survivors. The book successfully wove the experiences of this family with those of others who lives crossed the Garfinkel's. The story did not just stop with the concentration camps but also gave insight into the family's post war experiences. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to know more about the detailed experiences of Holocaust survivors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sara's Children: The destruction of Chmielnik","review":"I was very interested to follow the fate of individuals from Chmielnik, this small town of Poland who had 60% Jews before World War II, and like many other old communities has disappeared.I recommend Sara's Children for the accuracy of the testimony, given the fact that 60 years has passed since the events. For this purpose, Suzan Hagstrom interviewed many individuals who attended to the same events, she correlated their personal memories with the facts traced by the historians of the Shoah to build a precise, constrasted, vivid and human description of that tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Record","review":"As the child of Polish Holocaust survivors, I read Sara's Children with a great deal of personal interest. The author succeeds in faithfully recreating Polish Jewish life prior to World War II, including the gap between tradition and the encroaching secular modernity of a changing world. We all know all too well the ensuing horrors Nazi Germany inflicted upon Europe's Jews. The mutual help the Garfinkel siblings extended to one another, often risking their own lives, was essential and inspiring. If you read only one book about the Holocaust, I heartily recommend Sara's Children, Suzan Hagstrom's well-crafted memorial record."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Should Know. I Was There.","review":"I am a Jewish Holocaust survivor from Poland. I do not personally know the Garfinkel siblings, but I was imprisoned in one of the same slave labor camps as they -- the Hasag ammunition factory in Czestochowa.I felt the author captured perfectly what I lived and suffered in that camp. Sara's Children is poignant and powerful. It is an important addition to the history of the second World War and the conflicts of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"another corny lead single&More dissing which is played out. the Production is the same as His Previous lead in singles for Projects. nothing ever changes with this Cat.Boring&Vastly Overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"I lost respect for Marshall Mathers with this song.

The fact of the matter is that much evidence support the 'traditional' story of Islam, in particular in the Fertile Crescent where archeological finds have not contradicted the 'traditional' story.The fact that no such digs where ever conducted in the birthplace of the entire movement is regrettable. Incidently, Mecca should prove a veritabley exciting site, given the fact that it had been on a trade route for probably hundred of years before Mohammed's time.The search for answers to these questions, without theological or (much worse) political motives seems hard to expect in the present time.

Seriously teaches empathy beyond just telling the story.Every child I've read this book to (girl or boy) has delighted in it AND none of them have EVER heard of it.It's a rare treat to come across a book that no one knows of but is as engaging as the ones everyone owns because of their popularity or accolades.I highly recommend this book as an addition to any pre-reader's collection.

He won't let Big Pig push him around! This book showed a positive example of someone standing up to a bully.

And with each release, her worldwide audience is reminded once again of this uber-status. Yes, this single is extremely beautiful and has a beat that stays tuned in my head all day, but the remixes are totally a waste. I MEAN, WAKE UP!

He is soooooo tired! If you're a bit more of an intellect & a music snob then pick up Remixed & Revisited for a more interesting listen. This CD sucks!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The album versions are better","review":"Unlike most Madonna fans, I think \\"American Life\\" is a brilliant album and \\"Nothing Fails\\" is a moving ballad that people should give a serious listen to. This CD-single, however, is full of bland, generic, tired club beats. Sadly, these remixes add nothing to these 2 songs. There is nothing here that will send you running to the dancefloor, like \\"Ray of Light\\" and other favorites once did.I used to love Madonna's club mixes, but her last few remix singles have just left me cold (\\"Hollywood\\" is gathering dust on my shelf). Maybe her music with Mirwais is just too techno-based as it is to warrant having their songs remixed. I'd rather hear the album versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wow Faith","review":"Praise the LOrd I remember reading one of Kenneth E Hagin books in the year 1999 that book filled me with anointed faith that stirred me up to receive the gift of tongues.Glory to God,this book is extremely filled with Faith anointed life transforming knowledge of the Anointin,anyone that reads it will not want to put the book down in fact you will be cause to re-read it and keep it near for further teaching to others.I am inspired by this Man of Valor, author of Faith you will absolutely love this book I recommend it.I were very please in the way amazon wrap it, well packaged and I believe any book written by Kenneth E Hagin will come to you with Honor and the Spirit of God in His words."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you ever get a book, this is one to get","review":"This book was hard to put down.

This book put words to things I have experienced but did not have the language to express myself. Although with some parts like when Hagin said he could not \\"stand it\\" I think I would have used different verbage. It does get so deep and you go into His presence but I think that its a wonderful feeling, although it is true that our human bodies cannot stand to be there for too long. Overall I think this book is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Understanding the Gift of the Holy Spirit","review":"This is an excellent book to help understand the gift of the Holy Spirit. This topic is not covered in many sermons and finding quality teaching on it is difficult. I am a fan of Mr. Hagin and he has done it again with this book.

Instead of a story, the general theme is nothing but naked young women in various jungle poses. Most of the women are attractive, but they are all black and white pencil drawings. Some are very artistic and well done, but others are not. I was particularly disturbed by one drawing of a woman perched on a tree branch urinating. We all could do without that image. I saw nothing artistic, attractive, or even funny about it. Overall, this purchase was a colossal disappointment and is not worth the money that I spent. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ring of truth","review":"Author Granovsky relates the Stalinist nightmare of forced labor camps, prisons, and torture. Ironically, a major target of the NKVD seems to have been Communists, such as Granovsky's father - the purges destroyed the old line communists who Stalin viewed as a threat to his own position. Through luck, he was able to leave prison and work for the NKVD as an informer targeting the children of Communists who had been sent to the gulag - in an attempt to send the children to the Gulag also since they were now children of \\"enemies of the people\\". He waited until he had the opportunity to escape the \\"1984\\" society of Josef Stalin. The book illustrates the fate of those Stalin feared had the potential of having leadership potential to rival him - since other Communists were potential rivals for leadership, they were prime targets for Stalin's paranoia. In a nutshell, the most dangerous enemy of the members of the Communist party was - their own Communist leaders!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Region","review":"My DVD player is set for Korea.

I'm going to use a single sentence to convey my thoughts on each facet of this film.The Script:A confused history lesson delves into campy soap operatic tones that snuff out the more interesting bits.The Direction:A total step backward from its grittier 1998 predecessor, Kapur tries to add too much gloss and loses his core along the way.The Acting:Clive Owen is a joke, Abbie Cornish can't act, Cate Blanchett is shocking bland and unfocused and Samantha Morton steals the whole show with a handful of scenes (she's amazing).The Technical:Some overblown visuals look cheesy and fake, but the costumes are divine and the texture of the set pieces are organic and splendid to look at.In the end I hope that they stop here. I loved the 1998 film, and Blanchett in it, but this was a disaster that failed on nearly every level, the Oscar winning costumes aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done.","review":"Having enjoyed the first 'Elizabeth' so much, I was prepared to be disappointed in the second. It was reviewed as more concerned with costuming than acting. Call me crazy, I loved it. Cate Blanchett is a powerful Elizabeth. At no point did I feel the costumes outweighed the cast. While the first movie is still my favorite, I wouldn't have missed this."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not live up to my hopes","review":"I loved the first movie, Elizabeth. The Golden Age, however, does not live up to my hopes of a solid sequel. Though it shares the same general look as its predacessor and some continuity of the characters and their personal story lines, it is much less polished. Though the love Elizabeth had for Bess was evident, I did not feel any believable chemistry between Elizabeth and Walter. Cate Blanchett is a great actress but I felt the movie was cut in such a way that the queen appears to be a flurry of emotion shifting in every which direction and hardly having the time for it to soak-in between frames. The scenes needed to be longer or else more cleverly melded together to build the appropriate tension and further develop the characters. The gory scenes only appeared to add to the problem of time - taking precious minutes away from what would have drawn me more into the plot. It was frustrating to watch this movie after the masterpiece that came before it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Golden Age\\" has lost its luster","review":"The sequel to Elizabeth I has been long awaited only to leave me disappointed. I give the film 2 stars due to a watered down plot that was drug out and unimpressive. The 2 stars are for Cate Blanchett and the extraordinary display of costume. They may have well put their money where their mouth is with a better script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was really surprised at how good this movie was. When I first heard of it I thought it would be boring but the movie kept my attention the whole time. Great actors and actresses!! I am sure you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent acting by Cate Blanchett","review":"I am a student of British history, so I found this story very compelling. The acting was outstanding, although the resolution of the storyline was a bit unsatisfying. Gorgeous period costumes...vibrant historically accurate scenery. The violence and sex are very appropriate for the time period. Not an era for the faint of heart.

The costumes and sets look nice, but that's it! This movie was COMPLETELY inaccurate! It completely cuts Robert Dudley out of the story, even though he didn't die until after the battle with the armada. Where was Francis Drake? He harried the Spaniards more than Raleigh ever did and he's missing from the story as well (he also circumnavigated the globe, which made him a national hero). And the Spaniards weren't intercepting Mary Queen of Scots letters at all, Walsingham was too clever for that. Is it so much to ask that movies like this acutaully have some semblence of truth to them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth - The Golden Age","review":"What a great movie. Enjoyment to watch.

But this pales in comparison,its a flat story, cliche ridden depending upon poor story telling devices with none of the interesting plot lines or deliciously cunning characters, such as Francis Walsingham (played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush) as constructed in the first film. Save your time, see the first film twice rather than this one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Cate Blanchett performance!","review":"Cate Blanchett is one of our best actors in the field, and once again, she brings forth an amazing performance in this movie. It is as good as the prequel, Elizabeth.

Price was good, delivery was good. Unfortunately, the sound is a little off which makes this not a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy movie...","review":"If you're not familiar with real history ,like the majority of people are, then this movie would seem like a very entertaning one. On the other hand if you know a bit about history you would realize that this movie is so innacurate that at times it seems like a fantasy. Also they portray the spaniards looking like if they were from some South American country(no disrespect)and all of them dress in black to make them look like the bad guys, prince Phillip II is portrayed like a limping weirdo completely out of touch with reality. I just wish Hollywood would make a real good movie about this subject without taking sides and portraying both the English and the Spaniards as accurate as possible the way they really were along with the real reasons why the armada campaign came to be.......The real reason for the Spanish Armada wasntareligious e, it was a response from the Spanish to the continous piratical attacks to spanish possessions from english buccaneers backed by Queen Elizabeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A version of a biographical history of Elizabeth I","review":"Through out most of my lifetime Elizabeth II has reigned in England as a constitutional monarch. The first Elizabeth was another kind of monarch:she was one of the last mostly beneficial absolute monarchs. The wrongsof this system gave rise to a long period of civil strife after this periodin which royalists and protestants republicans fought it out.She executed a number of Catholic conspirators in this filmas the result of a Papal ban on her father's Church of England.In one view by defying the Spanish and the Pope, she established the British Empire in the world.In another view she was the one who made more peace than warand spent a lot of time building an army and navy for defense purposes.Time has told and she was one of the greatest, best English absolute monarch andmakes the King George of the American Revolution look very bad?The problem here is : do we believe this version of the biography or not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"This dreadful movie takes extraordinary artistic license with the facts of history to be polite. The Spanish Ambassador looked more like an Arab than a real Spaniard and the portrayal of King Philip was akin to an evil and ugly scheming Klingon captain of Star Trek fame. In actuality, Elizabeth I was not all she was cracked up to by the propagandistic British historical establishment. That mad woman embroiled England in a war(1585-1604) against Spain that actually bankrupted it and forced her successor, King James I, to sue for peace with Spain and sign a peace treaty that was largely on Spanish terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice pictures but historically inaccurate.","review":"Very nice pictures. This film is for those that appreciate more the stetical side of live/things than the real facts... a lot of both , Hollywood and historical inaccuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth I","review":"I have to admit I did not see the movie, nor shall I. I am a great fan of Elizabeth I, she held England together at a horrible time in history. As soon as I saw her depicted in armor, I knew it was going to be a fairy tale.What a shame to waste the talents of Cate Blanchett on something that ranges so far from the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb quality of picture and sound","review":"This is a masterpiece of both story and technology from an unfortunately \\"dead\\" format, even though people did not have the chance to really choose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they bother except possibly for a costuming award?","review":"Oh, the costumes look fabulous. Ditto the set design and locations. But come on...Elizabeth comes off as shrill, petty, obsessive, and hysterical here, while Walsingham pops up now and then as a prop. Sir Walter Raleigh is somewhat interesting, as is the queen's favorite lady, Bess--but the story isn't supposed to be about them, is it?It's also incredibly irritating to watch scene after scene of actors being filmed through frosted glass. Apparently the director and cinematographer couldn't think of anything else to do.The whole film comes off as surprisingly dull, given the potential strength of the subject matter. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A visually stunning Golden Age","review":"\\"Elizabeth - The Golden Age\\" deserves five stars for its beautiful costumes, magnificent sets and locations, and breathtaking cinematography, but only three stars for its approach to history and for giving Elizabeth I an enlightened and politically correct 21st century personality.The film deals with some of the most famous events of Elizabeth's reign - the Babington Plot which led directly to the trial and execution of Mary Queen of Scots, the invasion of the Spanish armada, encounters with Walter Raleigh. Don't come to this expecting an education; the film has only a nodding acquaintance with historical facts.As you would expect, the visual quality of the DVD is outstanding. The disc's special features include deleted scenes; short subjects on the making of the film; the reign of Elizabeth; creating the armada; towers, courts, and cathedrals; and a director's commentary.Recommended for its stunning visuals, but don't expect a history lesson"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"After seeing the first film (Elizabeth), I expected much more from this film, and was disappointed. The action is abrupt to the point of jarring, and there are too many scenes where Blanchett just stands in a costume while the camera whirls around her. The photography and sets are excellent, but not enough to carry this pretentious and poorly executed flick. I'm sorry I wasted the money to rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad state of affairs","review":"Although I absolutely love the first film and recognize that this movie is not supposed to be a duplication of that....it is without a doubt a grade z fluff piece. What disappointed me the most was that Cate Blanchett signed on to make this movie. Sure...its pretty to look at but I really felt it was thin on plot, thin on dialogue, and thin on history. I can think of lots of movies with well lit shots and introspectve looks on actors' faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie.","review":"This was a great movie. I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie since I had to watch it for my World Civilizations class but I'm glad I did. I'm not a huge fan of historical movies but this one is great. We learned about the holy war in class and this really brought it to life. Everything about this movie is great. Visually stunning. The soundtrack is phenomenal. Once again, awesome movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a big fan","review":"I understand the need to add a bit of drama to historical movies to make it more consumer friendly. But if you are going to stray that far away from fact you should just change the names and create a fictional character. Queen Elizabeth was an amazing ruler and person. She had plenty of drama and intrigue in her real life that I don't see the need to fabricate or diminish her person. Same feelings for the first movie they made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideas No Story","review":"I love Elizabeth the movie and the blu ray is absolutely gorgeous to watch. I didn't see the Golden Age until I recently bought the blu ray. The movie is really bad. I was surprised at how little story there was. It plays like a beautifully photographed music video with no music.You see a lot of people hating Elizabeth with little or no explanation as to why other than the over used bastard, whore, heretic reasons/descriptions. Caricatures is a word to sum up all of the performances. The Golden Age is a woefully poor sequel to a movie that was sheer pageantry. Cate Blanchett in one of the featurettes said that she felt that she had gotten it all wrong. I don't think that she should feel bad about this because they ALL got it wrong - especially the writers.Beautiful but not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Honestly I am shocked that this only has a 3.5 star rating. I think it was beautifully filmed, with tasteful and moving music. It seemed to focus on the light side of Elizabeth, and showed her sense of humor, strength, and deep loving side. It also refrained from multiple gruesome torture / execution scenes you usually get in films from this time period. Cate Blanchet is incredible in the role, and made me put QE1 on my list of people I wish I could meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like 'the Tudors' HBO/BBC series","review":"This is a glossy sham - little historical accuracy or plot - all the focus is on a unsubstanciated romance between Queen Elizabeth & Walter Raleigh .Why couldn't we see more about the Armada itself & what happened to Spain & Britain as a result . This was pivotal to both nations & indeed the future establishment of the US as an english speaking colony not a spanish or french or dutch colony . England bacame THE world seapower after this & spain fell in to long term decline - Spain's empire included most of Europe plus most of South & Central America .Go on somebody - make us a real film about the Armanda plus Walter's adventures in Virginia etc ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking Scenery, Costumes & Human History Unfolding","review":"Not that adept in the history of all this (although it did force me back into a college history text to boneup) the TV trailers for this made for this watch.The acting is magnificent, with the costumes and sets and brilliance of the photography is eerie and captivating!The choice to keep the violent scenes as well as the sensual ones leaving much to the imagination is to be applauded. We all still got the point without all the details.Truly enjoyable and admirable for the courage and wisdom and love of country that this remarkable queen exhibited!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this film unless?","review":"This movie may rival Ishtar and March or Die as among the worst movies of all time. You will not see much in the movie unless you collect Elizabethan movies or unless you have a part of your portfolio dedicated to the worst movies. This makes The Tudors seem like Shakespeare.The Golden Age is poorly written, badly acted and predictable. It does not deserve to be equated to March or Die. It is as inane as Ishtar. Blanchett, Rush, etc. play the same predictable roles as in any piece of this genre. It is hackneyed and trite.I am a history moviefile. I love every movie of this genre, but this is often unwatchable. It is formulaic. It would be a waste of time except it is a beautiful film in terms of cinema and costume. Maybe it would be better as a silent film or if watched in a foreign language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth's Golden Age","review":"I really didn't hear any buzz about this one and I wish I had. I rented and will probably buy it. It is one of the best historical dramas that I have seen. Beautifully filmed with great acting and costumes. Many movies have shown bits and pieces of Elizabeth before with Betty Davis being one of the best, but this rivals even her magnificent classic version. I highly recommend you catch this visual treat with substance. The movie centers on Protestant Elizabeth dealing with the Catholic King Philip II of Spain. His Inquisition is sweeping Europe and threatens the freedoms of all, including the English. Spain plots war with the assistance of the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots. Some magnifcent scenes including the battle in the English Channel with the Spanish Armada make it a feast for the eyes. The acting is quite good though so we never feel as though this is just eye candy. Fans of the movies \\"Apocalypto\\" and \\"Elizabeth\\" should see it. Excellent DVD with good replaybility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth...The Golden Age","review":"Elizabeth: The Golden Age (Combo HD DVD and Standard DVD) [HD DVD] I thought this a very good film. But the British Actor is a cut above. The story was well told. As I have made a great study of Elizabeth it is always good to see her come to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sound and the Fury","review":"There's very little substance of any kind here. You do get lots of beautiful costumes, sets, some decent naval scenes, and endless posing. Cate and Clive both look marvelous, simply marvelous. Cate certainly belts her lines out with conviction and Clive does a very reasonable Errol Flynn. But there's no center to this film, no evidence that any thought went into it at all. To borrow a bit more from the Bard himself, while there's lots of sound and fury, it signifies nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior sequel","review":"Conflict between Protestants and Catholics flares as Philip II (Jordi Molla) of Spain plots the assassination of Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchett) and the invasion of England. Meanwhile, on the home front, a romantic triangle heats up between Elizabeth, her favorite handmaiden Bess (Abbie Cornish), and Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen).No doubt the first Elizabeth film took its share of liberties with historical fact, but at least it was a serious examination of how a powerful and resourceful woman came to power, maintained her position, and the price she paid for it. This sequel is a combination of soap opera and Errol Flynn-type swashbuckler, peopled by one-dimensional characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Movie","review":"A must see movie concerning Elizabeth I.A powerful individual if ever there was one.Acting superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"Beautiful images in this film.

For people who just want to print out a generic HR manual, this is a good product. Any attempt to customize a handbook for your employees is much, much harder than doing it in MS Word.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to have help with developing a guidebook or company policies.

He offers dozens of useful tips, bolstered by examples from real-world hijackings, bombings and kidnappings. Epps' incessant paranoia can seem a bit much - he advises readers to be suspicious of everyone they meet. What's the fun of traveling abroad if you're terrified of everyone and everything?

The matches listed earlier are from the \\"Best of Starrcade 1983-1987\\" 2 tape set that was put out in the 80s. At least that is what I think the other person was alluding to. That's very different than the WCW \\"best of\\" series in the late 90s which were a bunch of quick highlight tapes at low prices. I don't know why people buy those little 30-60 minute comps, but they aren't very expensive, so if you want a quick trip down memory lane for a low price, it's not that bad. BTW, the Best of Starrcade 83-87 is quite hard to find, and would probably set you back closer to $$$$$ for an original copy. It is the only way to see in top quality some of the very early Starrcade matches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Fooled by Previous Reviews","review":"My Family ordered this tape 3 days ago.

This book was a big disappointment and I had to force myself to complete it. Having spent some time living in Japan, I enjoyed the descriptions of daily life, which are vivid. However, the characters seem to be pieces on a game board who are moved around artificially without motivations that ring true. Alternately the main character is thuddingly dull, or maddeningly self-involved. The characters around him are all very one-note, particularly the young women who seem to exist only for his pleasure. Read \\"Reservation Road,\\" which is outstanding, and avoid this earlier effort at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too foolish","review":"Going to Japan and spending long enough there to really absorb the language and culture was a dream of mine from my youngest days. That dream never got fulfilled, so I got this book to see what another young Yank's experience might have been like. Too bad the main character is an entitled, oblivious, morose fool. The story is a collection of various unfortunate and highly improbable social blunders, interspersed with irrelevant memories of his miserable childhood. I skipped forward, almost to the end, hoping to get to a part where he might experience some kind of epiphany or at least learn something. No such luck -- I will not be able to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-conscious writing","review":"While the descriptions of Toyko are fluid and pictorial, scenes where the protagonist interacts with other characters seems very unnatural and forced. It reminded me of watching a movie or play, where you see an actor *acting*, rather than seeing a *character*. In the case of Bicycle Days, I couldn't get pass that fact that the writer was *writing* so I never really saw Alec as a real character. In addition, the flashback scenes didn't grasp my interest as anything unique or intriguing, although I imagine they are important to understand. I'll never know, since I put the book down after reading 75 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Look into Japan","review":"I very much enjoyed JBS's style of writing.

This movie has nothing to do with racing at all. It's about some teens going around dealing with the dredges of life. The main \\"hot chick\\" of the movie, the main characters girlfriend, starts the movie a few months pregnant. She is then promptly replaced a few scenes later by a \\"hot crackhead chick\\" just because the main character almost runs her over and she tells him that she loves him when he gets out to help her to the sidewalk. He is \\"stalked\\" all through the movie by some guy in a black car who ends up sleeping with his chick who has had the kid by now. Makes you wonder where the baby is while they are both out screwing around on each other. Either way, pass this movie over if you're looking for something dealing with races. The only \\"race\\" scenes it does have, the cars aren't even going over 20mph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"For those interested in the sorcery of medieval Europe, this book may look interesting - don't be fooled. It is a farrago of half-understood and often misrepresented material, lifted from both actual grimoires, and from the anti-magical works of the church. The author pretends that there are medieval 'black books' of diabolism - there are none. He presents material lifted from Gardnerian Witchcraft as part of 'satanic' ritual, and in general lies freely to his readers. Those interested in the real magic of the middle ages, including demon-summoning, will do much better to read Waite."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and paper","review":"This is my first (and definantly last) IGOS published book.

What I found most helpful was the grouping of patterns according to row repeats, from 2 row patterns to 48 row patterns. There were 14 1/2 page examples of Aran combinations with tables showing the row and stich number for each pattern used. These combination examples illustrate how the Aran designs of different length and with can be group to create unique designs.This book is ideal for someone familiar with Aran Isle knitting who wants the freedom to design their own creations. A book most useful to intermediate to advance knitters, it covers the basics so well it would also be helpful to beginners with an interest in design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing buy","review":"Purchased this book thinking it would be equal to or better than the Vogue Cable volume. What a disappointment. While the directions and pictures are clear, the stitches given lack energy and inspiration. The samples are all worked in the traditional Aran creamy color and that does not allow the work to really shine in photos. This volume is also a bit larger than expected so it will not tuck neatly into my knitting bag. I would only recommend this book for those just beginning to build their knitting library and that recommendation is based solely on price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing.","review":"After waiting for 3 years to buy this book, I was very disappointed because there was really nothing special about the stitches it holds. Each of them are found in other Harmony books so they are only listed as Aran stitches, which they are, but they are duplicates, which makes the book unnecessary for a knitting library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurray for Timothy Zahn!","review":"Despite those who claim Mara and Luke do not belong together, I always have thought that they do. And Mr. Zahn probably thought the same. Those who have written novels that took place after Zahn's first trilogy couldn't catch his hint on Mara and Luke's relationship. Those two deserve a break after all that they have endured... and since they are two of a kind they deserve to be together. Both Mara and Luke have lost everything they had in the past... and that unites them... they understand each other. Luke doesn't need a housewife, he needs a friend, a companion... and no mather how sympathetic we are to Callista's problems, she is too deep into her own problems...in one word she's boring. Mara's my favourite character ever: she's real and not some mushy goody-good-doer. I even think she deserved to have her own prior history written in the star wars series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that.","review":"I notice that the previous customer reviews generally agree that \\"Specter of the Past\\" isn't as good as the original trilogy. In fact, it is practically a rewrite, minus the suspense. The original trilogy is held by many to be the high point of the Star Wars books, an opinion I don't share, though it certainly is better than most of them. Zahn manages to make Leia a little less dull than usual, but he is no good at all with Luke, and seems to know it, as Luke is a bit-player here. Zahn also brings a few more characters into play, which helps a bit. Mara Jade's popularity with the faithful is a baffler, because her character never develops beyond a lot of sarcasm. But the relevation of the plot from the first robs the book of even fake suspense. The only thing we don't know: when is Luke going to ever get laid?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start","review":"An early review of this book would suggest a need for some editing, maybe. It is a lot of setup: lots of political intrigue, several locations scattered throughout the galaxy, characters old and new, and considerable doses of continuity. I think Zahn will pull everything together, having loved the Thrawn trilogy these books follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Great Book!","review":"To Everyone Who is Reading the Review: This is a really great book, in fact it's probably one of my favorite STAR WARS books. Timothy Zahn is a great author! One thing you should know is, that if your planning on reading VISION OF THE FUTURE, (The next book in the HAND OF THRAWN), you should buy the book and have it ready to read the minute you end SPECTER OF THE PAST. In the last few chapters of SPECTER OF THE PAST, it leaves you hanging about certain events about different characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"THis book I mostly believe would only be understood by people who enjoy Star Wars to a certain extent. The plotline was great and the return of Thrawn was exciting and I can't wiat untill the sequel comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Lives On!","review":"Zahn does it again, expanding the epic story of Star Wars to new dimensions. The plot follows quite well from Zahn's previous novels, and does anm excellent job of integrating some of the characters from other author's novels. If you've read \\"Children of the Jedi\\", you'll be quite pleased to see what happens to the mysterious Callista in this book.Pellaeon, Grand Admiral Thrawn's former second in command is an exciting character that has evolved from the dubious fool under Thrawn's direct protection. Much of the plot of the book will likely become clear when part II of The Hand of Thrawn comes out, and the Empire's plot for the reappearance of Thrawn seems quite simplistic for a mind as creative as Zahn's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Pinnacle","review":"Zahn Strikes Back in this new installment of the Star Wars saga.

Some of the books coming out lately have been of poor quality or hard to follow. Zahn's articulated and concise writing style makes reading this book a pleasure.

Again, an excellent novel and I can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book...bad idea","review":"Don't get me wrong, the book was excellent...but the thing about bringing Thrawn back, bad idea. He was part of the first trilogy and should remain part of the first trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EVER STAR WARS NOVEL","review":"AMAZING - Thrawn is back! When I first picked up this book I could hardley put it down. Zahn writes in a style matched by no one. The story is that it turns out the Bothans were the ones responsible for helping Palpatine destroying a long lost world. The news comes out and everyone wants to either kill the Bothans or save them. Then Thrawn comes back from the dead ready to lead the Imperials to victory while the Republic destroys itself. Zahn includes all the classic charactars whom other authors have seem to forgotten - Mara Jade, the Noghri, Pallaeon. On top of this he mixes Stakpoles Rougue Squadron and Booster Terrik. All in all this action packed novel has you eating out of it's hand. Buy it at all costs. Oh yeah, Just try working out who or what the Hand of Thrawn actually is - when you do read the next book you'll be in for quite a suprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONCE AGAIN","review":"ZAHN CONTINUES HIS MASTERY OF THE STAR WARS WORLD...

Fans of Zahn will love this book especially since he discards the work of several other SW authors.

I realize that this book is probably just a lot of setting-up for the 2nd book, but I decided that I'd rather read other books instead of be bored on the way. It probably would have been better if Zahn had stuck with his original idea of one book instead of making it a duology.Instead of this book, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the best.","review":"If this points to the demise of any future history of the primary SW characters, a better vehicle will be hard to find.

This novel not only connects with Vision of the Future, but it also relates back to the original Thrawn Trilogy. Zahn perfectly sets everything into motion, clears up past author's mistakes and prepares you for Vision of the Future. This is Star Wars at its best and takes you into the past of Grand Admiral Thrawn. Make sure to get Vision of the Future, the exciting conclusion to The Hand of Thrawn series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent sequel to the original Timothy Zahn Trilogy","review":"The minute I found out about this book, I bought it and it's sequel-Vision of the Future. I thought the first Timothy Zahn trilogy was an excellent sequel to the Star Wars films. This book continues the story. The character and story development is great. I could not put the book down. I recommend it to any fan of Star Wars. Be sure to get Vision of the Future at the same time, so that you can continue reading. Also be sure to read the first Zahn trilogy, as this continues the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great I really enjoyed the book, can't wait for the sequel","review":"As with all Star Wars books I enjoyed it immensely.

I have been waiting for Zahn to write more in the Star Wars series. I just got this book a few days ago. It's so great, you can't put it down. It's not out in paperback yet, but the hardcover is worth it. All I want to know is what's going to happen next and how does the plot get exposed. Those of you who've read this will know what I'm talking about. Those of you who haven't - read this book!! Keep writing, Mr. Zahn!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saga Continues with style","review":"At last a new star wars book, that justly deserves its place in the universe. Timothy Zahn has taken us back to the suspense and drama, he first displayed with the \\"Heir to the Throne\\" trilogy. I love the fact that the \\"Tonnika twin story\\" in Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina relates to this story and that one of my favourite characters is now a part of the usual group (Shada the mistral, of course).The plot and subplots are filled with political intrigue and plenty of action, unfortunatley luke is not a major player in this story, but encompassing this fact, two other players have larger roles (Mara Jade and Talon Karrde.)Could it be possible that these two could have their own adventures retold by Timothy Zahn. All in all I am gasping for the next episode....May the force be with you all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This book was excellent because of the plot, I thought. Unlike most of the other books, this one did not involve a superweapon of some sort. An old New Republic nemisis returning from the dead - completly new and original. I can't wait for Book 2 of this 2-part set to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing with our nerves? or a disaster in the making........","review":"The grand Admiral's come-back was long awaited since it is one of the only great new character created after the films. Thrawn depth of personality and its powerful inteligence reminded the reader of their first chilling encounter with Dark Vader, years ago. Specter of the Past plays with our emotions by making the allusion that the dreaded Grand Admiral might be back to unite a dwiddling Empire.However, what a dissapointment to learn, half-through of the book, that it is not true. An actor is hired by a Moff to impersonate our evil hero. Why telling us so soon about the trick? Not a good move, unless a suprise is waiting to happen in the second chapter... Otherwise,a good story line with palatable style. Sorry my english is not great. May the force be with you....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you own both books of the set!","review":"Once again, Timothy Zhan has my full attention. I unfortunately didn't realize this was a two book set. It isn't written on the cover or back of my paperback. So now..I am stuck waiting for the second half of what has up to this point been a fabulous story! It seems Zhan is aware of the fact that most of his readers are familiar with the star wars world, and wastes little time over-describing a bush from a remote world or the subtle difference between the eylashes of two members of the same alien species. While Character developement is nice, I find that too many of the star wars novels I read spend more time describing little, interesting to know, but unimportant things than giving me the epic action I crave. Not Zhan. If you are like me, buy these books, and the Heir to the Empire series. You won't be dissapointed! ="},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"the irritating writing style continues...unfortunately this time there is no attempt at a storyline and no interesting characters. we don't really need to be informed every time someone has to 'connect to the force', or runs through jedi meditation techniques, etc. it has to be implied at some point really."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it","review":"What makes Timothy Zahn the best is that he keeps Star Wars what it should be: a conflict between good and evil portrayed by the alliance and the empire.

This is one of the better Star Wars books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Zahn should leaving the Star Wars novels to Kevin J. Anderson. Never has it taken me so long to read a book. Zahn yammers on and on without saying much. Too many strange aliens which never appeared in the trilogy, and not enough of the main characters, espically Luke Skywalker. Too complicated, too many storylines, not enough action, and just plain uninteresting. One of the worst Star Wars novels to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"This book sucks. Too many stupid subplots that are not very interesting. There is nothing very captivating at all with the crises that Zahn presents. Nothing even happens in this book and you end this book feeling like he wrote one huge book andjust cut it in the middle and made them two books. The worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a sad excuse.","review":"Timothy Zahn has taken it on himself to write the book(s) in which the Empire finally collapses and surrenders to the New Republic. The characters are great. The set-up is good. The final result is a cliffhanger. The second book, Vision of the Future, is an attempt to bring together everything that happened in all of the novels written to date. Considering what he had to work with, Zahn did a great job. Unfortunately, he included a lot of garbage (such as anything written by Kevin J Anderson) and completely destroyed his product. This is a must miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"The \\"return\\" of Thrawn raises then smashes the hopes of Imperial followers. Zahn alludes to actions happened in other books, but then proceeds to tell us exactly when it happened. Allusions are good, but blatant references get in the way of an already weak plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little for too much","review":"I got the distinct feeling that this was half or even a third of a book, having much less content then a single book from Zahn's Star Wars trilogy. Theme after theme was introduced and then dropped, with none of the richness of his previous work. It felt tremendously unfinished and unsatisfying. I can't think of any reason to publish a book this way other then pure greed. Even when the second book is published, if it continues in this mold, I doubt if the two books together will equal one of the original Zahn Star Wars books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"This book is great, but the returning of Grand Admiral Thrawn is not very good. It would be more interesting if he was cloned or something. Remeber to read Vision of the future, too, the conclusion of this Hand of Thrawn Duology.

That's how it is with differnt size books sometimes. Specifically, the Scriptures. But I simply didn't want to let down if the page number was wrong.

N.O.Intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better then all the other writers together!","review":"I was so happy to hear that Zahn was writing another series of books for Star Wars. After some of the cheesy stuff that had been coming out lately, from the almost childish (The Crystal Star), to the \\"Super Weapon of the week\\" books (Darksaber, Jedi Academy, Children of the Jedi), it was nice to see a quality book again. And what the other writers did to Mara! They just destroyed her personality! Almost an insult to Zahn. Thank goodness we got away from that Lando and Mara mess! Timothy Zahn truly captures the spirit of the movies, the original charcters. Although I thought that Pelleaon should have had a more substantial role (I find him much more interesting then the Moff and his *crew*), and that it was a little slow to get going, it is still a great book, and way better then all the other Star Wars books, excepting the Heir to the Empire trilogy.

Boy, does it ever.It works just like a car, has a key, goes into drive, neutral and backup, has a moving screen (windshield)with a car that will go forward and backward with the change. Windshield wipers, turning signals, cell phone and so much more. Rowan loves it. It is not heavy, so she carries it around with her and then sits down and drives.

I returned the first one that I purchased because the roadway did not move as it is supposed to. The second one I received moves intermittently. If we jiggle it or move the shifter back and forth, it will start moving again.I kept the toy because both my kids (1 and 2 1/2) seem to enjoy it regardless. We let them play with it in the car on our long drive back from visiting relatives for the holidays, and it kept them both occupied for some time.I did not find it too loud or annoying, as other reviewers did, though both kids seemed to want to move the shifter into reverse position and leave it there, which means that it beeps like a truck backing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Someone bought one of these for my sons birthday and he loved it.

The last one lasted only 3 weeks or so.Owners I know using non-Lexar USB keys get at least 9-12 months before the key dies. Two months or less for this Lexar is unacceptable.Look elsewhere for a USB key."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I wanted","review":"I had been looking for an MP3 player that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg so I came across the Lexar MPC-231 JumpGear MP3 Digital Music Player for JumpDrive Sport and the Lexar Sport JDSP256-231 USB 2.0 256 MB USB Flash Drive. This would be the answer to my problems. I didn't want the expensive MP3 players that were in the hundreds of dollars. When I listen to music I like to vary my songs frequently. The 256MB capacity allowed me to down load the right amount of songs that I wanted to listen too during a certain time period, then I could get more songs and put them on and I wasn't stuck listening to the same songs over and over again. The only problem I have is that a lot of my songs are on I tunes and that format is not supported, but I will just have to live with that I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case breaks","review":"The rubber casing/holder is a great idea.

This worked well for about 2 months when, after the normal wear and tear of taking my keys out of my pocket, the cap popped at the point that conects to the key ring. I say popped not broke because the cap is made out of rubber-like material that I now realise is a glorified rubber band. Sport indeed. I had to resort to keeping the drive loose in my pockets, have long since lost the fragile thing, and am now wishing I had the frustration of loosing caps for a drive that is sucurely attached to my key ring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent drive but horrible design","review":"Works well BUT the top is not so easy to use.

I had this thumb drive for less than a month when this happened, and was very carful to take care of it. The plastic casing on it broke, splitting into two sections. Now all my files are lost and I spent $40 bucks on something that was, in my opinion, poorly put together.

While copying back (more than 100mb) data from this drive to my laptop it will hang and then computer will not be able to read it (I tried with 3 laptops!).

The fit of the stock to the receiver was horrible. As a previous reviewer noted, there was a significant gap between the rear of the receiver and the the new stock when installed. I had to file down the new stock to create a reasonable fit. It's still wide around the edges where the receiver meets the stock, but if I file that down, I'll go right through the camo finish on the new stock. For something from the Remington brand, I would expect a better fit onto a Remington shotgun.Even though I didn't need it, I installed the new forend, as well.

Was there a poor orphan cliche he didn't use? Oh wait, she didn't get pressed into the Navy, but that was it! The real Anne isn't perfect and so long suffering. I know because I've read the books! Too bad Sullivan can't be charged with something and barred from ever doing anything Green Gables related again. Sad, because he started out well. Not sure what happened, but it isn't pretty.

The standing Anne on the stool and forbidding others to have any contact with her, the cutting of her hair claiming that her hair is the root of the rebellion in her, even the death of a friend in the asylum.This movie is not even worth watching. Watch the movies that they stole from instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst adaptation ever","review":"A New Beginning is completely that...the whole story line was changed and made Anne a liar.

If only I had read the reviews, I would have saved myself nearly $20.00. This was terrible! Beyond horrid. The acting and scenery were its only redeeming qualities. But the fact is, it is simply a bastardization of L.M. Montgomery's Anne-verse as her true fans knew it and loved it. Its pollution.

We have just watched thirty minutes of the movie and decided to turned it off because it was so dark and depressing. This film certainly doesn't hold a candle to the original or the sequel and we were very disappointed! It was confusing to my children because Anne's earlier life was portrayed differently in this film and doesn't hold true to the books nor the earlier movies. Kevin Sullivan shouldn't have taken liberties with changing the details of a character so dear to the hearts of many fans.

This is truly the most pathetic excuse of a movie ever. And to use the Anne of Green Gables books in vain like this is a kind of sacrilege. I can only think Kevin Sullivan is a very disturbed man to have taken something so beautiful and morphed it into this ugly movie.

In fact I think they should banish him to Iceland. And all the people who wrote reviews here- you all said a mouth full. I cannot say how upset I was.

If this were not proported to be an Anne movie, it would be an OK movie, I'd give it 2-3 stars then, although there are gaps in the plot and some of the story line jumped around a bit. Anne is an orphan, not an abandoned daughter, which shapes her whole life. Marilla would never have withheld a letter from Anne, she would have given it to her.

Why she didn't stick with Bottrell is a mystery, instead she turns overs the production reigns to every serious artists nightmare, Glen Ballard. Talk about one step forward and ten steps back!

The author could have presented the main points of this book on a few pages and saved us all the time required to read the filler material.

From page one Woodall coaches the reader in developing skillful, confident responses to sticky questions. She says, \\"Thinking on your Feet means saying exactly what you want to say at exactly the right moment . . . .\\" Her method and examples provide common-sense means for gaining the high ground in any conversational situation. It's guidance one can use without the distraction of theoretical or statistical overkill. Thinking on Your Feet follows its own advice, recognizing that brevity is not only the soul of wit, but of wisdom. I agree with Kare Anderson (www.sayitbettercenter.com) that \\"This is the best single book for learning to maintain composure when responding to a hot situation or volatile person.\\" Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Book?","review":"Wow, after reading the other reviews I'm not sure we're talking about the same book. First of all, I'd call this book more of a pamphlet. It's 117 pages in length that actually starts on page 15 with the introduction. There were 8 blank pages between chapters and the print was quite large. A book of 95 net pages that I, being a slow reader, easily read in less than 45 minutes is hardly what I would call a \\"book\\". I purchased through Toastmasters International (sorry Amazon!) for an award presentation and I'm just too embarrassed to hand it to the recipient. The content was just OK. I am convinced that there are many better reads on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"mad woman","review":"This book is fine. However, the process in getting the book was horrible.

Pero sin duda lo mas importante es que refleja el \\"desconocimiento\\" de la sociedad rusa sobre la situacion real de rusia durante ese periodo a causa de la falsa propaganda stalinista, en verdad se establece una situacion de \\"doblepensar\\"(segun G.Orwell).

He introduces you to new and amazing music by creatively identifying influential singers/bands, and then based on your interest per these groups, suggests ten similar singers/bands who you may want to listen to. Lesser-known but talented bands like Mars Volta and Magma should thank him for generating such attention.Abramowitz's enthusiasm for music is evident throughout the guide. His language is very fresh and, at times, comical His descriptions of well-known bands may cause you to re-think their music. For example, Abramowitz describes Black Sabbath as, \\"Slow, dark, doomy, but surprisingly swinging, groovy and more positively lyrically than many may suspect.\\" His objectivity can be seen with his description of U2, \\"One camp: Pompous and self-important. Other: Sweeping and inspiring.\\" Abramowitz will introduce you to a new world of music, one that will positively affect your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pockit Rockit Rocks!","review":"Erudite and expansive but still roughly the size of a Zagat this book is a must have for anyone looking to expand there knowledge of great music.

Running the gamut from the most mainstream (Say, Dolly Parton) to the wildly obscure (Exhorder), from Free Jazz and Prog-Metal to Hip-Hop and Folk there's no style of music or type of artist you've been interested in that you won't find a path to in this book.

Connecticut writer Kaufman sets this story in New England, capturing and juxtaposing the urban and urbane Boston against the more rural \\"hill town\\" region of Western Mass. This writing device also serves as a metaphor for the differences in the primary characters' lives -- stable family life vs unstable, wealthy vs poor, climbing the ladder of success vs sitting at the top of the ladder, and being almost what you seem to be vs being an almost total fraud. Some portions of the story tax credulity, but that criticism is relatively minor in comparison to the strengths of Kaufman's storytelling skill. I recommend this book, and even more highly recommend his second: \\"One Last Lie.\\" Though I've never met the author, I live in the same state and would love to discuss with him his work over an adult beverage or three. Why? His imagination, as demonstrated in his books, is wonderfully twisted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book for gifts from your kitchen.","review":"This book cantains 21 recipes.

For example, how does Chabad decide where to build new centers? For example, why Little Rock but not Baton Rouge?

The Rebbe (z''l) was such a great, dedicated and loving man. I'm glad I got to know more about him and the Lubavitchers through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda of the nice sort","review":"Chabad Lubavitch is a highly sophisticated philosophical system. This is the true driving force of The Rebbe's Army. That's why it's somewhat sad to see this book depend on 'propaganda' to make its point. Similar to another book -- Despite All Odds -- that also failed precisely because it was a self promoting work trying to hard to make a case for the 'greatness' of Lubavitch.Others may need to rely on spin and cliches, but Lubavitch's message stands on its own merit. Growing up in a secular environment, I uased to think otherwise. But after reading some very fine books on Lubavitch, like Holy Days, Toward a Meaningful Life and others, I came to realize the profound spirituality and comprehensive relevance of the Lubavitch perspective on life.Yet, the good news is that with all the negative propoganda out there, I guess The Rebbe's Army is a form of positive propaganda, disseminating an upbeat and empowering message of a very vibrant and dynamic force in the world today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling Bigots","review":"The above reviews typify the lowbrow adoration of Chabad and Hasidic bigotry and racism. Read Postville, for instance, written by a Jew about the Lubavitcher assault on an Iowa town. Better, even look into the many Jewish critiques of ultra-orthodox Jewry by reformist, conservative and secular Jews within Israel for a sense of how fundamentalist Judaism reeks of a hateful, inbred insanity -truly!Go to the website of Hemdat, which recounts tales of this breed assaulting old, Jewish women for using their electric wheelchairs on Saturday, or slinging their own excrement at synagogues they regard as deviant.The pretense that Hasids are even remotely spiritually generous to any human being outside of their narrow faith is complete stupidity, hypocrisy or cowardice.Like Bloom's work on Postville, the author here has failed completely to transcend her tribe in order to provide a fair critique of this entirely ugly movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a great book for someone interested in learning about the Harlem Renaissance.

It was great to see the return of Bakura to the Star Wars universe after a decently long time of neglect. The scenes with Luke and Lando are enthralling while other scenes show some flashes of brilliance, but overall this book is simply better than average. It suffers through a sophmore slump, parts of the book are just uninteresting. The writing stays fine, but the especially the scenes with Han Solo and his allies prove to be a bit drawn out and difficult to read. That said, Assualt at Selonia is still better than any of the KJ Anderson books in the Star Wars universe. It builds up very well towards the conclusion Showdown at Centerpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Love star wars books. One of the best books series the is.

By itself, just plain confusing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Drudgery","review":"I bought this book simply because it and its counterparts were in the used book section of a local bookstore. The book started off slowly and ended even worse. The unbelieveable amount of misspelled words and improper grammar was enough to annoy even me (a would-be engineer). The entire series could have been written in a single book even though I really don't know why anyone would even want to read it as a single book! To put it mildly this book (entire trilogy) was a huge wildly unbelievable pile of hooie. I have thus far read several trilogies in the Star Wars universe and have enjoyed all of them except this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and duller yet","review":"This book did not pick up on action where Ambush at Correlia lacked. The title alone has nothing to do with Selonia, since the characters don't even land on Selonia until the third book of the triology. A major disappointment. As a Star Wars fan for the last 22 years, I am not all that pround in having this in my collection of Star Wars novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"After reading the first book in this series by Roger MacBride Allen, I almost didnt want to read the second book. I read it and I really enjoyed it. It was much better than the first book. Now that I've read the second, I know how important it is to read the first book in this trilogy. There are the same characters from the first book: Han Solo, Leia and their kids Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin, Luke, Lando, and some other people that they meet along the way. In this book, Han is a prisoner to the Human League and Leia is looking for Han. They end up going to Selonia to where they run into a battle to save Han. Luke comes with people from Bakura that are going to help him save his friend. It's a very exciting book.Overall, I think this book is a great read for star wars fans and is better than the first book in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, but ot the worst","review":"There's not much to say here this book was boring but nothing beats out \\"children of the jedi\\". the ending is good however.

There is almost no character development and nothing to like about them. They're whiny and one dimensional. And for supposedly highly successful people, they're dumb as bricks. Even if you're not a trained \\"explorer\\" you don't simply barge into dangerous situations without taking some precausions. And they do this repeatedly, despite their past mistakes, blundering into bad situations over and over and over and over again. Even though Hutch seems to be more intelligent and is aware of the potential the dangers involved, she repeatly lets herself be pushed around by her not-so-bright passengers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had me, then lost me","review":"I really enjoyed the first half of this book. The writing was intelligent, the science was good and the characters were believable. The excitement of investigating the source of a brief signal that was clearly alien in origin was nicely offset with a crew of individuals who's strength's and flaws were as real as any random gathering of individuals. Then stupidity hit. The consequences of a previous fatal decision are somehow justified away and, would you believe it, disaster strikes again! I cringed as this stupid decision played out but kept on reading only to see previously strong characters suddenly become wishy-washy and allow more stupidity. I tried to stay with it but finally gave up when I realized I no longer cared about any of the characters (other than the charming AI). Unfortunate. It was an exciting concept but I really have low tolerance for stupidity. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, Rama-esque storyline, decent writing","review":"The story is a bit like Arthur C. Clarke's Rama, so if you liked that, you'll like this. Writing is decent, plotline is o.k.

However, in the end it doesn't matter. The book builds to a climactic ending THAT NEVER COMES. I have never felt so let down before. None of the mysteries are answered. What is the Chindi? What's it's purpose? What about the other ancient life discovered on the other worlds? It gave me a severe headache having all these questions go unanswered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galactic wonders with a human perspective","review":"I won't describe the plot, because this has been done. But instead I will point out what I liked. McDevitt managed to convey the wonders and the sheer scariness of space that we might find one day. He demonstrates that there could be engineering marvels such as the unnatural orbiting pleasure moon, or the museum ship, with no discernable answers as to why it was done or why the creators abandoned it. Amidst all of these marvels there is still plently of room for everyday human pettiness, screw ups and sacrifice. Of all the 4 books in this series I rate this as the best. Humanity is brought to light against this backdrop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't bother","review":"An awful waste of time. Others have savaged the book in considerable detail, so I won't spend a great deal of time repeating their comments. The concept is hackneyed, and the characters are dumb as rocks! Their first instinct upon stumbling on any alien structure is to bust into it with a cutting torch! The result is a series of improbable \\"Perils of Pauline\\" adventures, with a last-minute rescue, after which the characters jump heedlessly into the next misadventure, in a series of incidents that resemble a plot.Couldn't finish it, scanned ahead for the disappointing denouement and was glad I tossed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scifi has to start with sci","review":"Scifi has to start with science and then carry it beyond the known. The author of Chindi made some critical mistakes early on, which put me off for the rest of the book. Example: Suns \\"burn\\" because the Hydrogen fuses into other elements. Burning before fusion starts is an obvious mistake. Beyond that, the characters were not developed very well and the book dragged for long periods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you plagiarize yourself?","review":"A nice mix of action and science fiction, Chindi helps move contemporary sci-fi away from the boring, pedantic grad student ramblings or poli-sci obsessions that are all too often replacing good storylines.I would have given it four stars but it is EXACTLY THE SAME STORY AS HIS EARLIER WORK \\"DeepSix\\"! After enjoying Chindi I sought out more of his work and picked up DeepSix only to discover it is the same plot line with many of the same action sequences and basically the same dramatic climax. It was a good story once McDevitt; twice is just greedy laziness.I won't read any more of his work as I expect he will keep recycling the same story. But if you've never read any of his work and like Sci-fi that you can read without a CRC handbook then pick up a copy of Chindi."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING WITH NO CLIMAX","review":"Overdrawn and very boring novel, where not much happens.

I would have been able to overlook the slow plot if it had not been for the terrible character of Hutch. The female characters are so fake and seem so obviously written by a male. I was hoping that Hutch would be a strong female lead but as in all of Jack McDevitt's Hutch books, she was not. She is unbelievable and an incredibly poor depiction of women. I, myself, am not an extreme feminist but even so I was taken aback by her unrealistic and weak character. Other than this, the plot was drawn out and anticlimactic."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interesting Idea, but a Dull Book","review":"Jack McDevitt's new book, Chindi, starts out with an interesting idea. What would happen if a group of armchair adventurers hired a spaceship and made first contact with an alien civilization? The idea is intriguing but the author is unable to pull it off. The characters are caricatures, the pacing of the story is off, and the climax feels like a let down. After reading 400 pages I wanted some answers about who (or what) the aliens were. All that I got was a brief epilogue explaining that we still do not know what is going on. Where Jack McDevvit really shines is his ability to imagine grand astromonical settings for his story. His descriptions of the newly discovered planetary systems manage to evoke a sense of awe. Unfortunately this was not enough to hold my interest. Chindi is an interesting idea, but a dull book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rarity, a deeply mediocre McDevitt book","review":"Continued reuse of the same rather wooden lead character cast a pall of boredom over the opening chapters for me, \\"Hutch' is well past her sell by date and has hopefully now been pensioned off to well deserved obscurity. The book has it moments but struggles to rise above the quality of star trek's threadbare soap opera. The whole plot and especially the ending suffered from plodding predictability and lack of pzazz. Its all been done before with more style, better characters, and superior imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nebula nominee?

Most of the motivations and decisions made in this book make no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally Annoying","review":"Many genre plots are driven by irresponsible and dangerous decisions on the part of the main characters. This seems more than usually the case in Chindi. I'm about 2/3 of the way through it, but don't think I can finish it. The ideas aren't very compelling, the most nearly appealing characters have mostly been killed off, and I wouldn't miss the others.Like an earlier reviewer, I generally like McDevitt. Hopefully his next outing won't feature a band of idiots repeatedly falling into tedious perils."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Fiction for the Hopelessly Mediocre","review":"Master of the bland SciFi, Mr. McDevitt writes a novel representing a juxtaposition to his futuristic without being futuristic Murder She Wrote embarassement called \\"Infinity Beach\\".

He received it for his first birthday and after a few injuries we put it away for over a year...we keep bringing it back out to try again, but at 2 1/2, this still happens occasionally.

It starts with a description of an Egyptian family, then describes various aspects of their daily lives.

Calcium fortified juice is good, but I just didn't feel they were getting enough.I worked at a Health Food store and tried ALL the calcium supplements - capsules, chalky, unpleasant chewables, and bad-tasting liquids. One day, a rep from Nature's Plus came in and gave me a sample of the Animal Parade calcium. My kids LOVE the vanilla sundae flavor, the texture is not chalky and they now ask me if they can please take their vitamins!This is a great product, as even kids who can drink milk can usually use some extra calcium.

The representative I spoke with said the label is correct and that some Animal Parade vitamins are soy free but this one is not.If it weren't for my anger at mis-representation on the Nature's Plus website I would rate these vitamins a full 5 stars.

This documentary was shown on HBO almost daily up until the Sept 11, 2001 tragedy- BUT HAS NOT BEEN BROADCAST ONCE SINCE 9/11... Why is that? Why is HBO suppressing this powerful documentary?

Particularly, when one terrorist returns to the Ryder rental to collect his deposit, with the FBI in wait. That's right. After the WTC bombing, he returned for the deposit on the Ryder truck that they exploded in the WTC basement.But the most sobering moment of the movie, is at the end. Where some prophetic words are used, and in hide sight, should make every American angry. This is a must see.

This movie covers every aspect of the emergence of Al Queda, even as early as 1990, when the Rabbi was assasinated, through 1993 when the Rabbi's assasin El Sayid Nossair's cousin perpetrated the bombing of the World Trade Center.

I learned a lot about the first attack that I never knew and was very shocked at the ending when Ramsi Yusef told the FBI agent escorting him back to NYC for his trial that this basically was not over yet.

I learned much more than I knew about pyrography beforehand and was delighted to see that it falls well within the fine arts realm as opposed to just another craft.

What we do get is more confusion on Steph's part and her seemingly apparent denial that she is in fact cheating on the very man she claims to love. Why is this okay with so many readers?\\" The Ranger/Morelli dilemma is tiring. The fact that she can't choose and occasionally cheats is annoying and definitely not okay with me as a reader. Grow up and settle down, Steph! Sure, Ranger may always be a distraction and an enigma, but choose and commit to Morelli. Stephanie managed to drive the same car throughout the entire book. That's a first! Also, not enough Grandma Mazur. The whole thing with the band seemed forced. Still fun, but not worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Janet Evanovich never disappoints...She is the only author that I read that I laugh out loud with.

It was great and she continually makes the best read in town!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steph's back!","review":"For a while the Plum series languished in the same old same old rut. In Twelve Sharp, Stephanie's got her groove back. The tension between Ranger and Stephanie, Morelli and Stephanie, and Morelli and Ranger quivers without declining into cliche, and Steph herself is learning to live with the ambiguity of it all. What is troublesome is that she seems to be unable to make a decision and stick with it, unless it has to do with food. This girl needs to move on and make a life for herself! But Twelve's plot is nice and tight, somewhat darker than usual, and doesn't resort to easy or incredible solutions. The colorful stock characters are reliable as always, and the slapstick passages, especially those involving Lula, Grandma, and the funeral home are over the top. It's enough to make you want to visit Trenton (well, almost).Some classify the Plum series as chick lit, but I think it's entertaining enough and real enough for readers of mystery in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old","review":"the Stephanie Plum books have not had a new plot since about book number six....hmmm...what will any new book hold...Stephanie and Lula will have some capers that go bad; grandma will have a funeral home scene...Stephanie and Morelli will eat with mom and dad....and Stephanie will find herself with Ranger....and in the end she loves them both....I think we need a new plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read in the Stephanie Plum series","review":"More amusing situations for Stephanie mixed with some tense and scary events that keeps you reading.

Especially the grandmother and the respect they give her and she is so active - yet naive."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY 5-STARS -- SURELY WORTH THE READ","review":"Stephanie Plum has two men in her life -- Ranger and Joe. In Book 1, Joe is on the lam, in Book 12, it is Ranger.Both are macho hunk, both make her melt, both are the light of her life. But, Ranger is self described as the \\"dessert\\" in her food pyramid -- which he believes to depict a fun romp but not for the long haul. But, what he does not know is that dessert is her food pramid.Joe, is the guy who goes to her house every Friday for dinner and then for his ability to tolerate the banter, gets his own just desserts from Stephanie.Enjoyable and playful characters of the Burg, these books grow and grow and grow on you. There are times that you will find yourself in stitches (the scene of interviewing the prospective new bounty hunters is amazingly tight and funny).If you pick this book up -- I will almost guarantee you that you will finish it within hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie Plum","review":"I love Janet Evanovich.

Ranger is just too hot...if ever a movie they must have The Rock play this role. The storyline was good but thought the end of all the drama saving Stephanie was a little cheated...but then the very end with Ranger not so sure that Stephanie gets cheated in any way!!!Must Listen!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanovich is back on course!","review":"This was an excellent read. It was fast-paced and well developed. TWELVE SHARP took me back to the first couple Stephanie Plum books I read, which hooked me on Janet Evanovich. The plot's more serious, but there's plenty of comic relief. I wish they'd make this into a movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As great as the previous ones!","review":"I discovered this series through a friend and was hooked from the beginning. I bought all the books and read one per night... Lack of sleep was starting to become a problem but it is impossible to put those books down. It is amazing that the plots are as interesting even at this stage. I can't say how much I miss those 12 books and I can't wait for the next ones I hope. Two of my friends who are reading those books have developed the same addiction. It is so hilarious, I often found myself laughing out loud. The cashier at a book store where I was buying the other books told me that he couldn't stop reading and laughing either. What a nice tribute to leave to so many readers! Thanks so much for making our days and nights so happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs more ...","review":"I love Stephanie Plum novels, and I devour each one of them. In this, number twelve in the series, Ranger's wife is after Stephanie and later a wanna-be Ranger stalks her. It's excellent plot-wise - probably the best of plot in the series. Not quite enough of the Plum family in it (but then I can never get enough) and Ms. Evanovich sacrificed humor for plot. Instead of a ho-hum story with great humor, she has a great storyline with not as much humor as usual. Stephanie is more realistic about Morelli in this book. One thing I did not like was Stephanie trying to shake her bodyguards twice, when a raving maniac was after her. It seemed to go against the grain of her character. She is admittedly \\"not brave\\". I thought it a noticeable fictional move, in an otherwise very alive novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make up your mind, Stephanie!","review":"Misfit bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has two men in her life - she lusts after Ranger but is in love with Morelli. This time the focus is more on Ranger. An insane bounty hunter wannabe steals Ranger's identity and kidnaps Ranger's daughter. Stephanie helps Ranger figure it all out.As always, I really enjoyed Grandma Mazur and Lula. Also liked the new funeral home directors, Scooter and Dave. Didn't like how Steph was unable to choose between the two men in her life; I'm tired of it.The ending was flat-out dumb: Steph figured out how the fake Ranger did things but didn't anticipate what the fake Ranger was going to do?!! Pretty lame. I saw that coming a mile away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plum Addicted","review":"I have read all of the Stephanie Plum series, anxiously awaiting # 19 . They all rate 5 stars to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve Dull","review":"I'm suprised so many reviews of this book are superb. If you did not read the previous 11 books, I could understand one enjoying the book. However, the storyline just was not believable based on the development of Ranger's character in the previous books. There's just now way the identify theat/daughter plot would ever have happened to Ranger. It's like a different author wrote the book. Also, a mistake worth noting: Stephanie lives in an apartment. Twelve Sharp refers to her residence as an apartment at the beginning, condo in the middle, and back to an apartment at the end. Details matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay But Not Great","review":"Basically this was not her best effort. In the predictable column, Stephanie sleeps with Joe and lusts after Ranger. Grandma does her deal and sister is pretty much absent. Her car doesn't get blown up and someone new is running the funeral home. I did read it in one night as I love her work, but I didn't get the thrill I usually get from Stephanie Plum. I also thought it very strange that all of a sudden, there is this Ranger stalked who knows all about him, has been following him and Ranger doesn't have a clue? Excuse me, that is not the Ranger of any of the other books. 11 previous books make him the super competent, enigmatic character that no one can trace and now all of a sudden, this store clerk has been stalking him for months and he didn't know that they guy was screwing with his life, his credit, his name and kidnapping his kid? I don't expect these to be plausible, but at least be consistent. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I didn't mind that the books were getting shorter and shorter. Nor did I mind the thin plots or the weakening characterizations.But what I do mind is that I didn't laugh out loud once while reading \\"Twelve Sharp\\". That's what kept me reading these books. Please, Janet, how about slowing down?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you wanting more","review":"This book was great, as are all of Evonovich's Plum series. I was hoping for a little more background on Ranger, which is why this is only four stars. We did get to see a more emotional Ranger (He still doesn't hold a candle to Steph) and the Lula/Tank bit was great! Plus no Valerie and Albert Kloughn (There has been way too much of them in recent books.)Overall, Evonovich is still the writer I wait for every summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a story","review":"Lots of sexual overtones between Stephanie and Ranger and her long-time boy friend Morelli, but the underlying story is very thin. Reasonably good read, but easy to put down and pick it up later. Several of the main characters seem out of place (Lulu and Sally) in Trenton, NJ and the Bail Bond business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downward spiral continues","review":"After being delighted by the first six or seven books in this series, I noticed a big dropoff with book eight. It's no coincidence that Hard Eight is the novel where Stephanie cheats on Morelli with Ranger. And feels little or no guilt. She lost much of her charm in that book, and her continual string-pulling in the subsequent books does nothing to redeem her. I suspect that Evanovich decided her core audience is female, and chose to indulge a favorite female fantasy: two studs battling for Stephanie, and Stephanie doing pretty much whatever she wants, with no consequences. The \\"shake my head in disbelief\\" point for me in Twelve Sharp came when Morelli discovers Ranger is living with Stephanie in her apartment, closes the door, and meekly walks away. Right. That might be a female fantasy, but as a male reader, it is totally unbelievable ... unless you accept Morelli as a wimp, in which case, why care about him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Plum","review":"Is it funny? Yes.Does it have a lot of romantic tension? Yes.Does it have a good villain? Yes.Is the mystery interesting? Yes.Are the characters still fun? Yes.What more do you want out of a summer beach book?I've heard some reviewers bemoan Ms. Plum's lack of dynamic character development throughout the series. They would like to see Stephanie grow, or change, or mature, or develop, or choose between Ranger and Joe, or become a monk and move to Tibet, or join the Galactic Alliance and fight the Mucus Monsters of Planet Nostril.I disagree. I think the formula is perfect. It's fun, fast-paced, and always good for some laughs.You wouldn't ask Walt Disney to make Mickey Mouse more grown-up. Especially since Disney has been dead for several decades.You shouldn't ask Janet Evanovich to change Stephanie, either. Both Stephanie, and Janet, are perfect the way they are, and I hope they stay that way for many more books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twelve Sharp","review":"This is her BEST YET!I laughed so hard...the part about Grandmother and the Band....I nearly fell out of my chair.

It was definitely worth the wait! Stephanie is still getting into laugh out loud adventures and trying to decide between the two men in her life!

This one is just as entertaining as the other eleven. I found myself laughing out loud several times -- Lula's band outfits, band practice, the \\"Pleasure Treasures\\" adventures, and of course Stephanie's father. The plot is suspenseful as usual, and once again, Stephanie is torn between two VERY HOT men. I don't know how she controls herself...The only gripe I have about this one is that her car stays in one piece. It does get shot at, but she is still driving it -- intact -- at the end. I kept waiting for it to get blown to smithereens. I wish 13 was already out...I hate the waiting!If you've read the other books in the series, then don't stop now!

I'm happy to report that such is not the case with Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum.Things could get a little dull by the time you've made it through a dozen books, but Twelve Sharp is riddled with the humor, excitement, and lust that we've come to expect -- and love -- in a Stephanie Plum book. All the favorites are back (Grandma Mazur, Lula, Connie, Ranger, Joe and Bob) plus some new friends, and the antics are as wacky as ever.This book is sure to please the most devoted of Stephanie fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWELVE SHARP IS DULL","review":"Evanovich's latest Stephanie Plum novel is called Twelve Sharp, but it's a dull effort indeed.This novel feels like all the others she's done--the same cast of characters, nothing more than variations on the same bounty hunter plot and sharp-tongued dialog that you've read before.Evanovich churns out books like a sausage maker. There is no art involved, just the same recipe that yields the same result.Twelve Sharp is best avoided. Maybe Evanovich will do more than lightly life her writing fingers next time around. A better choice is to avoid her novels for better written fare available from other novelists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, BUT...","review":"Eh...I read this on my mom's referral and while it was entertaining and fast-paced, I wasn't enthralled by it. As I think about it, there were some fun characters and they were the high point (Lula and Ranger, specifically). I think my major issue with this book was Stephanie! I know everyone loves her, but I thought she was annoying and kind of pretentious. It was a fun romp through the underbelly of Jersey's \\"FTAs\\" as Plum calls them, but I probably won't be reading any other Evanovich books...but I see why people like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Phoned In","review":"I have anticipated this book for months. Start reading and Stephanie is a bounty hunter again. What happened to working for Ranger at the end of the last book?

I agree with other reviewers that there were no LOL moments and it seemed to be formulaic. I was so disappointed in Ranger's portrayal in this book. Where was the man of mystery? The classy, mysterious, elusive man? He was written like his character in the first novel... street. And this copycat Ranger! Puhleese! He studies Ranger w/o Ranger knowing, Ranger admits he's good and he comes off in the end reminding me of Albert Kloughn. BTW, where were Valerie and Albert? The book felt forced to me, not many details, no character growth... Yawn. I'll still be \\"Team Ranger\\" and will try to block this book out of my fantasies.

There was not much mystery, the comedy seemed contrived (the job applicants) and stale (the rehearsal) and I agree with a previous reviewer, it is time Stephanie grew up and made a decision about her love life. I like Sally Sweet and I love Lula, but the only place any of these people seem to go on a daily basis is the shopping mall, Vinnie's office, to the Plum's for dinner, or the funeral home, which is becoming timeworn. I wonder if the author isn't spreading herself too thin. I get the impression that she is tired of Stephanie Plum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twelve Sharp","review":"Evanovich delivers another hit.

The usual laugh out loud read. Like most Plum fans feel, Ranger is hot, and loved getting closer to his secrets. My sister suggested I listen to the Plum series in my car, as I have a long drive and heavy traffic every day. I'm sure other drives think I'm loony, laughing my head off in my car!

My only complaint is that it was over much too soon. I need at least 450 pages if you're going to make us wait so long Janet. Several laugh out loud moments, this book (like all of them) is hilarious. I'm sure the people on my commuter bus thought I was nuts. I do agree with some of the other comments that the Ranger/Joe thing MUST be resolved in the next book, it's gone on long enough. I personally think Steph should get her rocks off one last time with Ranger and then commit to Joe. May Joe could find out about it later which could make for interesting reading. The bit on Lula and Tank was great. I missed Valerie and Albert though. Don't keep us waiting so long for 13 Janet, I beg you.

It is a light hearted and fun read. I am exploring Evanovich books now having enjoyed this one so much. However, I want to take them in my Kindle and again, the price is higher than the paperback. This is just silly. Would I suggest that anyone buy an e-reader? Nope! I am so very disappointed. I can almost see the same price but higher when we can't even share the silly book with a friend. No indeed. I will check the bargain bins. Never mind Kindle books."},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"OK - maybe I have read them too fast?? I just started reading this series and have read up through 9 all the way. Was so disappointed with 10, 11, and 12 that I sent them back and requested a refund. Maybe I'm the dumb one since I kept reading them who knows... I read them in the span of a week and a 1/2 and maybe I should have put more time between the books maybe so I didn't lose interest? I don't know. This one was just ..... irritating is the only word I can come up with. OMG why is she letting another man feel her up? Why is someone with a missing child in the frame of mind to WANT to feel someone up? Why is someone that is constantly shot at afraid to carry a gun? Why has Stephanie NOT figured out she might want a cheap junk car for work and a nice car for when she isn't working so her nice cars quit getting blown up? Lula is SO SO SO SO annoying! If the bond office hired Melvin what do they need Lula for?? I have stopped reading the series for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve Sharp","review":"I really, really, really love the Stephanie Plum series. And I love Janet's other series as well. I really disliked this book. I felt the whole time I was reading it that Janet is just pushing out another book because we fans are waiting for more.I did not find the characters to be very likable and was getting really tired of Ranger putting his hands under Stephanie's shirt every time he got with in 20 feet of her. Maybe it is time Stephanie stops mooning over a guy that she knows is not going to commit or stop stringing Joe along.I was really saddened that all they could think about was sex when a little girl was in such danger.Maybe if Janet can't do better than this, and I really am hoping that she can, it is time to end the seies.

I think Ranger was weak/not on his game, Stephanie is getting too old to not change/make a decision about Joe/Ranger, and, for goodness sake, Rex cannot still be alive. All of the pages spent on interviewing the new candidates for bounty hunter were not funny at all.There needs to be some more character development or at least progress in Stephanie's character development.It felt like a ghost writer just took the \\"Evanovich Formula\\" and wrote this from an outline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Plum Good Fun!!","review":"Stephanie is at it again! Blowing up cars, confused between two men, funeral parlor mayhem and don't forget the donuts!In this latest installment you find Stephanie help track the kidnapped daughter of Ranger.

Are these books being written as a set format and Janet just changes a few things in each book? It was NOT lol it wasn't even funny! The Grandma gag is getting too old and used in every book! Her mother and father started to have some interest now mom is back on the bottle? 222 pages to even mention her sister???

I laughed so hard that my husband thought I was choking! As usual, Stephanie and Lula encounter one problem after another and their collective problem solving skills would give the Three Stoogies material for an endless supply of scripts. I cannot recommend this series enough whether you are male, female, little green men, or whatever. Janet Evanovich has compiled such an elcetic group of characters that you cannot help but be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Evanovich books","review":"I luv her books especially this one about stephanie the bounty hunter. all her other books are great. easy read but with a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Plum fan","review":"I am a huge Plum fan and eagerly await the new release each June, but I was really disappointed this time. It was an ok book, but not up to Janet's usual standards. Where were the laugh out loud until you cry moments? Where were the other story lines that go on within the story as in previous books? The characters of Ranger and Morelli didnt even seem like they were written by Janet, in fact alot of the book didnt have the Janet \\"feel\\". It seemed to me Janet was bored and just wanted to put something out there. I will buy 13 when it comes out and keep my fingers crossed that her writers block or boredom is gone by then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"I enjoyed this ride out with the New Jersey gang.

I only laughed out loud once. Usually I laugh out loud once per chapter. I have read and reread all of her books, I'm a huge fan. Don't get me wrong, this book was still great, but it could have been better. The Ranger/Morelli triangle is getting very juicy. Grandma Mazur's storyline is beyond repetative and needs a new direction. There was only one FTA aprehension by Steph in this one, that was a disappointment, how is she paying her bills? Joyce finds her way into the book more often in this one, I like her added in for dramatic tension.Overall a great book, but not the best plum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Crude","review":"I usually enjoy listening to a Stephanie Plum story on CD while I am driving around town.

I enjoyed the Plum Lovin' story I got as well but Twelve Sharp was just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve Sharp","review":"The book just wasn't up to the usual fun and laughs. It read fast but there really wasn't much going on. No car explosions, no big laughs with grandma or Lula, no really funny take down captures. The story did give a lot more background info on Ranger and his life which was nice. Stephanie usually has dumb luck on her side, this story had her trying to think and analyze her way around. The dumb luck finds and experiences worked much better. The book was alright but not anywhere near as good as the rest.

Lula's character is funny in this novel and she gets most of the laughs, Ranger is \\"out of character\\" but I think this was intended, Morelli isn't a big focus this time around. This novel is exactly what I would expect from book number twelve. PS: Hot Six is my personal favThis is a quick read for Plum lovers and good summer beach read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Rangers?","review":"Once again, the life of bounty hunter Stephanie Plum becomes complicated, both seriously and comicly. This series is very lighthearted, with oddball characters practically rolling off the pages, and the laughs just rolling out of the reader's mouth. The author's comic timing and sense of humorous wordplay are absolutely perfect. There is a plot, of course, but I really don't think that anyone cares about the plot as long as they can read about Stephanie's misadventures and her supporting cast of loonies. I enjoy every one of these books, and they all end too soon for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun and easy read....","review":"I really enjoyed this book, however I don't think it was as good as some of her others, I still enjoyed it.

There's a crazy person out there who wants to take on Ranger's life. He's already kidnapped his daughter and next on the list is Stephanie. For comic relief we have a group of bounty hunter prospects that make Lulu and Stephanie look like expert and a band featuring Sally Sweet, Lulu and Grandma Mazur. Although I'm getting a little tired of the love triangle, and find Stephanie's indecision annoying, I do really enjoy seeing the way Morelli and Ranger work together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Second Album by LSF","review":"The guys have turned in a great follow up to their debut album on Rocketstar.

If you are a fan of Jimmy Eat World, you will enjoy the sound of Long Since Forgotten.

This is definitely challenging and had me sweating.The abs section is even more challenging. The work on the incline is very advanced, although there are beginner modifications you can make. This is a workout that I will have to grow into.In order to do all of the exercises as demonstrated, you will need the new firm box or a step that adjusts to 14\\" and an incline.

However, I think the babies are my least favorite. Europe has babies that have moveable arms and legs, the calico critters version only has moveable heads -so one baby will always be crawling and one will always be sitting. I think these are the least 'imaginative' of the calico critters line... Also, the pic on this item might mislead you to think the basket of apples of comes with- but you will only receive the sheep babies.As for the Calico critter line, pay a little more for a full family and some of the lovely furniture sets. They have beautiful detail and the clothing on the families is very nice.

I could've gone back and read it all from the beginning again, but the author wrote this book tackily and I was just too lost to go and retreive anything.When I read Donovan's section, it was comprehensible. I actually enjoyed reading his section, but the section that combined Campbell and Donovan was so boring. I just could not finish reading this book. This read was an awful recommendation.

I considered a similar rack from Topeak that is nearly double the price. Comparatively, the Swagman rack is a terrific value. I'm extremely satisfied with its quality.

Very simple design and the price is very reasonable. With 2 of them, I was able to create much needed space in the garage. I installed it in a space with a somewhat low ceiling.

This does not affect it's perfomance in any way, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better directions needed","review":"I was very pleased with this purchase. But the lack of good directions for assembly are needed. The thing that got me confused, was the fact that both threaded ends are directional. One is reverse threaded, so when you ratchet the pole snug, and turn the pole clockwise the ends expand.I wouldn't put heavy bikes on the top, and the manufacturer does recommend a weight limit for both bikes. It sure helps clear up some floor space. Give yourself 10 to 12 inches from the wall and your good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Affordable Way to Store Your Bikes...","review":"I am very pleased with this bike holder. The shipping was quick, and it's free! This is the perfect space saver for a small area. It was very easy to install; it took maybe 10 minutes. You just turn the pole and it secures itself to the ceiling and the floor, screw on the bike rests and you're done! No screws are necessary though the rack does have holes for them should you choose to attach it that way. We have two bikes on it and there's no problem with the weight. If you bump it the bikes will swivel a bit so there is a little give in it. The one piece of advice that I could give is to make sure that you are hitting a beam in the ceiling before you screw it in tightly. We almost made a hole in the ceiling before we checked. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"Don't buy this hangar for anything other than sheets and towels. The product is very poorly designed, and poorly constructed. First of all, you cannot crank the the top and bottom screws tight enough to secure the rack, between the floor and ceiling, without bending the pole. In addition the pole comes in two sections with two differenct diameters - a small diameter chrome plated section that telescopes inside of a larger diameter painted piece, but the attachment cleats on the hangars can only be tightened over the larger diameter section, making the top section unusable. The weight of my bike was enough to rip the hangar off the chrome section, causing it to fall to the floor, even though I cranked the knob as tight as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only holds ONE bike","review":"All of the glowing reviews of this product would be accurate except for one thing - the hooks will not clamp onto one half of the pole. So effectively, this is a 1 bike hanger unless you have tiny bikes. The pole has two sections, a thick tube for one half, and a significantly thinner tube for the other half. The clamps will not even come close to holding on the thinner half. Both the pictures on this site, and the diagrams in the instructions show that you can clamp onto both halves, but this is NOT so. This issue is mentioned in one of the other reviews as well, and appears to be a design flaw rather than a manufacturing problem with the one I received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly","review":"I was so excited to find this rack on amazon.

We love the bright and childlike graphics, and the general story line, it is easy to read and easy to understand. However, before my children learned to read and I was still reading to them I would always omit the line on page 3 that goes as follows...\\"And, sometimes he caught a hard smack across his backside when he was late for dinner!.\\" I find this line terribly offensive and completly out of context to the rest of the story...We have actually blacked it out, now that the children are reading their own books.

My personal favorite is Meliveo's Dolorida, which captures the mood of the word \\"fugitive\\" through its percussion, clapping, and haunting vocals. The album was also my introduction to Nina Pastori, Chonchi Heredia, and Chano Lobato, whom I enjoyed immensely.

I read the info on the amazon site and found(to my surprise) not returnable. So I emailed CiTi electronics thru amazon and they said they would replace. Well here it is 3 weeks and still no new switch. I made a mistake it was 2 weeks emailed them back it was in the mail next day. I have the new one as of yesterday have not been able to test yet but it would be very unlikely to get two dysfunctional switches. The supplier cannot tell if a product is defective when it is in a box. So good turn around and if all works well well re rate the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cheap wireless controller","review":"Saved big over the $100 mild 2 wild exhaust controller.

This unit works every time. Easy instructions and the wires are long enough that you can go to the various hook up points without adding more wire. Super value.

But the end left me deeply concerned. I suspect Moore does not intend to be harmful, but he closes his book by dabbling with destructive spiritual powers.

The rows don't run parallel to each other (they're sort of hexagon shaped), and the numbers are tiny and the same color as the plastic making them nearly impossible to see. I gave up and got rid of it. This will completely frustrate you and your child...games are supposed to be fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel like I missed something","review":"While the shots in this movie where quite beautiful and peaceful, I've gotta say the movie was on the whole rather dull and uninspiring. There is quite a juxtaposition between the totally uninteresting quest of the main character and all his bumbling, and the beautiful simplicity of the life continuing on around him (best expressed in his motorcycle ride with the doctor), however either I missed some subtlety of this juxtaposition or I just found it a bit boring and entirely undeserving of 2 hours of cinematic treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiarostami's Finest?","review":"This film may be the finest of Kiarostami's great output.

I cannot recommend it too highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not satisfied and It Doesn't Register...","review":"It's too much a puzzle. Not much of poetry, in fact rather prosaic. Sorry I am not very satisfied and it doesn't really register save and except that it's quite a puzzle and, it's long. Perhaps it has the wrong cast, the hero did not impress at all, nor was the countryside nor village scenes... I tried to but haven't finished the second viewing, it's quite an effort. I have high esteem for Iranian films, and I enjoy \\"The White Balloon\\" so much and also another film about broken shoes where children don't have shoes for school... They are so wonderful, but I'm afraid, no, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transfer does NOT do justice to the exquisite photography and compositions.","review":"I'm not going to talk about this film's [grand] quality per se. Just want to let everyone know that the astounding, painterly photography of this film isn't rendered correctly by DVD standards because of a VERY noticeable motion blur problem in the transfer.I know a little motion blur is to be expected in DVD and that in some TVs is more noticeable than in others, but this DVD goes beyond the acceptable norm.Some of the most beautiful sequences (like the motorcycle trip) do suffer a lot from this, sadly.Please, be warned about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"This film is about the appreciation of life at its simplest. The cinematography is beautiful; great job capturing a civilization uncluttered and spiritual. However, the protagonist, whom we follow exclusively throughout the film, is a bore, and the plot is simple and mundane. The symbolic juxtapostion of the cell phone against the spiritual and uncluttered civilization doesn't strike the chord Kiarostami intends. There is little story here. In summary: very good cinematography, beautiful setting, extrememely boring protagonist, contrived symbolism, little story. Your choice. I personally liked the Iranian films \\"Children of Heaven\\" and \\"The Color of Paradise\\" much more. This one will just put you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"visually aesthetic","review":"i just finished watching this movie, and after it ended there was a period of about 10 minutes when i was trying to decide what the heck just happened. i went into the film cold, so i had no idea what to expect. throughout it i thought i caught several subtle allusions to camus and kafka, but that might just be me. after collecting my thoughts, i will say the primary value of the film is the photography. the location is beautiful, and the cinematography was so adept i felt like i was in that village waiting along side the frustrated protagonist. that being said, the plot is full of needlessly obscure and mysterious deviations. simplify, man. but if you pay attention and don't get bogged down by the contrived complexities, the message is loud and clear. it is a long and subtle film that will scare away those movie-goers with the attention span of a manic goldfish, thank you hollywood, but for me, the visual aesthetics made it worth the while."},{"rating":"2","title":"shades of blue (plural)","review":"These dishes are really pretty.

As a Lithium Ion battery, it's (IMO) supposed to last for a certain number of \\"full charges\\", not build up a memory when I charge it even though it's only half discharged. But this battery either builds up a memory or lasts for a ridiculously small number of full charges. After using it for a few months, it now lasts barely 36 hours on standby on a full charge. If I use it at all, it must be recharged every night. This is very poor compared to the battery that came with my phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Yoga Video","review":"I am in the minority, but I did not care for this yoga workout. I found the cueing confusing and uneven. The instructor does not state what yoga pose we are doing either which would be helpful. She never says- this is the triangle pose or warrior I. There is inadequate time spent in the stretches and the transitioning is rocky.I enjoy many other Firm workouts but this one was a dud. I would recommend Rodney Yee Yoga DVD's or David Swenson and/or Baron Baptiste. You would get a more valuable Yoga Stretch workout and Yoga knowledge from these instructors rather than the Firm's take on Yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crescent Wrench","review":"I own several Crescent wrenches of larger sizes.

The old one had tape only for the first few feet, then cord. I liked the old one, yet this one is so much better--lighter, retracts smoothly and quietly. Got it for our new 50# rescue pup, and the only trouble is with it being fairly small, as other reviewers mentioned it is barely big enough for my hands.

Good product though, I'd get it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for small dogs","review":"I bought this size because I read some reviews about the handle being too small and thought it might be helfpul for my husband to have a larger handle.

This was too much for my dog and I ended up needing to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, until it broke","review":"I haven't tested this against the corded version, but in concept replacing cord with tape makes sense.

My only regret is that there aren't a dozen more of her novels already on the shelf, waiting for me to devour them. Seldom does one find a modern women's fiction writer who tells a story with such humor, perception and literate grace. Liane Moriarty's appeal spans continents and generations of readers; my 28-year-old daughter loves them as much as I do. I am anxiously awaiting her next novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Sisters and Wishes!","review":"Beginning with a unique birthday celebration and lasting throughout the year we come to know the inner workings of these triplets and their desires. This was a light hearted read which did touch on some weighty subjects. I imagine that if Frank Capra were alive today he would make a wonderful movie based on this family tale. I look forward to reading more by this author in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"A simple, yet fun read about three sisters who are triplets. The book goes into the lives of each sister, their career choices and relationships. The book explores in a light-hearted manner just how much their life decisions where impacted by the relationship with their siblings. For example, one sister thought their \\"opinions\\" were one and the same and she couldn't disagree with one of her sisters. She didn't have \\"her\\" opinion it was always \\"their\\" opinion.To add to the crazy thinking was the fact that they were the product of two teenagers who by the time their mother realized she was pregnant was already broken up with the father. However, this happened at a time when good Catholic girls who got pregnant married the father of her child or in this case children!Three Wishes had me laughing and crying as I read about life as a triplet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read.","review":"After reading What Alice Forgot and really enjoying it, I decided to give Liane Moriarty Three Wishes a shot. It's an easy entertaning read. I'd recommend to friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"I love chick lit and I loved this book in particular. It's a very easy and entertaining read. Growing up in a household of three siblings I could definitely relate and made our family seem much more normal.

Another favorite of hers? \\"What Alice Forgot\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Liane Moriarty!","review":"Liane Moriarty is one of my favorite authors, and this book did not disappoint. It certainly is an enjoyable read. As usual, her character development is wonderful, full of humor and strong female personalities. I loved the idea of the story revolving around the triplet girls. Occasionally throughout the book Ms. Moriarty would add an outside observer's impression of the girls upon seeing them together. I thought this was clever to have this new perspective thrown in every once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique stories, great characters!","review":"Although these three sisters can be as different as night and day, the bond between these triplets is unbreakable. Once again Liane Moriarty has come up with a unique story and characters that seem so real that after you finish the book you find yourself wondering what they're up to when you wake up the next day. As always Liane incorporates one dark character or issue in her books, but this time it doesn't take up as much space as others. I love Liane's dry and unexpected sense of humor and often find myself blurting out with an unexpected laugh which can be embarrassing if I'm reading in a coffee shop or if I'm in a room with my kids who already think I'm a little strange. I absolutely cannot wait for her next book to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read, might be a good movie someday!","review":"As a mother of multiples myself I really enjoyed reading the antics of triplets, two of which are twins and look alike, think alike, even as adults! Sprinkled in the story are vignettes of outsiders describing their impressions of the triplets throughout their lives. Its a fun, fast read. And I could imagine this story being turned into a rolicking film, much like characters in Something Borrowed. I'd like to read more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam always makes things straightforward and simple","review":"As always, he keeps its straightforward and simple...great beginner's primer to get you started with iPhoto.

There's no comparison. This book will teach you the mechanics of how to use iPhoto, but not much more than that.

Not a scholar or an historian, I am simply a person who has an unquenchable thirst for stories about this time period. I liked the chronological format of the book, and I was particularly interested in the growing nature of legality over issues like land transfers, inheritance and marriage. If I could meet the authors I would like to ask them about the process they used to research this book, and if they were able to actually look at some of the original documents they report from. The notes and bibliography are fascinating, and when I next have a chance to visit the U of M's library, I will look up some of the titles. I would like to thank the authors for this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family in the Dark Ages","review":"An excellent work about a time about which little is really known. Frances and Joseph Gies manage to make fascinating what was a grim time for everybody. The book describes the form marriage had in different periods of the middle ages and what family life was like, complete with scandals and the biographies of several people of the time to provide background. The pervasive influence of the Catholic Church and what it meant at a time when it was the only international Law is shown in detail. The hardship both noble and peasant endured, the uncertainty of life and the bizarre ways(to us)families organized themselves to survive are clearly shown to provide us with a window into the times.The contracts aging parents wrote with their children surprised me more than learning how short-lived noble dynasties were.

The picture either stretched or has a black bar. The manual is NOT helpful at all. Having pictures displayed full screen without distortion - does this sound like a over-demand? I don't need the mp3 and video playback. BTW mp3 is OK but it can't play the video file taken by my Canon SD300. Besides, the picture looks much darker than that in computer and you have to adjust the brightness to the MAX to get a barely acceptable result.

We have gone through six paperback copies (each insisted on having his own); my boys shared it with everyone they saw, and they even slept with it! They love the clever and colorful pictures, and the short verses describing each instrument capture each instruments' special sound and qualities better than any other children's book I have seen.

This book is the best choice for introducing kids to classical music and will give them graphic insight into the joy of an evening with an orchestra. The conductor's role is even explained and each orchestra instrument is clearly identified (without skewing all the attention to strings). The author's descriptions of the sounds from each instrument are delightfully descriptive. The focus floats from timpani to woodwinds and brass.

I had to return them all. If the opening on your vents is more like 7 inches, go ahead and order them, but be sure to measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't let the cover fool you","review":"I was looking for a newer version of this book.

I'm not sure if this was intended to be a supplement to the book or a summary of the book. I was looking for the book, not knowing what it looked like; therefore, I thought since this one had the same name and publication company, it was what we needed. After reading the book and noticing the references to pages and tables that weren't in the book, further investigation was taken. If you are looking for the book in order to study for a licensing exam, this is not the one. In addition, it was poorly written, hard to follow, and contained many misspelled words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin in information.","review":"I bought this \\"book\\" to use it as a reference for my PE exam.

I used it primarily during commute - on some packed dirt trail, with fair amount of muddy parts, some more rocky areas, as well as roads. The handling is great off-road and rolling is still fairly good on-road (as well as could be expected from the 35 mm tire). Overall highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"At first it was ok.

Aside from the new look, I found this new dvd to belacking. The music is ok but the stories (as far as these stories go)seemed sub-par.

It treats all the elements of a graduate course in analysis thoroughly. One of the few books that actually goes through construction of the real number system (in Chapter 1) and products of infinitely many measure spaces (in Chapter 6). There is plenty material to choose from, and all the standard topics are covered. In a very few cases notation is a bit cumbersome (or obsolete), but this is no big problem.

This CD printer cooperates very well with my office iMac, and produces very high quality inkjet print (text) and very acceptable photographic images. A fact of life with printers of this type is limited ink life. I've determined I can print 57 full-color, 100 percent coverage CDs with one ink cartridge. Of course, many more CDs can be printed with simple text-only printing. (Keep in mind the fact that this is just a CD printer. Primera also makes an integrated CD duplicator/printer for those facilities lacking a stand-alone CD duplicator.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD/DVD printer","review":"I have been using a Primera printer now for over 5 years and it always performs admirably,The resolution of fine print, colour and detail is excellent.

So in a nutshell what I got was a 90 page book which didn't seem to explain things more than other books that I already had.

Now back off!\\" From the reviews I expected something good, but when I got it in the mail this morning I was really happily surprised. I got compliments all day at work and people kept asking if it was real. The best things about this ring are that it's low profile so it doesn't get stuck on everything, it is comfortable to wear, and it looks real!

Unlike the introspective character introduced in the beginning, Sarah, evolves into a somewhat ditzy, shallow character.

Well, I'm sorry Corelle, but this product looks like a joke, and your sorry attempt at explaining it away would be comical if it weren't so frustrating. And stoneware cups? Are you kidding? If I wanted stoneware, I would have shopped for and purchased stoneware. This is pathetic, and Corelle should be ashamed to put this product on the shelf.

I used this book as well as the Fitzgerald book primarily for study, completing each book in it's entirety. I found this book to be frustrating, detail oriented, and incorrect in certain places (I used the 3rd. edition, not the 2nd.). On each chapter, I added up my incorrect answers. I scored between 64%-81%, never actually achieving the recommended 85%. This book did nothing but make me unsure of myself and create a lot of unnecessary anxiety (I graduated with a 3.95- I should never have been worried!) And the CD- forget it! I never scored higher than a 50% on any practice test. My advice? Fitzgerald's book is awesome as well as her CD's. Amelie Hollier (APEA) also has great stuff.

As such it lacks the seriousness and academic excellence that much of modern, evangelical dictionaries have. It squeezes 700 topics into 700 pages, which means that the articles are too short for being on ethical issues, which usually are controversial with many opinions and arguments. Hence the discussion is absent and they are more of brief descriptions of what the author thinks. It would have been better with 100 topics on 700 pages.

This puzzle was fabulous. We did notice that the metallic finish differed at different angles, but we actually found that helpful as it added another dimension of information to solving the puzzle. We had no problems at all with incorrectly cut pieces or finish coming off (as mentioned in another review). We found the puzzle educational with respect to longitude/latitude markings, as well as aesthetically beautiful.

There have been many poorly designed studies in this area and the author calls attention to them. I am dumbfounded by previous reviewers attempt to accuse this psychologist as someone trying to undermine psychology. For scientists: questioning one and anothers' research methods is part of the profession. This is how knowledge advances. The only insults to common sense I see are the studies that attempt to define aggressive behavior as popping a balloon, or thinking about violence after seeing violent movies.Good science can and should stand up to scrutiny. The fact is, psychology has been guilty of some bad science."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Aggressive Attack on Research and Scholarship","review":"Media Violence and Its Effect on Aggression is a very peculiar book.

Thorsson obviously knows his stuff and has a very readable style. The problem, however, is that Thorsson seemed to be making a concious effort not to repeat things that he has covered in his other books. Since this book is an entry in the World Magic Series, though, it seems like it should have been more of a general overview than it was. An introduction even. Instead, it went off in several different directions. The hex signs of the Pennsylvania Dutch, for instance, seemed a bit out of place. There are many useful things in this book, but it should not be used as an introduction to Northern Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"It's an excellent introduction.

I installed the countertop water filter, no problem, let the water run for 15 minutes before drinking a glass. Water looks very clean in the glass, I was pleased, and here comes the bomb; the odor isn't odorless, chlorine odor is so pronounced it is as strong as the tap water.Twenty four hours later, same, chlorine odor, it reminded me of a swimming pool odor, you get the picture. I have just processed a return to Amazon, back to Brita till I find the right countertop water filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I had the paragon filter in the past and LOVED it. Don't be fooled...THIS IS NOT THE SAME! AT ALL! I have had it for a week now, waited a while before writing this review because I was hoping the taste would change. It has NOT. It tastes EXACTLY like drinking from the HOSE OUTSIDE! Everyone that has tried it has said the same thing without being prompted. It does look nice, and the pressure is amazing. It was super easy to install. But who cares, if it tastes worse than the water pre-filtered! I am soo unhappy. I seriously doubt it filters all it claims to. The instruction pamphlet was a JOKE. The product box it came in was falling apart. Not labeled or anything. That should have been the red flag. I fully plan on returning this filter. I'll wait to get a Paragon. Really thought this was going to be similar, but no way. It's so gross!! The aftertaste is the worst. No one wants to drink it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I was not impressed with this unit. I've been using PUR and Brita filters and decided to go with a counter top model instead. But this unit added a more unpleasant flavor to the water than what it removed.

I really love this water filter.","review":"I am so glad I chose the Chrome Countertop Water Filter. First, it is very nice looking - sleek and does not take up a lot of space.

The novel itself is interesting, with a lot of sexual exploits by the protagonist. Pearl S. Buck called it the \\"greatest physical love novel\\" of China. Still you might be better off reading the condensed version of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The French Passion","review":"I have read this book many times. It is set during the French Revolution, and is very similar in style to the Scarlet Pimpernel, etc. It is historically accurate, and very emotionally involving. I don't usually read romance novels, but this one is an exception. I always enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true biography of a humanitarian","review":"Border Angel was written by newspaper reporter Bill Starr. He knew his subject Frank Ferree, and the situation in which Frank Ferree lived. Frank was a humanitarian amd a humble man. He was a male, non-denominational \\"Mother Teresa\\" type who ministered to the needs (mostly the practical food, housing, job and health needs) of thousands of the poor in Cameron County, Texas and adjoining Mexico. He circulated freely with the poorest of the poor as well as presidents and statesmen of his time. This is a truly uplifting story that deserves a good read. It may change your life for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"All the way through this book, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.On the whole, I think the book could have been stronger. We never really got to see the early parts of the marriage which was supposedly so great. Stephen's descent into madness was a little unbelievable, and the ending was too contrived.HOWEVER. It held my attention, and I liked it in spite of its flaws. I think this is because the main character was believable, and her transformation was also believable.On the whole, excellent mind candy, recommended for a lazy afternoon or a long plane trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better","review":"Quite simply, I expected a better documentary based on the other reviews for this DVD; I expected better production quality and something at least worthwhile with regard to UFOlogy. I didn't see it in this DVD. First of all, the naration is terrible... the guy continues to repeat himself. It sounds like it was written by Seventh Grader trying to make sure his term paper has the requisite amount of words. The video is mostly stock video... and most of that isn't even from images in the 1970s. There are no re-enactments; a few drawings and a video of one abuctee speaking at some type of forum (this was the only thing that did make this worth watching). There is another DVD available here on Amazon about the various UFO incidents in 1973... I plan to purchase that one and compare the two... but for now, I'm feeling like I shouldn't have wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coincidence--or not?","review":"1973 was a big year for UFO activity--who knew?!

It did not grasp my attention nor did I find it to be worth my time. The author spent too much time on the sexual aspect of the story and forgot all about the charms usually found in romance books. I would not recommand this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dumb blonde!!","review":"The main character, Aelvina, was a very stupid woman. I never read a book with a character who did the complete opposite of everything that was asked of her. She put herself and everyone else in constant troubled and dangerous situations. I would have ended this story with her being beheaded for disobeying the king's orders. So much for happy endings. I truly couldn't believe Patricia Rice wrote such a bad novel until I noticed this was one of her first books. Pass this one by. It's too long and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Dishes","review":"Lenox Holiday Gatherings dishes are absolutely beautiful. I had been wanting to get a set of Christmas dishes for years, but had never found quite the right ones. I wanted some that were casual enough for every day and yet dressy enough for company. I also wanted some that were dishwasher safe. These were perfect for both reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, Unique set","review":"Amazon, in its wisdom, recommended these dishes because I had ordered a book on the Outer Banks. While I normally don't go for theme-type dishes, I got these in preparation for vacation, and to serve as a happy memory afterwards. While I've only had them for a week or so, I'm sure the Corelle will live up to its reputation, wearing well and lasting. I did wonder about one thing before ordering them though - none of the pictures show the center of either the bowl or the saucer. The saucer (as I'd expected) has a plain center. Surprisingly, the bowl does also. Other than the blue edge, the bowl is plain; I would have expected to see a lighthouse when I finished my cereal :) I know I had wondered, since none of the pictures showed the center, and none of the reviews mentioned it, so I thought I would. I'm expecting these dishes to last a long time, and bring back many happy memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelle plates","review":"Great buy. Corelle makes great products.

This book best answered my quest. Not only is the vocabulary simple and to the point, it is highly entertaining and descriptive. All periods of history are covered, even the Mormon and Mennonite colonies as well as the Chinese who went to Chihuahua are covered. Now I know what happened in the years from 1740 to 1900 as my ancestors evolved into the mix. It is worth buying! add"},{"rating":"2","title":"I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!","review":"This was my first Pelecanos book, and I am fairly new to the modern crime genre. I've read Dennis Lehane and have enjoyed all his books. When I saw that he was a Pelecanos fan, that's what drew my interest. Not only did this book entertain and keep me guessing, but I found myself re-evaluating my own attitudes about discrimmination and stereotypes that plagued the complex character of Terry Quinn in the book. It matters not to me what genre I'm reading, if it makes me rethink my own attitudes and in the process I learn something, I consider it a \\"great\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"Not much of a mystery - more like a sociological treatise masquarading as a mystery. Race is on center stage in this book, but only in a slipshod way. Basically, the black characters are drawn as multi-dimensional human beings, while most of the white characters are stock villians. As such, it starts to remind you of Blaxploitation literature of the '70s. As a resident of DC, I was also irritated by the endless moaning over how the city has changed in recent years, as though its a sin to open a decent restaurant downtown! All in all it was a decent read, but I won't be coming back for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"right as rain","review":"i have read 160 pages and still am not compelled to continue this book to the end. the plot is boring and predictable . it does not pull you forward, wondering what happens next. the writing is very good, no question about that; but it proceeds too slowly and has not grabbed my interest. i will read lahaine, colben, crais, and connelly before coming back to pelecanos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Boring","review":"Dull slow story, dull characters. I'd read Walter Mosley over this Pelecanos when it comes to stories involving black characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version sucks","review":"I like Pelecanos and I like reading on my Kindle, but I do not recommend the Kindle version of this book at all. Whatever software was used to convert it could not distinguish dashes from hyphens. Thus a word like cut-off is written cut--off, with a hyphen. Words that came at the end of sentences and shouldn't be hypenated at all are written with a dash in the mid--dle. This makes for very annoying reading. Buy the book if this is the best they can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple","review":"Terribly simplistic book. The only redeeming qualities are that it is a very fast read and it is always interesting to read books based in DC which do not involve politics. The story was weak and simplistic and the characters were right out of a cereal box. If only I could get/understand all of the music references, maybe that would have made the book more solid. In my opinion, find a different crime novel to read, maybe even another Pelecanos book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Reading the reviews I was convinced this would be a good stoy. Boy was I wrong. BORING BORING BORING. There was alot of potential here the characters were pretty good. There was nothing to keep you turning the pages.

It never did!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard","review":"Right as Rain is more a crafted novel than nurtured one. It has all the 'right' characters with strengths and foibles; settings are real enough, but painted with a heavy brush; dialog drives story, but is too often counter cop, buddy movie cant; plot is well thought out, but predictable in hindsight. The novel is not comfortable with itself and works too hard at being screen worthy. It did not send me back to the shelf for another from Mr. Pelecanos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best travel guide for the high southwest.","review":"This is probably the best travel guide to the High Southwest in existence. Not overburdoned with factual data like most travel guides, this book provides plenty of vital information about food, lodging, shopping etc, while providing fascinating first-person narratives of experiencing the southwest, as well as background information such as geological and historical information that bring enrichment to anyone's travel experience. As an experienced traveler to the High Southwest who could perhaps write my own book on the subject, this book is both my constant reference and fun reading whenever I visit the area."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guide for the Four Corners region","review":"This is a fantastic guide to various places in the Four Corners area. I appreciate its detailed descriptions and actual opinions of the author, which sets it apart from many guidebooks. He also describes a lot of history of the region. All of these things, along with the author's writing style, make this a book I like to read even when I'm not planning or on a trip.We used this book (in its previous edition) along with Sandra Hinchman's \\"Hiking the SouthWest's Canyon Country\\" for a 9-day trip to Bryce/Capitol Reef/North Rim of the Grand Canyon a couple of years ago. Between these two books, we not only figured out what we wanted to see, but also where to camp/stay and hike (the latter from Hinchman's book mostly).We've also used this guide when visiting Mesa Verde and most recently for a trip to Santa Fe and environs last month.

The visual portion works really well but we have a two story home and we seem to get quite a bit of interference from upstairs to downstairs. My only complaint is that there is no way to adjust the audio on the monitors so that the audio is clear. We get a lot of static so we are not able to use the audio even if the visual is clear. Simple solution was to buy a seperate inexpensive baby monitor and walkie talkies which my son thinks is great! Overall this system works very well and I would definately purchase again! The monitor has 4 channel settings so you can actually add cameras to monitor other parts of the home as well i.e. the front door etc....

It chonicles from start to finish the first rolls to the most current, and the reader seeing the evolution of the car, ever changing, but somehow always staying true to what makes a Rolls Royce the finest automobile in the world, that was the brilliance of the designers and creators of Rolls at Crewe.

This is another fiction by the same writer. Kids who have no knowledge of the reality of the Pagan beliefs eat this stuff up. As all the other books like this I doubt there is a claim by the writer or publishers that it was meant to be taken literally or even seriously. Kids do though so it keeps them busy with make-believe until they grow up and remember these reads so they can become interested in the real thing. Just hopefully it won't lead to them becoming interested in the negative things that are often associated with occult matters. Sometimes kids can't seperate the differences. That is my only objection to these writings. But for the most part kids are pretty smart today and most know these types of books are nothing more than entertainment. I only am concerned about the ones who are looking to fit into something and maybe go too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!","review":"If you are a beginner and are interested in Witchcraft, then do yourself a favor and stay away from ALL of Silver Ravenwolf's books. Would you want to study from a so-called Witch that doesn't even live by the Rede? She is a hypocrite and her books prove it! She goes on and on and on about how the Rede says \\"Harm none,\\" yet she details a spell for a successful deer hunt! Wow, is hunting deer not harming it? Yes in fact the act of KILLING is indeed the act of HARMING!

Her books are completely commercialized and if you do end up practicing Wicca you will have to completely unteach yourself all the things she teaches.If you're new to Wicca and looking for a good book to get you started then I highly, highly, reccomend Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A guide for the solitary practicioner.Wicca is all about learning, and you can't find all of your answers from just one book but I can assure you that SilverRavenWolf's books will not help you if you truly wish to learn and practice Wicca."},{"rating":"1","title":"another book for my collection","review":"I found this book more entertaining than helpfull. I love to read and share books of intrest with friends and family but this book is not one I would recomend to them because of fluff, some subjects of intrest are short.

It explains in detail how to cast a circle and what spells and rituals are best for each season."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Advanced and Worth it","review":"The only problem I have with Ravenwolf is her incredibly youthful optimism; however, I find this refreshing at times because of the dry taste authors like Buckland leave in my mouth because they give you a lot of information in a formal format. Silver, however, lightens up the studies with anecdotes from her own past. I think that her books are useful as \\"workbooks\\" because she gives little exercises to practice. Yeah, it's homework but some books just don't emphasize \\"practice\\" the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, as usual for Silver!","review":"This book is great for the beginneras well as the experienced! Silver has such a way of putting things in a easy to under- stand language that anyone can follow. I reccomend any and all her books and look forward to meeting her somedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey, trite, and not worth the money","review":"I found this book to be little more than a repeat of Silver Broomstick. There was nothing in the way of new information, or new understandings. Instead, it was simply a re-hash of what had already been said before, and better the previous time. My other real problem with the book is that, if it was truly seen as \\"advanced\\" it gives people the idea that they are farther along in their studies than they are, making true self-judgement much more difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious.","review":"This book, like all of Ravenwolf's books, is utterly atrocious.I'll admit that when I first looked into this religion, all of nine years ago, I bought this book and thought it was amazing. Now that I decided to sit down and reread the books that started my religious path, I can't believe I bought into all of the ridiculous tripe that Ravenwolf writes, even if it was only for a short time. Thankfully, I realized how useless Ravenwolf's books were after less than a year into my studies.She's the worst author on Wiccan and Pagan topics you can find. Not only are most of her \\"facts\\" complete falsehoods, but she writes in such a way that it's hard to follow what she's talking about. Seriously, Ravenwolf, you're writing a book that's supposed to be educational. It's not your personal journal, meant to boost your own ego.If you want a good book on witchcraft, look into Penczak's Temple series books. Don't buy into Ravenclaw's 'fluffy-bunny' syndrome that has no basis in reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must buy a Ravenwolf book, buy this one","review":"I really can't recommend this book. I'm not sure what it tries to be about... Wiccan? Nope, it's too far from any books on Wicca to be that. Traditional Witchcraft? No, it's unlike any of those works, too!Ravenwolf skirts the line between fiction and fact. I think the public deserves a new edition of this book with footnotes and qualifiers where she explains where she comes up with stuff...For beginning Non-Wiccan Witches, this book is too Wiccan to be of any use. For Wiccans, this book is too far from Wicca to be of any use.It will leave you confused, and WORSE, if you are familiar with the craft... I can only imagine what it would do to a true beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bunk again","review":"Silver had a tendency in the beginning to write garbage. In this book she also attacks Christianity as a vial religion that will not accept your faith, and even recommends keeping your beliefs hidden from your family.

I haven't yet quite figured out why people feel they have to use little pseudonyms for supposedly non-fictions. Seems like you would stand up and be counted if it were for real, you know? There's Leek, Cunningham and others who don't hide behind 'several' names. Besides any real witch knows that you never use your witch name in public. This book isn't worth a real seekers time or money but is for those who don't have a clue about the Old Religions and who are playing at finding out. It will probably sell, to those who are young or who don't understand the elements of the writing and publishing world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stir Stir Stir","review":"Stir the stars up a bit maybe the rating people ought to take over this site or get some new help.

The first time I reviewed that CD was about 3 months ago. However I changed my mind after I heard some music from No Limit and Wu-Tang. Cash Money has absolutely no talent. You can argue all you want, but I think you will think a little different after you hear some Wu-Tang and east coast rap. That's where the real rappers and talent come from. CMR just repeats what No Limit says and they do it worse. No Limit is bad to the limit already so why get Cash Money. I like No Limit even though they are not very good is because their music is just too addicting.

B.G. was on point with every rhyme he spit, Mannie's production on here was doper than it was on Juvy's 400 Degreez, and all of the guest stars were on fire. My favorite songs are \\"Cash Money is an Army\\" (which was a BET favorite), \\"Dog A\\" with Juvenile, \\"Hard Times\\", \\"Bling Bling\\" with Big Tymers and the Hot Boys, and my favorite, \\"Made Man\\" with Big Tymers, where Baby drops a very dope verse (I kid you not).

The stainless spots easy the the pump mechanisms break or clog way to easily. The glass on this looks very nice in person and is easy to clean. The pump works great even after months of use.

It lacks all the good stuff from the first movie.So what we have is a very low budget movie. The good stuff about it, is thatsits really a family movie with almost no horror or violence or nudity or anythingelse that can offend.

If there was a suspenseful point to the story or something approaching acting - I missed it. The science behind this remake must have come out of an elementary school dropouts imagination. The cheap, unrealistic CGI of a couple of ancient reptiles was inserted to provide a moment of comic suspense. Then replaced with Native Americans that look like they've been living on the surface yet somehow are able to survive the crushing pressures and temperatures at some unknown depth. Sadly they are portrayed as stereotypic African villagers. And, hand held lasers can't be pointed 10 miles and be seen.

I suppose the James Mason version holds a special place in my heart because it was the one that really wowed me as a young boy of 11. At that age, you don't look for scientific accuracies, and not even great acting ability. The surreal scenes and cryptic props were fantastic. And I enjoyed them just as much the last time I saw the movie a couple weeks ago. The Treat Williams version had some great new twists, like the indigenous tribe. It was also very entertaining.But this version was just plain dull! The indigenous tribe in this movie could very well have been a lost tribe from the Rain Forest.

I am the kind of person that will sit through a movie to see if it gets better or to see if there is a point. This is a classic story, and the remakes are always hit and miss. When you have a good actor like Rick and an even better one with Fonda, you would hope for entertainment at the least. I did not expect a mind altering experience or a wonderful remake, but something entertaining. That is not too mauch to ask for, right? With this movie, it is way more to ask for.

At once the most idealistic and most cynical person in the play, Harold pays the steepest price for standing by his beliefs.As we watch his journey, and those of his tenants, we learn poignant lessons in the meaning of life and the choices we must all make to live in a world not of our making. Like all the great plays in world literature, this play is a mixture of comic and tragic elements that blend seamlessly into an entrancing vehicle for performance.True-to-life characters, sharp, musical dialogue, and faultless cosntruction make this the great Canadian play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get's Better in each Season","review":"Each time Rita Lance and her partner Chris Lerenzo investigates a case.it gets better. The character and guest stars are great. Great detective work and cases. I recommend this series. It lasted for 8 seasons it had to be good especially on a cable network."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saucy Early 90's Drama","review":"We've purchased all three seasons released. Unfortunately our small town didn't have a copy of the third anywhere so we had to go to Amazon and what do ya know . . . they have it in stock and ship it right away. If you like the cheesy drama of the 90's you'll love silk stalkings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge without a heart","review":"I think family court judges must lose some perspective about divorce and heartache after years of dealing out the final legal blow to a family. I understand they must be impartial, but for goodness sake, Ms Baker, show some mercy to those who don't WANT to get a divorce. Shouldn't there be some kind of incentive to keep families together? The title suggests that there is some softness in divorce (or at least in the book) but it is a very dry, legal and hopeless process for what to expect when you go through a divorce. Good for those who are going through the process without a lawyer (or with a lawyer who doesn't explain the process) but not at all what I expected based on the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"replacement filters from \\"4 My Pets\\"","review":"WARNING! the filters that this vendor is selling are NOT \\"Drinkwell Replacement Filters.\\" Instead, the vendor sends off-brand aquarium filters.

This book does have a sequel that just came out recently (Certain Girls) but I haven't finish the sequel yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put this book down!","review":"I am never disappointed by a Weiner book, the ending was a bit cheesy but other than that I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it, read it. You'll love it!","review":"5 out of 5 stars! Half way through, I couldn't put this book down, because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. It's a fun book of love and romance, heartache and self-discovery. A young woman goes from the single life to single motherhood, and finds new love along the way. Get it, read it. You'll love it! I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel, \\"Certain Girls\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beach book","review":"I truly enjoyed this book! It can be hard to find a book that is an easy, entertaining read, without being too stupid or cliche. This book fits the bill. The plot gets a bit fanciful at times, and there are some serious/sad moments, but overall it is funny, smart, and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone else catch the holes in the story?","review":"I read this book over two years ago and I recall there were some holes in the story. The one that comes to mind has to do with Cannie's lesbian mother. At one point, Cannie tells us that she met Bruce at a party when she was doing an imitation of her mother's lover. However, at another point in the story, it makes it sound like Cannie was already with Bruce when her mother came out of the closet. That sort of poor editing really annoys me! I believe there were some other holes in the story, but I can't recall them now. The lesbian mother thing is the one that stuck with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"Did I miss something? Am I the only one who thought this book was just AWFUL?I read the first 100 or maybe more, pages. BORING! I rarely stop reading a book once I start, but this, was awful.The lesbian mother, the jerk ex boyfriend- just awful, just an awful read.I can't recall the last time I did not atleast finish a book. Why do people rave about this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"The main character, Cannie is annoying with her blame-the-world outlook on life. I couldn't relate to her negativity because I never found her to be a \\"loser\\" to warrant that kind of attitude. If she was a friend of mine, I would slap her and tell her (1) SNAP OUT OF IT (2) portion control (3) stop whining (4) find a new therapist.Cannie hung on to all the bad things in her life but failed to appreciate all the good things she had right on front of her. Clich storyline. And I didn't find her funny at all either.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!!","review":"I read In Her Shoes first, and loved it. Its still one of my favorite, then I read Good In Bed, mainly because of the interesting title. I started reading it really slowly, but it didnt take long to finish it. I loved it. It is one of the best, if not the best, books I have ever read. I recommend it to everyone. I just hope it is not made into a movie. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Engaging","review":"I loved this book. It was funny and entertaining. I also read Little Earthquakes and In Her Shoes. I enjoyed those as well. However, this was my favorite of the three. Hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to relate to!","review":"A universal book for women! I just loved the parts about the insecure childhood and how it manifests itself in womanhood. We never get over those childhood traumas! This book was at times poignant and touching, at other times, cold, at other times hilarious! Jennifer, keep it up! You are very talented!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It felt as if the first half of the book was written by a different author than the second half. It was as if I was reading two different books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-conscious, narcissistic, trite, boring dribble.","review":"I hated this book and probably am not qualified to write a review because I stopped reading this piece of garbage 100 pages into it. I found Cannie to be incredibly annoying, complaining about everything and taking no responsibility for her unhappiness. Any 28 year old still complaining about their childhood deserves to be alone and miserable. I knew this book was autobiographical (and then verified it on Ms. Weiner's website), which is something that I can't stand-memoir masked as fiction. I really couldn't stand this book and cannot believe it was a bestseller. I don't really read much modern fiction and tend to stick to the classics; books like this are the reason why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Every Woman's Head","review":"Fat or thin, short or tall, blonde or brunette, every woman at some point in her life has felt insecure and dissatisfied. Jobs, men, parents...sometimes your dog is really the only person who gets you.Jennifer Weiner has perfectly tapped into this feeling. Cannie is a woman everyone can relate to--and the humor with which the author tells her story makes it impossible to put down. Buy it, read it and pass it on to all the women in your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was laughing and in horror.","review":"I loved this book, but my friend hated it. She found it too good...I found it great and I felt as if I could bond with the character's struggle with weight. There is one of the characters in this book I wanted to beat up... the character that thought up the title. Read it and find out who that character is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HA HA HA HA HA","review":"So funny. So true and what a page turner. Finally a heroine who is as smart as she is funny and one is not at all embarrased to be like...and she's an American! Laugh outloud. READ THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I didn't think this book would be as good as it was! Many sensitive issues were brought up and things we are all (if we are honest) worried about. Acceptance, self worth, and good values all show up in this book. I found this author to be a great writer, easy reading, and also full of humor. Loving yourself is what it is all about, and finding the love of your life when you weren't necessarily looking--right in front of you! I recommend this book as an excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Funny You Can't Put It Down!","review":"This novel will make you love the character so much, you feel like your experiencing everything with her. I laughed out loud with every page I read. When you start thinking about the book your reading at work, and you can't wait to rush home and read it, you know its a good book. Good in Bed is funny, and the humor is intelligent and fierce. You'll love the character so much, you want to become her friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on the sofa too!!","review":"How refreshing it was to read a book that had me laughing from beginning to end! I couldn't help but cheer Cannie on during each chapter..hoping that she'd come out swinging more as each page went by. (She did!) Ms. Weiner's debut book is one to definitely pass on to other friends to read..it was a well written book, with surprises along the way! I am looking forward to Ms. Weiner's second novel wholeheartedly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not such a loveable character....","review":"I think this had the *potential* to become a really good book about what overweight women go through every day and having the grace and strength to overcome, but it just doesn't cut it. Cannie is such a funny character, but most of the book is just ridiculous and it doesn't do her justice. Instead of overcoming her obstacles and being a stronger person for it, everything is done *for* her by her family and her \\"celebrity\\" friend. I just think this book would have been a lot better if she learned how to trust and take care of herself instead of having a doctor boyfriend and her rich friend solve everything in the end. Another thing that *really* bothers me in the book is how Cannie thinks she has the right to decide whether or not her baby's father can be part of her life just because *she* had a bad relationship with him in the end. That is not personal growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the hype","review":"-about this book at all! It was a big disappointment. It wasn't entertaining or insightful...didn't add more to my awareness of being a plus sized woman than I already know."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY has this book received so much praise??? It's awful!","review":"This book isn't even worth writing an in-depth review on, because its stupidity can be summed up in a few sentences. It's absolutely horrible! The writing is mediocre at best, the storyline is predictable, Cannie's character is shallow and whiney, and the whole scenario of, \\"girl writes screenplay, girl coincidentally meets the biggest actress in Hollywood and they become best friends, actress loves girl's screenplay, screenplay is bought and girl becomes filthy rich\\", is completely lame. Everything about \\"Good in Bed\\" was unbelievable. Don't be misled by other reviews saying the writing was \\"witty\\"...it was about as witty as my left foot. Was Jennifer Weiner trying to write a novel or a sitcom? Dumb, dumb, dumb. If you still feel the need to buy this book, be sure to get it used so you can save money."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible...annoying, self pitying and homophobic","review":"Possibly the worst book I've ever read. Annoying, self-absorbed dreck. Hated, hated, hated the main character -- she is a whiny, immature idiot. The portrayal of her mother and partner was totally stupid. Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"This is a miserable excuse for a novel. Good beach reading or maybe a small step up from romance novels, but precious little else. It is obvious from the first 50 pages that the author clearly has both talent and also something original to say about living as a plus-size person in an unforgiving world. Unfortunately, the book goes horribly wrong after this and soon degenerates into an 8th grade fantasy. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read in bed or anywhere","review":"I loved this book. It's funny, in-your-face, feisty, heart-breaking and heart-warming - all of the above. And being \\"a larger woman\\", I could absolutely relate to Cannie's struggles with her weight and body-image. I look forward to reading more of Jennifer Weiner's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read","review":"I was looking for a good book to read by the pool, and this proved to be a very good choice.

I could not put this book down, and I will definately look for this author's work agian when choosing a new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light entertaining read","review":"I just picked this book up last week after recently hearing good things about it. I finished it within four days. It is a light entertaining read. It's not a deep book nor meant to be I think. The main character, Cannie, is witty and smart. The storyline holds up well. The only thing that bothered me with this book was all the complaining Cannie did. Whether is was her weight, family, men, job, etc... it dragged on a little too much for my liking. In the end, Cannie does come to a more positive place about herself and her life, but I would have liked for this revelation to have happened sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Jemima Jones instead","review":"...if you're in the market for a plus-size fairy tale.

I am an easy to please reader who is rarely critical. But, this book bored me to death. It has a great beginning -- and so much potential. However, I soon felt like Cannie was somewhat obnoxious and always complaining. I decided i didn't like her when I hit part about the first group meeting at the doctor's office (page 70)makes a complete fool out of the poor nurse. Yeah, the nurse was going over calorie control, protein and fiber portions, etc... and yeah, most of these women were very familiar with all that. But, she had to start off with the basics. All Canie had to do was say something. instead, she completely disrespects the nurse and turns all the group members against her. And thinks it's funny when the woman becomes frustrated and runs out of the room. There's a fine line between an amusing, slightly melodramatic character and a self absorbed, obnoxious one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry me a river...","review":"All the \\"heroine\\" does in this book is whine whine whine... Boohoo, I'm fat...Boohoo, my boyfriend dumped me...my dad abandoned me...my mom is a lesbian...my sister is skinny... So what???!!! Get over it lady. This story is painfully ridiculous. This sniveling woman actually becomes best friends with a movie star who spends piles of money on her and lavishes her with gifts and attention...yeah right. In fact, everyone she knows lavishes her with attention and does she appreciate it? Hardly. And the ending to this tale is just flat out absurd and corny. I'll admit I skipped a lot of parts because it was SO unbearable. But I read enough to know that Cannie (even this name is so contrived) is a total wimp. I'm writing this review simply as an advisory. Read Laura Zigman or Helen Fielding--at least their heroines are funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Good in Bed","review":"I wanted very much to like this book and partly because I liked the main character. But, I found myself skimming through it following one unbelievable coincidence after another. The writing is clever and funny, but most of the characters are flat stereotypes, particularly the diet doctor and the movie star friend. And the pregnancy, I felt like I was reading a treatment for a television sitcom. This book seemed like it was a learning exercise for a writer with real potential to mine the depths of serious issues through comedy. I hope she doesn't get swallowed up by the publishing industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP for SPOILERS AHEAD!","review":"Ok, I absolutely loved this book up to a certain point which I will get to in a moment. I loved Cassie's attitude, her humour, her distress over her ex-boyfriend Bruce, etc... until she finds out...she's pregnant. UGH! Being blissfully child-free, I thought by making Cassie pregnant, completely ruined the book. She turned into this awful human being that I couldn't stand. It took every power of my being to finish the crappy second half of this book. Why do authors ruin books by making the lead characters pregnant?????? So disappointing. I'm so glad I got this book out of the library so no money was wasted on it. And before I get any hateful comments, I don't dislike children. I actually love them, just don't want to have them nor feel that every relationship story has to have them included in the storyline to make a happy relationship successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK I ENJOYED EVERY PAGE OF IT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT 100% I LOVE JENNIFER WEINER AND ALL OF HER BOOKS I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE THAT COMES OUT ON SEP 2005......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"I received this book from my boyfriend for Christmas; it was a surprising gift. I started reading it Christmas Eve and finished Christmas night. It was simply written; not amazing, but done well enough to hold me interest for the six hours of straight reading it took me to finish. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, and could easily to relate to all situations throughout the novel; even the extraordinary ones. It was a delightful read for me and I would reccommend it to anyone who likes reading books where the underdog comes out on top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've read in a long time","review":"Finally a book with a heroine I can relate to! I loved it! It made me run out and buy her other book, In Her Shoes which I loved just as much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Good in Bed is an enjoyable, easy read with a sassy main character (Cannie). Some aspects seemed to be borrowed from Bridget Jones, Julia Roberts, and Sex in the City. But it was entertaining anyway, waiting to see how things would work out for Cannie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insults the intelligence of intelligent women","review":"I was eager to read this book, as I think that full-figured women are underrepresented in most of the popular arts, fiction included. It's nice that Jennifer Weiner's heroine, Cannie, is a strong and confident woman despite being \\"over\\"weight.But in addition to being strong and confident, she's superficial, intellectually insipid and has the cultural tastes of a 15-year-old girl. Her emotional responses are predictable and housewife-ish; her star-struck \\"Hollywood\\" adventures are the stuff of Tigerbeat. The plot is aimless and disappointing, and the ending has absolutely no surprises. This book is for women who love watching Oprah and The View. So I guess if you're a fan of both those shows, you'll like this book. I thought it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak entry in a strong genre","review":"There are so many wonderful books out there about confused 30ish urban women. This isn't one of them. It seems as if the author couldn't decide whether she wanted to be of the fun-and-clever Helen Fielding (\\"Bridget Jones\\") or more somber-and-literary Alice Hoffman (\\"The River King\\") ilk. She missed in both directions.If you're looking for light and love-oriented, try Jane Green's \\"Jemima J\\" or Jenny Colgan's \\"Amanda's Wedding\\". For a deeper read, try Barbara Kingsolver or Melissa Bank or Anita Shreve. Nick Hornby, Marian Keyes, Robert Hellenga, Alison Lurie...This one might be Good in Theory. In reality, it's just mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in Bed","review":"\\"Good in Bed\\" sounds like something everyone wants and wants to be. Too bad you will be disappointed with this book. It starts out well enough. But somewhere in the middle of the whining about her weight and inability to cope with her family, I just lost interest. I did make myself finish the book. I am always hopeful that things will improve. I feel things in this book went from bad to worst. Maybe it's the self-defeating attitude \\"feel sorry for me I'm fat\\". Or the way no one in her office doesn't the fantastic job she does and yet she is given little credit. I just thought it was more like self-loathing instead of pulling herself up by the boot straps and making a better life. Instead she is unrealistically suspended until her fantasy friend appears to make her life better. I noticed how her fantasy man appears interested in her after she loses weight. This book is a romantic novel in disguise"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to read in bed","review":"This book is well written and highly engaging. Some books are hard to \\"get into\\" but this book kept me interested from the first page. A few times I would opt to take the bus to work rather than walk so I could keep reading. The Philadelphia references were a neat treat as well.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lazy, predictable writing","review":"Another example of how just about anything that creates momentum through lowest common denominator readers and good publicity can become a best seller. Bad, rambling writing, irritating, one-dimensional characters, plots stretched to the absolute limits of believability, and predictability so gross that almost every page has a \\"I feel like I could have written that\\" quality to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring waste of time","review":"The book reads like something written by a 14 year old girl, complete with silly movie-star friendships, pages and pages of ruminating about an ex-boyfriend, an unexplained cruel father. Completely implausible storyline. As others have said, whining main character. I read this out of boredom and the need to read a light book. Somehow I got through it, I think only to see if it got any better. (it didn't) How on earth did anyone get this published? Geesh, makes me feel I could write and sell a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The plot is artificially driven and completely unrealistic. The character doesn't grow remaining the same self-loathing person she was as a teenager dependent on men to make her feel as though she has worth. She remains childish and irrational right through the final pages of the book.I could write more, but I'm sad that I even gave it this much attention already. Other than the very occasional giggle, the book was just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last Jennifer Weiner novel I will read","review":"This is the second Jennifer Weiner novel I read, and it will be the last. I think I've pinpointed what I disliked so much about both of these books; the main characters spend the first 150-200 pages doing nothing but whining (and the first half of the book bores me to tears). And then miraculously something happens that is completely out of the ordinary. I just hate whiny main characters. Both books I've read have an overweight main character, and especially in Good In Bed, she complains about it constantly. I just don't enjoy reading about that. I didn't give it a one star because I was able to finish it and the ending was somewhat cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Real","review":"Jennifer Weiner captures the hilarious and the painful absurdity of life in this excellent story of Cannie, a smart and witty heroine for everyone. While it's easy to say that most people don't have emotionally abusive fathers, late in life lesbian mothers, national magazine humiliation from ex-boyfriends, etc, there isn't a person alive who can't relate to Cannie's trip through the fire of pain and disappointment from those she loves, emerging finally as someone who can love herself. A great deal has been said about Cannie as a \\"plus size\\" heroine, but really, she is a heroine for anyone who has ever felt inadequate, unworthy, and generally unlovable. In other words, everybody. BUY THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it zero stars","review":"I admit I did not finish this book. It was recommended to me by a friend, and once I'd read half-way through I came to read reviews and see if I was the only one terribly disappointed by it. I was not, but several of the reviews neatly summed up the rest of the storyline and I felt no need to continue reading as I knew what happened. In a way that was upsetting (reviews that give away too much plot) but at the same time it was liberating - I knew what happened and I could set this book aside!Others have summed up the problems with this book far more eloquently than I could, but suffice to say I really disliked the main character and her constant whining was beyond irritating. The first chapter of the book was good, and seemed to bode well, and it was all downhill from there. Here's a hint, Cannie, people don't dislike you because you're fat - people dislike you because you're an insufferable, self-centered, whiny little... well, I think you get my point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book!","review":"I loved this book and had to force myself to put it down! Funny and sad, with great characters! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I very much liked this book. I found it hard to put down.

I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Book","review":"I've read a lot of fiction and one thing that I hate is poorly developed characters, thankfully I found a book to read where the character development is outstanding! What a treat to read about people in a work of fiction that I actually would like to know in real life and lament that they don't really exist. I completely recommend \\"Good In Bed\\" as an easy, yet thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Cliche","review":"Perhaps a better title for this book might have been \\"A Supersize Cinderella story\\". Although the main character, Cannie, starts off to be fairly likeable, witty, sharp, (though self-loathing and hyper critical), I had a little trouble believing the strange turn of events which started around the time she threw herself at her grieving ex. For me, the characters all seemed a little cliche and flat and the plot somewhat predictable and soap opera-ish--with Cannie getting the real \\"prince charming\\" in the end (not to mention the fulfillment of every woman's fantasies: wealth, generous celebrity friends, a huge career boost, etc). I also found Cannie's constant obsession with her ex to be beyond annoying. C'mon, ladies! Is this woman for real? Despite all that, I do think Ms. Wiener is a talented writer and would like to see her move beyond this self-indulgent (and rather limited) Chick-Lit genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's fine....","review":"I feel like the main character was much too selfish. It was all about her and feeling sorry for herself. She dumps her boyfriend but he's the bad guy? She wants everyone to feel sorry for her. Get over yourself! She does NOTHING for anyone else in the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worthwhile as brain candy","review":"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read! Because of all the hype about it by reviewers from women's magazines, I foolishly paid for and read a full-priced book that was half-baked. The plot was RIDICULOUS and the main character was as shallow as the men she mocks. She whines and complains about herself and her situation and comes off more as pathetic than sympathetic. Hopefully, larger sized women don't read this book thinking it's a some kind of a \\"girl power\\" book when all the character succeeds in is coming off as a loser. Please tell me that an author will come along one day and actually write a book about a confident woman who happens to be larger (and not about a larger woman who one day happens to be confident)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed every page - a nice light quick read","review":"On vacation in Hawaii I beach read a lot. I had just finished \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\" and \\"She's Come Undone\\" and I saw my sister reading \\"Good In Bed\\" I dismissed it based on the cover thinking it was a trashy romance novel. That is until she kept laughing out loud every few minutes as she read. She brought the book to dinner, in to the pool EVERYWHERE, she didn't put it down. Once she finished it I stopped reading \\"White Oleander (which is a pretty heavy read) and dove into it.

I especially enjoyed the fact that, although there are tear-jerker moments in this book, it is also filled with witty, fun, realistic moments that make it more than just a sappy feel-good story. This book is exceptionally well written and has a lot of substance, but does not take itself too seriously. I hope that Jennifer Weiner's subsequent novels are as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, yet poignant","review":"Cannie entertains, enlightens and engages the reader, as we recognize bits of ourselves in her. When her boyfriend publishes revealing articles about their relationship, Cannie's shocked response leads to soul searching that is funny, yet also poignant. Her perky dog, disgruntled co-workers, supportive friend and the new diet doctor bring some twists to the story. It's lively, insightful and just fun to read. There are some sad parts, and some growing pains, so it's not just fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable!","review":"I loved this book!! Not only was it hard to put down, but it was great to be with Cannie through her ups and downs... It made me both laugh and cry!! Must read for sure!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in Bed is good in bed","review":"While I wouldn't classify this as \\"light\\" I would classify it as an easy read. Weiner manages to write the character as a well rounded, likable person, with normal neuroses. There were some parts that I could have done without, especially the over dramatization at the end, but over all it was an enjoyable experience, perfect for bedtime reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This truly may be one of the best books that I've ever read. Jennifer Weiner tells this story so well! I can't wait to read In Her Shoes, and any future books by her. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weiner writes well for a first time writer","review":"Weiner does a superb job at creating her main character. Cannie is realistic. I can imagine the whole story in my head and go along with the actions. A great read! I would recommend this to everybody. A humorous, inspiring book with many turns. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I could not put this book down. I am drawn to reading Red Dress Ink books, all the single-woman stories that keep me laughing and loving to read. I was recommended this book by a co-worker and Good In Bed was hands down one of the best reads in awhile. I read it in 2 days, sneaking in some reading while I was suppossed to be working. Truly enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yargh!","review":"I literally threw this book across the room. What a waste of time and money. I'd elaborate, but now I have to go outside and set my copy on fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Vapid Book I've Ever Read","review":"I had to read \\"Good in Bed\\" for a book club meeting. WOW... if this is the kind of book that gets published, I'm doing something really wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing","review":"I bought this after laughing out loud a few times in the first chapter, usually a good sign. Unfortunately, while I wanted very much to like this book, the silliness of the plot kept subverting Weiner's otherwise enjoyable writing. The Hollywood twist was an unbelievable, Wayne's World-esque fantasy; the crisis resulting form her fling with Bruce was made-for-TV unoriginal and melodramatic; and the climax with Bruce, his new girlfriend, and Cannie's meltdown was just too much for the book handle. I wish Weiner had characterized a more normal day-to-day life for Cannie - I think she'd have done a great job of it and it would have been more illuminating. Most irritating thing: I wish Cannie had actually said more funny things as opposed to reporting constantly that other people say she's funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time!","review":"This was one of the worst books I could have laid my eyes on! After hearing what a good author Jennifer is, it is hard to believe it after reading the first few chapters of this book. Boring and the character seems pathetic! Maybe good for people who are having major weight issues...."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book was better","review":"Weiner's first book was fantastic. This book didn't even come close. The characters were unbelieveable and underdevleoped, the plot boring and predictable. It was so terrible I would rather have a tooth pulled than read it. So I got to page 147 and couldn't take it anymore. Weiner, you have a lot of writing talent but this one was a bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"This book should be sold along with what other kids in junior high are reading. Ms. Weiner apparantly forgot to consult an editor before they published this book. The plot is so predicable and the writing so wordy. Do we need to hear the description of every last detail? I assure you, the adult audience you intended this book for as an imagination. And Cannie, get over the fact that your father left you already.Take my advice, leave this book for the children graduating from Judy Blume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"What a boring drawn-out read. I abandoned it after about 80 pages. I purchased the book because of its very high ratings but sorry to say I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"It would have been an interesting book had the writing not been so terrible. I'd say the author's writing skill is about the same level as Stephanie Meyer. I can read books with unlikable characters, but these characters are just overall uninteresting. The plot is also boring. I think she was trying to go for Bridget Jones but forgot to be funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just can't get into it","review":"After seeing the high reviews the book has received, I really expected to like it. However, I purchased it about 4 months ago, and I'm still only about 1/3 into it. It's slow and boring and the main character is about as interesting and likeable as a paper plate. Jennifer Weiner has failed miserably at drawing me in. I can't even feel sorry for Cannie for what her ex wrote about her because I couldn't see it as nearly as bad as I suppose Weiner intended it to be-- and I'm a plus-sized chic myself! I want to finish this book just to get my money's worth, but at this rate, it will be Halloween before I'm done."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed and I cried - it wasn't what I was expecting","review":"Read.this.book. It's great. Pure escapism. You can't help but love the main character. I couldn't put it down. Loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with the Kindle edition","review":"This is not so much a review on the content of the book - as the people that have gone before have said, the content of this novel is fabulous. However, the Kindle edition needs major editing. Serious, serious editing. The punctuation errors - missing and misplaced punctuation, quotation marks, and misplaced words - made it hard to get through the book. Also a fair amount of typo-like spelling errors. Amazon should take another look at this edition and make it less distracting to loyal Kindle users like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Jennifer Weiner, I recommed listening to this","review":"I really enjoyed this little story. I drive a hour a day to work; and had a lot of fun listening to it. Its a no brainer kind of story but sweet and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!","review":"This is the first Jennifer Weiner book I've read, but I will definitely read more of hers! Cannie is a wonderful \\"true\\" woman with qualities and life time experiences we can all relate to. This is a romance novel that could be a true life scenario. A bit of a tear jerker with a VERY satisfying end. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to read","review":"Imagine finding the story of your last relationship written in print in a national magazine and it begins with \\"Loving a Larger Woman\\". Any overweight woman already has her insecurities and doesn't need the nation to read about how her ex, a writer for the national male magazine, Moxie, feels she was lacking in the bedroom.Here we meet Cannie Shapiro, writer for the Philadelphia Examiner. She begins the long trek to come to terms with herself, her ex, and her highly mixed up family. There are a few surprises in her future.A very funny novel. Sometimes I really felt her pain, (being a larger women, also from a dysfunctional family). An excellent read for any woman of any size."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Maybe it's not the most realisitc book but it is a great story. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will the Real Bridget Jones Please Stand Up?!","review":"For everyone who thought that despite the fab accent and courage to gain a few, Renee Zellweger's Bridget Jones was not exactly a \\"large woman\\", has Jennifer Weiner got a heroine for you!!! Cannie is honest and funny and fat. And completely and utterly lovable, both by a best friend and that really hot doctor your mom imagined waiting for you at the end of the aisle... Cannie is strong but not unshakable, weak but not breakable - the real woman's woman and the real man's subconscious dream. Wake up, America. Cannie's here, she real and she's perfectly imperfect, just like you and me. Do not pass by Good In Bed unless you want to miss the next best thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic reading, I want more!!!","review":"What an enjoyable book! I simply could not put this book down once I started.Cannie, our heroine, is such an engrossing character, very well developed. I felt connected to her as soon as she opens up the magazine in which her ex-boyfriend wrote an article about \\"loving a larger woman\\". I was routing for her the whole way through, and found the entire book very fulfilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crackers in Bed","review":"This was a great quick read. I simply couldn't put it down, it went everywhere with me for 2 days! And it was most definitely good in bed.On the same track as Brigette Jones, but more rounded and full. If you've ever felt remotely the odd one out because you're not a size 6, please give this book a read. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good In Bed ....Great Read","review":"This was one of the best books (of this type) that I have ever read. Cannie is one of the most developed and REAL characters in modern books. I love the fact that she is not \\"perfect.\\" There is no suprise ending in the book but at the same time the twists and turns that get you there are a lot of fun. This book has been passed around my group of friends and everyone has loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine summer reading","review":"First off let me say that I enjoyed \\"Good in Bed\\"; no it's not high art, yes some of the situations are highly improbable and too predictable but so what. It's still a fun read, that had me laughing out loud and genuinely touched, especially when Cannie shared her pain about her father. It's hard not to like Cannie, she's witty, smart and has some great one-liners. Yes she's struggling with her weight, but don't all North American women, fat, thin or average struggle with some body image issues at some time? There is plenty to relate to here, in our quest to be \\"body perfect\\". I liked this book and I liked Cannie, what more needs to be said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip, Hip, Hooray for Jennifer Weiner","review":"This was a truly lovely book. When I finished reading \\"Good In Bed\\", I truly felt that I had met Cannie Shapiro. She was a wonderful, honest protagonist, who I genuinely wanted to root for. I highly recommend this book - not just to \\"Big Girls\\", but to anyone who is interested in a sensitive, feel-good story set in the \\"real\\" world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I rarely read novels any more","review":"This book reminded me of why I read memoirs in lieu of novels these days. It felt so contrived. Though I can see why some women will like it and relate to the character, I was groaning over \\"Cannie\\" (what a ridiculous name)deciding she was in love with the idiot Bruce after he wrote about her in a national magazine AND used her for sex after his father's funeral. I was about two thirds through the book when I had a strange sense that I'd read this story before. Not this novel, but the STORY and I realized it was like a rehashed \\"She's Come Undone\\" by Wally Lamb. I'd recommend that book over this one.Oh, and out of no where she falls in love with a character who likes her in part because Cannie reminds him of his dead sister (red flag! bad basis for a relationship!) It seemed it was just to wrap up the happy ending neatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"I felt that reading Good in Bed was a waste of my time. I read it for a Book Club and felt that the story left us little if anything to discuss. The writing felt empty and lacked the humor and ethos that I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright..","review":"It took me a really long time to get into this book, and when I did I loved it, but was disappointed on how long it took to really get going. I love how witty it was, and I had a stong connection being someone that has struggled with weight my whole life, so there was definitely a personal connection to this book. I would recommend it but not a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly great","review":"What a great, engrossing read. The author's introduction left me infatuated with her as a person and the book delivered a great touching tale that made me stop everything i was doing until i finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better","review":"This book was an ok read. It had enjoyable moments but overall I just didn't care about the heroine of this story. I'll think twice before I buy another one of Jennifer Weiner's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please explain this book's charms?","review":"The only good thing about this book is that it makes me think I can quit my full-time job and write fiction novels, because apparently people will read anything. The main character is completely miserable. I also don't like the way she disparages against her mother's partner (and her mother), it borders on lesbian-bashing. I wouldn't be able to recommend this book to anyone other than to have them read it to see how even such poorly written material can do well these days. This book is a definite skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD to read IN BED.....","review":"This is one of those great books that are perfect for when you want a long bath, your favorite jammies, and to mindlessly immerse yourself in someone elses' life. I don't have the time or mental fortitude lately to dive into anything too heavy; but didn't want to read something entirely trite or mindless either. (As I write this one of my toddlers is trying to tie his sister into a human pretzel....CLEARLY Ian McEwan is not happening for me this week.) This was a great choice. This is a book that will entertain and leave a smile on your face instead of your brain grappling to discern the hidden meaning in the author's setting choice. It's simply a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful & Witty!","review":"This is one of those books that I'd been meaning to read for some time, and finally got around to doing so. I am so happy I did! \\"Good In Bed\\" is a remarkably touching, witty read with the heroine being a plus-size woman. Kudos Ms. Weiner for having the courage to write a novel with such a main character. Cannie Shapiro is the kind of person I would choose as a friend. Funny, smart, sharp witted, who cares what size she is? And, in a nutshell, that's pretty much the lesson the story teaches us, the readers. But more importantly, Cannie comes to accept it herself.Although Cannie Shapiro is a larger woman, this book should be required reading for all woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the title put you off","review":"I just loved this book. I don't know how many times I picked it up and looked at it at the bookstore without buying it. Finally, someone gave it to me and after reading it, I wish I had bought it the first time. Weiner has a gift for describing the painful, messy, emotional aspects of life. I laughed out loud and I cried as if my heart would break.I've also read Weiner's second book, In Her Shoes, and while I didn't find it quite as affecting as Good in Bed, I eagerly await future books from this exciting new voice in fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good To Read In Bed ...","review":"Good In Bed is definately a 5 star read ... From the moment I picked up the book until the time I put it down, I was completely drawn into Cannie's story ... She was real, honest and endearing ... the kind of character I like to read about. The cast of characters was dynamic, the relationships believable, and the outcome not one of those \\"time to end the book\\" endings ... all for which made for a satisfyingly good read. I am anxiously awaiting the next book by Jennifer Weirner ... (Any chance for a Cannie sequel?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped by its own genre","review":"Bridget Jones pulled it off - and she remains the queen of chick lit. This book fits comfortably in the same genre; however, when the author tries to become more \\"serious\\" and gives her heroine a \\"psycotic\\" adventure, it becomes almost too painful to continue reading...The first part of the story is the most engaging - and the most clever. The periodic columns written by her ex-boyfriend works quite well in driving the story forward; however, after they cease to exist, the hum-drum starts. After the \\"reunion\\" with the uber-mean father figure, the plot skids downhill. Finally, the ending just keeps going and going - a more over-the-top finale is hard to imagine (did she perhaps just die and go to paradise?)A decent book for the beach, which the author probably was aiming for in the first place :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"wet your pants funny, puffy eyes in the AM sad - WONDERFUL","review":"I ordered this book Monday, received it Thursday, and have completely devoured it in two days. It's so poignant, funny, sad, and Jennifer Weiner writes with a deep understanding of what it is like to be a 20/30-something year-old in our society. Written in the first person - Cannie feels like a new best girlfriend!GREAT beach book for summer '02!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author makes unforgivable mistake ...","review":"A pleasant-enough read until about halfway through, when Weiner FORGETS she has told us on page 3 that Cannie was imitating her mother's life partner, Tanya (also spelled Tayna in this poorly edited novel) when she first meets Bruce. Later, she tells us she and Bruce were dating the day she is devastated by the news that her mother is gay and that the woman who's been living with her is, in fact, more than just a friend. If the author didn't care enough about Cannie to get the details of her life right, why should we? Sloppily written and lazily edited; a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Read","review":"I was looking for a good \\"beach\\" read, and thought this was the one. However, the main character is so depressing, and so self-deprecating, I am sorry I bought this book. Cannie is a self fulfilling prophecy with her laments about her weight issues, her disturbed childhood, her boyfriend problems, and her lesbian mother. I was very disappointed in this work, which surprised me as I enjoyed In Her Shoes. It's a depressing read, and I'm only on page 100. I'm putting it down and selling it to a used book store."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters are well written, and the pacing is pretty quick and even, in that you can follow what's happening, but you don't feel like a point is being labored to death.I was recommended this book by my wife, who is now reading Ms. Weiner's second book. I'm very glad she did. Gives a good look into the mind of a female character, and I would venture to say that men would enjoy this as well (as I did), as some of the problems and trials faced by Cannie (our hero in the book) are not gender-specific.We all face self doubt and so forth. This book tells a good story of dealing with what we have, and making the most of it, even when we feel like there's no way to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful!!","review":"The main character in this book is just full of self pity!! She has a very cynical, morbid outlook on life. I was really offended by her outlook on being a single parent - The Daddy Parade. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much self pity","review":"I was expecting a light-hearted romance and instead found a main character that was so depressing I could hardly get through the book. It was pitiful how the character kept deliberatly defeating herself only to finish strong in the end. I had a hard time getting involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a terrible book","review":"a terrible plot, not believable and the characters are just plainly ridiculous. i can't believe how this could remotely be considered a good book. i don't normally write reviews but i had bought this book as a gift and skimmed it to see what it was like. it was so horrible that i had to write as i have never read such unintelligent crap - it was so bad i could not give it away.there is a reason this book is always at the discount bin. if you want to read about obese pregnant people whose lives fall apart and who end up meeting movie stars and meeting their dream man as their doctor when they are at the fat clinic when they are pregnant and falling in love with them. GIVE me a break. Who can publish such drivel?well that was 2 hours that i will never get back in life and the book is good enough to burn."},{"rating":"1","title":"only good for the opening pages. the rest, judgemental and self-pitying","review":"I decided to read the book after the funny opening pages, and tried hard to like the heroine. However, there's just so much whining and hatred one can take. The bottom line is, the author's never gotten over being overweight. There are many similarities between the story and the author's background. This book is more like a revenge against everyone that has not indulged her or lived as she approves. Throughout the whole book, we see over and over how cruelly she verbally abuses people that are not as fat, as elite, as straight as she is. Many times people she dislikes are described as skinny, unhealthy, freaky and dumb. Reading the book one doesn't get why Cannie has any friends at all since she constantly talks about herself, let alone friends and family that are so indulgent of her. The real funny part is that the book repeatedly states Cannie is warm and kind, how delusional one can get?"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written and unreal","review":"Let me start by saying that this is a first time I am writing a reveiw. I really wanted to like this book but it just was not happening. I skipped through many pages. The story is very unreal and written in a very childish manner. In what planet do you meet a movie star in the bathroom and become best friends with her over night ?!?!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend who described it as hysterical and an easy read. At least the later was true. Although the main character has a good sense of humor and whit about her, the story itself is tragic and depressing. I just kept waiting for this book to end! Although some great things happen to her, I think the awful things she comes across are too mournful to make the good things count for much. I will not be reading the sequel and recommend this book only to those in search of a story about the cruelties of life. I give it two stars because it was a quick and easy read and well written. I just did not enjoy the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"A good product at a good price. Would have liked a better description of the condition the book is in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read!","review":"I loved this book. I thought it was light and humorous. I loaned it to my Aunt to read next because it was so good. I just bought the next book called Certain Girls and I am excited to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for the beach this summer!!!","review":"Once I started to read this book I could not put it down. It is a \\"feel good\\" book that almost any woman can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Realistic Book","review":"I enjoyed the main character of Cannie- mostly because I could relate to her. I felt that she made real-life decisions that a woman of today would make in her shoes.There were a couple times during this book, where I thought I could see the plot turning to go one way...and if it had gone that way- I would have been disappointed to say the least...and I can not even begin to tell you how delighted I was when the plot developments didn't turn the stereotypical way. I don't want to ruin the story by telling you exactly what I mean, but I am sure that readers will pick up on it as well.I recommend this book highly. It did not disappoint, unlike the other books I bought in this shipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fastest, Funniest Read in a Long Time","review":"Cannie Shapiro is the funniest main character I've encountered in years. At the end of the book, in the discussion questions for a book club, Jennifer Weiner says that Cannie is her, but bolder. I loved this book; it was witty, touching and very clever. Weiners' way with books had me laughing out loud! Can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I had hoped","review":"This book started out well, but lost its steam. I was disappointed by the slowness of the book and kept waiting for it to get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slick for its own good","review":"This is a very canny novel about a woman named Cannie (what a coincidence). And by \\"canny\\" I mean slickly tailored to the prevailing literary market: young woman in publishing flails comically through relationship (and weight) issues in today's crazy mixed-up urban world. Much of the time this reads exactly like a Hollywood movie treatment, in fact the excerpt provided here ... gives you a swell idea right off the bat. If this is your thing, and you don't mind frankly unbelievable twists like Cannie (a reporter) bonding deeply with a movie actress she's profiling (happens all the time, right?), then I can recommend this novel highly. If you want substance and real atmosphere in a book about women's problems ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I decided to read this book based on the good reviews here. Sad to say, I was not impressed with this book. It's Jemima J meets I don't know who!! The story line seemed so hokey, predictable and unbelieveable to me. At times you want to knock some sense into Cannie for not having the self-confidence that I know is somewhere inside of her. Maybe I was disallusioned as I began reading the book...because I never expected to be so depressed about it after I was finished with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny, entertaining!","review":"The main character is Cannie. She's the type of girl that could be your best friend! She's smart, successful, funny! Her one sin is that she loves food and she's overweight.Her ex-boyfriend, who she's still in love with, writes a column in a Cosmo-like magazine called \\"Good in Bed\\". Cannie reads one of his articles and realizes that \\"Loving a larger women\\" is about her! She's devastated but decides that she's still in love with him.Even though Cannie deals with her weight,lost love, and her abandonment issues, her quick wit and humor will keep you rolling! I loved this book and would recommend it to all my smart and successful girlfriends who aren't a size 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the read, entertaining","review":"This is a really good book -- particularly if you like wit mixed with a bit of cynicism. I think most women can completely relate to the main character in some way or another. It had me laughing out loud several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"The 20-something girl in Good in Bed is, like everyone else, battling her body, searching for love, and trying to make sense of it all. Despite the happy-go-lucky thread throughout the novel, this is a fun, satisfying light read. For women only."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"I really liked this book. After reading some of the negative reviews on the Amazon postings all I have to say is this: This is a good entertainment read, I don't think it was meant as a guide to live your life by. Cannie is very lovable and gives a great point of view. I loved that it was real-to-life with Cannie not turning into a super-model thin character. I am glad I made this purchase and I laugh that some people take entertainment so seriously and bag on every issue presentable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Wish Fulfillment","review":"I picked this up at the Salvation Army. I enjoyed this book at first. Ultimately, however, I agree with the reviewer who said \\"the heroine remains self-centered, self-pitying, immature, judgmental, condescending, elitist, and cruel throughout the whole book, and is repeatedly indulged by friends, loved ones, and [allowed] to dance through life without having to take responsibility for herself.\\" The only realistic part of this novel is the description of the verbally and emotionally abusive father - seems the heroine/author has adopted his voice without knowing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEXT!!!!!!!","review":"Wow,the lesson I learned from purchasing and reading this book is- never assume that the New York Times bestsellers list is an accurate measure for a good read!Hyped as a great summer read, I looked forward to enjoying this book, however, instead of finding a story which could substantiate the media review raves, I read a girl meets boy-boy meets another girl-girl finds someone who really loves her predictable story, laced with cynical, self-abasing, slapstick humor. The continuous onslaught of big girl jokes made it hard to hang in there for the \\"now I love myself just the way I am\\" fairytale ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did it have to end??","review":"I loved this book! The only reason I rated it short of five stars was because it ended to soon. I wanted to know what happened with Bruce and also Peter. It's an ideal book for any woman dealing with weight issues. I loved all the characters. Jennifer described them greatly. I'm hoping for a sequel to answer all the questions I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I read this year","review":"I expected this to be a light-weight, Bridget Jones-type book but found myself absorbed in Cannie's life. The book IS funny but it also is heartbreaking at times, and teaches a lot about self-image and self-acceptance, loss and working through it, and learning to trust again. This is one of the best books I have read all year and can't wait for Ms. Weiner to write some more novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good In Bed, Good but leaves you hanging","review":"I really enjoyed Good In Bed, by Jennifer Weiner. I only thought that the ending could be developed more. I wonder what happened to all of the characters. It was a great read, I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book","review":"i loved this book. it was heartwarming, funny, and just a great piece of writing. also, it's nice to not have the main character be a size 2. i felt like i could relate more. jennifer weiner is a wonderful author and i love most of her work. i highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start, Slow Finish","review":"I read this book on Kindle, so I got to read a sample chapter before I bought it. The first two thirds of the book are really funny, and surprisingly well written, with enough twists and turns and great laughs to keep me avidly turning each page. Then the author gets serious, and all I wanted to do was get to the end, even though the ending was totally predictable. It is as if two people wrote this book. The first is funny, self aware without being maudlin, and understands how to keep me on the edge of my seat and emotionally involved. The second \\"author\\" is almost unbearably self pitying, humorless, and predictable. I thought I had found a new author, to me, but now am leery of reading her other books. Too long, and way too self involved at the end. A lot of talent here though. If the first two thirds of this story weren't so good, I would have given this two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"If THIS is the best, what is the WORST???","review":"I grabbed this book in between flights after a non-solicited suggestion in the airport. Wow, if this could be considered great, I can't imagine making it through the worst! The plot moved incredibly slow making every turn of a page painful. Cannie spends so much time sulking about a man who as described no other woman would appreciate much less, want. She does this (and complains about everything / everyone else in her life) without taking any responsibility or doing anything to improve herself or situation. A few big words are thrown in from time to time yet they do nothing to strengthen a weak, predictable yet completely unbelievable story line. Sadly, this book was a HUGE disappointment and the fact that I foolishly paid full price for it in the airport bookstore only heightens my annoyance.This was brutal and certainly NOT my idea of a good \\"beach read\\" - The only reason I made it to the end of the novel was the fact that I was stuck on a plane..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in Bed","review":"In Her Shoes was the first book I read by Jennifer Weiner so I thought I would read another book authored by Weiner. Good in Bed's character was a whinner and not very interesting. Didn't see the humor in any of the story and the book was wordy. Disappointing that this wasn't as good as In Her Shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite!","review":"I love Cannie Shapiro in this novel! She is brilliant and has an awesome personality. I highly suggest reading this book, you won't be able to put it down... when you finish, you will want to read the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if I were on a beach....","review":"I'm sorry. I'm going to be the one who disagrees with everyone. This book annoyed me. Yes, I did end up finishing it...so something kept me reading it. I think I was always waiting for more complexity to these characters. I wanted to like them and I just didn't really care about anything they did. There was something so stereotyped about them.Just not my style of literature. It seems more like a very long non-fiction story from a women's magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it","review":"I tried to enjoy this book but I found it irritating after a while. The narrator seems to have a real issue with vegetarians and she constantly takes pot-shots at them. (Her ex had the gall to be a vegetarian! A guest at her mom's Thanksgiving dinner had the nerve to eschew meat! A food critic is mad at vegetarians!) She seems to have some sort of ax to grind, and after the fourth shot was fired against vegetarians, I'd had enough and put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach Trash","review":"Self-absorbed, self-pitying journalist meets celebrity in bathroom whom she instantly becomes best friends with and ultimately ends up a rich single mother who almost lost her baby in a freak accident after meet her estranged father in hollywood as her celebrity friend gets plastic surgery. Is this how she pitched the book? Were the publishers on crack? Enough said. I could have gotten more entertainment watching a soap opera; less time consuming and dare I say more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I don't even know where to start with this review. Good in Bed was recommended to me by a friend, who thought that it was GREAT! and much better than Bridget Jones. I couldn't disagree more. The chick lit that I have read, Bridget and the shopoholic books, were better than this book by leaps and bounds. The writing is just plain bad. This book is in desperate need of a fantastic editor.As for the story, the character is not very likeable. When she spirals from ok to worse at the end, I wonder why postpartum depression is never mentioned. It seemed pretty obvious to me. Anyway, the character is a drama queen acting her worst.The only redeeming feature about this novel is that it did manage to make me weepy. Only, the more I cried, the more upset and angry at the author I became. I feel strongly that the book was not deserving of my tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sad to be funny.","review":"The main character can only appreciate the good things in her life, after several horrible things happen to her. Sad that her life has to be in shambles before she can recognize her worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"A painful read, and I only read 100 pages at that. Is this what single thirty-somethings are like? No wonder they're single. Absolutely pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like some cheese with that whine?","review":"I'm trying to justify a 3star rating here. To put it mildly this was difficult to get through for me because I didn't fine Cannie (Lord I hate that name) sympathetic at all. For me Cannie was whiny and looking for someone to blame her lot in life on. Granted your formative years play into self esteem but at some point you are responsible for your own orgasms. I understood her \\"plight\\" but I didn't understand why the book was at least 85% wallowing and whining - I kept hoping this would change. I did however enjoy the snarky humor in the writing. The mechanics of the books also seemed to work but this was overall not a pleasant read for me. I also knew from early in the book exactly what the ending was going to be. Not a series I would continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't get into it.","review":"I try not to quit on a book and give it a chance but this one just didn't grab me at all. I only got to about page 100. Cannie was just so down on herself, yet despite that, she got through college and had enough confidence to get a good job at a major big-city newspaper. She puts her worth totally on how she looks and having a man, which is not a good message to send women. The book just doesn't have enough substance. Cannie is a whiner ----- sorry, but there are bigger issues and people with alot worse problems out there in the real world. I just didn't have any sympathy for her and felt this book was too much \\"fluff\\" --- I guess I just don't dig the chick-lit genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant and addictive","review":"I highly recommend this book-- it's very feel-good and I enjoyed reading it, it's very emotional at times which can be difficult if you're an easy weeper, but on the whole very funny as well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read but unrealistic","review":"This is a fabulous read! It's funny, has identifiable characters (especially Cannie) and is really honest about the goings on inside the minds of large women. It's more like a dream of how larger women wish their lives could be than how it actually is for us most of the time though. Sure Cannie goes through some exceptionally rough patches, but overall her life is just too good to be true. That's what's great about it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes it's okay to be overweight...","review":"I found myself engrossed in this book. I couldn't get it out of my mind for days after FINISHING it!It's well-written & easy to follow. The author described the characters well enough to give the reader a mental picture of each person. And, since the lead character is overweight, it's easy for many people to relate to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, poignant and truly entertaining","review":"Good In Bed hit the spot. The main character is very well written, with a mixture of gifts and flaws like the rest of us. The people around her, some more believable than others but still feel real. I was immediately drawn in by the story line and how it unfolded in front of me. She goes through the events in her life trying to keep a sense of humor, sometimes succeeding other times not. I was sorry when I finished the book, I wanted it to go on a little longer. It's a great summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun page turner!","review":"I really like this book a lot! This is my first Jennifer Weiner and I'm happy that I started with her debut because I imagine she keeps getting better and better with each book she writes. The story is heartfelt, moving, witty at times to the point it cracks me up, and very realistic. I know what it's like to have my heart broken one too many times and I could really identify with the main character, Cannie, and what she was going through, through all of her many trials and tribulations. This has been a fun summer read and one that I highly recommend to others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"After the first 50 pages, I was thoroughly bored! The heroine as well as other characters were all one dimensional. Can't believe all the great reviews! Please skip!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, relatable, girly","review":"I loved this book. Very girly, very relatable and hilarious the whole way through. I loved the characters and the flow of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off well, then downhill","review":"Like so many other reviewers, I wanted to like this book. And I did enjoy it for the first third or so, but then I just wanted to tell the main character to get over it already. She whines about her break-up to just about everyone she meets, including movie stars, doctors, etc.. My sympathy ran out early, and I kept waiting for her to show some interest in any other character's life or problems, which never happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smitten","review":"I am a Jennifer Weiner fan...and tend to enjoy reading all of her books. I like the twist and turns that this book leads down a normal life of a women. You lose a guy and think that you want him back...but, in reality if you were really into him, you wouldn't have lost him in the first place. It was a very pleasant book and I enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I really wanted to like this book because it had been recommended to me by several people, but I just couldn't get into it. I was a little annoyed by Cannie's character who is pretty immature. But mostly, I was just bored with this book because not a lot happens. Judging from the other reviews, I guess this is a book that one will either love or hate. With so many terrific books out there I don't see why anyone should waste their time with this one. Maybe I just don't get the \\"chic lit\\" genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"After wandering around aimlessly in an airport bookstore I finally picked this book out, read the back, and fell in love. Cannie's story is one that every woman will relate to at some point in her life whether it be from depression, anger, love, or Joy. I recommend this book to everyone who has endured a hard time in their life... which is everyone. Jennifer Weiner adds twists into the story while keeping the reality of the events solid. You will laugh and cry with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just your run of the mill \\"fat girl\\" bood","review":"This book is fresh and funny. How can you not relate to Canni?? Anyone who has ever not felt 100% about the looks, body, or lovelife can identify with the trials that she goes through to find her true happiness with herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"My (new) favorite book!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! The story line was constantly intriguing, with a main character that comes to life like no other. She is so believable that it's hard not to get sucked into this story. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good girl book...not a beach read.","review":"The plot of this book kept me interested and reading; I couldn't put it down. I gave the book four stars because the main character, Cannie, annoyed me because she was too down on herself. I identified with her somewhat, but she was over the top depressing. I could not see myself reading this at the beach. It is not lighthearted! I loved the storyline, though. This would be an excellent book for book clubs. Jennifer Weiner is a fun author who really knows imperfect women and what they face in this cruel world. Check out Jennifer Weiner's Goodnight Nobody. It is an even better read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who can't identify with Cannie?","review":"OUCH! To be a plus-size woman is hard enough, but to have your ex write about your love life in a magazine column is ridiculous! Cannie is a very real, witty and sympathetic character. Good in Bed goes beyond your average beach-read, although it is a quick easy book to devour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny, easy to read, cute story.","review":"It was one of these bookes that I could hardly stop reading and whenever I had to stop I wanted to get back to it to find out what happens next. It was my first Jennifer Weiner and I will for sure read more of her books...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Do People See In This Novel?","review":"The protagonist of this novel, Cannie, was little more than another whiny, self-deprecation-masking-as-wit ridden overweight woman. The storyline managed to be both formulaic and farfetched, and the only interesting/respectable character in the story was perhaps Dr. K. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone in search of a story with memorably unique characters or insightful prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I bought this because I heard Weiner was a good author. This book was terrible! It was painful for me to flip through the story because Cannie was too whiny, the plot moved painstakingly slow, and it just wasn't that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Good In Bed\\"... enough to put me to sleep!!!","review":"Okay, I will give this book 2 stars as it picked up in the end a little but this character is way to depressed and I (a larger women) cannot relate to this at all. There is just no excuse! Did we forget that she broke it off with the guy and called him weak, pathetic, etc. Even to the end Cannie does not seem to wake up and \\"get strong\\" she just whines!!!! Jennifer is a great author but this was a slow, depressing read and I did not feel anything when I completed it. Usually you are sad because its over, or smiling with tears, or laughing... the last paragraph was weird and I was just glad it was over so I could start something else! Anyway, I always finish what I start but it is NOT a BEACH read... Try Sheryl Woods or Janet Evanovich or Rachel Gibson, those you will love! Will not pass this one in the box to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but a little depressing.","review":"Good in Bed was a great book. I enjoyed reading it, and actually finished it in one sitting. The main character, Cannie, is very likable. Nevertheless I gave the book four stars because it is a very sad book. There are very funny moments, but the book is very moving and sad as it recounts Cannie's troubled year after \\"taking a break\\" from her boyfriend. I didn't find it to be predictable. I wouldn't consider it a beach read either since it is not as light hearted as expected.It is well written, and very moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for beach.","review":"A feel-good \\"fat girl's revenge book.\\" Yes, plus-sized women deserve their day in the sun too, and that's why this should be read by the pool or on the beach. I liked it well enough, but the heroine's suffering garnered little sympathy from me and her success, while enviable, is as believable as Subway's Jared commercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Bridget Jones Wannabe","review":"I cannot understand why this book is so popular. It was horrible! The main character, Cannie, spends all her time obsessing about her father who abandoned her, her loser boyfriend that she broke up with, and her weight. It was hard for me to finish this book, it was so boring. It was the worse kind of chick lit masquerading as some sort of girl power anthem. Weiner borrows liberally from Sex and the City and Bridget Jones, not to mention \\"Maxi Ryder\\", a thinly veiled characterization of Minnie Driver. After reading this book i had written Weiner off as a horrible writer, but I have read In Her Shoes since and it was truly a good book. Everything that her debut was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disagree...","review":"Perhaps I am unqualified to rate this book because I did not even finish it. I was so frusterated by all of the whining that the main character seemed to do that I had to put it down half way through. She was living some life that I did not relate to or care to ever relate to. I was looking for comedy but found the main gal pathetic and weak as a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read, bad title","review":"I enjoyed this book. The writing is clever, funny and witty. I think this author has a lot of talent. It is quick read great for commuting to work or a plane ride. There were pearls of wisdow thrown in every so often. A perfect balance between fantasy and reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great In Bed","review":"I don't get the Jennifer Weiner hype at all. I have read all her books and to me they are very repetitious (not just because some of her characters cross over in the novels, like Cannie from this one, for example) but the plotline, \\"problems\\" and characters are all the same. And you can see the happy ending coming from a mile away...For me, this is the best of the bunch but I found it stretched the bounds of credibility. I can't imagine a Hollywood star acting the way Maxi Ryder does but then this is fiction - fluffy, frivolous, forgettable fiction. Read it only if you are really bored and you have absolutely nothing else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Story Idea...Why Couldn't I Stay Interested?","review":"Plump, pretty and witty, dumped by her boyfriend, abandoned by her father, loved by her dog, a nagging late in life lesbian mother, a bestfriend that always finds the wrong man, co-worker threatened by her skills and personality, fast friendship with a pop singer/movie star. I thought this would be one of those books that would suck me in and I would read it straight through. The only thing that kept me reading was the thought it HAS to get good soon. It didn't. Sigh..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most depressing!","review":"This is the most depressing book I have read in a long time. Cannie's body image problems were so over blown. The ending was nice, but I didn't feel that Cannie ever really grew up. I couldn't believe her best friend was a lawyer and didn't suggest even once that she sue for any of the horrible things that were pushed on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"When I started the book, I thought it would be a light read - Bridget-Jones-ish. I was surprised to get so involved with the main character, Cannie, that I cried and laughed out loud many times. I couldn't put it down. I was so sad when the book ended. I certainly hope that Jennifer writes another - soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the feel good book of the year, so far.","review":"I have to say that I loved this book. I rarely feel compelled to write reviews about books, and I read quite a bit, so that says a lot right there. It's a must read for anyone that has a poor body image, is a larger woman, or just needs to feel better about themselves. If you want to laugh, cry, and end up with a smile on your face, this is a book for you. If you know anyone with low self image, go out right away and make this book a present to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love a larger woman!","review":"This book has so many good qualities that it's hard to seperate them. This book was great for many reasons but what I found most inspiring was that finally a larger woman is portrayed as a real woman with a life and family and men problems. Then there is the many adventures of Cannie Shapiro... from New York to Hollywood and back to Philly! And even better, Cannie stays a \\"larger woman\\" and likes herself!The writing here is comical, easy, and very entertaining. I recommend this to all who like a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, except for the main character","review":"It's hard to like a book when you dislike the main character so much! Cannie, the main character, comes across as incredibly full of herself in regard to how witty and intelligent she thinks she is, even though she appears to have issues about her intelligence. Overall not a bad read, but the end seemed to rush into a happy ending all of a sudden, and not a believable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great message if a little unrealistic at times","review":"If you have ever had someone tell you in order to lose weight you needed to burn more calories than you ate, and in response you wanted to punch them, then you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Beach Read","review":"This is a light, funny book that anyone who has struggled a bit with weight will enjoy. It gets a bit long and annoying toward the end when the main character falls off the deep end but up until that point, it is really charming. Guys -- this is a chick book so read with caution, but as far as chick-books go, this is a well-above average read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Yourself, The Rest Will Follow","review":"It's been called \\"a delight,\\" \\"warmhearted,\\" and \\"oddball.\\" This being the author's first novel I didn't have high expectations. But I was highly entertained. I laughed, I cried, I went, \\"Yeah, right.\\" Weiner combines sarcasm, culture (and cultural icons), psychology, and a bit of sappiness to describe the life of Cannie, an overweight reporter who comes to grips with her sometimes soap-opera late twenties. We see her go from medium ok to very high and happy to a major depression and back to the middle. Weiner has an entertaining (though often verbose) style which I enjoyed reading but will admit to skimming at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"The worst fiction I've read in a long time. The book for me, was an insult for all over weight girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK! Weiner WHINES","review":"Ok - so I read this book with high hopes. It had super early reviews. I liked the fact that the heroine was a plus sized woman with a professional career.Boy was I disappointed.... another whining long story where a woman has to go through hell and end up thin in order to find happiness.This is advertised as a comedy- NO WAY! There is graphic disturbing violence toward the end . The heroine is pushed to the ground while very pregnant and forced into horrific labor which leaves her uterus torn and then removed and her baby in terrible distress. Comedy? If I want angst I will read something that is better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is so bland and boring, I couldn't get passed the first few chapters. I don't know what the hype is all about, it's one of the worst books I've read this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"This book was highly recommended to me by a few friends and co-workers. After reading this book, I question the ingelligence of these friends and co-workers (not to mention the author). I am most sincere when I say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I did not feel sorry for the main character midway through the book because I began to see the selfish, negative, unmotivated attitude that probably caused her to gain weight in the first place. If you are over 12 years old and still have crushes on celebrities, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. If you have EVER come into contact with a woman you actually respect, please don't read this book. It will just upset you to know that some women actually look up to people like Cannie and Jennifer Weiner. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST DISAPPOINTED","review":"Book took 16 days to arrive (only 3 states away) and it was LARGE print, which wasn't disclosed in sales description. Most disappointed, I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let down","review":"I've been listening to this book to and from work. I am a thin woman, and from what I've read ...if this is the way large sized women think, it's no wonder they are always fighting the scale! It's pathetic! The main character in this book thinks that she is the only one that has to watch what she puts in her mouth, that thin woman are miraculously slender without any effort or self control on their part.By the way large size woman talk in books, and to our faces, most of them are bitter women who eat out of frustration and can't understand why they are miserable.When the character in this book found out she was pregnant and could not \\"possibly figure out how she could have let it slip her mind about birth control\\" After the author voices her unwanted opinion about pro-choice, the character asking God for divine intervention, I had enough, and threw the CD away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly witty and spunky book","review":"My best friend told me to read this book and I told her I couldn't be seen on the beach with that book. Well, curiosity got the best of me and I went out and bought it!! It is the most refreshing book I've read in a long time. I was laughing and crying the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"It was so refreshing to read a book that made me laugh out load often. I didn't want the story to end. I loved this book so much I emailed the author telling her so (not something I've ever done)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entertainment","review":"I really liked this book. The story had just enough detail, and the characters took on a life of their own. At times I felt like I was watching/reading a movie...interestingly enough, Good In Bed is scheduled to air on HBO as a series... I will keep an eye out for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in Bed was awesome!","review":"I loved this book!!! I just couldn't put it down. Cannie was such an engaging and lively character. Through her, Weiner really hit on the head the emotions and thoughts that can accompany a person without a size 6 body. EXCELLENT!! It brought laughter, tears, and was definitely a read I'd recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading","review":"I'm reading the book while Hurricane Isabel takes over my area of Virginia, and I'm liking it so far. It's a quick read -- and I guess I identify altogether too well with Cannie, as I'm also a plus-sized journalist who can't hold down a relationship and who has literally every weird possible thing happening that can happen. The author hits it on the head with her descriptions of not necessarily feeling unworthy, but of definitely feeling a bit of discomfort with the lead character's physical appearance. This is a definite must-read for the upper-20s set who have body image issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the subject ever written!!!!","review":"I have made several graphite fly rods for myself and my children and every one has turned out beautifully. The simple, easy to follow instructions and clear photos make this book a \\"must have\\" reference. My Loomis blanks turned out easily as good as the factory rods in finish and I have the satisfaction of knowing I did the work myself. Plus, I saved about 50% on the cost. I customized the rods for each of my kids so they each have a unique, hand crafted rod with Dad's signature on it. Great book, no question about it. Buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done","review":"The layout and photographs of this book are beautiful. Ritzy flyrod shops should have this one lying around for people to read and admire. In general it is a very good introductory book on building a graphite fly rod and I built one using it. I did find the explanation of how to determine the rod blank's spine to be confusing. However, there are several good explanations of rod spine on the net. It has a good description of how to do a two color thread wrap, that is, a one color main wrap with a different color accent. Mine looks mighty nice, cobalt blue accented with gold on a charcoal blank. (St. Croix SC-III 6wt. 9ft.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference Book","review":"I've wanted to build a fly rod but had no idea how to start. This book is a great crash course for a beginner like myself. I have a rod kit partly completed on my bench with no problems encountered, thanks to Mr Garcia. I found that some of the sections required me to physically have the components in my hand to completely understand the directions, due to some of the wordings, but the light bulbs did come on within a couple minutes!I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in building their own graphite fly rod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for a beginner, but a nice book.","review":"I do agree with others that this is a beautiful book with lots of good color photos. But I believe a how-to book should be passed through not only the hands of experts for review, but also to beginners. It's too easy to assume terms and products are well known and do not need to be defined and that's the one flaw in this book. For example on thread winding, what kind of thread? (Cotton, polyester, nylon, rayon, silk, etc.) What size? Does it matter or will anything work?There was also a chapter on the manufacture of graphite blanks in a factory setting, which added little helpful information to a rod builder, although it was interesting. The space would have been better used to define more terms and to pull back and show the finished products. Almost all of the photos were very close up. (Again - that's great, but just a few overviews would have been beneficial!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Stan Whitmire does an excellent job with his arrangements of these popular Christmas songs.

However, this book is fairly out-of-date, and doesn't reflect the state of the art for speech recognition technology. The section on linguistics is wrong more often than right, and wouldn't add much to the reader's understanding of designing speech interfaces even if the errors were corrected. While I think that the authors' knowledge of user interface design, in general, is solid, their experience with speech is less so. For example, in the interview with Kate Dobroth (which is really the highlight of the book for me) the authors/editors consistenly transcribe the term \\"n-best\\" as \\"end best\\" pointing to the authors' inexperience with the technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Punk In Gallows America is a MUST READ for everyone","review":"I recommend this book very highly. I feel there is a little of the PUNK in all of us. I read the book from front to back in record time.

It does leave a very slight peppermint odor which is gone after a couple of days.

He is an unapologetic comic book geek with an obvious passion about his subject. The brilliant thing about this book is that it is not really about comic book superheroes, it is about reality (ironic) and what makes life worth living. Zimmerman is at his best when he uses the world of comic book heroes to ask questions of ultimate meaning about life in our own world. The book does not give many straightforward answers to life's questions, but it does help us to know if we are looking in the right direction, namely toward the God of the Bible. I found the combination of historical insight, cultural analysis, theological reflection and general wittines to be thoroughly engaging. This book will probably be read most by fans of comics, but that is a shame because it speaks to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still holds up.","review":"Don't be put off by the publication date, In her lifetime Doreen Valiente was one of the pioneers of modern Wicca, and her books still hold up. Though other reviewers have rightly pointed out \\"facts\\" that have since been discounted (ie. the Margaret Murray references), the main value of this book, in my opinion, is in the last section where the author presents a simple dedication ritual to give beginners a taste for the path and get them started. This was one of the books that got me in way back when, and I am glad It found it. If I'd encountered some of the trivialized \\"fluffy-bunny\\" books that abound today, I would have been run a mile. Doreen's sincerity and lack of hype is a refreshing contrast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Doreen Valiente was a pioneer of her time, a true Wica Priestess of the Craft. Within Witchcraft for Tomorrow she breaks down what the heart of the Craft is, the tenets as they should be understood and shows one how to find their own connection through working with the elements, the tools of the Craft and much more.This goes into the heart of the Continental Tradition in which spans through many Craft Traditions with a great understanding. This work is one of our Temple's required reads to further understand and grasp how one is to work with and learn of the Ancient Ways.EnjoyAriana"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter, good price","review":"The down-to-earth approach of this book ensures that it is more dense than other guides for beginners. Gets you from knowing absolutely nothing to a level at which you can start reading about technical analysis, read financial papers, annual and quarterly reports. Good 'further reading' tips.

Plenty of pages were spent on immigration procedures ( and samples of application forms) which are readily available from the internet and are more up to date.

I am a big fan of Charlise Theron and consider her a good looking woman, but they could have found someone who exudes sexy-ness alot more than she does. The action was ok but have seen better in B class movies. If you are a big fan of the cartoon series than you will probably be very disappointed in this movie. In short ..they took an MA or strong R rated cartoon and made it into a pg-13 movie...not impressed at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special.","review":"I was a fan of the animated series, Aeon Flux. I loved its quirky and bizzare storylines and characters. When I heard about Charlize Theron playing the lead in this film, I knew it wasn't a good sign. When I heard that a director with ONE feature film behind her was attached to this, I knew it wasn't a good sign.I could mention the production designer, costume designer, etc. also, but really it was the script and direction OR the studio that ruined this film.This film was what you could call \\"Sci-Fi Lite\\" even though the studio tried to market it as an action thriller with a formulaic movie trailer that did absolutely nothing but misrepresent the film.In the end the action scenes are poorly photographed and seem to be edited to hide a profound lack of... action. The story is flat and any resemblance to the original series is painfully absent."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG...","review":"Here's a thought; if you're going to base a movie on a previously successful television series, why not make it actually resemble that series? Another thought: if you're going to cast Charlize Theron as the sexy heroine, why not make her look, oh, I don't know, sexy? She's running around in what looks like black long-underwear throughout the movie, and you really don't care. It doesn't look good on her, and she's acting like she's The Terminator. Problem is, she's a hundred and nothing and kicking the #### out of people twice her size. It's just not believable. At all. The characters are embarrassingly without character, and the story is horrifically without thought. And what a waste of Pete Postlethwaite's talents.

Liquid Television was a good show bringing viewers highly original and entertaining animation. As for the movie, in my opinion they completely blew it. Charlize Theron is talented but wasn't at all right for the part. I thought Carrie-Anne Moss would have been better. The movie wasn't at all like the TV show.

For people that have trouble following movies like Total Recall or even Mission Impossible, this movie would make you have a nervous breakdown.Aeon Flux is very, very bad.

What happens when you combine Rebels with government and they have a past that they can't/don't remember and what can happen when they do. No this movie doesn't give itself away in the begining which means you have to follow the story and have some sort of an attention span.By the way, this is a FANTASY/SCI FI style movie.

Aeon (Theron) and all the other main characters are flat and awfully boring. The simplistic story about the evils of cloning seems much longer than its 92 minutes.

And there are lots of nice effects. The background story is solid; it is the execution that is flawed.Quite often, the plot feels like information was left out. It never does a good job of transitioning from one moment to the other. In fact, at times it is outright confusing.The flow of the story uses recycled elements. There is the bad guy who really isn't the bad guy, the \\"I am your father\\" type twist (in this case \\"I am your wife\\"), the hero (or heroine) is hunted by the good guys and the bad guys twist, and the real bad guy is trying to gain power twist. It feels like the director and writers saw several movies and said \\"Hey! Lets put that idea in our movie.\\"The base story was solid, but it was ruined by bad writing and bad directing.

I never knew machine guns could be so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually impressive and incredibly trite","review":"The live action adaptation of Peter Chung's beloved anime series Aeon Flux is one of the most visually impressive sci-fi films to be released in the last year, and it's also one of the most incredibly trite and tedious as well. Charlize Theron slips into skin tight leather as the acrobatic heroine/assassin on a mission to overthrow an oppressive regime, I think. The story of the film takes a back seat to the visuals and to Theron who sleepwalks her way throughout the film's running time, but you'd hardly notice because she looks so damned good. The action and special effects are nicely done, but the film's incoherent storyline, wasted cast (Frances McDormand and Johnny Lee Miller are wasted beyond belief), and otherwise surprisingly tepid direction from Girlfight director Karyn Kusama make Aeon Flux a film that's strictly for fans of modern, empty sci-fi; and even fans of the anime series that it hardly resembles may find it hard to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Basically this movie promotes a heroine who practices genocide against her own people by deliberatly severing the only lifeline that her entire species has to survival. Shortly after this, amongst heaps of praise for her unexcusable decision, the movie ends as though all is now well. The main villain has been a psycho running around murdering pregnant women. The main charecter is suposedly this great, pure person, but she takes his crimes soooo much further by eliminating her species.All in all, a terrible movie! The designers seemed to have been promoting her sickening actions too which is perhaps the worst of it, that they condone the murder-suicide of the entire human species."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just watch?","review":"I dont mind getting thrown into a fast paced action movie. But when the main character can perform moves in a Kill Bill fashion without the intentional camp factor then it get boring really fast. The plot was a flop for me though I didnt know about a series before I watched the movie. Apparently she gets driven into moral action outside of her duty when she begins remembering things from a past life she had some 400 years ago, goes against the orders of some all knowing rebel leader, begins figuring out things that no human logic could jump to, and manages to fit a sex scene in all at the same time.

They did this whole thing and THAT was all they had to offer?\\" Unfortunately, this is one of those films: the images are striking, the mystery fun, and then you get to the end and wonder how any producer could have imagined it would sell enough to recoup the investment.Not recommended. I won't play the spoiler, but really, you are better off reading the comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did this get such bad reviews?","review":"From the start I didnt have high expectations from this DVD. I never saw the series, and read all the horrible reviews the movie got when it came out. But I rented it anyway, because I like scifi, even BAD scifi.From the opening scenes Im starting to pick cynically at it : why would these people live on this little \\"island\\" surrounded by a huge wall and not want out? What happens when the population gets too big? Etc. etc... Im just waiting for the movie to fall flat on its face because of all the plot holes. But then it started sucking me in, and Im wondering what the flashbacks are about, and the other oddities, and Im thinking ok, this is going to be a case of the \\"huge letdown\\" when the plot is finally revealed.But it wasnt.Then I realised that all the bad reviews were just that - BAD reviews.This is a good, and suprisingly thought provoking movie. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my Utopia.","review":"I was skeptical walking into this film, I thought it was going to be one more mindless action film where the good guy stops the bad guy and it's one big happy ending.But I thought this film had a lot more to say than its \\"paper-thin\\" plot had to tell. It's a meditation on chaos and order, on what it means to be human, on love and shows the world a glimpse of a future where man does not overrun the planet.A lot of flack is leveled at the performances in this film, but I felt that by the end of the film its dreamlike quality had been fully embraced and earned.Try and give it an unbiased chance. Don't compare it to the show. Think of it as a love story with a Sci-Fi backdrop NOT a Sci-Fi film with a love story thrown in.Oh, and it looks beautiful on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT Catwoman 2!","review":"Whoever says Aeon Flux is Catwoman 2 is an idiot and should be ignored. This is a very good movie. It's not without it's faults. The director isn't very good when it comes to action scenes and the acting is pretty dry. But there's a solid and original story here and the scenery looks great. Science Fiction movies like this can be extremely difficult to follow (The Matrix) but this director does a very good job of making a complicated story easy to understand.I actually think it was a good idea not to let critics screen this movie in advance. They all typically hate this type of movie. But for people like me, this is great entertainment.I give Aeon Flux an 8 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everquest used to be fun, but not anymore","review":"I went back to the game after being gone for 3 years and was sorely disappointed.

Written and directed by the Thai director Songyos Sugmakanan. Two prizes in Berlin. A young student is sent to a new school by his parents. He soon understands that the only kid he gets along well with there is in fact the ghost of a student who drowned in the school's swimming pool. I liked a lot this film which reminded me at times the best ghost movie I've seen so far that is to say Jack Clayton'sThe Innocents. The director is obviously a sentient being who manages to translate the sad feelings and the melancholy of a child lost in an unknown environment. Besides, in the interviews he gave to the press, Songyos Sugmakanan freely aknowledged that his film was in part autobiographical. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friendships are forever","review":"Very Nice movie. Simple to follow and very touching.

First one I put in was labeled \\"Good Neighbor Sam\\", but it is actually \\"Operation Mad Ball\\". So a little homework with a felt-tipped pen was needed.

All five movies that are supposed to be included in the set are there, just mislabeled. That's really annoying! We'll have to mark them somehow so we know what's what. The movies themselves are all ones we'll enjoy, but I've never seen this kind of error before! I was wondering if anyone else had the same problem, so I checked the reviews and it looks like several mention this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait","review":"These 5 films have been out of print for over 20 years. Phffft!, Good Neighbor Sam and The Notorious Landlady are the 3 movies I purchased this collection for. Unfortunately, my box set came damaged in shipping and I ended up buying it from a store for the same price. The only flaw with the discs are the labeling.

I have read all the books in this series. The first ones were enjoyable. The last one before this was disappointing. This is a dud. The story does not hang together.

He's held back nothing in this work and really tells it like it is. The episodes of Forrest's life are brought to light and in remarkable clarity without the dullness of over dramatic writing.From Forrest's early days to his failing health, this work gives the reader keen insight into the man and his legend. A truly remarkable work that was absorbing and enjoyable to read.I highly reccomend this book to Civil War scholars and history buffs alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent outdoor speakers","review":"These speakers provide a remarkably full sound and good dynamic range. I have these mounted on a pergola above my deck about 10' high; I would suggest not mounting them quite so high so as to get a more immediate sound; however, even at this height the omnidirectional speaker provides good coverage (I have it down-firing) and an enveloping sound field. Bass response is probably as good as you can expect in an outdoor speaker, and was better than I had hoped for. I have not rated this as 5-star only because these speakers seem to be a little overpriced. Although, f you're looking for some of the best outdoor speakers, I don't think you'll do better at any price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.....but","review":"I agree with the other review.

If you know the difference between stick figure characters and real people, your intelligence may be insulted by reading this book.

I guess you could compare it to a Tom Clancy book, because like many of Clancy's novels there are soldiers and politicians and terrorists. However Clancy understands things like plot and pace and letting the characters develop in the readers mind instead of spelling everything out for them in the first 50 pages.The characters are so one dimensional and cliched, it's hard to take them seriously and I'm sorry to say Colonel North's military experience isn't enough to make the story anywhere near believable.I was also disappointed at how forced the interjection of Christianity was in this story. It seemed to me like these stories are written and then North and/or Musser make them just religious enough to sell at Christian bookstores.I guess I like my thrillers a little more...dare I say nuanced?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I wish I could give it 0 stars. I bought this video hoping to find a really intensive stretch workout. I was sorely disappointed.The exercises are fairly basic and at times cheesy. Stephanie Herman has you waving her arms like a swan several times. It brought me back to being a six year old in my ballet class. I did not find her engaging as an instructor.I think the budget for this video was practically nil. The set looks like a high school stage with cheap background (silver tinsel and all - I kid you not)!I get a much better stretch from my yoga videos and will stick with them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable stretching workout","review":"I really liked this video. With her ballet history, Stephanie Herman really knows how to use her body, so her demonstations are inspiring. Her manner is low-key and engaging, and the music is very enjoyable. I'm in my fifties, with a ballet background, and want to work on my flexibility. This workout primarily offers good stretching, but also offers some toning and balance work. It's not a super intense, exhaustive workout. However, I did it following a ballet workout, and at the end of it, my body felt very good and like I'd really worked it. It was a very pleasurable experience that I can see repeating for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am disappointed with this video. Her mic doesn't pic up her voice very well and so hearing her over the music is often difficult. There are times when you must look up to see what she's doing because she doesn't always do a very good job of cueing. The stretches are OK.

However, I wish I would have read it earlier in my training, the description of the book says it's great for both beginners and experienced but I found it to be written for too large an audience and was left hanging on certain aspects of the book.

This story is of an injured soldier who runs away from the best hospitals the military could offer and escapes to the beach to die.

Abbey Lee Miller is just a big woman with a large mouth that just angles for a fight. The moms are self-absorbed and clearly are in this for the attention and seem to care more about exposure than their own children. To say you watch this as a guilty pleasure is an affront to humanity because there is nothing of merit on this show. Children get exploited for the adults' pleasure and to say you enjoy this means you truly are not looking at the greater picture.

Can someone tell me how to set this controller pad up so it wont keep automatically putting commands in for me? Every time I even touch the control pad when it's hooked up to my PS2, the buttons are too sensitive, and it keeps doing what I can only describe as \\"hair-trigger buttons\\" on it's own as though the turbo is out of control. Apparently I thought the sensitivity would start out normal and then I could set up the turbo on my own. Instead from the very beginning the control pad starts automatically putting all sorts of commands (triangle, squre, circle, etc.) into the game for me, so I can't play. Somebody please tell me how to set this pad up. I bought a second one just now and it does the same as the first one I bought.

I was already impressed with creative MP3 players before I even bought this one, and this one did not disappoint me at all. My 1st player still is in working condition, and the reason I bought a second one was the color screen. Creative products (MP3 players, speaker systems, sound cards etc) will always have the best sound quality in the same class - bar none. This player has very good battery life and amazing sound quality - two most important things for any MP3 player. Plus, its screen resolution is much better than any other player out there. When you combine all the great features with its comparably low price, its an absolute no-brainer. It will be very difficult for Apple/Microsoft/Toshiba to lure me away from Creative any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is my first MP3 player.. I love it. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for the following reasons:1. It is not easy to find accessories. There appears to be nothing specifically designed for the 60GB that allows me to play the files in the car.2. Very limited instructions. Maybe for those already familiar with players, it's no big deal... for me, synching was an absolute nightmare. Do not.. I repeat.. DO NOT use both the software that came with the player and Urge to synch unless you're better at directing the software to locate specific files. Both programs synch to the player-- and they synch ALL of the files on your computer. No big deal-- you can direct the software to synch certain files-- except this wasn't clear when I first opened the package-- nooooo instructions.Otherwise, I love it... love love love it.

Yet he had to suffuse them with so much sex (and bad sex, may I say), which he does with virtually every book he writes, that the story just becomes soft porn books. Of course teen boys love it!

The author is not a true expert on this subject and I've read some minor criticisms of this work. It's not in the style of a traditional history. Some of the details of the book come across as \\"gossipy\\" or journalistic. The book does shed light on the economics of the war, the problem of finding effective tactics, and the role of the media. Much is included in the book, but I wonder what was left out. If you haven't read a general history of the war in France already, you might want to before reading this book. Very clearly written, and exciting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"good provocative history but a doubtful central premise","review":"Covers lots of ground. Generally reliable EXCEPT--and a big EXCEPT--for his central assertion that the Britain blundered wrongly into war. Given the 18th and 19th century Britishdetermination to prevent the continent being dominated by a single power, how Ferguson could conceive of a Britain accepting German dominance over Europe in 1914 is inconceivable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killing became an end in itself.","review":"Ferguson's courageous history of the first world war explains how sadistic, relentless killing quickly became an end in itself. And WWI led directly to worse barbarity and terror, so that in 1999 the world faces virtually the same problem in the Balkans which existed in 1914. In explaing how the first great war came about Ferguson stands head and shoulders above the \\"victor's historians\\" who fill the textbooks and befuddle political leaders. He finds much to blame conservative British leadership for. And nothing kind to say about America's role. Unfortunately - and this is not Ferguson's fault - he cannot explain how the pointless savagery could have been avoided or cut short. Senseless murder may simply be an instinct; if so, it's time for all of us to face up to that. Forget heroics; war, like all murder, is failure. There are no \\"good wars.\\" The value of Ferguson's effort cannot be overstated, but it is only a beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative, but ...","review":"It is a thought-provoking book which is well worth reading, though the arguments are indeed full of contradictions and sleights-of-hand (...). Some of the most provocative claims are made in a single throw-away sentence, without evidence to back them up.One point I think should be made: (...) the book has not broken the last taboo, etc. In Britain there is a strong tradition of disillusionment with the war, which only began to be challenged in the 1960s. Mr Ferguson's book is part of this dominant tradition.The most original thing about the book is not the arguments, but the form of analysis. Mr Ferguson recognises something that has eluded military historians for too long: war is an economic activity. For example, he considers questions like: how much did it cost to kill each soldier? what was the kill ratio of German soldiers versus Allied soldiers? and so on. Questions like this are so obvious that it is a wonder no one has really asked them before."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pity of this book","review":"This book meanders all over the place, from some history and literary critique to economics. Ferguson indulges in long tracts with endless figures to reach highly doubtful conclusions. Mostly, he likes to shoot down other people's theories with a mass of facts and figures, yet his own conclusions are based on extremely sketchy evidence. Some examples of his conclusions: the Kaiser was not responsible for leading Germany into war and the war went on because men weren't tired of fighting. I think I can pretty much guarantee that given a choice, 99.99% would've voted to go home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Academic Wonderland","review":"To make a reputation in the world, one has to come up with new ideas. Sometimes they are closer to Hitler's BIG LIE than anything else.While there is much interesting in the book, he fails to convince. After all, the Germans still invaded a neutral country. This area was also one that England had fought for before. I could go on but one more point must be presented.Perhaps it was destiny that Germany become the dominant nation of Europe and the First World War only delayed the results. But the liberal, democratic society of today is better than the aggressive, insecure German nation that existed in 1914."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLASK","review":"THIS FLASK WAS RETURNED BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD LEAVE SPIRITS IN IT FOR ONLY A SHORT TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to Paperport 9","review":"I'm a huge fan of Paperport 9; I use it extensively.

It would have been nice if the production was a little better with more sophisticated photos and colour, but the content is all there. Except that I feel the author should have made much more reference to the mind-body disciplines and meditation. For example, a key concept in meditation is that one should sit with one's back straight because the energy moves up the spine better that way.

Its one of the funnest tools you'll ever be fortunate enough to use and this book presents it in a fun and easy way you will remember.

HeadFirst HTML with CSS & XHTML is written in a logical order that is very clear and easy to follow, with many checkpoints along the way to make sure you don't get too far off track. They don't just spew data at you; they explain things and give you exercises that help you remember the information. Even at over 650 pages I was able to breeze through it in about a week. I would not suggest getting HeadFirst PHP & MySQL however, as the authors of that book aren't anywhere near as good as Eric & Elisabeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major issues with Kindle version","review":"I bought the Kindle version of this book for a class.

For someone like me however, this is a great book.No the book isn't as deep as some would like, but for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with XHTML & CSS, this is a great way to get started. For me it is important to know why something is done a certain way, why it is important. Head First does a great job at answering the \\"so what\\" of some basic things in web design. Because of that, I have a much easier time to learn it. I'm not ADD or watching Nickelodeon, but this book was a great help in getting me started on web design.

In the past books on topics such as this resulted in a fine night's sleep after a few pages.

Not many computer books start with a discussion of metacognition and how we think and learn, but this series does, and their approach really works.I was able to incorporate some of the stylistic elements that are demonstrated in this book into my final project.

I have never had such a great time going through a book and no book has kept me so engaged with exercises , humor (yes, humor in a tech book) and crossword puzzles (you'll have to see it to believe it). So much so that I finished the entire book, all its exercises and quizzes and am actually looking forward to doing some web designs of my own.Plus, I am looking forward to their PHP book.

I found the constant doodles, tips, and just about everything on the page took you away from reading the actual information that was presented to you as the reader. I don't mind illustrations, but they were too cumbersome and too plentiful. I know if they had decreased the amount of distractions in this book it would be much more of an enjoyable book to read and understand.

This is a minor thing but is handy for quick review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for beginner web designers","review":"If you want to learn basic web design and are starting from scratch, this is the book for you.

It gives nice perspective and makes tags/elements and attributes make sense. I'd highly recommend to anyone that needs to learn HTML and CSS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent teaching tool","review":"At first, I thought this book was a little silly and shallow, but the more I got into the book, the more I realized I was learning. By the half way point, the amount of material covered, was extremely in depth, and I felt like I was really beginning to get to the meat of HTML. Because the first few chapters were so simple, by the time I got to the complex portions of the book, I felt comfortable with the language and the topics. The CSS chapters were a bit difficult to understand at first, but again, by the time I got there, I was at least conversant and able to figure out what was going on.I'd definitely recommend this for someone who is an absolute beginner or maybe has a little experience, but I think someone with advanced skills would find it little more than a refresher book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips page locations in Kindle edition","review":"Is the Kindle edition supposed to skip from location 1624 to 1636?

Many pages are broken up by a host of info-tainment elements, including unrelated nostalgic pictures, deadpan comics, puzzles, handwritten notes and arrows all over the place, sidebars, and others. So the layout was a real turn-off. Some may prefer this mix.

They assume you're a total idiot for buying this book, which maybe you are! :) I can't stand the silly pictures and kindergarten strategies for getting you to learn. It's way too rediculous. If you're under 20 and a total computer newbee this is perhaps a suitable first start. I can see what they're trying to do here; you will learn the basics if you go through the 700 pages of little silly exercises and read the silly little \\"jokes\\" and so on, but it's difficult to stomach for somebody of average (or higher) intelligence.

Even if you don't know HTML and CSS but are computer-savvy it's a bit slow at the beginning.

Not to mention the actual class is a whole semester long. Some of the stuff in this book isn't even taught in the basic web design course here. I would've had to take both the basic and the advanced web design course, that's a semester each, just to learn all the stuff that this book had in it. Except this book only took a couple weeks to read :)The tone, the images and the games made it very easy to understand. It wasn't just easy, it was even fun! I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Funny Primer","review":"Wanting to learn CSS I pulled down several books at the bookstore and began thumbing through them. Later I took a look online at reviews and thought to give it a try. Initially I was put off by the rigamarole that the Head First team goes through to explain their philosophy of pounding the material into your head.But it is good. Humor, with some real world examples and repetition do seem to work here. The only thing lacking is that the book should have a reference instead of telling you to buy another book so you could have a dictionary of the terms they have now struggled so diligently to teach you.Another detraction is the 45 days online free. Once you buy it, find someway to make that always free online. Make the user stronger and the relationship between purchaser/student and author/teacher better. Build on it, and find someway to make those tests in the book interactive on the web. A good resource and entertaining as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Whole Lot of Nothing","review":"Just how stupid do these people think we are?I hate this book. Like the other one-star reviewers, I find the cartoony illustrations and jaunty hand-printed notes in the margins to be wildly distracting. I don't like having to sift through the intentional repetitions of the concepts just because other readers might have to read something 3 or 4 times before they absorb it. I don't, and if I do need to go over something again, I'd rather just go back and review instead of being forced to read the same thing phrased or staged in three different ways.This is the assigned textbook for an HTML class that I'm taking, and I'm going to complain to the instructor, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly and unsporting","review":"I absolutely hated the way this book was written.

Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy testing of first exercise diminishes book's usefulness","review":"When I purchased this book I wanted more than a hip, new-age way of getting me to absorb the material, I wanted the exercises in the book to work. Like myself, the 30 or so other reviewers were influenced to purchase the book by the pictures, cartoons, and sometimes irreverent prose. None of us could test out the book's exercises in the store. I can't vouch for the other reviewers, but once I got the book in front of my computer I began at the beginning and in the first exercise, Uh oh, problems. I am not alone. One just has to go to the HeadFirstLabs online forums to read that the exercise apparently wasn't tested on the world's most popular browser, IE6. If the first, and what logically should prove to be the simplest exercise in the book is flawed, what disappointments and frustrations do the following 620 pages have in store for us IE users."},{"rating":"1","title":"style over substance","review":"This is the first \\"head first\\" book I've read, and unfortunately it will probably be my last.I actually don't have a problem with the material covered in the book. It seems pretty complete. But to me, having to wade through all the \\"cutsie-poo\\" little pictures and notes and jokes and all that just leads to a book that is difficult to pick up and find the info you need. I suppose if your goal is to be amused, then by all means pick up this book. But if what you are trying to do is learn so that you can accomplish something in an effecient way, then I'd definitely buy something different.I'll leave the \\"head first\\" book to the teens, I want my medicine \\"straight up\\" and strong, not watered down like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Info, but Confusing","review":"My instructor had this book as our text book. It has a lot of good info, but it's all jumbled together in a giant cluttered mess. Taking tests with this book was a nightmare as I really couldn't pin down the answers to the questions. I am ordering other HTML/XHTML CSS books to fill in the gaps where this one left off. I need organized facts and examples, easy to find answers. Not this garbled mess of cutesy crap that just takes away from the mass of good info it DOES have. I give it two stars for the good information it holds, but it lost 3 stars because it's just such a messy book of nonsense that I had a difficult time sifting through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to HTML and CSS. It does take quite a while to get to the CSS parts of the book but the seperation helps you understand the diffence between the two.

This is the first book in which I've managed to work through the entire thing. I loved it. It's a great introductory book that you won't get bored with after the first few chapters.

Not many technical books you can say that about..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book that Really Delivers","review":"Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML is well crafted to give you full insight into how and why these technologies work.

I have been using it for almost 1.5 years now and my hair has never grown tired of it. I must have tried over a dozen different 'natural' shampoos over the last 5 years, including other types of Aubrey shampoos. This shampoo fits me so perfectly. I love how it gets my fine hair,shoulder length super-clean, but without drying it. My hair feels super fresh, clean and really shiny after each wash with this luxurious shampoo. Aubrey shampoos are slower to lather, but I feel they are supremely good quality and clean so much better. I love that the recipe of this shampoo is Mayan (as I live in Guatemala) so that just adds to the enjoyment of using it!For my fine hair, I combine this with Aubrey's Island naturals replenishing conditioner and these two keep my hair in happy, healthy, shiny and managable condition.I hope you enjoy it too :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"More drying than sulfate shampoo","review":"It dried my hair out and it made it hard to detangle.

I did not like it at all. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really an autobiography","review":"I felt this book is just a story of a part of Steve Chandler's life. He repeats the same point in each chapter, but with different examples. He compares two types of people, owners and victims. Victims aren't going to read this kind of book. What can owners do to change victims? He says to be the change you are trying to effect. But true owners are not in need of change, and he gives very few specifics on how an owner can help a victim. He doesn't encourage you to change until the last third of the book, and then only briefly, until he gets back into repeating himself. This is in no way a literary work, with it's informal style, and discontinuous nature. I do not recommend this book unless you just need some 'fill' reading. The very short chapters lend it to readers who have small amounts of spare time, such as breaks, or waiting in the car for a child, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it a chance","review":"I read this book about 1/4 of the way through and the whole time I felt like I had some kind of confused grimace on my face. I understand how maybe someone who feels stuck in a monotonous existence might benefit from reading this book, but as someone who is comfortable with her personality, I found the book very contradictory to how I live my life.

Steve Chandler has the kind of personal experience that makes the approach and suggestion legitimate, and having struggled with my own victim behaviors I can honestly say his wisdom shone through clearly for me.This is an easy read, and I was able to set down the book for a couple days and pick right back up where I left off without missing a beat. Readers from junior high school on up will be able to understand and apply Steve's concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against Depression","review":"The message that there is significant risk in treating depression as a problem of deviant temperment rather than as the physiological threat it presents is well taken. It does not require 291 pages of text to convey these extensively documented facts which are generally known to those of us interested in these matters, if not in such detail.The book lacked details of treatment protocols and outcomes.The broad suggestion that mental illness is best treated with a combination of therapy and medication is like a disclaimer. The main benefit of therapy is to provide emotional support which encourages the adherence to the prescribed medication protocol. No mental illness has ever been cured with therapy. Also, there is little mention about alternative treatments or future treatments such as TMS. This book is not comprehensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does he want, MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY?","review":"Depression means lost happiness and well-being which means lost productivity.

There are not many of us who have never felt depressed. The first step is to accept that depression is not a bad thing. It is a warning that you must deal with it or it will grow deeper and deeper within.By acknowledging our depression we are taking the first step to healing. By not acknowledging we escape into drugs, alcohol, food, sex and many other addictions.Pain is part of the human condition, we cannot erradicate pain 100%. One must learn to live with painful emotions and go beyond the ego and acceptance leads to letting go. This is not burying your pain but making it part of your human journey.Other books for your consideration:The Problem of Painby C.S. LewisThe Pain of Being Humanby Eugene Kenneday"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow going","review":"The author certainly knows about depression, but in this book his prose style and frequent tangents slow the reader down and are little more that detractors and fillers. You wonder if he is writing for himself: has he fallen in love with his writing style so that as many sentences as possible can be sretched out beyound usefulness. His message gets lost in these elongated thoughts, elaborate case histories that are overdrwwn as if he intends a shore story. See,for example case of the women who could not get her laundry done.His effors at style are overwrought and interfert with a clean message that is easibly followed.The CD is not any better option and should not be played while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative","review":"I found Against Depression to be fascinating, cover to cover. The middle section alone, about the science of mood, could stand as a fine book. As usual, Kramer makes tough material understandable, he pulls different approaches together, it all adds up. I think the bottom line is hopeful--the notion that current treatments make the brain more resilient. I've read lots of books about depression, and if I had to recommend one right now, this would be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept expecting it to get better","review":"This was an awful book.

Having a kindle fire to read it on was great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, but it has a lot of heart","review":"And My Shoes Keep Walking Back to You is not a very good book; the plot is thin, the characters mostly stock, and sometimes the strain for comic effect is just too painful to bear.BUT.There's such a nice spirit in this book, an open-hearted warmth, that you might just like it in spite of itself. She nails the bar band atmosphere, and the camaraderie of people who play music together into the wee hours, and she treats her characters with kindness and humor even when she's having them do ridiculous things.Mildly amusing, light, warm-hearted--so it's not literature. There are worse ways to kill a few hours and Kathi Kamen Goldmark is pretty good company, even it is just a road relationship that isn't going to go anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My God! So funny!","review":"What a hilarious story! This book made me laugh out loud, and I'm not even a country music fan. Start reading this book when you have a good chunk of time - you won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Up Your Heels","review":"I was intrigued by the glowing review of this book in the September 2002 Oprah magazine. It is a wonderfully satisfying and funny novel offering a female insider's view of the Country Western music scene. The characters are so well drawn and kooky, that you fall in love with each of them. I was rooting for the heroine, Sarah Jean Pixlie, as she takes on ex-boyfrineds, bad bosses, well-meaning family members, and even a crooked executive from the record industry. The song lyrics are hysterical, the story well paced, the situations madcap, and the heroine completely charming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"I'm wondering if the other reviewers here actually read the same book I did? My book club selected this novel based on the glowing reviews here (and the tag lines from all Ms. Goldmark's friends on the back of the book -- shame on you, Roddy Doyle and Amy Tan!!). I have yet to talk to someone who enjoyed it. The Amazon reviewer is being more than fair -- it's predictable, the plot is loopy, and the song lyrics throughout the book are practically unbearable. I figured out by the 10th page that I'd need to skip them if I wanted to finish the darn thing.Further, Ms. Goldmark may be a country music \\"insider,\\" but I didn't get that feel from the novel. Most of the characters are immediately recognizable stereotypes: the self-absorbed big star, the greedy record producer, the citified record industry folk. Hilarity ensues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This is a really fun read, and it's very well written. We follow Sarah Jean as she goes from single back up singer to a country legend to being a star of her own, in addition to becoming a mother and trying to find a man. The cast of characters around Sarah Jean is fun and makes you wish there was such a honky tonk around your corner too. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical show-business memoir","review":"I had to work to read this one to the end. Showcases a quirky family, with some interesting content behind the scenes of country music.

Having found it on a complete whim on the internet and then falling completely in love with it online, I had to have it.

I recently purchased several different CDs of Russian folk music, a number of which were quite good--but this one shines out above all the others.

I have small collections of folk music recordings from various traditions, including Irish, Scottish, Spanish, Latin American, South African, etc., which include some blisteringly good CDs. This one is the equal of any of them. It is one of those rare CDs that is unrelentingly excellent and sparkles and crackles with energy all the way through.

However, there are many typos that can't be ignored (Green Day are bringing punk rick to the masses?) and the average person who flips through the book would think that the singer's name is \\"Billy Joe\\".Most of the information is good, though, and most Green Day fans will enjoy it. The author makes references to his experiences with Green Day, which would've been cooler if it hadn't sounded like he was trying too hard to show how big of a fan he was.The chapter about American Idiot was also poor, because it tried too hard to make Green Day sound like saviors for enlightening the world about the evils of George Bush.It's alright. I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wussie Punk Rock","review":"They've already ruined the music industry enough through sound, now they have to ruin it by literary material. Here's my perspective of all Green Day products: horrible, worthless, and wasted effort. One reason I hate Green Day the most is because of the way they portray Americans in they're new album, entitled American Idiot. Aren't they Americans themselves? To tell you the truth, I really don't know what their music is about, it's just the fact that Green Day has a horrible singer and an attitude that the band has (trying to act like magical fairy princesses when they aren't) that bothers me. I stand for the classic Rock n' Roll bands, like Dio, Ozzy, Ac/dc, Motley Crue, and so on. Not this pretty boy stuff, for as ugly as this band is! If I wanted to listen to punk rock, I'd listen to the Sex Pistols, not this junk!Either way, this book is a Green Day product and that means that it deserves no credit, it's unfortunate that I can't give it a 0."},{"rating":"2","title":"[HEY YA!/G-H-E-T-T-O-M-U-S-I-C-K]","review":"* This CD is a great value if you haven't yet bought their smash album: \\"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\\".*1. \\"Hey Ya!

That comes with the case of Outkast and their music. The first hit from their double album, Hey Ya, really seems to be a knock off or remake to one of those kinds of songs that actually doesn't seem to focus in from the infectious period of Motown during the 60's and 50's. Although the melody is alright, it is just a little bit difficult to hear what the members are singing, because the audio outwits the actual voice of the group.

I was amazed to read on the dvd that this was written by Louisa M Alcott, but it is explained a bit when I read in here that she was 17 at the time. It is a real young girl's variation on Cinderella and I suspect a bit like the stories Jo March was producing before her Professor advised her to write what she knows, and from the heart.For the first time, I disagreed with the strength of the ratings and comments in here and have bought a dvd I can't see myself watching again, and that is why I decided to comment.

Otherwise, it's formulaic and stagey: the characters are two-dimensional, the plot development obvious in the extreme.

Meredith Baxter was unfortunately miscast (as was 3/4 f the actors in ths movie; I couldn't stand watching her play this role.

It's hard to believe the reputable Louisa May Alcott penned this story. And why did they pick a strikingly handsome man to play the part of a man who is several times referred to as unattractive? Overall the movie doesn't ring true. P.S. I don't know why this is in the British cinema category. There's nothing British about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREDICTABLE","review":"The InheritanceIt's made for T.V. and that should give you pause.

I was disappointed by its lack of depth and the feeling that the acting was forced and artificial. The actors came across as if they weren't comfortable with the story themselves. British period pieces - to which I am accustomed - usually have much more depth than this movie, which I found to be quite simplistic. The costuming and sets are well done and everything is top quality except the acting and the script. The attitudes of many of the actors seemed too modern to be believable and the plot and character development seemed a bit forced. I really wanted to love it, but I found this movie an unsatisfying disappointment. Obviously there are many others who like this movie, so maybe I'm in the minority. I'm not sorry I saw it - it just didn't have the quality of the good period pieces I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My main problem with this movie was the script. Little was left to be implied by visuals but all had to be said by some character with dialogue that was blunt and uninspiring.

All I can say is, these people do not know period pieces. Where to begin, the cast was so poorly cast. The location and scenery looked so unauthentic. It looked like they filmed in a mansion in LA and a sound stage. The plot, predictable and uninteresting.

There was not enough engagement with viewers, drawing and including us in the storyline about the human experience.

It is rare to find a family movie that depicts life where honesty, humility and self-censure is shown in such desirable way. When Louisa wrote this book, it was standard fare in society, but today's children are not raised this way. I am glad that the movie didn't try to place this movie in the setting and societal norms of the 21st century instead of the author's.It was a sweet romance, which I think it was played with tenderness and sensitivity. The characters were portrayed as I think Louisa would have cast them. My only complaint was that the story could've been developed a little more.

And they took out the brother, which was a disappointment. It is mildly entertaining, totally unrealistic, and has a few lightly comedic parts. (The \\"hell\\" discussion is a favorite.)

First off the original score is fantastic. It delivers mood and setting where the writing sometimes fails. Second is by far my favorite part of the movie which was the crazy neighbor played by Gary Wagner, he literally makes the whole movie for me, I only wish that he got more screen time. Overall this movie is in my collection and I'm happy that it is.

This leads to many inconsistencies in plot events, characterizations and in minor but disturbing details such as people's looks.Then, suddenly, we are faced with nearly perfect pages that hint at Mr Keegan's undoubted abilities and leave the reader with a bitter aftertaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes....","review":"I'd buy any Keegan book like a shot - there is no such thing as a BAD Mel Keegan novel- but all I can say is, I hope it was writing another masterpiece that distracted him from his work on this one. Keegan's incredible strength as a writer comes from his power of characterisation: these two lead characters just don't come to life for me. Neither of them have any real past, where as most of Keegan's characters come with a history that makes them move as real people. And there isn't much chemistry between them or even any real friendship, although the historical setting is very well done as usual. Very often Keegan's more complex books pay off with more reading- even over time- but this one is definately on the tepid side.

So the picture, print, etc. are 40% smaller than intended, with wide stripes of white space at top and bottom. Many of the funny details in the pictures are lost, and much of the text is unreadable.The other reviewers are exactly right as to the hilarity of the content.

But then the unthinkable happened. I was lightly shaking a bottle of sauce over the plate filled with tacos and it slipped from my hand and fell about 3 inches to hit the edge of the plate. THE PLATE SHATTERED. I MEAN SHATTERED. Splinters, shrouds and pieces of plate everywhere. We sat in amazement to the distance it traveled for such a minor, I mean minor accident.

It's amazing to see the progress that the band has made over the years. This new album is a mixture of old and new. The band has taken a more melodic approach toward their music by combining their signature guitar riffs with Adam Harrell's Jeff Buckley esque vocals. This is no longer a screamo outfit, but more a defined alternative band. Highlights of the cd include, \\"Zombies\\", \\"Wolves\\" and the unforgettable \\"Fiends\\" which is a track that takes a shot at phony music fans and kids that tend not to listen to music, but listen and act upon the trends. CV has made a huge stride from their debut album and this is a strong sophomore effort. This is a very good conceptual album that should be given a chance by all. Even all you old CV fans. You just might find something that you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Sophomore Effort","review":"\\"Fiends\\" by Chasing Victory is much different than the band's wonderful debut album \\"I Call This Abandonment\\", but it is good nonetheless. As mentioned by other reviewers, CV have decided to head in a brand new direction, musically speaking. On this album, you will hear similarities to bands such as The Classic Crime (in The Skeleton Key to a Skeleton), Matchbook Romance (in G.O.B. vs. Tony Wonder), or even The Bled (in the lead-in to Rapture Raptors). Though CV have cut out much of the screaming, it is still present in spurts. The first four songs on this album are solid, then the quality declines a bit.

I don't have any serious problems with the book as a history teacher, but as a reader, I thought the novel lacked development. The characters were contrived and flat, there were too many false starts and loose ends to the narrative, and the gratuitous attempts at sexual titillation were annoying.

I'd go so far as to call it bizarre. Not to mention surreal, or perhaps simply unreal. The circumstances surrounding Bonne are unusual enough, without the addition of the way she maintains her status as a wetnurse between jobs (other adult characters drink her milk straight from its source), the people she considers her friends (a dwarf pretending to be a child, a self-flagellator pretending to be her uncle, to name just two.) All of this strangeness is distracting. Medieval history, religion, and fiction have always fascinated me, but there are so many other novels that present the era so much better. Not necessarily nicer, just better.

Secondly, what he does describe is often incomplete, poorly presented, INACCURATE, and/ or useless. If you're going to Baja, get the Peterson's \\"Baja Adventure Book\\", which is much better.Don't buy this book for Southern California, either, because it is equally useless in this respect.

I saw the title and expected danger and excitement--I mean, it even had a former Navy SEAL in it! If there's a SEAL, I expect to see some serious action.Instead, I got a lot of people running back and forth and very little action. But my main complaint is that characters who should have been competent made foolish mistakes or simply didn't behave in a competent manner--the former SEAL (who did not come across as even having been in the military. much less elite military), the sheriff (who ignored some basic investigative techniques), and the villians. If there's a heroine in the story, I want her to be smarter and better than the villian and still escape by the skin of her teeth because he's just as smart and clever--not win simply because the villain was incompetant."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"This was the first Karen Harper book I have read and it was so boring.

These also have made me vomit on many many occasions, with or without food. It's especially bad with milk. I find that I have to take them right after a meal (and I mean right after or they make me vomit) with a glass of water. If I take them right before food, they make me vomit and if I take them in the middle of a meal they will either induce vomiting or dry heaving.The last pills I took at the same amount of vitamins in a much smaller capsule, were much cheaper and only had to take one a day.

I give this album four out of five stars simply because although I love many of the tracks, there isn't much variation in style.

Hopefully you have not slept in days so this album can do its true job, put you to sleep. Most of the songs are listenable, but that doesn't make for originality or actual talent. Brad Arnold is a more boring version of Rob Thomas vocally and lyrically. If I had the opportunity to sell the Better Life for 5 or more bucks, I wouldn't hesitate. As for Away from the Sun, I gave that album away to a friend who doesn't know the difference between real, original music and crappy, depressing and boring music.

By trying to out-do themselves with another album full of infectous, singable choruses, that are full of crunching guitars. However, their effort may not be up to what the true 3 doors down fans hoped for. Its hard for any band whos debut cd had so many popular songs, to try and please everyone's taste. The first cd had more distorted guitar driven songs, while the more mature sounding \\"Away from the sun\\", has a more acoustic feel to it. The hard hitting choruses are still there, so if thats what your into you will not be let down. This is still a very sound, and catchy cd that will appeal to many rock fans who enjoy good straight up rock and roll without any suprises.

The band recycled riffs on the new album and overused the chorus effect/arpeggiated chord combination. They could have tried a little harder.

Example: Someone told me just last week that the lead singer (whatever his name is) recently said he backs the war (in Iraq) 100%, and that if it took a million U.S. soldiers lives to bring us to victory, it'd be worth it in the end (A seriously moronic thing to say, expecially since we just hit the thousand mark for U.S. casualties and rising deathtolls hit home for many people). Granted, I heard this from a friend, so it may or may not be true. but judging from what I've heard in the past, his story holds water.When its all said and done though, I can (sort of) look past the politics and take the music for what it is; well written, well composed modern rock (with a little country mixed in too). Standout tracks include: When I'm Gone, Ticket to Heaven, Here without you, changes, road i'm on and away from the sun..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of a slump in both sound and a rejection of their old fans","review":"When I first heard 3 doors down 'the better life' I thought it was an amazing cd and still do to this day. When I heard a new album was coming I was so excited but when I got it and played it my heart sank. This ladies and gentlemen is a sellout cd, gone is their old heavier sound and lyrics and thus they made this cd more mainstream with tracks like 'here without you.' This cd would be good to listen to if you were VERY VERY VERY depressed. Its really hard to listen to this cd all the way through without wanting to turn it off. Still theres a few good tracks on here like 'When Im Gone' Going down in flames, Sarah Yellin and changes. I think if your around 16 years old or younger and are going through that omg Im so lost wtf someone help me then youll like this otherwise stay clear, better yet pick up the better life and listen to 3dd at their best and heaviest."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Kept it up","review":"If you have heard this album then you know that They haven't Lost There Touch This one is as good as the first and i would bet that they keep this up for many years to come, say hello to the next big thing in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm here without it, baby","review":"And I don't want to touch this album, it sounds like everything else baby, thats on the radio aaalll the time, I'm here without this album baby, because of its mediocre songs, and yes I have heard them aaaalll. Some songs are okay, like the radio hit \\"When I'm Gone\\", these songs are overplayed baby, on the radio 24/7, so its not worth buying the CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appaling","review":"This is so middle of the road i wonder if they have traffic lines painted down thier backs. Away From the Sun is just another testament to the marketing powers of television and radio and that style will always win over substance. But do not worry, this band along with thier faceless cousins, Nickelback and Creed will get thier just deserts when they are laughed at in ten years time, and trust me, they will be... \\"ha ha ha ha ha i can't beleive i used to like them\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is A must buy album for all rock fans out there!","review":"There is not much that you can say about this album except that it is great and is the perfect follow up album to the amazing \\"The Better Life\\" which sold over 6 million copies. The first song \\"When I'm Gone\\" is so catchy, the lyrics are great and the vocals are perfect. The rest of the album could all be hit singles, and i'm just wondering what the next single will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"majorly disappointed","review":"As a fan of 3 Doors Down, I have their other cd (The Better Life) and think it is a great album all around. However, after waiting a looong time for their follow-up, I was dissapointed. The album is written for radio, trading the darker feel of songs like \\"down poison\\" for much more radio-worthy ballads like the single \\"when I'm gone\\". Although a few songs were middle-of-the-road.. overall this cd was a major disappointment, and I am amazed at the high ratings it got from many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Doors Down","review":"Excellent mix from an excellent band. Every song perfectly executed. No cursing or explicet lyrics. Just good old rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Although I don't have Three Doors Down's debut album, I am a big fan of songs like \\"Kryptonite\\", \\"Loser, and \\"Duck and Run\\". So when I saw that \\"Away from the Sun\\" had hit stores across the fruited plains, I picked up a copy. I was not disapointed. This album is one you can listen to straight through. The guitar work and Brad Arnold's vocals are both outstanding. While you may not find a smash hit like \\"Kryptonite\\" on this album, I think it can safely be said that Three Doors Down is not going through a sophomore slump. This album has just the right mixture of hard and softer songs, giving it a nice flow. Highlights include the opening track \\"When I'm Gone\\", which has classic Three Doors Down sound; the beautiful \\"Here Without You\\"; \\"I Feel You\\"; and \\"Changes\\". The best song in my opinion is the title track, a beautifully crafted tune that should be a big hit. This album is worth a listen and gets better every time you hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"3 Doors Down has followed up their debut album, \\"Better Life\\" with a great album, \\"Away From the Sun.\\" This is soft rock at its absolute best here.Those familiar with 3 Doors Down will find the same catchy tunes, strong vocals and good guitar that they've become accustomed to. This album is, however, much better than \\"Better Life.\\" The songs are very well written, and the repetitiveness of the previous album is all but absent here. You really couldnt ask for much more from these guys.There really is no weak point on this album. Except the last three songs sound somewhat alike. \\"Away From the Sun\\" features some fantastic songs, like When Im Gone, Here Without You, Away From the Sun, Running Out of Days, and Changes.This is a very soft album, so those looking for hard rock or heavy metal will be disappointed. The hardest song on this album is Changes, but its not really that hard. But if you like rock, or you like softer music, this is a great album to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"I remember when I first heard \\"Kyrptonite\\" on the radio and how eager I was to get the debut release from a no name group called 3 Doors Down. Since then I have eagerly awaited their sophmore release and now \\"Away From The Sun\\" is finally here. What the hell happened?! The great origional sound that I heard the first time around just got up and left. After hearing the entire album I am sad to say I am extremly dissapointed. The songs are all bland and tastless, in fact it's nothing but mainstreem rock or as I prefer to call it... ! I would advise a true fan of this group to count your blessings and listen to \\"The Better Life\\", which is infact the better record. I gave this album one star because \\"Away From The Sun\\" only has one decent track \\"When I'm Gone\\". Unless 3 Doors Down goes back to the way they were, I am gone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"OK, at first I was like \\"this is awesome\\" but I heard how all the songs blend together like one hour long one. There are some good songs like \\"When I'm Gone\\" and \\"Here Without You\\". But other than that, there isn't much worth while on this CD. Sorry guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"At least the liner notes and lyrics are spelled correctly...","review":"For good decent low brow rock this album cannot be beat. I don't over analyze it to death I just like to listen to it. Thier, oops, Their only failing is singing with that darned stupid southern drawl at those nascar races... Oh well it does sound great in my truck driving around South Carolina. It is unbelievable, I mean, unbelievably great."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 doors down rocks!!! and some people are really stupid!","review":"First off, I really don't appreciate what this one guy said about 3 doors down. I believe it was \\"The mississippi feel-a-thon\\". Well i read your reviews and you have no taste in music if you rate everything 1 star especially 3 doors down.If all you got to do is critizize everybody's album then you really need to get a life! Back to the review: This album rocks especially songs like \\"when i'm gone\\" and \\"away from the sun.\\" The truth is the whole album doesn't have a bad song on it. I would rate every song at least 9/10. Anybody who gets this album they will not be disappointed. (Also I went to see them in concert on oct. 29 in Johnson City, TN and they put a really, really good show on so if they are anywhere near you go see them!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Album","review":"This is by far one of the best rock albums to come out in a long time. Away from the Sun is by far my favorite song on the album. I saw them recently in concert and that will make you loves these guys even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way from the Sun is still super hot","review":"3 Doors Down's new album \\"Away from the Sun\\" should have been called \\"Closer to the Sun\\" because the tracks are blazing hot! Although, none of the tracks are quite like \\"Kryptonite\\", this CD showcases tracks that are almost as good that reveal a more mature side of 3 Doors Down . The single \\"When I'm gone\\", features a nice solo and has the potential to be a military anthem - check out the video. \\"Sarah Yellin\\" and \\"I feel You\\" are going to be huge! The CD sounds a little bit calculated, but in the end it all it sums to greatness. From the sound of the album, it seems the band is embracing their rock & roll side over their pop-metal. I definitely recommend this album - and ad it to my list of CD must haves!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, worth the purchase","review":"A great CD with several hits, I play it often. It is a rather melancholy album but still a great listen most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Well I bought their first CD and I believe this already out does the first. I am so impressed with this CD, you have got to buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2002 Version Of Arena Rock","review":"3 Doors Down avoid the sophomore slump with an album that recreates most of the melodic sound of their 1st. There are really no deviations here. And this album could be almost interchangable with The Better Life. That's okay though, as these guys are good at updating 80's arena rock. \\"When I'm Gone\\" goes from quiet to booming chorus(a theme that is often repeated.)\\"Dangerous Game\\" shows the band's harder influences, as does the Rush meets Metallica \\"Sarah Yellin'.\\" Much like contemporaries Fuel and Nickelback, the band tries to be heavy, but not without sentimental moments, \\"The Road I'm On.\\" Singer Brad Arnold's smooth vocals make every song accessable and will no doubt appeal to female fans. If they can overcome their by- the-numbers tendencies, 3 Doors Down may yet eclipse the popularity of \\"Kryptonite.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow's Word - 3 Doors Down - Away From the Sun","review":"3 Doors Down's Away From the Sun is quite a moving album. Every track of this CD seems to fill the need of the listener. It rocks and it moves. When you listen to it you feel as if you are truly part of the music.This album is a piece of art. True, it could have been made a little better. Just a touch. But nonetheless, it proves to be quite amazing. I would recommend this CD to music lovers without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons Of Great Songs","review":"They are older hits, but this album has tons of really good hits. It hit the right spot from the early 2000's for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformed","review":"I purchased this with the understanding that the video \\"when I'm gone\\", would be on it. This video means a lot as a Iraq vet that deployed around the time that it came out. I have been looking for quite some time and it was not on the bonus DVD that was included , very misleading . I already have the album and had bought this one with expectation of that song on DVD ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Away From my Playlist...","review":"Kryptonite seems to be the only song from this band that I like. The rest is very boring. And that song isn't even on this album. So I don't think I could in my right mind recommend this to anyone. I guess that this band just had a one-hit-wonder and turned some heads for a few seconds, then everyone got bored with the rest. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me Sick","review":"You people make me sick sometimes, 3 doors down putting out the best album ever??? Thats the dumbest thing Ive ever heard. These guys have no talent what so ever, every song is the same repetative thing over and over again. There is no uniqueness in the group. I mean come on my 10 year old sister listens to these guys. I mean I respect your guys opinions of music, but doesnt this group seem a little bit boring?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were these guys thinking?","review":"I just got done listening to away from the sun. WTF! This cd sucks beyond sucks. *hucks it out the window* I figured these guys would do better then the better life guess not. All the songs are about the same. Those of you who like the album title track......may have mercy for you. There's no greatness to it. I agree completely with the other reviewers. That it has no originality, lyrics are garbage, oh and when brad arnold is \\"singing\\" on the track I feel you...he mentions the new title for the next album \\"another 700 miles\\" which shows the album is a sellout. yeah another 700 miles and we will fall asleep at the wheel to this [...]. I can understand people liking the tracks chosen for the radio...but as far as album wise. It's no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band never was any good, and they just get worse","review":"There is no more bland, banal, pointless, artless, worthless piece of non-culture in this world than this band. Every chord, lyric, and melody is weak and empty headed. Every power chord and southern drawl infused lyric lowers the listeners IQ...and many of thier fans need all the help they can get in this area. This is music that you play in you pickup on the way to a NASCAR or monster truck event. Everything that is wrong with American rock music. They've grabbed the torch from Matchbox 20 in that department. Unbelievable lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A person with common sense","review":"This cd is by far one of the worst cd ever recorded. This cd shows what is wrong in the world of rock music, bad lyrics and repetitive song formulas. This cd and band is the epitome of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"More pathetic mainstream crap","review":"I hate this band. Three Dumbasses Down is basicly another made-for-radio band without ANY orginality. The lyrics, guitars, bass, drums, and vocals all suck. For good mainstream music listen to Audioslave, Soundgarden, Korn, Godsmack, System Of A Down, etc., etc. And for good msic in general, listen to Manowar, Kreator, Lacuna Coil, The Haunted, Meshuggah, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dang cd on the planet","review":"This cd is the best ever! They always make good cd's but this one is by far the best. This cd is in my cd player 24/7. All the songs are good... not just some or only a few. All of them are good. There's no skipping around trying to find a good song. My favorite out of all of them would have to be track #6. Here Without You. For any romantics at heart this is a great song. But the whole cd is great so buy it and listen to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Away From the Talent","review":"Liking \\"Kryptonite\\" and \\"When I'm Gone,\\" I thought this album would be a welcome addition to my music collection. Initially, it was. However, when I listened to the whole thing, I kept wondering if my CD player was on repeat since there is essentially one song on this album. It doesn't help that that one song is eerily similar to the music of Hootie and the Blowfish. What begins as a fresh, thought-out album all too quickliy becomes a droning noise that begs to be put out of its misery. I'll stick with Hootie and the Blowfish since they offer a similar sound with the addition of variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for family, but for just adults","review":"I remember playing the original version and that was fun. This version still has some pretty good questions, but they are more for a broader audience. I played with just adults and we got bored. The directions are not very clear. I'm going to either give it to my sister or just hold onto it for the family get togethers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For My Family","review":"I don't know if my family is just weird or what, but we didn't even finish playing the first (and only) game. They took it to be a strategy game, so they were guessing what the other person would say to fake them out rather than guess what the other person would feel in his heart. But the scenarios were weird and contrived so it wasn't like learning something new about each other. Those types of scenarios would never come up. I really wanted to love it. I hyped it up before we started, but ended up with a big let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would You Rather game rating","review":"The game is fun but more than 3 players are needed to make it more challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"We did not like this game, we have tried to play once, there were too many varibles.

I tried playing it with my family and with some friends, all adults over 25, and nobody found it intriguing. I don't understand what is so great about deciding if you would rather stand in an elevator filled with fat men with bad breath or an elevator filled with wet dogs. The questions were neither interesting nor funny. Everyone agreed it they would rather play a different game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"Ordered this as a Christmas present for my 14 year old daughter.

We always thought it could be a great product if only you could figure out a way to put it in a box and sell it. We could never come up with anything compelling enough to turn it into a board game, however, and neither could Zobmondo.The questions are uninspired, far too contrived, and are only an incidental part of the gameplay. To win at Would You Rather, you have to do \\"challenges,\\" most of which involve letting other players draw on your face with makeup. Seriously.Would you rather spend your money on a parlor game you can come up with on your own, or use it to buy something else? No brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you Rather be Pickled in Alum or Play this Game?","review":"Personally, I'd rather be pickled in alum! The \\"would you rather\\" questions are OK, but the rules to the challenge questions change each time, take a ridiculous time to understand, and many are just plain not fun. With a world of games out there, pick another one.

In this book, as you just might guess from the title, covers Excell 2003.This is probably the best book I've ever seen for the complete beginner. If you've just turned a computer on for the first time, this book will get you started very well. One of the tests I use for the depth of information contained in a book on Excel is checking to see if the book talks about pivot tables. These are handy tools to change the way information is summarized. Pivot tables, however, are a pretty good step above what the beginner can be expected to grasp in his first book. This book didn't cover this area at all.So the level of this book is pretty basic. It's not what the help desk needs, it's for the beginner. At the same time, it is complete enough that the user is not likely to have any trouble getting useful work out of the computer.

All in all, he presents an excellent description of what you need to think about, what technologies you need to understand, and the various tools that are available to assist in the construction of the site.The intent of this book is to enable to get a site up and running, fairly quickly (He says in a day, I think he is a bit optimistic, plan on a weekend, maybe even a three day weekend.) but only after having thought a lot about the various aspects.Then in chapter 18 he talks just aenough about things like JavaScript, database connectivity, cascading style sheets and more to let you know that you've barely scratched the surface.An excellent place to get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Dummies at all","review":"People buy this book to learn how to create webpages from the beginning, and I am one of them.

HTML can be very intimidating, like learning another language, so to me, and to a lot of beginners, their step-by-step approach, with lots of images and tips, was an excellent way to learn.

For many months I have suffered with my Dell wireless router - which would lose the wireless connection quite regularly. I had come to believe that interference was unavoidable in a densely populated area with an 802.11g wireless router. It was an act of desperation that caused me to buy a new wireless router from Netgear and lo and behold - no more losing the connection.Yet, I do not give this 5 stars. The wireless card is not Windows XP compatible and while it works on Windows XP, the interface is simply not as nice as the Dell wireless card.But the bottom line is that this kit works reliably in my home - whereas the Dell equipment does not. That is the really important thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Built cheap...","review":"The power cord was built so cheap that after only 1 year of use the darn thing snapped like a twig.

After that I discovered that there was a cover missing on the wireless network card and I could see inside the resistors and other details of the wireless card. I tried twice to report the problem but the outsourced service support was not interested in the missing cover and wanted to troubleshoot the device - no exchange so I consider returning the product to Amazon even though I like it but without cover sooner or later dirt and humidity will reduce the lifetime of the wirless card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work with SBC modem","review":"The wireless card works fine in a laptop however the Router will not work with an SBC modem. The router has the same IP address as the modem which makes it impossible to address. So it is no good if you have an SBC high speed connection with their modem.

After that, the router would crash and lockup my modem once a day. This is the worst quality piece of networking gear I have ever purchased. Netgear offers a short 90 day warranty because they know their product won't last longer than that. My router died after 4 months of use. (...) it is not worth wasting your time or money on. I should have paid attention to the other reviewers. I am so disappointed and frustrated with Netgear. It's probably only a matter of time before those with positive reviews have to revise it to zero stars when their router prematurely dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Experience","review":"I bought this at a time when I had a little extra money, but I knew I wouldn't be using it for about 2.5 months. Well needless to say, when I tried to install it at the 2.5 month mark, I had trouble. I used to be a total fan of Netgear products, but I will never EVER use them again. I called their help desk and they tried to help me. I went out of town and when I came back the same problem arose. When I tried to get help from Netgear again, a person on the other side of the world told me that I would have to pay $35 odd dollars for premium service because my 90 day free help had expired. I had the case # and advised them that this issue started before it expired and they said it didn't matter. I would have to pay for their help. Well I didn't pay.

Again, Netgear is clearly the culprit.It works great if you are in the same room, or in the next room in a thin-walled apartment, but otherwise, not very robust, and certainly does not live up to the specifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"WPA does not work for a lot of people","review":"I bought this combo because I wanted to upgrade my wireless network with faster speed and higher security. The speed is no problem, but the security is. After upgrading firmware on the router, I was able to configure WPA security (the best wireless security) with no trouble. The same did not hold true for the PC card...I got installation errors on the software upgrade for the card (you can't use WPA without the upgrade), and apparently for certain computers, especially those with AMD processors, the upgrade software simply doesn't work.

If you like Ken Russell and the kind of movie he makes, you will like \\"Mahler.\\" A lame remark for a lame movie. As an ardent and devoted fan of Mahler's music I felt compelled to watch this thing, but books are far more revealing about Mahler and his legacy than this pretentious and overwrought wallow in ponderous piffle. The one part that I did like, of course, was the music. Russell puts it to good use - but regrettably we don't see much of Mahler the conductor.

And do not believe ads calling this a \\"widescreen\\" edition. It is standard screen size, possibly because it was never filmed in a widescreen format to begin with.

The base story line is established as a prelude to what could certainly be hours of interesting and dangerous exploration through Abilene, Kansas in search of a fugitive from the law. The characters and circumstances are believable, and the action is fast and furious. At critical junctures, you are asked to roll dice to determine your fate and the next paragraph to move to. Success in violent events adds dice to the next time you must roll and contributes to your possible survival. Moreover, the \\"Code of the West\\" is apparent and frivolous gunplay can lead to a quick funeral instead of success in capturing your prey. Overall, I had a great time reading and playing through this and also used it as a learning experience with my teenaged son who was studying 19th Century American West in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pleasurable pain of Love","review":"I greatly enjoy the poetry of Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi. His poems move me to action -- they put a smile on my face -- bring a sigh to my heart. I have at least half a dozen if not more books by the Mevlana.Of all these books, this is perhaps one of my favourites. Many recent authors have taken to reinterpreting the Sufi Master; but I feel that in those works, the original author's message becomes intermixed with the translators'.In this translation, the translator has attempted to keep close to the original intent and writing of the Mevlana, yet not getting into difficult English like earlier translations by R.A. Nicholson.The result, to me at least, is a more powerful spiritual punch and deeper tug at one's heart-strings.If you love the poetry of Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi, this is one book you should add to your collection, so at least you get a better feel of his voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devotion at its finest","review":"Sufism is a word tossed around by Sunnis claiming to have any hold on the subject, but further inquiry reveals they don't consider it to be orthodox, with the celebration in dancing and singing and so on they don't think are halal practices.

It is better than expected. There is great variety -- different types of hikes for different ages and abilities, even backpacking. The maps are good, and each hiking adventure is well described with all the information you need. Much more than hiking -- also camping and backpacking, as well as fishing and boating options. Many of the hikes are great for adults, too, who are just beginning to hike or backpack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egg on the face","review":"Shame... Shame...A self confessed Ogilvy fan has finally found out that this Scotsman can be egotistic as hell!Ogilvy on Advertising was indeed a great book but this book... would take you to a completing different direction. The book was simply a self-satisfying, trumpet blowing bio and Ogilvy would just not let it go. The book was also like the man was trying to kiss his own rear-end.But... Ogilvy is known to be a proud man and you can't blame him. The man built one of the most famous ad-houses and wrote two great bibles (Confession... & Ogilvy on Advertising)!So, what do I think of this book? I think the book was written during the time when Ogilvy regret his baby is with WPP (I may be wrong as the book may have been written prior to that event) and the book's sole purpose was to reinforce his achievement to the world.Read it if you have the time but make sure you got it from the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Useful","review":"A surprisingly useful and insightful guide. My first response was that a style guide for email was oxymoronic; and that, I guess, is exactly the author's point. Email is thought to be exempt from the rules of clear communication; but of course, its not. The more concise, and clear, your message is, the more likely you will get a satisfactory response. I consider myself a veteran, long-time, high-volume, email user (Investment Banker: 80+ emails / day) - yet I found much here that I had not thought about before: unique ways to highlight key points, appropriateness of style, effective formatting, etc.. Includes time saving tips, strategies for managing email, and the obligatory reminders of the permanence of email, and the common pitfalls of casual usage in corporate settings. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Training Resource","review":"Helping people learn to write clearly, efficiently, and effectively is an ongoing process. This book is exactly the kind of resource I'm always looking for. It's comprehensive, yet very easy to use. The information is accurate and addresses all the issues that continually come up when people use e-mail to communicate (which is much of the time). The questions and suggested activities make the book ideal for individual learning, team study programs, and workshops. And the checklists, which can be downloaded from the publisher's Web site, [...], make great handouts to reinforce training. I will certainly use this book in our e-mail and writing classes and I strongly recommend it for anyone who is responsible for helping others improve their writing and their use of e-mail in particular.

Unfortunately, there are only 12 of them, not 16. While I have found a place for this in my home, I originally purchased it to hang in my classroom. A 16-month calendar meant that I could hang it in September instead of having a blank area on my bulletin board for 4 months. I now have to go shopping again, as this one starts, as most conventional calendars with January. The product numbers all match. It was the calendar pictured.

Anyway, I had some cauliflower in the fridge that I needed to use up. I decided to try the \\"curried cauliflower soup,\\" something I don't think I ever would have tried if it weren't for the fact that I had the soup book and the cauliflower both together. As it turned out, the soup was easy and absolutely delicious, even though I couldn't use quite the correct amount of cauliflower called for, and I substituted chicken stock for the olive oil to save calories. The soup was savory, spicy, creamy -- perfect for a cold and damp February night. I'm amazed that such a simple soup has such good flavor. That's it, I said - if the other recipes are even half this good, the book is worth buying.

There are lots of other styles of soup recipes in the book,such as consommes, bean, and fish soups that use different techniques, that are also delicious.

Plus I'm on a diet and I'm a vegetarian. So cooking is a bit of a chore for me. I've only made one soup from this book so far (creamy carrot) but it was super easy and extremely delicious. The most difficult part was chopping up the carrots! The entire soup only had four ingredients plus salt, pepper and a splash of olive oil. And let me tell you, it tastes outrageously rich and creamy! I've already picked out two more recipes I plan to make this week. They both sound very easy and delectable. My big pet peeve about other cookbooks is that you have to drive all over town to buy obscure ingredients you'll never use again. Not so with Saved by Soup. All of the ingredients are easy to find, and also, there aren't that many ingredients in each recipe, which is a godsend for singletons like myself. I highly recommend this book!!!

The \\"Fabulous French Bread\\" recipe starts with a loaf of French Bread. That is not scratch cooking. If you want a really lovely church supper style cookbook, this one is fine.

I have my favorites of course such as the Fresh Tomato Pie on p46 (sounds odd but just try it!) which always brings rave reviews! (You can add some onion and/or asparagus to change it up ccasionally!) Grandma's Date-Nut Bread (p 74) is absolute perfection to say the least and after first trying the Golden Cheddar Biscuits on p 93, you'll remember to make a double batch the next time!

The man is just an oaf who struggles though life.It's all a bit much.But, if you like seeing a woman's bosom throughout a film, this is for you.If you think the French language makes everything sound deep and enlightened, this is for you.If you enjoy seeing actors speaking directly to the camera, this is for you.This film is a forced and indulgent exercise producing nothing.Thank goodness for 1.5 speed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"Maybe it was over my head, but I thought it was pretentious, and actually repulsive.

Despite being perfectionists, the songs have a great slippery groove that only comes from playing many years. All the hard work has paid off to produce a set of songs you can dance too, but will find yourself pondering in the quiet moments of the day. I'd give this 5 stars, but I want them to reach for even greater heights. I hope the next album comes out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fantastic printer!!!","review":"I have been using this printer on a daily basis for about six months now. It has never given me any trouble, and was a breeze to set up. It even has a toner extension feature that gives you almost twice as many pages per cartridge, and the reduction is quality is not noticable unless you are doing a side by side comparison with the \\"non-saver\\" mode. I am just thrilled with this purchase, and recommend the printer to anyone that is looking for an inexpensive laser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my Life! Wonderful!","review":"After having a inkjet printer for the past 5 years I decided to finally get a black ink laser after realizing I don't need color. I went with Samsung 1250 because of various write ups - it has never let me down! I have several computers networked and it works wonderfully without a hitch for all computers. True, it might be a little loud when it starts up and prints but what you gain in quality and overall computing enhancement far far outweighs the slight increase in sound. I recommend highly without reservation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy at your own risk","review":"This is a nice piece of luggage. Roomy, not TOO heavy, good interior, plenty of pockets, etc. to separate liquids, dirty clothes, etc. BUT, big drawback: Wheels and handles are prone to breaking and there are no replacement parts or service available. The company closed up shop after selling a few million pieces through several mass vendors like Sams Club, etc. IF YOU GET A REALLY GOOD DEAL ON THIS PIECE & recognize that it's a throw away once it breaks, then it may be worth your money. Otherwise, I'd recommend avoiding and going with a brand thats been around for a while and stands behind its products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Luggage for Vegas","review":"I used this luggage for my trip to Vegas - Summer 2008. I was looking for something that matched a smaller bag I was carrying and this expandable piece was the ticket. I liked the cost and the bag arrived very timely. Also, it comes with a few extras (garment bag enclosed for the dresses or the suits you may carry that need to remain hanging) and replacement parts for any zippers, etc. that can get damaged during travel. Fortunately, I have not replaced anything on the luggage, but the extras are nice to have.I recommend this piece if you are trying to go minimal, but yet have room for all the things you might want to wear on that fun-filled trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I just really don't like how these fit or work. They are too big even for a 3 'n half inch base and it is cumbersome and awkward trying to fit it into the basket. And, I don't understand having to fold the corners over...this, to me, would seem to make the brewing take longer.

The water flows through the paper filter and around the coffee grounds. Since I bought a case of them I use one to cut a disc filter that I place on TOP of the coffee grounds, as the problem is the grounds floating out of the basket. Sure sometimes there a few grounds in the coffee but I have full strength coffee! Now that I am using a percolator to make my coffee I can't stand the taste of drip coffee! I don't understand how we have let these fine coffee makers almost become a thing of the past.I have a Presto 12 cup percolator and the holes in the basket are rather small. These filters may work better in another brand percolator that with larger basket holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"These work","review":"If you use a percolater, these filters really work. We have an ancient perc that heats to a perfect 195 degrees, and we buy real beans that we grind at home. These filters keep the crud out of the coffee. Since we only make 4 cups, our little perc does fine; we drink it all before it goes bad. I realize few \\"serious\\" coffee fans use percolaters these days for good reason. But our 40 year-old one really works, since it gets hot enough, fast enough.I've been told that modern percs are not the same; too cold, too hot, too long, or something. I can relate, as I have drunk some miserable perked coffee elsewhere.Long story short, if you perc, try these lovely filters. It might improve whatever you are drinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"FILTERS","review":"HAD TO BUY A CASE OF FILTERS BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND IN LOCAL STORES!

Not a good experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diaper Filters","review":"I could not find this style of filter for the past couple of years.Melitta seems to the last manufacturer left.The review were inconsistent as to how many holes there actually were.These have one hole in the middle and four holes on the corners.Some reviews stated that the ones they received did not have the center hole.I took a chance and got exactly what I wanted.The price can vary considerably.These come 40 in a plastic wrapper but some of the more expensive ones are in a cardboard wrapper.I paid 0.4 cents per filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never use auto drip again!","review":"After our last automatic drip coffeemaker died we brought out our old electric percolator pot... at first the coffee was full of grounds, not good.Decided to purchase both the disc filters and these 'wrap around' filters. After using both I must admit that the wrap around filters are the way to go! No grounds in the coffee. (The disc type leaves a lot of grounds in the pot, even with one on top and one on the bottom of the coffee).Hint: make sure your basket is completely dry before you try to use these as the filter will tear if it is wet. I also crumple them up a little before I put it in the basket. Push down to hold coffee and wrap up, couldn't be easier!I will never go back to automatic drip again... not only do we save money by using the percolator pot by using less coffee per pot, we also have never tasted coffee so delish!I give this product 10 stars if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable!","review":"Excelent and useful text, indispensable for graduate students and research ,athematicians working on algebraic geometry.

It's called WEREWOLVES. It is a whole bunch of stories about werewolves fromauthors such as Jane Yolen & Ru Emerson.There are some heart touching stories, scary stories and sad stories. The book has other fairy tale creatures such as fairies and sprites (and not sprite like the soda). Sprites are kind of like fairies although they're as big as humans. There are also stories about gypsies that are werewolves.I do not recommend this book to little kids because it can sometimes be a little scary. I do recommend it to people who like fantasy creatures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless waste of trees","review":"This is a pared-down reprint of _A Guide to Library Service in Mathematics_, which is still available. That book was a guide to math librarianship plus an annotated bibliography of materials. The annotations are merely \\"This is a book about...\\", helpful before the Internet, but now completely worthless. If you want to find a good book, you would now browse the reviews on Amazon. The only part of the 1993 book that is still worth reading is the advice for librarians, which is just what was cut from this new edition. So, I can't see any justification for the existence of this book. Besides that, the paper, printing, and binding are poor. I suppose the reason why they decided to publish this is to compete with Dekker, which has just come out with _Using the Mathematics Literature_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd Color Reads","review":"The scanner does its job in the very basic sense, however, I have had mine for 3 years and the last year it has started to scan red tones on all of my images.

I gave it 1 star just in case the scanner I received was bad. I actually wanted to give it a zero. The set up was so easy and the software was a snap to download. Hoever, trying to scan my photos, etc. was a nightmare. It was like the thing had a mind of its own. I tried to contact the technical support center several times and was unable to get through. Oh, the company does not have a toll free number. I also emailed them. No response. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software at least 5 times. It still would not work properly.

I really can't say too much more about this book without giving away too much of the plot.This book was horrible. It was so bad that I had to find out what happened to the characters. The heroine annoyed me to no end, but I had to find out what was going to happen to her. It didn't help that 100 pages into the book I already knew who the killer was and why it was happening.I had to read it for myself just to see if I was right. I will give Ms. Reed points for trying to make something new and interesting, but she failed to get me to care about the characters, and despite having a plot that could have been superb, it was weakly executed. She could have really had a winner with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw pink","review":"This was an interesting read. O'Rouke shows room for improvement in her book.

It was a good mixture of theory and practical use, as well a new and old. Kennedy added some very nice examples to back up what Dr. Maltz talked about. Hearing the two together really helped me to understand it.I have read mixed reviews about this audio book, especially when comparing it to the original version of the book, which was first published in the 60s. This one is great, in my opinion, since it gives you a different perspective on the original writings. Is it a replacement? Maybe.

Sure, it's big and cheap, but it also tends to fail a lot. Mine worked very well for a few months but by the time a year rolled around it was failing constantly. It does things like not processing entire pictures, slowing down the save speed and therefore how quickly pics can be taken, and just ceasing to function all together. I fear using it now because I expect my pictures to be lost, so it just sits in my camera bag. I'll probably throw it away. Did I get my money's worth?

The setup took about 15 minutes, but only because I wanted to customize my wireless settings. I am giving this package a rating of 4 stars because occassionally, I do notice a slowdown in the wireless network. Have not looked into it as yet, but it's not something that could be characterized as a \\"show-stopper\\" (at least till now). I have a older Dell CPx notebook with 128 MB and a 500 MHz processor and was concerned that the notebook card might not work with it - but had no issues at all there. I also have an HP Pavilion and a Vonage (Cisco) ATA wired into the router. Couldn't ask for more for the price (check out the rebates being offered currently by Netgear)."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 star if i could...","review":"Bought this at Staples a few weeks ago (...). It worked fine for about 4 days before the router started crashing (yes, apparently routers can crash just like Windows). The setup utility is a snap, but the connection doesn't last long. Every few hours, I have to unplug and power cord and in some cases hard reset the router in order to have connection back again. Flashed its firmware to the latest version 5.3 posted on Netgear's website, but the same problems persist. I would give it a 0 star if I could, but don't take my word for it, just do a search for MR814 on the net and you'll see how many people see the same issues.

Installation took a couple of hours - due in large part I think to my Arescom NetDSL 800 modem and its funky settings than anything to do with this product. (Last time I set that modem up with a wired router, it took just as long).Range of wireless access seems to be good - I can use my laptop down in my basement, 2 floors away from the router.One negative - that stops it from getting a 5 star rating - is the fact that the NetGear configuration utility which monitors your connections, seems to arbitarily stop working. It doesn't affect access to the LAN or WAN, but it's a small irritant nonetheless.Good product, great price (...)from NetGear."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a quality product","review":"i got 2 units from netgear and i was unable to get either of them working. the first one wouldnt power up correctly and the second one would not work for more than an hour at the most.i have been unable to get this router working correctly for more than an hour. the router fails after an hour. an immediate re-start of the router or resetting did not help. for some reason, if i wait for about 2-3 hours before i power it back on, i can get it to work again.the web interface is easy enough to use and all, but if the base product doesnt work well ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"The router has not worked since the day I bought it.

Not for the little ones, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not for children","review":"The book beings very well, and I could see it being a tasteful lesson on loving people in spite of differences and changes, but I was shocked by the ending.

The illustrations did not let me change the horrific ending for my kid, so the meaning was loud and clear.

Instead, this book takes a markedly different turn. In some ways, it's a bit like the story of Todd and Copper from the movieThe Fox And The Hound, as the characters change as they grow up and they realize that they just can't be friends anymore. However, in this book, the characters don't just mature, but physically transform into new creatures that look and act completely different from their previous forms. The book is very funny - even for adults, so you'll enjoy reading it to your kids. Really, I can't believe that some reviewers gave this book a 1-star rating. Do they have no sense of humor at all? This is all innocent fun. I guess if they don't care for this book they should, instead, read the bookThe Caterpillar and the Polliwog.

We got the book after having seen real tadpoles in a stream while on vacation. I read the first half of the book, but didn't make it to the end until she and I read it together at bedtime. She was mortified that the frog ate his friend.

I suppose they wanted to be creative and different, but it just doesn't work. To read the book, you need to hold it open long-ways, so the pages are laid out like a wall calendar. It is not easy to turn the pages. I can't believe the School Library Journal reviewer didn't even mention this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A practical set of rules for a new project manager","review":"This is a book that I wish I had 10 years ago when I was starting out managing major business development projects - the checklist model is sound and works to cut away risks.It has an engineering bias but can be refocused to business development - but this requires some existing experience of project management to secure the maximum benefit.If there is a negative, the book is a little thin - both in size and in business examples.It is worth a place in a serious project manager type of business role."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE O THE BEST COMEDIES I'VE SEEN","review":"I NEVER HEAR OF BEN STILLER UNTIL ONE NIGHT MEET THE PARENTS WAS ON TV.

But again, aftertwice weeks of once-daily use, it also just stopped in mid-use.I think the belt is too heavy and the controls are awkward.

And the fun begins. You may end up loving or hating this guy by the end of the movie, but either way, you will have had a good time doing it. It's just packed full of gags, and good times.

Has CSI ran its course can there only be so many stories about Las Vegas, there was even one episode that intertwined with Without a Trace that was disjointed. Grissom was god and this CSI was the best series, not sure now as CSI Miami seems to me to more watchable.

This makes it difficult to determine if I would say the following had I purchased direct from Amazon. The season had struggles due to the writers strike. The first three discs are episodes that had been repeated during the strike, then the quality of those discs are remarkably different than the remaining discs, they are grainy and unpleasant to watch. I question if the \\"new, never used\\" description meant???there will be downloads, copies, etc.I should have known..the third party would not reply to my email inquiry..asking exactly that information. CSI's STORY QUALITY remains pristine. I waited a long time before buying the 8th season. At the very least I have the complete collection. Let's hope season 9 will hold up.

I was hoping to get some insight into Italian before traveling there for the first time and found the same kind of pseudoscientific nonsense that charasterized my studies of Linguistics in the late 1980s. I have studied Latin, French, and Spanish, so I might have hoped that I could find an approach to Italian that could skip all the cloudy methphysics that goes into entry-level grammars. Even if you can penetrate the arcane treatment of an apparently overgeneralized subject, you may find yourself asking, \\"What's the point?\\" in a dialect of English that is alien to these academic types.

I wish I had much more of Mr. Haas' stuff.John,Texas"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic photo book","review":"Ernst Haas wasn't known as a \\"nature photographer\\". He was a photojournalist, one of the stars of the Magnum photo agency (an agency of stars itself). What he did with \\"The Creation\\" was take a selection of his photos from various areas of the world and arrange them to illustrate the story of creation as presented by the world's religions. The results are stunning and the book is a classic. It was one of the first photography books I was exposed to when I became interested in photography about 40 years ago.\\"The Creation\\" is not about nature or religious dogma. It is visual poetry from a master photographer. Although Haas was known for his black and white documentary work, he was also enthralled with Kodachrome film and color abstractions. This may be his greatest achievement as a color photographer. While long out-of-print, used copies of later editions of this work in both hardcover and paperback are available at reasonable prices. It is a classic book I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding peace","review":"Father Bob Stewart's easy-to-read book will cause you to weep and mourn, but his message is strong, clear and inspirational. He shows us that a life cut short by a disease such as cancer isn't a tragic or unfinished life.He challenges us to walk with our crises, rather than run away from them or bitterly stand against them. He teaches us how to find moments of love and blessings in our darkest times.If you or anyone you love suffers or has suffered from cancer or any other terminal disease, this book will be a God-send.

That does not mean that Korpiklaani is not as good as Finntroll. In fact, if you've heard and disliked the heavier Black Metal sound of Finntroll's latest CD \\"Ur Jordens Djup\\" then this CD should give you your \\"Finntroll fix\\".I wasn't all that impressed with my last Korpiklaani CD \\"Voice from the Wilderness\\", however this time the music is far more catchy. How I would love to go to a European festival and sing along to \\"Happy Little Boozer\\", which I think is the greatest drinking song a metal band has ever put out!\\"Vakirauta\\" is another favorite of mine. Really fast, fun and folksy, like some of Finntroll's earlier works.\\"Spring Dance\\" is a great folk-metal instrumental piece.Finally, \\"Rise\\" is a bit less heavy than Vakirauta, starting off slow and then getting faster towards the middle.So fear not, metal fan, let it be known that Folk Metal still frolics in Finland!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the World Going?","review":"This is a series of short article-type chapters on a whole range of political global issues.

This book was in print by at least 1965. My dad was stationed in Germany in the mid-sixties, a rather remote area without TV or radio even to speak of. My indulgence in chess was enhanced by this book to provide thoughtful provocation in an intellectual wasteland. It did, indeed. Foremostly, it demonstrates how not to ever surrender; rather, manipulate through the opponent's greed to commit the blunder necessary to salvage victory. I am a sloppy player nowadays. But I plan on repurchasing this book, as it's great combat training for the chessboard. And beware the unwary online when I'm done! NO PRISONERS!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluff, but what's wrong with fluff","review":"I fail to see why some reviewers think that every chess book has to be a masterpiece of instruction. Chess is a game and games are supposed to be fun. This book probably will not add many points to your rating, but it is entertainingly written and charms you with some classic examples of \\"the sting\\" among which even history's best players can be found \\"led down the garden path.\\"Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if it did improve your chess. There is a good deal of psychology in chess, and it isn't always just about the objectively best move but the best move to play against the necessarily flawed human being who is your opponent.Anyway, I first read this book many years ago and it is still fun.It is a little over-priced, but, since most of us tend to buy over-priced yet less permanent things every day without concern. In the long run, it should be more economical in than that last latte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternally entertaining","review":"I've had this book for years,and every time I pick it up I am captivated.It is packed with instructive examples and humour.Good fun for players of all strengths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Chiltons, not as good as Factory service manual","review":"This is a good book that incorporates techniques suitable for the home mechanic that don't have access to expensive factory speciality tools.

I have followed along with many of the examples and am extremely grateful for the accuracy .... it's as if Gaja & Kirti are working with you. I've already recommended this book to my colleagues and would highly advise it to anyone who not only wants to gain a more efficient approach to tuning but needs a little humor to keep the interest going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of vision","review":"There is a lack of vision in this book as to what it wants to achieve. For a \\"101\\" book I was expecting to have a systematic approach to diagnosing and tuning system performance. Instead it wastes a lot of time on very general statements such as \\"choose the right balance\\", \\"find the bottleneck and then tune it\\" etc. I would expect that such things are obvious in fixing any problem.i.e. you understand the nature of the problems and then fix them.There is a start along the direction of using a systematic approach but the author doesn't follow through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Oracle Tuning","review":"Gaja knows his stuff, he is the guru.

It took me into the world of seriously ill babies, not easy territory. Yet oddly, I didn't want to leave. Through Nancy Kennedy's rich and sensitive poetry and David Pegher's exquisite sketches, these babies and their parents and nurses come to vivid life. Each tiny bundle, looking precious even attached to oxygen or other medical devices, has a big personality. Each baby not only responds to love and care in a unique way, but also gives back a love so strong it is transformative, even to the reader.Amazingly, what I felt as I was immersed in the world of infant intensive care was not pity, but wonder at the strength and dignity of us all...the babies, the parents, the caregivers.When I finished reading I was surprised not to feel sad. As I turned back to reread it, I realized Baby Hands & Baby Feet is a powerful affirmation of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"title of review","review":"Wow, this is pathetic. Blatant Isis imitation.

If you're not interested in fitness or Pilates than this just isn't a good book for you, but if you've ever taken a Pilates class and are interested in finding out exactly where you're supposed to be during all the different Pilates exercises then this is a must read.Brooke Siler provides great clear easy to implement instructions and photographed examples of each exercise as well as modifications for both raw beginners and more advanced students. She also provides recommended exercise sequencing with tips for transitions and how many reps you should do of each particular move.I recommend this book for anybody hoping to take their Pilates practice from the studio to the home and any Pilates students hoping to move from beginner's classes onto intermediate and advanced classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best to get you jumpstarted!","review":"I initially used another book to begin my pilates workout. It never got me started. Then I found Siler's. This is the greatest book to walk a novice through the workout. I loved the fact that I could begin slowly (initially 15 min at a time) until I felt ready to add more. It has given me the confidence I needed to continue with the workout. And each time I have completed the movements, I feel GREAT! No book will give you the same results as if you had a live trainer, but this books sure seems to be close. I whole heartedly recommend this book if you are looking for a different way to use your body to feel wonderful. After working out in a gym with weights for over 7 yrs, this is a fabulous addition to wake up my off-gym days. After 15-30 minutes, I feel taller, more graceful and agile! And who doesn't want that! Keep in mind it takes time and patience to accomplish anything work having; this is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide for Pilates work!","review":"A fantastic guide to the Pilates matwork excercises. Although it is very complete and shows you both beginner through advanced excercises (with illustrations) I'd still recommend that anyone who is interested in Pilates take a matwork class first so that you can get the techniques down. Although they're not complicated, it's important to know how to do them correctly so that you don't hurt yourself. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"Whether you believe the hype or not about pilates, this book presents the information you need to start the mat work right away. There are beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercises available as well as a beginner's routine to get your body used to the movements and positions.What I like most about this book is that each of the exercises are presented on a single or two page spread, such that you do not have to flip between the pages. All of the notation, pictures, and recommendations for each exercise are included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it but ended up painful","review":"I tried it, but the book is rather convoluted, I find myself confused about the instructions.

I emailed the seller but didn't receive a response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Designed for Advanced Pilates","review":"While the book's layout is visually helpful, I was hoping to see advanced mat work, and it's not here to be found. For instance, The Corkscrew and Straight Leg Stretch were shown with \\"external rotation,\\" but no real elaboration or emphasis on this technique. Also, it would have been good to see an advanced (hands to ankles or feet) pose for the Open Leg Rocker. I am looking for a book with more advanced techniques employed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference","review":"I have gone back to Brooke Siler's book time and again to refresh my memory regarding the basics of the Pilates mat program. Her explanations are clear, her models great and her \\"inside scoop\\" (exercise-specific hints) particularly helpful. I don't know that I could have gone it alone with only the book to guide me, but as an aid to homework from my (terrific) instructor, it's been wonderful.I have 2 quibbles with the product - there is no index to the exercises; if I have a question about a specific exercise it takes too much flipping through the book to find it. Also, the format prevents the book from lying flat for easy reference. If it had been issued in reinforced spiral bound it would have been much easier to use for ready reference. As it is the binding is going to split; I have copied many of the pages and put them into a looseleaf binder; it's more useful that way"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for begining a home practice","review":"I love this book. I was able to move from attending class once a week at the Y to having a daily home practice. You will need to attend at least one class, or watch a video to really understand the moves, but this allows you to move at your own pace, with your own music (or lack thereof.) Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilates Body","review":"This is a good book that can point anyone wanting to learn to do Pilates in the right direction. The book is just filled with pictures, which makes it easy to learn the moves. But the best part is that there are beginning, intermediate, and advanced routines. So, if you stick with it and progress, the book just keeps giving you more challenging exercises to do. A great book one can work with comfortably at home without the worry of getting injured."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PILATES BODY, DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT!","review":"THE PILATES BODY is an excellent beginners and intermediate book for anyone interested in Pilates.

The exercises are clearly laid out, and her visual images are certainly helpful. However, the explanations of the fundamentals leave out key pieces. While she discusses them to a certain extent, she does not go into enough depth, which means that without a teacher, a lay person would not fully \\"get it\\". I wish she went into the basics of the anatomy of the \\"powerhouse\\", explaining the low back muscles, psoas, and transversalis. Without fully understanding these principles, most people end up using their abs in the wrong way. Therefore, I recommend this book only to people who have a personal trainer as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"As a Pilates instructor I analyze books for my students to use at home. This is one of the Best, with well written and accurate descriptions for form.. and carefully divided into exercises for beginners and advanced. Pilates is precise and it is hard to instruct in book form. This is a great exception; I still recommend a few lessons from a certified instructor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice book but what's all the hype?","review":"I bought this book because it's clearly photographed and clearly written but I cannot say it is the absolute best book out there. I have read through many of these reviews and am frankly confused by the cult-like following the author seems to have gained. After a second trip to the book store I found several books that seemed far more comprehensive than this book - not to mention visually inspiring. There are some beautiful hard-cover full color books with wonderful instruction. All in all Siler's book is fine but I would have to say that it's pretty much yesterday's news. Since this book came out a few years ago there have many books written that far surpass it. Just goes to show you what good marketing can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware beginnings...","review":"While agreeing with most of the critiques listed here - positions are demonstrated thoroughly via photography - I'd list one point of caution: the editing. The first 30 pages are a bit too preachy, and for the most part, not necessary. The subject matter is itself highly fragmented, drawing in buyers who are \\"pre-sold\\" on pilates and/or health. The trick for the reader is to allow no more than five minutes for reasons why, then get down to work. Work being participative and not being talked at."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilates Body - I am convinced!","review":"I had the occasion to thumb through this book at a friend's house recently and was rather impressed with it (and with the results my friend has had). Yet, I still did not run out to buy it, however, after reading the previous excellent reviews I'm ordering it asap. Hope I will have such marvelous results to report in the near future. Thank you to all of you who wrote such clear, comprehensive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much","review":"I had to buy this book for a course on yogalates. I definately was not impressed. This book contained a lot of the basic pilates moves, but it lacked life. The pictures were out-dated and boring, as well as the formatting of the book. I have much other better yogalates books and video. This book was about as interesting as reading an anatomy book or a calculus textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I bought this book and started the beginner progam. After 2 weeks & ten sessions I have had wonderful results (especially my arms and stomach) and feel stronger and more graceful. Don't be fooled into thinking it's easy, it can be a real workout. But I am getting better results than trainning with weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start but how to correct your form?","review":"This is a great introduction to Pilates with good photos and clear instruction. The best part is the enthusiasm instilled in the reader as you follow and the visualizations. I started with this book and a video and now I go to a regular mat class once a week at a Pilates Studio.I contend, however, that this book is not clear on how to protect your back and how to really keep the core stable. There is a figure in the beginning of the book that shows good and bad form. I swear that it is hard to know which is right at first! At the studio, I finally learned the true meaning of \\"core stablization.\\" It is key to know how it feels and how to protect your back while doing some of these exercises. Now I go back to the book and see it in a new light.I understand that a studio may not be in reach for all, so all I am saying is to spend a little extra time on the basic protection of your midsection so you won't get hurt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Time-Saving Workout","review":"I originally bought this book because I had a lot of business travel planned and Pilates seemed like something I could do in a hotel room. Not only was I right about being able to do Pilates anywhere, doing the exercises changed my shape so drastically that I continue to do this specific Pilates work out even when I returned home and resumed my normal gym and running routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Used","review":"I bought three books at the same time. I use this book almost exclusively. I started out with the modified beginners routine and have progressed to more. Pictures are clear and the style is friendly. There are a good variety of exercises and it will be awhile before I have tried everyone. I feel better after the exercises and try to do them every morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"Having no previous experience of \\"Pilates\\" I found the book very helpful in teaching me the fundemental principles of this extraordinary technique. The book layout is very easy to follow and guides the reader seemlessly through the basic principles to the more advanced. You never feel overwhlemed and each excercise is subtley structured to take you on to the \\"next\\" stage. The author seems to have judged the audience very well. Having had a personal session with Brooke at the re:AB studio in NYC I can say that the book is just as good as being there!. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for the \\"perfect\\" mind and body!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're prepared, this book's a winner!","review":"I bought this book several years ago, based on the rave reviews it earned on www.Amazon.com, and on my need for exercises to stabilize my bad back/trick hip. I found it difficult to follow, and nearly tossed out to the Goodwill, UNTIL...I bought some video instruction: Ana Caban's Pilates Intermediate Mat Workout, under the Gaiam label. Suddenly all was clear!I've come to really appreciate Brooke Siler's book for the wonderful, complete reference that it is, presenting Pilates exercises in a form that stays close to what Joseph Pilates himself had in mind.Pilates exercises are challenging, no doubt about it. But if I practice them regularly, my back and hip are pain-free and stable. And when my dance teacher notices how gracefully and efficiently I'm moving with regular Pilates practice, I'm happy and proud as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilates Body","review":"This is a truly wonderful and worthwhile book for anyone who is interested in learning Pilates. It outlines a mat workout for both beginner and advanced levels that you can do anywhere you have a floor. There are complete explanations, beautiful illustrations and tips which I found to be extremely helpful. The book very closely follows The Living Arts brand Pilates Beginners Mat Workout with instructor Ana Gabin (which I would also highly recommend). I am able to take this book with me when I travel, which allows me to do the moves that I have mastered anywhere I go...no equipment or gym needed. A truly valuable investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for beginners","review":"Pilates is very difficult for most people to learn on their own. This book gives great visualization tricks along with the explaination of each excercise. It great to have a knowledgable inststructor to help correct form, but this book is about as good as a book can be to teach Pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most accurate instruction for classical technique","review":"Brooke does a great job of giving clear instruction for classical Pilates technique while adding a little extra insight. She provides details that most books don't offer or most authors don't even comprehend. I like her style--it's straightforward and accurate, while giving a visual sketch of how your body should feel during each exercise. Along with a DVD such as Peter Fiasca's Classical Pilates, you can possess the tools to do Pilates effectively in your own home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Reference but First Take a Class With a Live Instructor","review":"I use this book everyday, but in reading through the reviews I have to agree with the other reviewers who point out that in the beginning, you must have a live person with expertise to teach you the fundamentals. We moved and I lost my instructor (too far to commute to her classes), and I had already bought the book and then, because of my previous experience, The Pilates Body was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information","review":"This book is great for those who want to learn all of the manuevers. It's almost like a giant pilates glossary. The 4 star review is for the fact that it's impracticial to try & do Pilates and read the book at the some time. A supplement tape would help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster truck came and ran over my picket fences","review":"This things does it all!! It take care of all your home office, or personal needs.

You can't beat the price on this one either. I've checked around and found this to be one of the best buys out there. I've had no problems at all with it. It's also easy to install and run, which is nice. If you want one machine that does it all this is the one for you.

When I contacted service they suggested I change toner, I had only printed 700 copies. I did and the first 700 sheets were fine. I got no relief from service (they had me use a pin and cover the toner and shake in a bag) I wasn't satisfied and brought it to their suggested service center. The center said it was toner problem & couldn't do anything until it was okayed back east. After 30 days in the service center they decided to send me a new toner. I couldn't sell the machine, it was a lemon (I wouldn't do it to someone else). I threw it out. I could not afford new toners constantly and service was no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Machine","review":"I bought this machine to serve in a small law office and to avoid clutter with separate products. The print function works well and prints quickly. The scan software works seamlessly and the feeder makes quick work of multipage scans. The only complaint would be that the machine is a little slow for the first page to print (about a 20 second delay). Having used many other similar products this one is a good value, easy to setup, easy to use, and is free from the jams and annoyances of most competitors. Recommend it for any home/small office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I bought a MFC-9700 from Amazon a little over two years ago. For the first year it worked well, and then the scan lamp started to fade on one side yeilding unreadable copies and faxes. A $120 repair fixed that, but then six months later the printer output started having an overall grey background. Brother tech support first suggested a new toner cartridge ($60) and then a new drum ($110) neither of which made any difference. The local Brother service center thinks it's the high voltage power supply, which will run about $150 to replace, that is, if it isn't the main PC board, which would be $230.My advice: save your money and buy an HP. The initial purchase price is just part of the total cost of ownership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor print quality.","review":"When the machine was new, it worked fine. But after printing 1000 pages, there are toner stains all over the printed page. I replaced new drum and toner(cost about $200), but nothing improved.Just like other brother laser printers, this machine has some design or manufacturing defect. The real lifetime of the drum unit is far less than they labled on the manual(20000 pages)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received chocolate!

Instead it's a hard cover with the history of the bunny queen Janet, relevant quotations by famous people, a nice ribbon bookmark, a magnetic snap closure and all three stories.

This successful Dvd moves along quite nicely, holding your attention while stories of biblical truth are told. The voice of the narrators are great and the angels are so cool! One hour of viewing is perfect for children up to age 6-8. Although perhaps you might want to pause the Dvd half way through and have a delightful intermission.The Dvd starts with The Beginning. The animation of creation is quite lovely filled with waterfalls and vines, starfish and humming birds, and puppies and lizards!

He never got the recognition he deserved. All the Curlyphiles out there think Curly was the funniest stooge, and while he was indeed hilarious, Shemp was also a comic genius in his own right.It's a matter of taste, I suppose. Curly was the jolliest stooge. Shemp was something of a sad Stooge, the victim of inanimate objects as well as his impatient brother Moe. And therein lies the lack of appreciation for Shemp's comedic talents. Comparing Shemp and Curly is like comparing apples and oranges--or cream pies and oranges.While some think these episodes of Stoogedom are rehashes and pale versions of Curly's work, I see them as Shemp reinterpretations. Let's let Shemp be Shemp.So sit back and enjoy slapstick comedy the way it was meant to be, an escape from the filthy and talentless \\"comedians\\" of today.

The performance of Britnay Murphy was okay, she could've been better. The Performance of Dakota Fanning was ecxellent it was so good. She's a good child Actress. One of the best i've ever seen. The story of the movie was okay, it was slow and boring. thats why i didn't like it.Plot. Molly(Murphy) is a daughter of a dead rock star who is living of his fortune, one day her accountant runs away with the money and there is only one thing she can do, and have never done. Get A Job. This would bee a new experince for her. She becomes a nanny of a Spoild brat named Ray(Fanning) who thinks the whole world Is A Germ Infested place. There is only one thing diffrent between the two. Molly is 23 and acts like a kid, Ray is 10 and acts like an adult. Can ray show molly how to become an adult?If you liked this movie check out the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Holey","review":"If nothing else this movie was cute. And that was solely due to Dakota Fanning. I think we can expect to see more from this promising young actress. Uptown Girls is a fairly decent but not creatively original story that was rushed. The main character, Molly, was highly underdeveloped, her life was confusing and lacking a certain depth and that glow that warms viewers hearts, making them feel more like a friend then an audience member. And her romance with what's-his-face-Egyptian-cotton-boy was very unrealistic and strewn about. I think this movie should have tightened itself up a bit to create a whole picture instead of a holey picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie of 2003","review":"I thought this movie would be cute, but it was the worst movie I ever have seen. There is no plot to the movie, and it conveys the stupidest message in the world. It leaves you stumped, and the ending relieves you as you can finally leave. All that I got from the movie was a snotty little kid, and a lazy Britney Murphy. The movie ended up with tears from the two girls, and grr, it was horrid. My parents saw this, and I cried when they brought the movie home. They were not fond of the movie, and my friend who I went to the movie theater with to see this movie hated it also. Please, don't rent this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy Nonsense","review":"I thought I would have liked it but I didn't!

An accountant steals all her money and suddenly this unskilled party girl needs to get a job. She gets one at last as nanny to Dakota Fanning, a stern nine year old who behaves as if she were a ninety year old spinster. Brittany and Dakota go through the contest of wills stuff; Brittany falls for an up and coming rock 'n roller (actually more a balladeer); girl meets boy, girl loses boy, boy sleeps with girl's employer - you get the picture. Actually the movie holds together only because everyone knows everyone else from being the music business.The movie is pure schmaltz. The storyline is weak. But even so, the director builds the story between Brittany and Dakota and it ends as a real coming of age and girl story. Not many dry eyes in the house at the end of this one. Not art - just fun.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"When Uptown Girls came out in theaters, I was dragged to see it by two of my friends. I literally fell asleep during this movie (and don't say, \\"Oh, you fell asleep 'cause you saw a late show,\\" because we saw a one-in-the-afternoon show). I, personally, think Uptown Girls is one of the worst movies ever. And the spinning--Oh, the spinning! What was up with that??This is basically a movie about a rich woman (Brittany Murphy) who is forced to find a job when an accountant takes her money away. She ends up being the nanny for a girl (Dakota Fanning) who hasn't got an ounce of kid in her. Blah, blah, blah, yadda, yadda, yadda... If I remember correctly, the movie ends with the kid doing a ballet recital with her nanny's dad's old guitars (which the nanny had to sell to make some money). So, yeah...I hated this movie and do not recommend it to anyone. This is one movie I would not even wish on my worst enemy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"And The Award For Worst Movie Goes To...Uptown Girls","review":"Brittany Murphy always looked like she had drunk 10,000 bottles of beer.

They react horridly to each other, but as the movie wears on, grow to respect and even love on another.

A few funny & tender moments, but that's it. Ms. Murphy, Dakota Fanning & a very underused Heather Locklear give fine performances, but the film suffers from cliches, a contrived (and unreal) ending and even worse deleted scenes (sans director commentary. It should have had a better ending (ie. the mother realizing she spent too much time at work and re-connecting with her daughter, the idiot guy realizing that Molly was right for him and Molly finding fulfillment in caring for the little girl). So much potential, a few snappy lines and good actors couldn't save this atrocious mess.

I liked that this was written before China became popular so it shows a true account of the Chinese culture and way of doing things in China in the early 1990s. I am not interested in Kung Fu but I was certainly wanting to read about China and a non-Chinese person's journey in it. It is a very funny book with some very good spiritual highlights. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny and fascinating look at China and Kungfu","review":"In American Shaolin, Polly recounts the two years he spent training in Kungfu at the Shaolin temple in China. However, the book is as much about the Chinese people and culture as it is about Kungfu. Each chapter is a separate story that illustrates something about Chinese culture or politics so that the book will really appeal to almost all readers, not just those interested in martial arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kung Fu Adventure","review":"This coming of age story about an American learning studying kung fu in China will keep you laughing and try to bridge the cultural gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a martial arts book","review":"More of a travelogue so if you're expecting lots of deep martial arts writing, stick with Dave Lowry. The author writes well and makes a good story. He also manages to get his negative political digs in at U.S. foreign policy and American culture, not surprising considering he writes for Slate. Kind of backfires on him though because reading this book just reinforces how advanced we are compared to China (more than 50 years). A good book if you want to read about modern China. Also a good book to burst your bubble about Chinese martial arts. As an asise I couldn't help wondering how a Shaolin monk would do in the UFC. Not very well I suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"not really kung fu, buddhism or burger king, but funny funny funny","review":"Although this is a nonfiction memoir, it reads like a very funny novel. Beware of reading this in public, unless you don't mind laughing really hard and having people staring at you. (ie iron crotch monks, coke dealing, midnight mistresses, etc). Interestingly there were moments that were also very touching and could really bring a tear to person.Despite this, the book gave some very fascinating, presumably accurate, first person account about China in the 90's, kungfu, and the most importantly the people there.the writing was extraordinary and fluid. The author has a way of making you understand and feel emotions for the characters he describes, monks, vendor, evil administrators and yes the author himself, without boring you with deep analysis.summary: funny read, sometimes sad, but mostly funny and informative and did I mentioned funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contagious casanova","review":"I loved this book, so much, that I had to keep putting it down so I wouldn't finish it too soon! The descriptions are beautiful, so much so, that I felt as though I was the painter in Venice. I have not been this thoroughly absorbed in a book for such a long time. Plus, it encouraged me to get all of Casanova's memoirs to read. To me that makes Lovric a true author to admire because I kept wanting to read about her subjects well after I was done the book. I've always been a fan of Byron, and this was just another wonderful portrayal of him.I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this reading experience, but I would run out of room and run the risk of boring people. My only disappoinment is that it doesn't have Kindle version as that is how I do most of my reading.Can't recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best memory card hands down","review":"HUGE memory card 2048 blocks. Since gamecubes are on the decline since the Wii came on the scene, I needed a big memory card to last and store all the saved games i neeeded, like madden NFL. Great card for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gamecube128MB Memory Card","review":"This memory card is way better than the factory-branded cards you get from Nintendo and at a better price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty","review":"I purchased this memory card about a year ago, and dispite reports of it corrupting eaisly I had no problem with it, it easily held all my games and seemed to work fine. This is until yesterday, yesterday I went and tried to play metroid, and a message popped up saying the card was corrupted and needed to be re-formated it said the same thing with all my games. If you care about your game saves dont buy this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a bunch of games...","review":"I used to have 3 memory cards just to hold my saved data, but now I only need one. I really like it. This Memory card is pretty and good looking. Its really only for people who have a bunch of Gamecube games and hate deleting old data for their new games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of game storage","review":"This was a well received present for my wife, believe it or not. It ended a running dispute amongst the gamers in the house over who was using up all the storage space for games (or overwriting someone else's). No functional problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed","review":"I really liked this book, out of all the other ones I researched this one covered a lot that is needed for many women. I took what I didn't already know, and still liked the way she worded everything else.I say a much needed book for women in all aspects; covers an array of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lazy","review":"This is an incredibly lazy print. It is obviously a scan of a more typical poster size and shrunk down to fit within 11x17. Note I said within, the product has a significant white border around what you are actually paying for.As the image shows, it is a scan from a folded poster, which I knew getting into it. But beware if that would bother you.My recommendation is that if you really want this then put it in a frame so it just looks like it is matted. I got this at such a cheap price that it's not really worth the effort to cut it down properly, at least not at the moment. It is worth the extra money to get a better print at a more appropriate size."},{"rating":"2","title":"An alternative perspective","review":"Suzy's conversations with Matthew always interest me. The information on 2012 and into the Golden Age is useful to keep in the back of your mind. I look forward to Suzy's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative and rings true","review":"The book is very informative. I like the simplicity of its presentation. The contents ring true for me. I purchased the other books by this author/channel. I subscribe to her e-mail updates which I wish gave more frequent updates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Systematic & practical approach","review":"Fisher & Shapiro have beautifully presented a practical framework of '5 Core Concerns' to enable readers to effectively utilize emotions in negotiations. I find the concept of the framework very simple to grasp, yet powerful to be applied in both professional & personal situations. 'Beyond Reason' is also packed with lucid examples which make it a truly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"deadly boring, but useful","review":"I've got some delicate negotiations coming up at work, so I wanted very much to read this book. It contains useful techniques, but it's a terrible read. It's boring, verbose, and repetitive. Its style sounds as if it were written in the 1950's; formal and stilted. I had to force myself to finish it.My guess is that the book is such a bad read because Fisher and Shapiro wanted to put their techniques into a theoretical framework. (At the end of the book they cite a huge amount of theoretical literature.)One aspect I had to laugh at is that they didn't cite Herbert Cohen! Cohen's first book, You can Negotiate Anything, is much more useful and much more entertaining than this one. In fact, I'm not sure that Fisher and Shapiro said anything that Cohen didn't say more simply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Strong Work","review":"\\"Getting to Yes\\" deservedly became a classic in its field. This book, co-authored by Roger Fisher, is another strong addition to the literature in this area.I did not like the audio edition's use of both music (very trite) and of \\"guest narrators.\\" These devices were especially irritating when you learn that the audio edition is an abridgement. By inference, it suggests that core material was edited out in order to make room for bad music and guest narrators.But maybe that's just me being emotional..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moral of the story: negotiate by being nice to the enemy","review":"This wasn't good. The reason it gets 2 stars was because of the depth of the material. So much packed into 5 discs. I listen while I work in the office, as I don't have time to sit and read a book. I suffered through all of it but got little out of it. Yet more negotiation stuff that unlike Herb Cohen, who offers practical advice, tells you how to kiss up to the other side and make them happy and \\"hey can't we all be friends.\\" That stuff doesn't work in the area of law, my field. There's no bargaining here, just long boring talks about how to reserve the right conference room and pamper everyone. Lots of long drawn-out examples of this too. Roger Fisher, I believe, wrote the book \\"Getting to Yes\\" and/or \\"Getting Past No\\", at least one of those. Those were great books. This is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"You better stick to Getting to Yes... this does not add anything new!","review":"I was very excited when I bought this book. After learning so many thing with Roger Fisher in \\"Getting to Yes\\", I really thought this book was going to help me become a better negotiator... Nevertheless, it is pretty much the same that Getting to Yes. It adds more examples about emotional negotiations as par example with your teenage kids or a hurt customer, but nothing that you can not infer from your own experience. It repeats a lot the same concepts (that is why you will see reviews saying that it is a boring book) and in general, I was expecting much more of this book than what I got. This is not a keeper. It is one of those books that were made to be read just once. You better get \\"Getting to Yes\\" (by Roger Fisher and William Ury), \\"Negotiate to Close\\" (by Gary Karrass), and \\"Difficult Conversations - How to Discuss What Matters Most\\" (by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton and Sheila Heen.) Those are real keepers!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a quick reading","review":"I read this book right after reading \\"Starting with NO\\" by Jim Camp. My key takeaway is the awareness about the core concerns that stimulate emotions during negotiation - Appreciation, Autonomy, Affiliation, Status & Role.It was hard for me to sustain interest with the book. I felt that there is more theory than real life stories & examples. Anyways, it is worth a quick reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very basic.","review":"I began reading this book with the hopes of picking up some fresh ideas on negotiating. As a lawyer handling divorce and family cases, I frequently see a high-level of emotions between parties and I was curious to see if the authors had some insight into how to this might effect negotiations. However, this book was incredibly basic, and I'm not sure who it was written for because all it did was state the obvious. There are better books available on negotiation and this book does not provide anything unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly dissatisfied with the Print Quality of this book","review":"The book is an excellent resource and full of useful information. However, due to poor print quality I was unable to read several pages in the latter chapters of this book. They were extremely faded to the point of being unreadable. I purchased a brand new copy of this book from Amazon.com, so you can imagine my shock when I got to the last half of the book and could barely make out the text. Not sure if this has been an issue for others. Needless to say I was highly dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything in a pinch","review":"I wanted a useful and reliable multitool that would be small yet sturdy. This item delivers all of that and more. I had no idea how many tools this thing actually had. Its a phillips head and flathead screwdriver, bottle/can opener, scizzors/metal shears, and on top of all that, it folds up to about half of its size (around 2.5 inches folded up completely). My only complaint is that its a little heavy to carry on a keychain, which only means that they're sturdy. These things are full metal and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedro Es Numero # 1","review":"Pedro is the best singer in all Mexico, because he's been singing since he was a little boy, and his voice has been awesome all the time not the same but both wonderful,and he's very sexy, has a nice body and a beautiful face. so his music goes with everything he has.

Do yourself a favor and buy a book of successful essays instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get into top colleges and law schools-- use these methods!","review":"Excellent book; if you want real advice on how to write a stellar application essay, this is the guide for you. At first, I purchased a few other books on the topic, but they were not helpful because they simply cited positive aspects of other students' essays. It's hard (and not advisable) to copy other people's writing. Also, these books were all about \\"selling yourself,\\" and produced very canned, artificial drafts.After hearing many great things about McGinty's book, I found that it helped me craft an essay which reflected my character, spirit, and ideas-- my essay soon dramatically changed into a more interesting and powerful part of my application. Using these strategies, I was admitted to a top 5 college and a top 5 law school despite my less-than-great test scores. You will not regret this investment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite college essay book","review":"Some people swear by this book, but I didn't find it that helpful. The book has some examples at the end, but the commentary does not provide much insight as to how the reader can fix their own essay. The writer uses quotes from different college counselors, one of which I found out is from a counselor at my school! What I most disliked about the book is that it gives more examples of college questions, than ways to approach the question. In one chapter, the author gave 3 pages worth of college supplement section questions but didn't give a clear way to answer them.I would recommended looking into other books before you buy this. Visit your local book store and flip through the book before deciding to buy it. I found another book I bought (The 50 Successful Harvard Application Essays) much better than this. It doesn't surprise me though, because it is branded by the College Board, which makes me expect vague explanations and no real purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so fun","review":"I did not buy this miniatures and a Braxar's War booster pack to play Dreamblade but to play D&D. Well, this collection do not have many fun miniatures. Most are just... strange.

Can't say if they are being used or are in the basement, since they were a gift for my sister who entertains a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marry me Rich! Or Steve!","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend, who is a golf nut. After weeks of listening to him talk about endlessly to his buddies - not to mention having him ignore me while he read it! - I decided to see for myself what all the fuss was about. Understand, I could give a flying fig about golf, but from the first page I was hoooked on this book, mostly because of the personal stories of Rich Beem and Steve Duplantis, the player and caddie featured. They are very real people, who have overcome so much in their lives, an despite all the obstacles, they both achieved their dream in golf. And, judging by the photo on the back cover, they are hotties, too! Although there were times when all the golf slang confused me, and I didn't particularly care for touranament action described (my boyfriend tell me it was very exciting stuff), I loved reading about Rich and Steve. I hope they figure out all the problems in their lives. They deserve great success, because they've earned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money .....................","review":"I found this book to be a waste of money and if I were either of the main characters....I would be totally embarrassed to have my immaturities listed for several hundred pages. We've all been young - and I certainly would not want my earlier days in print...I can't believe the characters let themselves be exposed like this - even if it is all true. If you want to read about a couple young men running around to bars, strip clubs, and watch one of them dump their kid off to any new girlfriend he can find -then by all means this is your book. If you were looking for some real insight into the typical tour pro, their caddie, their challenges, wins and defeats - then look somewhere else......"},{"rating":"1","title":"error filled","review":"I was one of the people interviewed for this book and am quoted several times throughout. It's a slip shod effort by Shipnuck that is filled with factual errors, misspelled words and names and typos. The author is desparately trying to be funny and along the way he stretches the truth. Beem's win at the 1999 Kemper Open and how he got there is a great story. Unfortunately, Shipnuck shouldn't have been the one to tell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dud","review":"This book is an annoying survey about the trials and tribulations of two immature young men. They are put forth in a world where the money flows and so does the booze. Halfway through this book I began to just roll my eyes. Was Steve going to mess up again? Was Rich going to be too hung over to perform that week? It just began to get ridiculous. The ultimate low point of this book was when Alan Shipnuck had the audacity to say that Jack Nicklaus' 1986 victory at the Masters was \\"preposterous\\". I wanted to throw the book into the garbage after I read that. This book was ill conceived, and has no redeeming quality. Please don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Writer trying to cash in!\\"","review":"This book is a terrible example of someone thinking what they have written is interesting!

I really was hoping to gain some insight on the PGA Tour, not a story about two lost souls who are trying to find themselves. I don't even understand the title.

Perhaps it was writing, perhaps the translation; just when one hoped for at least some anecdote to make sense, it got into some poetic pseudo-strain and so this reader was completely at sea. It surely was nothing comparable to Dogen Zenji."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't know, I can't view it.","review":"I bought this for my son because he loves Cat and the Hat, I bought it for a great price!

C'est bon les etudiants de francais.","review":"I first came across the Petit Nicolas stories while in French IV. All the people in my class, including me, greatly enjoyed these stories. They are true classics. While easy to read, they give the reader an acute sense of how French is actually used - in context. the tales are engaging and Petit Nicolas acts and thinks so much like all little kids that any cultural differences displayed in the book are easily understood through his eyes. I greatly enjoy these books, especially this one, and highly recommend them to everyone who wishes to read in French. They are not only for children and learners of French, they are for anyone no matter what their age and ability in French.

I even took a train to NYC in hopes of watching it, but the theatre stopping showing it a day prior. Finally I ordered it from Amazon and watched it with my girlfriend who also was anticipating watching it. We were both hugely disappointed. The previews made the movie look so intense but I thought the movie was weak. The soundtrack was one song played over and over. Their was no great revenge scene, the acting was almost amateur. Ugh, just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amateur film which shows the filmmaker's inexperience","review":"This is a film from a young film school student. It's about a group of half-brothers in Arkansas who hate each other and the violence that erupts between them. It's supposed to show the personalities of a certain type of low-class southern men who work in dead-end jobs, drink a lot and do not show much outward emotion.This is an amateur film all the way and shows the filmmaker's inexperience. The acting wasn't bad, but the pacing and editing were horrible. This was supposed to be a serious drama but I frankly couldn't keep myself from laughing out loud at times.Perhaps this filmmaker will get better as time goes by but I just didn't see his talent in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WALKING WOUNDED","review":"I'd been hoping to see a film that provided a thoughtful treatment of revenge, and this one does. With an undertow of Greek tragedy (the mother seems to fulfill a definition of the name \\"Antigone\\"), \\"Shotgun Stories\\" forgoes the reflexive fatalism of massacres that achieve little more than the reinforcement of self-gratifying violence coupled to (coupling with?) the pointless emotionalism of most domestic films, finally dwelling on something closer to the truth: that revenge accomplishes nothing but adding to the population of the walking wounded. Or, more accurately in this case, the walking already-wounded. The frank cinematography, understated acting, and the omnipresence of crucial events left just out of sight contribute to a highly authentic articulation of the subject. An excellent use of music, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Light flimsy steel, cheaply made in China, no leg supports so they wiggle and bend, temp controls are pre set so you don't have fine control.

So far we have tried tri-tip, pulled pork, whole chicken, chicken legs/thighs/breasts, turkey, fish, sausage, and ribs. Next up is beef brisket.This is bar none the best way to cook a tri-tip or chicken. Prepare/marinate your meat as you normally would and then cook it on high. Since the pellet grill cooks with indirect heat, flare-ups and hot spots are not a problem. You can cook tri-tip in half the time as usual.For slow cook meats just make sure you have plenty of pellets in the hopper. Prepare your meat, toss it on, and come back in several hours when it is perfectly done.Everyone I have had over that has seen the grill and eaten the food it has cooked now wants one.I would definately buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy it since it is made in China","review":"I was very disappointed this item is made in China.

He was right. Chicken was amazing. I've gone on to make smoked salmon and this weekend went for the 3-2-1 baby back ribs. Just awesome. Friends came over and could not believe how good the ribs were. Going to do smoked pork tenderloins and some veggies next.The deal with a pellet grill is that it dials in the low temps without any need to tend the fire - I wanted a smoker but don't have time to sit at home tending the firebox all day.

The actual meat of the story strikes me as somewhat less appropriate for younger readers, but in a day and age where the average 3 year old has seen sex on T.V. several times and witnessed hundreds of murders as well, there probably isn't much that the average 14-year old hasn't seen already that's in the book.I should note that there is, of course, nothing graphic, with regard to violence or otherwise, in the book. The characters are painted well to appeal to a younger teenage audience, particularly the main character who, while being transparent in his entirety, fits well in a book designed for younger readers.As the first book I've read by this author, Castle of the Deception was a complete disappointment, and it will be some time before I consider looking at another of her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy This Book If You're Using Someone Else's Money!!","review":"This has come to be used as a text or reference in the field of compound semiconductor epitaxy only because of the absence of anything better!

What is the range on these things...4 feet?I'm currently trying to find out where to send them back to Uniden for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless Add On","review":"Purchased this stand alone to add to the matching base set recently purchased.

Once it arrived, I found out that the TRU9460 was a standalone unit and would NOT associate with the Uniden TRU9466 2-line system.The good news is that Amazon refunded my money, including shipping. I was pleased with that, even though frustrated by the inconvenience of not having an additional handset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but doesn't last","review":"I had no problem with the phone - until it malfunctioned just after the 1 yr. warranty period had ended.

As a low-carber of many years, I have learned to use several dry ingredients together to take the place of plain flour. Even though I only use this as part of the dry ingredient mix, the soy taste is still prevalent in the end result. I now add just a tablespoon or so to my baked goods just so that I can use it up, but I will never buy it again. Everything else I have used from Bob's Red Mill has been very good, so I had higher hopes for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carb-free diet good","review":"This makes being on a carb-free diet very helpful.

But at least I can enjoy something more that green vegetables and eggs."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT good for low-carbers!","review":"If you are actually a low-carber, you probably want to avoid this product. Read the ingredients list.... it just is not low-carb. All the reviews that say that they like the taste are not for you. If taste was the only criteria that matters, that would be different. But low-carbers make choices first based on whether the food fits their way of eating and only second on how it tastes.If you are just avoiding \\"whites\\" because of diabetes or other health concerns, this may work for you and is a definite improvement over Bisquick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Protein, Almost Works Like Flour","review":"At first I substituted only a dash, perhaps 1:5 (Bob's Red Mill Baking Mix:Flour) in a recipe. I was worried the mix would change the outcome. Now, unless making something like a light fluffy cake, I make a 100% substitution. Great for casseroles, corn bread, home made granola bars (my repetoire). Great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flour Alternative","review":"As a type II diabetic, I've missed sweets most. This low carb baking mix has opened up a whole new world of creativity. I do use this 100% in place of regular flour with excellent results. I even managed to make blonde brownies (using DiabetiSweet brown sugar substitute) that turned out moist and chewy (with about 40 gr net carbs per 8\\" pan). No special recipes required. Have also tried muffins and quick breads and plan on trying some of my old cookie recipes. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product; great nutrition","review":"Bob's Red Mill products are all good but this one is really special. Zone dieters (and low carb dieters in general) really struggle to add old favorites to their menu ... especially baked goods. Bob's Red Mill baking mix is very much like Bisquick, but without the poor nutritional stats that Bisquick brings with it. Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix enables us to make pancakes, waffles, muffins, etc., etc. that are \\"Zone friendly\\" so we can stay \\"in the zone\\" and still eat many of the things we were missing while on the Zone program (which, if you haven't tried and want to improve your nutrition or lose weight, you really should!). Thank you Bob's Red Mill for another great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loving it","review":"I was so excited to find this Low-Carb Baking Mix and I thought that it would be of the same quality as all the other Bob's Red Mill products I've used. Unfortunately that is not the case. I've used it in several low carb baking recipes and it smells and tastes like FISH. (Or is it soy, as others have mentioned?) I don't know, but this product makes awful baked goods and the unfortunate smell and taste overpowers any other flavoring you may have in the recipe. I imagine it must be a good coating for fish though.I'm sorry I purchased this in bulk as well, as I feel bad about wasting money and food. This is not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy","review":"i was a bit skeptical about this, but it is actually very good. it tastes great, and the consistency is just a little thicker than you would find with a white flour. it is a great alternative for low-carb people. the pancakes take longer to cook than you would expect, and they have to be very thin to cook all the way. the bread was dense, but still good (bob's red mill website's recipe called for nutmeg but i strongly urge you to omit that ingredient!), we made pizza dough that came out wonderfully. go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, very versatile","review":"I enjoy using this baking mix for everything from pancakes to the breading on fried chicken. This mix has a nice taste and very good nutrition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly Understated Carb Count","review":"Not only does this baking mix contain fructose and turbinado sugar (where is the 'low carb' in those?), it tastes horrible. It is bitter with a very strange texture.The recipes are easy to make, but the results are less than appetizing. It was definitely a mistake on my part to order this on Amazon, since I was only able to purchase in bulk.This is definitely something to avoid if you have Type 1 diabetes. The carbohydrate count is grossly understated and will shoot your blood glucose numbers through the roof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent alternative for successful low-carb baking!","review":"I have used Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix for everything from muffins and pancakes to pie! I am very pleased with the versatility of the product and will be a repeat customer, for certain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for heartier baked items","review":"I'm a carb counter; I wanted this mix so that I could make things like strawberry shortcake biscuits, banana bread, and oatmeal cookies with Splenda. The first batch of oatmeal cookies turned out a little dry, but are otherwise rather tasty--and better than no oatmeal cookie at all. I made farmhouse oatmeal cookies, the kind with no brown sugar but made with soured milk. The strawberry shortcake biscuits turned out fine as well. Splenda works great with mashed strawberries. I haven't yet tried this mix with banana bread but I expect it will turn out well. Using this mix and Splenda, the carb count is quite low. I wouldn't recommend this mix to replace any white flour mix and expect the same results. But for heartier items, it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coating and Batter","review":"So far, I have used this product for coating meat and preparing batter for baking meats and vegetables.

If you wash it properly when necessary and let it air dry, then it will last for years and years to come. The velcro flaps are so easy to use for adjustment. I have arthritis in my hands and this is so much easier to put on the dog other than trying to use snaps and hooks.

The beginning of the book is dedicated to understanding and learning your pressure cooker and was a huge help as well as a stress reliever since I had grown up hearing those horror stories about pressure cookers exploding.Every recipe has sugguestions for alterations as well as cook alongs if you want to cook sides in the same pot. After trying one or two receipes directly out of this book by following Lorna's directions (in section 1) I was even able to modify crock pot receipes and slow cooking oven receipes out of my other cookbooks - I made a pork shoulder that would normally take 3 1/2 hours in the oven in under 1 hour and it fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pressure cooker; it was wonderful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring the Pressure Cooker Back for Busy Moms!","review":"This cookbook has some great 1 pot meals for busy moms.

For instance, the Pot Roast with Mushroom Gravy recipe can be modified to make German-Style Pot Roast, Pot Roast with Light Tomato Sauce, or Brisket with Mushroom Gravy instead.Although the cookbook is not specifically designed for electric/digital pressure cookers, I've had no problem making any of the recipes in my digital cooker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for meals!","review":"I currently live by myself as a medical student and I have to say that I love this book.

It was folded onto itself and was stuck together. My purchase was in December, so it couldn't have been from the heat. The outside leather had scratched on it and looked completely warped and worn. Was it left in the rain at some point? Also, the metal loops on the strap were covered in rust. I was extremely disappointed. This was supposed to be a holiday gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of bag for the money","review":"I'll just get this out of the way right now... the bag that I received smelled horribly when I took it out of the plastic wrap. Luckily, I didn't need it right away so I stuck it in my garage for a week and now I don't notice a thing. As an added bonus, I have found 7 dead mice (just kidding!) Personally, I would rather get a bag like this for a great price and air it out myself, than pay an extra $15 bucks to have them do it before they ship it.The bag that I received appears to be very well made. I have not noticed any tears or fraying. The zipper seems very sturdy. The bag is slightly bigger than I anticipated (even after reading the reviews) but not so big as to be troublesome. If this bag lasts me for the 5 or 6 trips I take over the next 12 months, I will be very satisfied given the great price. However, my initial perception is that the bag will last much longer than 12 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"was looking for an inexpensive overnight bag and this bag was perfect, great quality, good size and well made, no problems other a leather smell but left the bag outside overnight and the leather smell was gone, great buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"It turned out much better than I expected","review":"I have ordered this bag for the trip.

It includes two influential but distinct formulations of the argument--those by William Rowe and Paul Draper--followed by a number of essays written in response to one another. The list of authors who contributed to the anthology is impressive. Besides Rowe and Draper, the book also contains essays by Richard Swinburne, Alvin Plantinga, Richard Gale, Bruce Russell, Peter van Inwagen, and Stephen Wykstra.Like Cole Mitchell, I was also somewhat disappointed by the demographics of the book (10 of the book's 16 articles were theistic).

All JellyCats look floppy and not durable but in all honesty they can take the heat of most wear and tear an average plushie endures daily.

I was suprised to find out that it was NOT! There are some good pictures and a fairly lengthy bio on every actor (the longest is SMG) but alot of facts in the book are wrong. I guess you have to be a die-hard fan to notice them but I was dissapointed. There were errors that shouldn't have been such as the name of SMG's character in I Know What You Did Last Summer.

Utterly abysmal transfer.","review":"Don't get me wrong - the film itself is a gem.This transcription, however, is really bad. The original is 16:9, and the transcription is 4:3. There's none of that pan/scan stuff, which would be bad enough in itself - they just cropped the edge of the screen. To call it 'amateur' would be an insult to amateurs. Think 'bootleg copy'.This is the second example of crappy transfers from European productions that I've come across in the last couple of weeks. Both involved British productions currently unavailable in the US. I assume the business model is to provide USA-compatible copies of difficult to obtain European productions (c/f A Month in the Country), hoping that the target audience will accept anything.We don't. Anyone feel like producing something worth buying?And just to repeat - the rating is for the transfer: the film is at the very least ten stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cropped and Crappy","review":"Bullshot - what a great movie. It's a shame there isn't a DVD company out there that realizes this and is willing to give it the proper release it deserves. I picked up this DVD and couldn't wait for it to arrive - I'd been hoping for it to come out on DVD for many years. What a disappointment to see what a bad job was done on the transfer. Looks like a bad VHS copy; not even widescreen and the edges are cropped (actually ruining some of the visual jokes in the film). The extras - trailers for other \\"Handmade Films\\" titles like \\"A Private Function\\" are obviously from VHS (they look like they have tracking issues at the bottom of the screen). Betcha if people read this revue and decline to buy the DVD, the assumption will be that this is an unpopular title that won't sell.

The mouse also has an excellent feel and is easy to use.

The page back key is on the left side instead of the right side like my other keyboard. There is not a shut down key to shut down the computer like my other keyboard. The mouse is a bit annoying with the little red light able to be seen from the side.

It is awesome, the keyboard works great, though I am waiting for an update for the software (the media key does not support winamp version 2.8). The mouse works great. I found that it is jumpy if you use a mouse pad. On a regular desktop though it is fine. Also, both the keyboard and mouse work well outside of the suggested 6 foot range. Battery life is my only concern. I got a message on my computer saying the battery level in the mouse was \\"critical.\\" This after only about a month and a half of normal use.

SO they recommended I resubmit - problem is I didnt have the UPC anymore - I sent it to them - they \\"lost\\" it or destroyed it.

This book is absolutely not for the beginner and will make an intermediate think twice about what you've gotten yourself into. There are also many errors in the index which makes looking up information quite difficult as well. In all I would say it's a decent book but it could have been put together a lot better and could have provided readers with better explanations of what was going on in the samples.

The online catalogue description is wrong or the order was short shipped. Given the low cost, it is not worth the hassle of paying for freight and sending it back. Very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised.","review":"Product was advertised as 4 24-pk but was in fact 4 4-pk. Item returned over three weeks ago and we're still waiting for our refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Cookie sheets!","review":"I was very happy with the quality of the cookie sheets and the price was hard to beat! A++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' it!","review":"We have started this with my 4 yr old. She hated hooked on phonics and I didn't think Bob books were helping her as a reading/phonics program. She continued to show signs of readiness so we switched to The Reading Lesson. Each lesson is about 15 pages long, so we do 2-4 pages a day. She has shown so much progress in such a short time and is so excited to be able to tell her dad \\"I read THIS All by myself!\\" and point to the story she finished reading. She loves that I let her color the pages that we complete. Overall, this has been very positive for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my ready-to-read 4 yr old","review":"I purchased this book for my 4 year old who had begun to try and sound words out. The book is a great combination of phonics and, eventually, sight words. She picked up easily on the beginning concepts and like the activities that went along with the reading. We spend about 15 minutes a lesson 5-6 days a week depending what is going on. We are about half way through now and she is doing great. Comprehension is another concept, but she will definitely be reading early readers on her own within a couple weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading Computer program","review":"My son has struggled with speach from the age of 2 on. He is behind in reading as well now that he has reached first grade. He is in several extra programs at school to help with speech and reading but I felt the need to do more work at home. The Reading Lesson is a great program. Simple, colorful, and my son doesn't argue or fight me at all to do the lessons. It works fine on my windows 7 program (HP touch screen all in one computer). I think this computer program is worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work on mac","review":"doesn't work on iMactried to get support and that didn't work either!waste of money do not buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't do it for us","review":"I sort of hate to be a debbie downer here but this just didn't do anything for my daughter. She knew the letters and sounds of the letters but she totally resisted doing anything in this book. It seems to be the short words and repetition of those words, for instance if the word was \\"cat\\"..she'd make a face and say fat cat rat blat blat blat. (my interpretation is \\"I'm not a moron so stop forcing this gibberish on me\\")What has worked for her, and beautifully so is the McGuffey eclectic readers.Also, it is probably more respectful to the human being who is your child to allow them their childhood and not begin lessons until they are ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSE THAN DREADFUL!!!!!!!","review":"this book is SHOCKINGLY BAD;maybe we didn't understand the teaching system, but it has great long texts with little or incomprehensible punctuation.it seems that the texts are written by someone who barely speaks english.how can a child learn from reading idiotic paragraphs in baby-talk, with no capital letters, no commas, no inverted commas?THIS BOOK IS GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE FIREWOOD BASKET;LOOK FORWARD TO BURNING IT!my 7 year old daughter and 11 year old son at least had a good laugh reading this nonsense;an excerpt:Everyone says that Ping can sing.Sing us a song,Ping,we asked,a beautiful song."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD does not work on current computers","review":"I bought this CD to go with the book because the reviewers said the CD made everything so much more fun. Well, it looks like the software was written a decade ago, and it doesn't work on today's computers. I tried it on my iMac (purchased one year ago), and it wouldn't even start--it said classic applications are no longer supported. On my Windows 7 PC, it would start, but was horribly unresponsive. It was unusable. It took many minutes just to start, and once it started, it would take 1-3 minutes (really, I counted) to respond to a single click. I tried reducing my screen resolution because it would only open in a tiny window, but that didn't help either. They either need to update their software or remove it from sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reading Lesson is very effective and easy to use!","review":"We love this book. We homeschool and have found this is the best reading program for us to use both from the parent (planning time and involvement) perspective and from the kids perspective of learning in fun and hands on \\"reading\\" lessons. They are also learning writing skills and grammer with the lessons.My kids both have improved their reading skills within the first few lessons. They enjoy the short lessons, the pictures and the easy to understand codes for each sound. I enjoy the ability to move through a lesson at their pace yet still to be seeing progress. I also like the CD with the activities and fun things for them to do while reinforcing what they are learning in each lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"My son is just about to turn 4. We started this program a few weeks ago, and things have been going well. The book is helpful in warning parents not to try and cover too much material too fast. It's difficult for me to not want to push him to do more, but I think the age adjusted pacing, suggested by the authors, is a great guideline. The lessons are easy to follow and build on one another. I can see progress immediately, and my son seems to enjoy the time we spend together. Well written and manageable, considering I also have a 1 year old. Would definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Works!","review":"As a teacher, I made a promise to an older struggling reader that I would teach him to read yet nothing seemed to work. One day I happened upon your book and decided to try it. We started at the beginning and faithfully worked through your program. Right from the beginning I knew it was going to click with him. It is very straight forward. There are very few distractors and so easy to follow. Each page introduces just a few sounds at a time and allows plenty of practice before moving on. I love the controlled vocabulary so every reading experience is successful. The results were amazing! Seeing the results, I tried using the format with other students. Again, the introduction of a few simple sounds and soon kids were reading words well beyond their instructional level. This book was worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My son was so bored by this - sorry!","review":"Hi,In a nutshell, if you have a visual learner who likes colour, or one who struggles to blend this book is not for you. My four year old was totally turned off by this so instead, we purchased the online Headsprout programme and now he is a really confident reader in a short time. My advice is to go for a different book but if your budget allows, buy Headsprout because it is brilliant and it works. My son loves reading because of that programme.Hope that helps you.Faye"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful teaching program for beginner readers","review":"We started this book at age 5. My son just finished it. He is now an excellent reader. It was easy to use and was enjoyable to my son and me....
