In that, it is an excellent and worthy addition to the Dragonriders of Pern series.It is set prior to the time of Lessa and the familiar characters of previous books. Those books speak of a time of restoration, of rediscovery and of renaissance as changes sweep through Pern's society. In this book, that excitement is lost. If this book had never been published, the Pern cycle would not be damaged. In some ways, this story undermines the appeal of the Ballad of Moreta as the plot here disagrees with the story told by the ballad. However, this is small damage and this is a pleasant story of an earlier Pern that stands well on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Moreta is supposed to be some sort of mythological figure in Pern history, of some sort.

The sketch for spelling-changing verbs on page 21 and the sketch for stem-changing verbs on page 25 are unique and I have never seen the better presentation in other books. Appendixes D, E, and F also provide a more extensive list of spelling and stem changing verbs than most of other books.

Very systematically he looked for stories that depict a deranged mind more than real paranormal phenomena. The ghosts are living in the minds of the main characters and that gives a real twang to the book. No special effects, no monsters with a zipper in the back but phantasms, imaginary beings, delusions, all the result of a mind that does not know where to stand any more. And when you lose your footing, you have the tendency to see the ground floating over your head and the air harbouring a lot of incredible beings and creatures. In other words these stories are perfectly plausible, most of them, and they give you a real feeling of unease because you know you could experience the same thing under some circumstances.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross, but not very scary","review":"I thought the stories in this collection were well-written, in some cases sliding over into the realm of 'pretentious'.

I have 4-6 mp3 players as small or smaller than a tape cassette and they sound better. I will definitely enjoy having a better quality version of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Winwood is a GREAT ARTIST.","review":"AWESOME CD!!!! I love to listen to Steve Winwood's music. He puts life into his music. The music takes you on a journey you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!!","review":"I love the music, I love the lyrics, and his singing voice is great! Steve Winwood is one of the most underrated singers ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and buy Arc of the Diver instead","review":"I don't own this cd right now, but had borrowed it from a friend one time. This is music that yuppies rave about. It's just too poppy and polished sounding for my tastes. I think I'll stick with Winwood's Traffic, Blind Faith, and his first two solo albums instead. Of his stuff past the Arc of the Diver album, I only like the song \\"Valerie\\", and that's about it. I know I'm gonna get a lot of unhelpful votes on this, because everybody who comes here to read these reviews are fanatics of Steve Winwood, but I still felt like I needed to put my two cents in about Steve the sellout. His songs are just too saccharin sweet for my tastes, but I guess everyone's different, and have different tastes in music, but if this is your thing, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Minority Report","review":"I realize I'm alone here, but Steve Winwood's voice reminds me of a cat trapped in a burlap bag with a mouse stuck in its throat. This may have been a good album for the mid-80's, but it was this kind of drek that gave rise to the \\"alternative\\" scene a few years later. There's one song I like here, \\"The Finer Things,\\" but listen to it interpreted by someone who understands it, like Linda Thompson or Delores Keane, and you may see what I mean. If not, by all means enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back...Again","review":"I originally purchased \\"Back in the High Life\\" in album form in the early 80's. Loved it then, and love in now in CD form. Good times."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Traffic Jam Here","review":"I absolutely love this album by Steve Winwood. In fact, it's his best effort of his career. I know what you're saying: \\"That's a bold statement.\\" If success is measured in album sales, then this one is his best, hands down. However, it IS his best, and the record sales are a bonus. This 8 track masterpiece has some of his best songs, including HIGHER LOVE, BACK IN THE HIGH LIFE AGAIN, THE FINER THINGS (a personal favorite), and SPLIT DECISION. Steve Winwood was thrust into the spotlight seemingly overnight, and this album depicts the mid-eighties pop sound. It's a more mature album that appeals to an older as well as younger crowd. All of the \\"nice and easy\\" radio stations couldn't get enough of this one back in 1986. Steve Winwood is one of the most talented musicians in the history of music, and this is his showcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the GREAT Life!","review":"I didn't realize I knew who Steve Winwood was until I saw him in concert opening for Tom Petty last year. I looked him up, realized I had heard \\"Higher Love,\\" and that was that.That is, until the concert. I can honestly say that Winwood was the best opening act I've ever seen, and one of the best acts I've seen in concert period. This isn't a review of that concert, but it was amazing.After the concert, I was at a bookstore that sold records, and picked this up. Good stuff. The weakest cut is probably \\"The Finer Things,\\" while \\"Take it as it Comes\\" is my personal favorite.Good stuff here - horns, some upbeat rock stuff, and Winwood's voice, which to me sound relaxed, like he's thoroughly enjoying every moment. A solid rock album. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, massive hit","review":"Steve Winwood's solo career peaked commericially with \\"Back in the High Life,\\" which for a time made him one of the biggest pop stars in the world. \\"Higher Love\\" was a huge danceable hit and was followed by \\"Finer Things,\\" \\"Back in the High Life Again\\" and \\"Wake Me Up on Judgement Day,\\" on the hit singles charts. These songs are all excellent, as is the pretty ballad \\"My Love's Leaving\\" that closes the record. The rest of the material is spottier, but none of the songs are truly bad. Overall, this is a good album for Winwood fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I heard Higher Love on the radio a few months back and something about the music just hit home and I had to find out who it was by. As soon as I found out the artist was steve winwood I bought the CD the next day and can't stop playing the song Higher Love though the rest of the songs are good too. It's one of the best songs ever, it's too beautiful for words."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANNIVERSARY DANCE","review":"This album is fantastic !! Steve has been around awhile and his earlier work is great too. This album came out after we were married and we established that the song \\" The Finer Things \\" was to be our song !!

You have great dance tunes as well as R&R !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album.","review":"This is a great album that has many good songs on it. Every single song is worth listening to on this album. This album features the Number 1 hit for 1 week Higher Love. This album is a prelude to more hits that ould come such as \\"Valerie\\" and \\"Roll With It\\". This album spent many weeks in the top ten and sold 3 Million copies which was well deserved. Higher Love still gets much airplay which is good because it is a quality song. Good Album and Highly Recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Stevens","review":"Been wanting to buy this for a while and finally did through Amazon.

Cat Stevens first album is still as good as I remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Stevens at his best","review":"If I had to choose one of Cat Stevens' albums, this would be it. I prefer the mostly acoustic, piano and percussion emphasis in this one. Whereas some of his later musical ventures lacked the depth of character and sound space that these songs provided to listeners. I first hear Cat Steven's voice as the soundtrack to the film Harold and Maude - one of my all-time favorites. Once I heard his voice, I was hooked. I looked for a soundtrack, but at the time it was not available,. Now I think there is one out. The songs from that film are still my favorite of his works. Amongst them, Wild World stands out. My favorite songs fromHarold and Maudeare If you want to Sing Out, Sing Out, and Trouble, which can now be found on the soundtrack to the film. Does anyone know where to get a copy of the soundtrack these days? If not, pick up Tea for the Tillerman and one of his greatest hits CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL-TIME!\\"","review":"These words were once uttered by the world reknown music critic Ollie Chrisler: \\"I don't care what you say. . . it's just the greatest album of all-time!\\" I own a tremendous amount of music myself, and I have to completely agree with Mr. Chrisler. The caption says it all. If you don't happen to own a copy of this disc, your collection is incomplete. No road trip can be taken without it! \\"Miles From Nowhere,\\" \\"Longer Boats,\\" and \\"Father & Son\\" are masterpieces that can never be duplicated. And \\"Wild World\\" is clearly the \\"worst\\" track of the bunch. What does that tell you about the featured lineup?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album","review":"To this day, Cat Stevens is still one of my favourite artists. I grew up listening to him and some things just never go out of style. I own all his CD's, the Complete tab book to all his songs for guitar and Piano, as well as the movie \\"Harold and Maude\\" where the soundtrack is all great Cat Stevens songs (It's also a fantastic movie).

I can't wait to get this version on CD, I've been listening to it online fom a download site all this time, but have decided to re-add it back into my collection. I've missed it sorely. Highly recommended for EVERYONE! Doesn't matter what genre you normally listen to, this album is THAT good! Cat's voice has a unique sound and I love his guitar style, powerful \\"happy music\\" (compared to the Pantera, Tool, and Megadeth I listen to now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat's Tongue","review":"When the album was produced Cat was bantering with Hal Ashby about which numbers could be included in the movie \\"Harold and Maude\\" (Bud Cort & Ruth Gordan)...He eventually recorded the most memorable rendition of poetic lyrics to be backdropped into an obvious antisocial medium. The movie and album became an anthem for many of us. There was never a soundtrack for the film so those of us who enjoyed the visual rely upon this inspiring collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never could I rate it any less","review":"To me, I feel so close to Cat Stevens as I listen to his peaceful music.

Who is this psycho-chick?\\". Get to know this album well; buy it, listen to it, listen to it again, listen to it again, and so on until you can memorize a bit of the lyrics.

It's the best $30 a vinyl fan can spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album, watch Barron Laycock","review":"This is a great early album by Cat Stevens. Songs like Wild World, Where Do the Children Play, and On the Road to Find Out are terrific. While I'm reviewing this, I'd like to point out the reviews of someone named Barron Laycock(Labradorman). He uses the same review for almost all of Cat's albums, just substituting in songs with each album. He does the same thing for other artists, too.

I thought Jumbo and The Pajama Game would NEVER end. Even Jimmy Durante couldn't save Jumbo! And The Glass Bottom Boat wasn't even worthy of the Three Stooges.

Over time scepticism about the possibilities of science and technology has waned. Unfortunately for us the world was not yet ready for Tesla, this man out of time, and he died with his greatest achievments alive only in his mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty fascinating stuff","review":"Once I got by the romantic flair of the first pages, I really enjoyed O'Neill's biography of Tesla. The subject of Tesla's life is certainly fascinating. He was a true visionary and a man well before his time.Minus one star for the romance (Is this typical of biographies of the era? I don't know.), for some circular logic (punishing Marconi for not seeing the potential of wireless transmission but lauding Tesla generating the first X-rays even though he did not grasp their potential).Over all, an informative and enjoyable read.P.S.

The author was science editor for the New York Herald Tribune, but like so many Tesla enthusiasts today, was uncritical of Tesla's theoretical ideas, neither recasting them in today's language of physics, nor criticizing them where they are clearly wrong (or wrong-headed).

But this one is ROOMY and has a place for EVERYTHING and then some.There won't be a need to carry a purse either when you have this.This is a little more than most diaper bags, but this a spurge I would not pass up.This even gives my high end bags a run for there money, move over gucci & louis... there's a new bag in town!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$ ??","review":"I gave this bag for a baby shower gift (mother had registered for it).

To lug this around (does not have a shoulder strap to throw over stroller bar) all day long with a toddler, is just too much. I returned this and bought the Pink Camouflage Messenger Bag by Wendy Bellissimo instead... Its just as beautiful and has a ton of room for everyone's stuff, but it also has a shoulder strap so that you can hang it on your stroller when you are out and about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to print","review":"I have ordered (and received) the paper/label set to print pictures in small format.I have also ordered the paper tray that goes with it otherwise it is not possible to print.

So, I'm stuck with the expensive paper and ink and won't be able to use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable account","review":"I believe that one of the strongest things that exists is a true account that has the ring of authenticity - not an account where the teller has an agenda, or is trying for self-aggrandizement. This story is very powerful; it is the telling of the author's survival from the Death March and his encounters with true followers of Christianity. It is one of the best books I've ever read, powerful in its sincerity and authenticity. The horrific acts were here, but also great acts of compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gospel Lived Out","review":"The book traces the transformation of the author's life and the life of the Japanese POW camp in which he was incarcerated. It is a beautiful book. The Japanese created an environment in which each prisoner lived for himself in a desperate struggle to survive. As a result, life was cheapened, prisoner stole from prisoner and many lost the will to struggle to live. Then, as if from no where, isolated acts of great courage and sacrifice arrested the camp's slide into hell. Men began to ask the question if there was some purpose to life beyond self. Groups formed to discuss the question. From that emerged groups who began serving others. The answer they discovered was that Jesus Christ had suffered much like they were suffering and yet was able to serve others and ultimately die for their sin. The camp was transformed. Men used their talents to serve their fellow prisoners. It is an incredible read.Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable testament to the power of Christ's love!","review":"This book will move you like few others. It portrays a typical soldier who becomes a loyal follower of Jesus Christ. This is NOT a war story, but a story of the good that is possible within mankind. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Principles and soon to be a major movie","review":"The book--a true story--has incredible principles even though it is not well written. It was hard to put it down. The author showed how creativity could spring forth amidst horrendous cruelty, starvation, and isolation when military prisoners of war forsook their own selfishness and began help others. It not only saved their own lives, but because it gave purpose to their otherwise hopeless situations, an environment was fostered that gave true hope and purpose in their existing situations.

In fact, it is probably the strongest LP of his career as it is imbued with a coherence and a complexity that binds these shimmering pop songs together. His voice soars. Years had done nothing to diminish his multi-octave crooning... and the wisdom of middle age had added a certain poingancy to each trembling note. These are songs about lost love and broken dreams... beautifully arranged, breathtakingly sung. The production is a little slick and compressed, but Roy's voice is captured perfectly. You can hear every nuance of his phrasing. Sadly,this album is often overlooked. I beleive it stands as one of a handful of great records from the last two decades... this from some one who was supposed to be \\"irrelevant\\" by the beginning of the '70's. Roy Orbison, we miss you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more mature music from the Roy....","review":"I am a latecomer to Roy Orbison's long list of fans when I bought the DVD of \\"A Black and White Night.\\"I cannot heap enough praise upon this album. The band playing behind him is of first quality, and so is Roy... anyone thinking that Orbison's voice diminished with the years will be pleasantly surprised that Roy had the voice to the end of his years. The album demonstrates that his later work was a more sophisticated type of music, glorious in presentation and listening pleasure.I can only marvel what the man would have written if he had lived to a ripe old age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fitting End to a Legendary Career","review":"Roy Orbison had a rather tragic life when it came to his personal life. Much of the pain he sang about through his career came from actual pain he had to endure. However, his last moments on earth produced what probably is his best work ever. Roy's talent had such an influence on so many artists and those artists let him know that, by producing these wonderful cuts. Although each song is great and the Big O at his best, \\"Mystery Girl\\" is truly the masterpiece. Thanks to this great album, a new generation was introduced to one of our greatest musical artists, that is something I am sure brought happiness to Roy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love So Beautiful","review":"Today, after happily ordering the Traveling Wilburys' re-release, I became nostalgic about Roy Orbison & George Harrison, two of my all-time favorites. When I looked at comments on Mystery Girl, I was delighted to see that most listeners rate this album 5 stars. But, I noticed that \\"A Love So Beautiful\\" is rarely mentioned. Please listen to it again -- it is outstanding. I rate it as one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. This album was a gift for my birthday in 1989, and even after 18 years, I still am awed each time I hear Roy hit that high note in the word \\"away.\\" If you're undecided as to whether or not to purchase this album, DO! It's wonderul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic sound updated!","review":"I knew I liked \\"You got it\\" so thought I'd take a chance on this cd. When I received it and listened though, I was blown away! Roy's voice is perfect for these songs and some, like \\"Windsurfer\\" hark back to his popular classics. But you have just got to listen to: She's a Mystery to Me, California Blue, and \\"In the Real World.\\" I pretty much liked the whole cd, but the songs I mentioned would make it worth it even if I didn't like the rest. This is the first time I have ever been moved to rate anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysteriously beautiful","review":"I don't know if the editors had noticed - Roy Orbison passed away in December 1988, BEFORE Mystery Girl was issued and not AFTER. Otherwise, I don't have much to say - California Blue is still one of the most beautiful songs ever and this album is only a hint at what Big O could've done if he had lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"His last solo album, and he still had it.","review":"This is Roy's last solo album, and is one of his best. He still had vocal control, and that wonderful quality in his voice. A must-have for Roy's fans, both old and new."},{"rating":"2","title":"An LP So Beautiful","review":"There is/was no voice like Roy Orbison's! This is his last LP. And it's amazing!Just listen to \\"A Love So Beautiful\\" and you'll know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"I first read this book many years ago and returning to it recently found it had lost none of its charm. The characterisation is beautifully crafted and the story of John's progression (told through the eyes of his friend) from being a poor orphan to a wealthy businessman is gripping and endearing. Dinah Craik seems to have gone out of fashion nowadays but I highly recommend this book as a really good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock In Japan","review":"This is standard Koontz fare, elevated by wonderful local color in Kyoto. It reads very much like a Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn intrigue/love story, the sort of thing Stanley Donen or Alfred Hitchcock would direct: the heroine is suffering from inexplicable amnesia, and the hero is a spy whose loyalties are in doubt. There's just enough suggestion of kinky weirdness to float it through - a bizarre character with metal hands, for instance. It's a bit long for what it is, but it satisfies."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT...BUT STILL COOL BEANS!","review":"I didn't think I was going to like this book at first (which is exactly what I thought about my favorite book so that says something right there, hint hint: my fave book is 'Dark Rivers of the Heart;' if you haven't read it ya desperately need to) but this one was pretty cool! All the psychological stuff was neat but the dreams were kind of freaky! You can tell Koontz has considerably deep pockets (duh!) 'cause the way everyone always orders the quote/unquote 'proper' this and 'proper' that. But anyways, I LOVE this book and it was event the inspiration for one of the books I'm currently writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This is Koontz' premier, first printed in June '79. The text has since been re-worked to include modern events such as the fall of the Soviet Union, Lexus cars, etc. I found it a great read and not predictable which today is reason enough to read it. The words flow seamlessly in typical Koontz style, while the international stage adds excitement, from exotic Japan to remote Saint Moritz, cold war antics and all. Even includes hilarious East End London Cockney dialect, not to be missed! My 2nd book of his, I'm hooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a re-run in print.","review":"Take one part 'The House of Thunder' (beautiful woman, mysterious past, political intrigue). Add a dash of 'Strangers' (science used to play with people's minds). Mix in two scoops of 'The Door to December' (abusive parent of main character).

My wife thought I would like it because it was about photography, which it was not. A powerful spanning of the century from a field in Belgium before WWI to the Detroit Insitute of Fine Art in the mid Nineties. Swept me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enormously clever and quite moving tale of the 20th century and what it means","review":"A photo - literally, of three farmers on their way to a dance, taken by August Sander in 1914 - shows us the last moments before the calamitous 20th century hit western civilization full force, with atrocities and dislocation and the good and evil of the modern world. Richard Powers takes this indelible image and weaves a brilliant three-part tale: of two men looking for answers to what the picture signified, many years later, and then (as a counterpoint) the \\"real\\" story of those farmers from long ago. The less you know the better, but anyone interested in the ways the fiction can uncover the truth behind history, or restore humanity to cold facts of the past, should read this remarkable book. This was Powers' first book, years before he achieved fame and (well deserved) accolades, but he was clearly a fully formed genius from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powers' second-best novel","review":"'The Gold Bug Variations' is his best. This one, so entirely different, is almost as good. I tell people about it all the time, since it isn't very well known. Try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of entertaining reading","review":"This book is one of my favorites and something I return to again and again. It is a collection of nuggets from all of time and geography. I love to come back to it again and again. Professor Camp has done a great service in mining a huge assortment of quotable quotes and jokes from all of western literature. My favorites are No idea is dangerous unless it's the only one you've got. Young men think old men are fools but old men Know young men are. It is a good read and well worth the money. One of the few books I have given as a gift repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little pin nailer","review":"Complaints about other brands of 23 gauge pin nailers not countersinking the pins don't apply to this Nikle. The instructions say use 70 - 100 psi, and I found that 1-9/16 pins countersink fine in pine with 80 psi. For 3/4\\" oak you might have to dial up the pressure a bit, say to 90 psi. You have to get used to the second safety trigger, but that takes only a couple practice shots, which you should always do anyway with a new pressure setting or different pin size. As for handle size, I wear size 9-1/2 gloves, and the handle is plenty big for my fingers; I think you'd have to have really big hands for this to be an issue. I like the size because it can get into tight spots that an 18 gauge brad nailer won't. This tool is sweet, and the price is quite reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I am an artist hand pouring pewter jewelry for a living.I have used many brands of polish cloths and stocked many to sell or give to customers. This is an excellent value!I would rate it a 4 star of 5 on how it works. It isn't quite as agressive on hard to remove tarnish. But works excellent on light to modest tarnish which is what most folks deal with. If used often it will easily keep pieces bright and shiny.The biggest selling point is the price.There is a major difference in price from other brands. I often give them out free to valued customers. This is not something I could even think of doing with other brands. I am very happy with how it works. For extreme tarnish I usually look for more aggressive products or use the polish wheel in the shop.Helpful hint...it's a good idea to wipe your jewelry with a clean soft cloth after polishing to remove any dust that may be on it. That way it will be clean and won't get tarnish on your clothes later."},{"rating":"2","title":"a teacher in your home","review":"perfect for that little bit of extra explanation - good for intermediate algebra"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect textbook companion","review":"Not a stand alone Alegebra course but an excellent tool to reinforce what you've learned in class.

Dada has been around since the early nineties, and after a hiatus of sorts, they reformed to produce \\"How To Be Found\\". I'll echo what many other reviews and comments here and across the Internet say: dada is the most under-rated power trio of the nineties and now. These guys are musician's musicians! And HTBF is as good as their first album, \\"Puzzle\\". If you're new to dada, pick either or both of these albums, then dive into their other releases for more goodness. And if you EVER get a chance to see them live, you MUST go! You will not be disappointed ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS..dada fans","review":"Great every show since early 90's...Most underknown band of 90's through now...AND I LIKE IT THAT WAY...a band most will miss out on...and look back on..If they know HOW TO BE FOUND.....hopefully you do..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not find this CD","review":"Let me preface my rant by telling you that Dada's first three CDs were brilliant. They were clever, edgy, and contained some of the best rock harmonies that I have ever heard. \\"Puzzle\\", \\"American Highway Flower\\", and \\"El Subliminoso\\" is Dada for me. They took a few years off and came back with a self titled CD that was much weaker but still OK... and now this, \\"How to be found.\\" I just can't believe that it took these guys 6 years to come up with this incredibly sappy music. The lyrics are shallow. The harmonies are the same. The music is almost totally lacking of hooks. If you want some Dada (and everyone should have some of their CDs), do not waste your money on this latest title in their catalogue. Buy the first 3 CDs and say Hello/Goodbye to a wonderfully tallented trio who has just over-stayed their creative moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge fan....of ANY other dada album","review":"Huge dada fan here. Have seen them every single time they've made it Mpls. Given that, this album is just weak, and not nearly to the level of the dada pre-hiatus era.My main complaint is the poor sound/mixing/mastering/whatever. Not sure if this comes from self-production or what (they wouldn't be the first band to suffer after doing it themselves--see King's X). My other complaint is the song writing, just not up to par.The independent projects by the guys sound fine, I'm just not sure what went wrong here. The vocals are muddy, the guitar sound is somewhere between irritating and indistinguishable, and the harmonies (core dada element) are just poor.I would suggest any of their other albums, and sure hope they they find some help with the next album...which of course I'll buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"Awesome file.

I felt present in the rooms, on the streets, and in the cars while his characters interacted around me. Because of the \\"up close\\" feeling evoked from Richard's \\"snapshots,\\" I felt a wide range of emotions from the characters; from despair and powerless, to gratitude and hope, to final vindication.I liked the way Richard concentrated his short stories like one act plays.

It advertises itself as a bead storage box. Well, first of all there weren't enough dividers so some spaces have to be larger even if you don't need them larger. Secondly, those dividers slip out very easily, mixing the beads up. Thirdly, once you get the beads in the box, they are very hard to get out of the box, especially considering how easily the dividers lift out of place. I am going to have to buy something different for bead storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the other reviews before wasting my money","review":"First problem is that there is no seller contact information. Even Amazon doesn't know how to get a hold of this company, which is unfortunate because I would have loved to have someone explain to me why they thought that it was fair to rip people off.The case itself is much much smaller than it looks in the picture. It's about half the size of a standard piece of printer paper. It only comes with 12 dividers, which is nowhere near enough to do anything with, considering that there's 21 slots. The dividers are flimsy and don't stay down, so if you put beads next to each other they are bound to mix together causing massive amounts of frustration [happened twice while I was trying to set it up with 2mm beads.]If you need bead storage, I strongly suggest something is attached dividers.Bottom line, this item isn't worth the money and isn't very user friendly, and neither is the company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a short, but very satisfying and addictive set of songs from the Pixie's original demo tape.

So IMO, its just not their fault, but rather a bad script and horrible direction.amnightus"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money for both the studio and you!","review":"Not even the hotness of Amber Heard can save this turd of a flick!

I liked movies like the Punisher and Jonah Hex, so I was willing to give this a chance. I expected SOOO much more from Nicolas Cage; this movie has conferred junk bond status on an once great actor.In it's defense though, the creators of this seem to have sired a new genre: p0rn noir. There's an old maxim that comes to mind, and this piece of filth is no exception: Success has many fathers, but failure is a bast... err. misbegotten.Save your precious time and money, unless you are skeet shooting or know of a landfill that's just begging to have indigestion."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word, YUCK!","review":"Being a huge Nic Cage fan I was disappointed that he would make a movie this bad.

I did read some of the reviews on the rental site and knew it had a mostly low rating, but really figured I'd get past the blown off limbs, afterall, I did all watch Saving Private Ryan with all it's bloody limbs. This one had bad acting, bad script, it's just plain bad, ugh! Guess there will always be some who will like trash like this, those will find this review \\"not helpful\\" just to defend this horrid mistake of a movie.

Pointless destruction from the beginning to the end.Nicholas Cage is a good actor and has made many good movies, just one example being Lord of War. In this movie he is good, but just about every person in the movie gets killed before the end of the movie. It is a fantasy, but why is the devil Accountant? What is the devil worship anyway? Why are they trying to kill the child? Nicholas Cage's character kills countless number of people in order to save a single baby. How does that make any sense?Each to his own I guess.

With nick cage busting out of hell to save his daughter from a evil cult leader. What were you expecting high cinema? no, you get a fun b movie that delivers lots of action in 3d. It's a beserk movie too with outrageous scenes like nick cage shooting people while he's having sex. If you don't like b movies then stay away from this one, but if you love good ole over the top b horror then sit back and drive angry. This is lowbrow drive in type of theater to be sure but I liked it. I also like high brow in my defense!

I didn't expect much, when I plunked down the cash for the 3D movie ticket. I was surprised to have one of the best cinematic times I've had in the last year. The driving stunts are awesome, the acting and dialogue...well, it's what you'd expect from an homage to bad '70s drive-in movies.

Amber Heard plays a fabulous tough girl with a heart - and she's a really good badass chick, IMO. There's a couple of scenes that definitely entitle this to its R rating, along with the language. The action just keeps on going, with a few short moments of back story. There's enough twists to keep strong interest, and enough predictability to make you right in your anticipation, enough craziness to last all night long.

I am NOT a blood, gore and violence fan... but, though this movie is full of all that, it's kind of a tongue in cheek type, which I can handle. Loved the plot, the action is wow, the classic cars are dazzling and a little humor here and there keeps you involved! Car chases, evil cults, murder and mayhem all abound, but in a \\"I know this isn't real\\" kind of way. I would highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy action movies with an actual plot, seeing good overshadow evil and a movie that has an actual ending. Not a movie for kids.

It's a tried and true supernatural tale with lots of gore, swearing and driving and the action is pretty good as well. Amber Heard's spunky character is fun to watch as she gets into fist fight after fist fight with men but her rationale for continuing with the main character is hit or miss at best. But, to be fair, you can't take this movie too seriously and enjoy it at the same time so you have to just roll with it. Old automobile aficionados will appreciate some of the rides in this picture. The blonde in the motel with Cage during the gunfight was cleverly hilarious and the Devil's Accountant was arguably the most colorful character.

Throw in a liking for some general low class behavior scenes by the leading woman, and general violence from start to finish and this movie might be for you. If you think it is a high speed driving movie in 3d.... it's not. It's closer to a combination of some of the recent vampire fare coupled with an End of Days tweak.

My husband was laughing and kept commenting on how \\"stupid\\" the movie was and wanted to shut it off. It fell very short of even being entertaining. Laughable...yes.

Still another example of an aging actor not role challenging himself but declining towards the money.(2.) Ripoff storyline of someone coming back from the dead with a revengeful stalking of the representatives of evil (i.e. Satan with his always present alternative names). Can't they be a bit more creative than bon fires and baby sacrifices? And, the usual cheap money maker of flying bullets, pointless sex scene and the getting-old-fast 'n furious driving. Then we have the typecast human looking types with God like powers always showing them off in trivial pointless ways. (Why? Just to have filler visuals for the film.) They always seem to lose anyway. You would think that with their superior capabilities that they would just do the job and leave but then there wouldn't be a movie.(3.)

It moves great and my oldest loves riding in it! I thought he wouldn't want to ride in the back but, he loves it! Its easy to fold and put away and it is light weight! The only thing is that you have to take the car seat adapter and the shade off to put in the back of the trunk. I have an 06 Jetta and it has a very large trunk but, I still need to take both off. It's actually very easy to put on and take off so I still rate it 5 stars! If you are a mother of two this is a great product!

Very happy overall"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I purchased this stroller before a vacation last month and love it! It took me about 5 or 6 minutes to put it together out of the box. The front seatbelt is easy to adjust. I love the parent organizer that came with it too! The one I got has two cup holders (the one I purchased for my sister only had one cup holder) and works great! My older daughters love to ride in the back. It is so much lighter than the usual double stroller. I was so happy to get rid of the old stroller! The only problem I've had is that my daughter's sippy cups are the tall ones and the cup holder in the fron tray isn't very deep, so if you hit a significant bump, the cup falls out a lot. I haven't noticed that the storage basket is too small, it's perfect for us. The foot rest in the front is a bit small, but hasn't been a problem. The material is really easy to clean and it seems really durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try it out before you buy","review":"My wife read all of the reviews for this stroller prior to the birth of our second child and decided to purchase this stroller online. It is, by far, the worst stroller that I have ever used. The dimensions are such that it is rather tall and skinny so it has a tendency to be difficult to turn when you want to, but driveway slopes tend to force you down into the street if you are not holding on very tightly. As far as looks, ease of folding, and overall features are concerned, it is a fine product. I am a healthy 34-year old dad who finds this really difficult to maneuver. I wouldn't even think of trying to take it to a crowded place or store. Who knows, maybe I just got a dud, but I would recommend trying this out at a store before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Stroller--single or double","review":"I have a 4 yr old and 3 mo old. This is my favorite stroller so far, and I have had many: maclaren single, maclaren double, graco metrolite, jeep jogger, and kohlcraft contours. I use the Joovy Caboose whether I have 2 children or one with me. The extra space is good for carrying my groceries, etc. It is steerable with one hand; in fact, when I have both kids, I pull a cart behind me and push this stroller with one hand. I found no other double I could manage with one hand. I haven't regretted my choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First impressions great here too","review":"I've been using this stroller for about a week now with a 1 yr old and a 4 yr old. It is VERY lightweight, I compared it in the store with the regular model and to me it is definitely worth spending the extra on the Ultralight model. It is very sturdy too and the ball bearing wheels make it so smooth to push. The sun shade covers both the front and back passenger really well. It was simple to put together out of the box, simply snap on the wheels and tray and you're off. I was carrying around an Evenflo Take Me Too double stroller and a Maclaren Quest before this and this one stroller now replaces them both. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it is still a little big, i guess it has to be to carry two kids. It folds up very flat but is still rather long - lying down it takes the width of my trunk in my minivan. Nice thing about it being so flat is that I can stand it up in the trunk though which takes up a lot less room. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've had the best","review":"Best stroller on the market by far. I have owned the peg perego pliko, and the zooper cruiser 4 wheel drive, and the joovy caboose ultralight leaves them far behind, and it is cheaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joovy Choose Ultralight","review":"This product is a life saver! We love it. Also, I would buy it from Amazon rather than a vendor cause it has really great customer service. The first one we bought from Amazon went to the wrong address and they immediately refunded it! So we bought it again. Also, we choose the standard shipping (the cheapest one) and we ended up receiving the stroller much earlier than expected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushes easily","review":"Love this - wish we had gotten it sooner. Works great even if I only take one kid out because it is so light and easy to push. I am very tiny and have no problem getting it in and out of the car. It folds very flat - flatter than my single stroller - and lighter. The best part is that is pushes and turns so easily - it is really nice to take the kids out in it. I love the five point seatbelt in the front and the seatbelt on the back seat. I don't have a problem with the basket. The organizer is nice to have, but definitely not as easy to use as a plastic ones on most single strollers. It does the job though and keeps everything handy. My son loves this, though. I like that I can belt him onto the back seat if he is tending to roam, because that was a concern I had getting this since he is only 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Convenient","review":"I just received this stroller and I love it! I have a 3 month old and a 3 year old and I love that my 3 year old can sit on the little seat in the back or stand when he gets tired of walking (or gets into too much stuff at the store and HAS to sit instead of walking on his own!). It is much lighter than I had anticipated even though it says ultralight, I still didn't expect it to be as light as it is. It is easy to fold up too, once you get the hang of it. I would recommend this to anyone w/an infant and a toddler, it's money well spent for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"We absolutely love this stroller with only one exception.... it desperately needs more storage. Our prior one-child stroller had nearly twice the underneath storage area.The construction seems solid and our 3 year old loves riding in the back while her sister's car seat/carrier fits perfectly in the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 too go!!!","review":"My daughter recently had her 2nd child with her first child being 4 years old. She wanted a double stroller that was not as big and bulky as the usuals but still wanted comfort for both her newborn and 4 year old. This stroller was the answer. Although the \\"seat\\" for the 4 year old could be a little deeper, overall this is a great present or purchase for any family adding a 2nd second child to thier family.I would definitely recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH EVERY PENNY!","review":"We bought this stroller for a trip to Disney World with our 2-year-old and 5-year-old and we were very pleased. It was easy to push, turned on a dime, folded and unfolded quickly, was manageable to carry on and off the busses/monorail, and the kids were quite comfortable in it. The canopy was large enough to cover both kids and there's plenty of padding all over, including the handle, which made it more comfortable to push. My five-year-old could climb easily in and out of the jump seat. We had no trouble storing what we needed in the bottom and no problem accessing it. The front tray with drink holders came in very handy, and the fabric cleaned up well when it got dirty. Even the rain cover worked great when we needed it. The color worked well too because it made it easy to spot when we had to leave it in stroller parking areas. We liked it so much we got rid of our double jog stroller and we use this now for our jog/walks. I don't have one complaint about this stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor construction! Not enough storage!","review":"I bought this stroller when I was expecting my second son. My older son was 3 at the time. After having it for less than 1 year it has completely fallen apart. I have to hold the hinges together with cable ties which frequently break. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who has a son (or daughter) who can get out of the back seat on their own. This was obviously not design for typical wear and tear. I still have my single seat Graco and it is great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect--but close!","review":"We bought this for our 3 year old. The stroller was so easy to put together and is very sturdy. Our daughter loves having the option to sit in the back or in the traditional front position. (She has a hard time standing. That may be easier for taller children.) The handlebar works well for both my husband (at 6'4\\") and myself (at 5'0\\"). We used the Joovy at a trip to a major theme park last month and it was really easy to fold up for tram rides, etc. Downsides: I wouldn't recommend it for \\"off roading\\" - even in grassy areas. The wheels don't do well on anything other than pavement. And the storage basket is small. But overall, money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lightweight stroller for active toddler and sibling","review":"This was the lightest stand-on stroller that I could find, which is why I purchased it. I just put the stroller together and it was extremely easy (no tools). The parent organizer is great, because it is not included in the older models. The basket isn't very big and might hold just a couple of items (not an entire diaper bag). I like the oversized canopy, because it looks like it will provide protection for both kids. However, when the infant seat is installed in the front, the standing/sitting toddler doesn't have much room to sit unless they lean forward. Also, it would have been nice for the sitting toddler's footrest to be larger - it is kind of hidden behind them. The stroller is very light for a double stroller and is also nice looking. The padded seat and handle bars were the other features that I liked on the Joovy models, because they aren't found on other sit/stand strollers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment!","review":"This stroller is perfect for my 1-year old and 2-year old daughters! It's extremely light weight and easy to maneuver - even with one hand. The cupholder works great for mom's coffee, the girls' sippy cups or a container of snacks! The only disadvantage is the VERY small storage area beneath the stroller. It doesn't fit a diaper bag packed for two, but easily can hang from the handle. I would recommend it to anyone with a child that likes to have frequent opportunity to walk.However, when seated on the bench, I strongly encourage using the lap belt as sudden stops or travelling over bumpy surfaces can cause your child to fall off easily if they aren't holding on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a great product","review":"The basket is a little difficult to access but that's very minor in comparison to how efficient this product is. I definitely would NOT recommend this to a parent who's toddler is under 2. My son doesn't sleep in the stroller anymore so the bench was good enough for taking a rest. I have had this stroller for a week and he is still learning to stand without trying to escape when the stroller is in motion. Also, you cannot leave the car seat adapter on if you want to store it in the car which is a bit of a pain but again, very minor complaint. I can't image a tandem stroller getting anymore compact than this. I did not have any problems with its maneuverability like the other parents. I found this stroller to be pretty sturdy and well constructed... but then again mine is still fairly new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"This stroller is wonderful! It's compact and lightweight. Both babies can fit in it and it works perfectly with the chicco keyfit 30 carseat. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stroller!!","review":"I have a 3 year old and a 3 month old and this stroller is the best. It's light enough to take in and out of the car several times a day. It works great with the Graco snugride infant carrier. The only down side is the toddler jump seat is not stationary - but neither is my 3 year old so it doesn't really matter. I really love this stroller and I'm glad I spent the extra money on the ultralight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot handle the taste.","review":"Sorry, I have done a good job at using it every day for 2 months but it is the worst taste in the whole world! I am only doing it because it was so expensive and with the hope that although it tastes so horribly bad, that I may get some benefits. I don't feel any different, no big changes in hair, nails of any sort. My husband has been using it also and he doesn't notice any difference either. I am sure it is helping with vitamins but honestly this is a horrible tasting product. No matter what you mix it with, you feel like you are eating grass. I don't think it blends well, I can feel the grass blades against my throat when I am chugging it. Wish I did more research and realized how awful this product is on the taste buds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anekdoten, son of King Crimson","review":"Anekdoten is back with another great album.Less heavier than the firstones but also more melodic.Anna Sofi Dahlberg proves again that she isstill the best mellotron player around today.Ian Mcdonald is probablythe best ever but Anna Sofi cames right after him in my book.

The 2 units stay together with magnetics which are on each of the units. Our biggest problem was the volume control was not loud enough. Our kids are too young for headphones so this was a problem. The extras were nice - headphones, guardian. Took back. Looking for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for the extended warranty!","review":"I purchased this at Target in July, 2007. Because we have had trouble with various electronic gadgets, we decided to buy the extended warranty (3 years for $19). Good thing we did. This unit was purchased for our longer road trips. It really didn't have that many hours on it. Unfortunately, it failed on our recent 800 mile road trip. This was only 5 months after purchase. The kids were upset, as that was their main form of entertainment for the long ride. Since they were unhappy, we were all miserable (you know how that goes!). I have contacted the Service Plan people and they will be sending me a credit for the amount paid once they receive the broken unit from me. It is unlikely I will purchase this Disney unit again. However, based on our track record, it seems like unless you're willing to pay good money for top brand electronics, none of them last very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"mickey mouse\\" quality","review":"We also bought this at Target. Bulky, cluncky, and cheap dvd player. Picture was ok on main unit, on the second unit the picture was too dark and the controls for the brightness and color were only on the second unit and did not effect the main unit. This does not come with a battery! Must be plugged in to use. We looked at this for taking on a upcoming long road trip and this will not cut it. :( Also packaging states that it comes with 4 different interchangeable graphics. It only comes with 2 patterns (x 2 units) made on flimsy cardboard. One design is tinkerbell and the other is the pirates of the caribbean skull. We returned this."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"We purchased this unit at Target last month. Fortunately we tried it out at home before leaving on a long road trip. It worked great... for about 45 seconds! Then the main screen went to static and we smelled a strong electrical smell. We brought it back to Target and received a full refund. We expected that Disney would only put their name on a quality prodoct, but sadly we were wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Must Be Plugged In To Work :(","review":"I just bought this DVD player at target like an hour ago.

I am taking them on a four hour airplane trip & thought it would be great for each of them to be able to hold their own screen so there would be no fighting, but....there is no battery pack so it has to be plugged in for it to work! I thought about just keeping it for the car but it sounds like a piece of junk :( I too was not offered the extended warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 5 months","review":"Do not buy this portable DVD player. I have called Disney, Target, and Disney event transferred me to Memorex customer service for help. Memorex doesn't even make these players and never has, so that was 2 hours wasted on the phone. I bought this player online and did not know about the extended warranty, otherwise I would have bought it. We have only used this thing about 5 times and it has been well cared for. This was a special treat for my kids to finally get a portable DVD player and now it is broken and I feel like Target and Disney have ripped us off. I would feel better shopping on ebay from a seller with a 5 star rating than I would buying another expensive product from Disney. I am very disappointed and feel let down by Disney Corp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Dual Screen DVD Player","review":"On the positive side: I love that it has two screens. I love how easy it is to strap to the headrest and it is at just the right level for the kids to watch. The remote works fine, and the controls on the main unit are easy to use. The picture is clear and bright on both screens.On the negative side: It was a little expensive. You can only use it in your car, there is no battery, so it's not truly \\"portable.\\" The sound quality is poor, and the sound fades in and out so much it is incredibly annoying.All in all, the negatives win out over the positives; I would definitely not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality","review":"I got this at Target. The video quality and sound from the speakers were ok. The case seemed to be extraneously large, probably to make it look more targeted towards kids, but it's just bulky (and probably heavier).The phone jack on the slave unit didn't work correctly - I only got sound on one side of the headphones. Also, there were several options for screen ratio, but the slave screen ratio did not match the setting of the master. I returned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney dual screen portable dvd player--poor buy","review":"I purchased a Disney dual screen portable dvd player from Target. I was not given the option of an extended warranty. The player worked well for my twin grandsons, keeping them occupied for long car trips. The problem is, it only worked for about 5 months. The second screen has lines through it and is not usable. One screen for two children in car seats is not sufficient. I took it back to the Target store of purchase, and was given a number for the Starlight Company for manufacturer warranty. Neither the manufacturer or Target would offer any compensation, as the warranty is for only 90 days. A poor return on an investment of $179.00. I will not purchase another Disney product, nor will I purchase electronics at Target. All personnel I talked with were polite, but no one would stand behind the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality!","review":"we were headed on a last minute road trip for a funeral, and stopped at Target to grab a dvd player for the kids. This was the only dual screen in stock that day - and what a waste of money! the first thing to break was the car adaptor - it literally fell apart. The speakers go in and out, and finally it won't read any dvds. Save your money! We were very disappointed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk - Don't Buy!!!!","review":"This thing is a piece of junk!!! We bought this at Target 2 years ago.

We've had one of these for almost 4 years and it has worked perfectly. It has read all DVD's, even scratched ones very well. Sound has been plenty loud for our vehicles. It has been used VERY hard as we are a road vacationing and heavy travel family and it could not have been better.

This is strictly or the movie: The Rite is one of those films that starts out very well, laying the groundwork for what could've been a scary,atmospheric, tense nail-biter. Unfortunately, a little less thnt halfway through, it reverts to using a few updated tricks/nuances from The Exorcist, and ultimately slips into a confusing morass that simply doesn't make any sense and frankly, becomes close to boring. A shame, given the quality of the actors. It would be nice to see this re-done as the kind of film it could've been, but it won't happen. Worth missing, or watching only for free. with the FF button handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"....feels like God's fingernail....\\"","review":"I just loved this movie, it had the right amount of scary and believable !! I am so happy that Anthony Hopkins did not retire. I remember a few years back, in an interview, he said he was seriously thinking about retiring and my heart sank. He does a fabulous job in this movie, always the right touch of sarcasm, humbleness and authority. If you're a fan, don't miss this one !!

At the climax of the film, I kept expecting something else to happen... It never did... it just ended... The prominant review on the back of the cover said it was \\"The Best film about exorcism since The Exorcist\\"... To even compare it to \\"The Exorcist\\" is a crime. I think Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors, but despite his skills, the film was a failure.. Not worth the purchase.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommending \\"The Rite\\" is Setting the Bar Too Low","review":"Despite claims to the contrary, this movie - inspired by Matt Baglio'sThe Rite: The Making of a Modern ExorcistDOES sensationalize. The real life, middle-aged priest learning about exorcism of the book becomes the mid 20ish, GQ-looking seminarian of the movie. The character of Matt Baglio himself has become a female journalist, with whom you're wondering if the seminarian will become inappropriately involved. This sort of a plot line is standard, insulting Hollywood crap.PERHAPS, this movie treats Catholicism with a bit more respect than other Hollywood fare. Yet to recommend it is setting the bar entirely too low."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Rite movie","review":"Excellent acting and topic...is there a devil? watch this and you'll see why the Catholic church feels the continuing need for exorcists...unfortunately for my faith, if there was an exorcist, there wouldn't be any preachers left..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Anthony Hopkins is a good actor, but he has remained the same for quite a few movies, including this one.

Creepy!!!","review":"I saw this movie the other night and was surprised by how good the story and acting were. Most possession movies are just cheap ripoffs of the Exorcist which is the best one ever but this somehow seemed to me a lot more believable. Also the acting was top notch and the whole movie did contain a very creepy atmosphere. Some parts were boring but overall a very good and believable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roman Chtholic propaganda.","review":"This is a movie to keep your mind off of our Lord Jesus the Christ and on the fact that the Devil exists.

They seemed to copy a few \\"ideas\\" from The Exorcist, such as the older and younger priest and a few other things, but none of the great parts. I think Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, but not so much in this movie, which could have been the role he had to play.

There are a few funny parts and a few good parts, but overall, I wish I rented instead of bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopkin's should be ashamed","review":"I can't believe this movie is getting any positive reviews...Anthony Hopkins should be ashamed for even having his name associated with this debacle. I love horror movies and the Excorcist made me sleep with the light on for a month...this movie just made me sleep. \\"Inspired\\" by true events, much in the way Donald Trump was \\"inspired\\" that he had a full head of hair, the movie is based on a factual book about a priest training to be an excorcist (factual from the Catholic point of view anyway). I happened to have read the book just before the movie was announced and found it to be interesting, but couldn't see how it could be made into a good movie...I still don't see how it could be made into a good movie...a lousey movie?...yes, point made...but certainly not enjoyable in any sense of the world. Still, if you're into stupid, unbelieveable plots, this could be your film...the only thing I enjoyed while watching the Rite was the popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! So, so very bad","review":"I guess Anthony Hopkins has reached that point in his career where quality no longer matters. What a shame. He's so good. He's the reason I rented this awful movie. I love horror flicks and have a pretty big collection; and I'm not that fussy. It doesn't take that much for a horror movie to entertain me. This one, The Rite, is the exception. I rented it on demand video, then even after they offered me a big chunk of money off to buy it, I turned it down. I don't need this reject in my horror collection. This is just plain bad. I'm sure Hopkins is just counting his $ and doesn't care what I think. Too bad. He was one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful exorcist story","review":"Pitiful exorcist story with a big budget, think of all the little movies that could have used any part of this budget to make there movies better and you see this bloated whale of a movie just sucking down the bucks for the actors, sets and location not to mention the ton's of dough they blew to advertise this waste of cash. I should have went with my gut when I saw the first trailer, I thought now this is another one of those non-scary catholic mumbo jumbo hocus pocus movies to take my mind off of the real scary things about the catholic church.Anthony Hopkins can be a great actor when the man has something to work with but not here, ol Tony is just collecting a pay check as he mumbles his way through this mess.

It is a pity that such an actor like Anthony Hopkins has put himself in the role for this class B argument.

My advise: keep your money for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty as charged","review":"4 stars because I do have a soft spot for everything that is genrewise connected to the religious horror genre and when Anthony Hopkins is on board nothing can go wrong for me.

So if you're a fan of Tony and religious themed horrormovies join in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to retire","review":"Anothony Hopkins has grown very tired. his character was pretty burned out in this bad pick of running out of good film materialscript. Who else would play his part? the Pope if things got slow at the Vatican."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding performances and background","review":"A fantastic movie with great acting, backdrops and a real musical score. The momentum builds as the story progresses with very few special effects. Comparing \\"The Rite\\" to \\"The Exorcist\\" is a collosal mistake. As in the Exorcist this is based on a true story, other than that the two movies part company. The opening scene introduces our main character who decides to use the Catholic church as a free ride to an education. His creepy background (growing up in a funeral parlor) adds to the mix. Before ducking out from under his vows he is pushed to attend exorcist classes that lead him to father Lucas, a radical exorcist played by Anthony Hopkins. After repeated hints that the Devil may be real, the time comes for our uninitiated priest to find his faith or perish. Subtle symbols through out add the perfect amount of suspense. A great movie with great acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rite.","review":"I thought that this movie would be good, and it was not horrible.

I don't even want to start comparing this against \\"The Exorcist\\", the gold standard of exorcism movies and to my knowledge still the only one that invokes true terror. One last comment: if you want local authenticity, you shouldn't hire Anglo-Saxon actors who then try to imitate an Italian accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ol' Christian Movie","review":"This movie is great! I have watched this movie since the time it came out to theaters. I decided to buy it again for a family priest, who now is interested in exorcism.

The 1 and 3/4 hour movie feels like a 20 minute show."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Doesn't Have The Rite Stuff","review":"The main problem is we've basically seen it all before and that makes it boring - a religious man questioning his faith and being confronted with exorcism...wow.

'Hollywood' is really trending towards churning out lame movies regardless of 'names' or budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"I must commend Austen Andrews for the excellent work he did in this novel. Richard Garriot would be pleased on how he shaped the \\"New Sosaria.\\" The book starts action paced, as the brave knight Montenegro faces down a highly skilled Jukan female. Austen then manages to capture the Knights battle internally, as he goes through his trials of virtue, much like the avatar did in the games. He uses the feelings of each character to draw the reader in, enablling sympathy for the characters.This is a story i highly recommend. Want action? Plot development? Or character interaction? This book has it all, and uses the Ultima world to great effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrews Rocks!","review":"It might not be fair to review a book I haven't even finished. But I can't help but share what I think already. Andrews creates a very real world with very real characters who each in turn want something. This is cleverly weaved into a plot driven by greed, political warfare and power.The language is beautiful. And Andrews shows great skill in presenting the story very clearly, yet, without patronizing the readers.Though his attempts (to make references to what Ultima gamers would be familiar with) hardly qualifies it as \\"based on the bestselling computer game\\", The Technocrat War already has me looking forward to a compelling trilogy which I will read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every thing you could want in a fantasy","review":"Even though I am a huge fan of rpg games, I have never played even one of the games in the Ultima series, even though I really want to. So when I picked up this book, I was unsure about buying it because I thought that only people familiar with the games would enjoy The Technocrat War. I was wrong. This book started out great in the first chapter, and only got better with each coming page. The story is excellent, you really get to like the characters, and the action is great. But don't get me wrong, this book is not something that would apeal to every one. If you don't have much interest fantasy books, then you might not enjoythis book as much as I have. It is definately pure fantasy. But is you are a fan of fantasy novels then you have wasted enough time already reading this review, and not enough time reading Ultima: The Technocrat War!

There was no reason for the big misunderstandings and secrets to keep going on and on the way they did. After awhile I decided that if these people couldn't act in a mature fashion, then I didn't want to read about them anymore. Instead of talking and trying to work things out they would lust after each other and lie, or get mad, or simply not believe the truth so the supposed conflict would continue.I've enjoyed many of the other Bouquets, but unless you like stories based on misunderstandings, this isn't a book I'd recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Story","review":"Alison Kent has updated and revised this 2000 book for Kindle readers. Yay for authors who are making their backlists available to those of us who missed them the first time around.I really enjoyed this story of tempestuous young lovers reunited as mature adults. Life has happened in the 17 years since teen supermodel Eva and hotshot fashion photographer Carson ended their affair. Eva left the glam life she never wanted and Carson went on to travel the world as a celebrated photojournalist. A chance encounter leads Carson to track down the one who got away. He never knew why Eva left him and he's reached a crossroads compelling him to find answers. Kent deftly handles her lovers as they get to know one another again as grown-ups. Old hurts are realistically addressed and do I have to tell you they fall in love again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst mystery I have EVER read","review":"First of all, this book barely qualifies for the mystery genre. If anything, it is more a travelogue of Alaska. While interesting, not what I thought I was buying. This Alaska trip takes up the majority of the book and has only, possibly, 2 pages total that relate the purported story line of a murdered man.Overall, the book contains maybe, maybe 30 pages of mystery. Our \\"detective\\" isn't even a detective since she doesn't solve the murder. Urg. The ending makes absolutely no logical sense, even in the world of cozies where characters are \\"quirky.\\"Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, it offers ZERO insight into the process of preparing to become a bar/bat mitzvah.

My grandmother cooked in bacon fat all the time and is still kickin' it it at 87!This book is the epitome of our unhealthy obsession with health, going about its quest in all the wrong ways--in exclusion rather than well-roundness and moderation.If you enjoy the taste of food, avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes my Husband hated","review":"Although the reicipes in here were low fat and easy to follow, etc...We found that no one in the family would eat the ones I tried.

I do, however own the CD by the original Quarteto and am taking the time to let less informed buyers know that this is a completely different group. The original Quarteto, comprised by Hermeto Pascoal, Airto Moreira, Heraldo do Monte (a world class guitarist who declined Airto's invitation to join Return to Forever) and bassist Theo de Barros only recorded one album, and while it tempts hungry listeners buy this recording based on the name alone, it definitely ain't the real thing.

Another style over substance band has gotten hyped to high heavens by desperate music 'critics' who desperately want to be read, and want their field of journalism to matter. For previous examples, see The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Vines and many other not-as-good-as-the-groups-they're-ripping-off bands. The sound of The Rapture has some superficial resemblance to that of The Cure - or even P.I.L. on one track of this album - but they forgot something that their precursors were masters of: the tunes, the hooks, the melodies. There's nothing here to hold your attention, and quite a lot of pointless shrieking that should drive you away. Avoid.

It's not clear who does what on the album, but the credits make it appear like Luke Jenner is the primary singer. He has a voice that sounds like a cross between quavery Robert Smith and off-key Johnny Rotten. It's minor torture listening to him sing, which is a shame because the band has written some very inventive, original, and rockin' tunes. They've got the funk, the cutting-edge rock, unique production and instrumentation, etc. But the singer can get really bad at times. Just listen to his screeching on \\"Infatuation\\" and you'll hear what I mean. It's like those auditions on American Idol where somebody is just AWFUL, but people around them have been afraid to tell them how bad they are. I'm sure these guys will be proclaimed as The Next Big Thing, but they have no chance of wider success unless they find another singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is this crap?","review":"I saw them on Dave Letterman and had a good laugh (that guy with the cowbell is looped!), because I figured any band that 'original' (these days, that term is subjective)... might have some decent tunes (though I HATED the one they performed on Late Night).

The music is a very cool blend of dance floor beats and early 90s angst rock.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent stuff","review":"These guys are good. They've been slagged off by many people for the fact that they take influences from the Cure and a few other new wave bands, but so what? Adittedly the vocalist's voice takes a bit of getting used to, but at least they have the guts to do singing in a strange yelp. the instrumentation is excellent, and it is the disco punk tracks like \\"echoes\\" and \\"house of jealous lovers\\" that are probably the best, all razor-sharp guitars and driving drum and bass lines.

While I can't profess to knowing much about PiL or Gang...I know the Cure...and honey, this ain't no cure! To compare this singer to the Great Robert Smith is blasphemy. And their junked up sound reminded me more of the Dead Milkmen on crack than anything else. I gave them one star for fooling New Yorkers into thinking they rock. They most certainly do NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rapture... err, uhh, Rupture?","review":"Fresh off the heals of seeing The Rapture live at the Curiosa festival I was curious enough to want to hear the band produced and clean. There are a few songs that are OK but over all I just can't hang with the blending (and not well either) of so many different genres of music. The Band did show some passion live but there is no excuse for the inclusion of the cow bell as an instrument. Perhaps, Echoes, being the first true release of the band deserves a little sympathy. The band is lyrically weak- apart from the music the songs do not hold up well. The CD was $9.98 so I did not break the bank on these kids... I hope that they got a piece or two of my coin and keep working at it- The band shows some promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put these guys out of their misery","review":"I consider myself well-schooled and very open minded as far as music goes.

I soaked up enough of this new wave-ish stuff when I was little kid. There were only two bands with this sound that I could get my head around: The Cure, and The Talking Heads (and with the Talking Heads, I only really liked \\"Once In A Lifetime.\\")Maybe I'm biased, but my point is, I personally don't go for this new-wave, post-punk stuff. If you like the nostalgiac feeling it gives you, then by all means. It's just not my cup of tea.But that being said, I will admit that the album was very well done. The production was great - there were no kinks or missteps as far as that. But the singer has a horribly annoying voice. He has a high-pitched whine that sounds like it would more likely attract the howling of dogs than the howling of fans.There. I've bashed these guys enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"music=good / voice=bad","review":"although i havent heard much from this band aside from the little demos amazon offers online, i feel like i have heard enough to formulate an opinion.

No it's not disco or actual dance music (you know, that techno stuff with beats, beats, and more beats) The Rapture's release of Echoes just makes the listener want to move, and not in that grunge rock jumping up and down way. You'll want to go crazy. The vocals are just amazing, the bass funky, and the rest is just plain good. The introduction to the song Heaven is the best vocal intro since Self Esteem by The Offspring.

I think that Simpson's writing also does an excellent job of making you feel as though you are right there, if not belaying him, then standing at the belay watching. In the first chapter, there is a good account of his attempt(s) at Alea Jacta Est (a difficult mixed climb in France) and I could really feel the tension. Not quite the same feeling as you get when you are really running out a lead yourself, but not too far from it.Anyways, I would heartily recommend this book to the climber and non-climber alike.

The acting was so bad, i felt continously embarassed for Orlando Bloom...from his first narrative. I love Kirsten Dunst but she was stuck in a bad script so there was not much hope there. As for the plot itself, i did not become engrossed at all with the story and did not care if i saw the end or not.I could tell what i was supposed to be feeling in some of the scenes but i felt no emotion except embarassment.The movie apeared good; all the actors fit the part physically, the scenery was pretty, and the music was a great background. but it just did not do anything for me.Overall i would recommmend watching Almost Famous instead, that had a great soundtrack with a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"They tried","review":"I'm sorry Orlando Bloom, but your accent was terrible. Keep at it, you'll get it right.Kirsten Dunst was doing the heavy lifting in this movie; charming as usual, she stole the show. There were a lot of good elements, like the family scenes, the town, and especially the soundtrack, but the plot was a bit dispassionate. The main character, Drew, goes from wonderkid to huge failure in a very short span of time, then tries to kill himself. (This all happens within the first 10-20 minutes or so), but personally I felt nothing for him. I think the problem was that Drew was drifting aimlessly, so the plot did, too.

Some critical points were terribly underdone and others way overdone. It's like there was nobody in charge on the set that had any sort of barometer. Sorry guys. Film was disjointed and sorry again, but lovely Mr. Bloom underwhelmed me this time. Either his heart was not in this film or he was simply not directed at all well.

The contrived storyline of life and death and success and failure all happening simultaneously, is not believable and really distracts from the movie, overall.BUT...having said all that, why do we watch movies? Basically for entertainment and escapism, and this movie scores on both. It is safe to say that none of the stars were robbed by not winning an Oscar for their performances. But they all seemed to have real chemistry, many of the lines were pithy and memorable, and the back-stories were entertaining, and even funny.If you want to watch a good movie for a couple of hours, and laugh a little, Elizabethtown is great.

With its sometimes goofy, slightly comedic, a little disturbing and even heart warming moments, the movie just worked.

Yes, the music selection is good (I own the volume 2 which I recommend since you do not hear many of those songs in the actual movie). However the funny parts are far and few. Frankly it is boring and the love story is cliche and overly sugar coated. However, Dunst did a fantastic job, she is the only thing that makes this movie.

A long, drawn out film that could've used an edit or two.It falls short as a romatic drama, or whatever its trying to be (its hard to classify due to its many themed storyline).1 1/2 hours could've been nicely cut out of this movie!F- Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable flick","review":"I really liked \\"Almost Famous,\\" and decided to give this film by Cameron Crowe a try.

I start by saying I'm glad I rented this, although I wouldn't have had I walked into the store looking for something interesting.I categorize Elizabethtown as a \\"girl flick\\" which is not a bad thing. It's well produced and effectively played my emotions. The strongest emotion I had was the urge to choke Kirsten Dunst's character, only because I would not be able to tolerate a person like her in real life. Kirsten is so believable that I wanted to slap her before the movie ended. I enjoy Orlando Bloom and he manages this roll well, although there are probably other actors more suited for this type of film.

He journeys back to his home town in Kentucky and meets perky flight attendant Claire Colburn (Kirsten Dunst) along the way.Orlando is no leading man and Kirsten - although cute - is miscast as a screwball. There is no chemistry between them whatsever. There are echoes of Crowe's brilliant \\"Jerry Maguire\\" in the plot starting with Baylor's downfall at the beginning of the film - but the ideas are tired and unfocussed and \\"Elizabethtown\\" is flat and uninteresting - not too mention neverending.Being a Crowe film it does have good music but that's about it.

But I was pleasently suprised. First, being from the South, I thought that Crowe did a great job of capturing the feel. Secondly, I loved the theme...life. It does a lovely job of showing why life...at least to one character...was still worth living. Plus, the comedy laced into the story was well placed. Finally, the music is amazing, as most music in Crowe's movies are. The movie is a little long but I never felt that it was dragging. So check it out. Great date movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting + ridiculous fight scene = 1-star movie","review":"The fighting scene in this movie looks like a kids' play. The acting is laughable.

Alan Rickman is funny and sexy, but, sadly, that's not enough to save the movie. The editor must have been doing drugs because it was so choppy. Still, I have sympathy for him/her because the story and dialogue stank.SPOILER ALERT:The low point of the film may have been when Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Kline get it on and she tells him she is 23. He repeats it. Um....sorry, no. The actress was 31 when she made this film, and although she's attractive, she looks it.

If one were to read the fine print, however, you could get a hint that something is wrong when you see that the film lasts 1 1/2 hours only.

How do you go wrong with Kevin Kline, Susan Sarandon, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (I haven't liked her in anything else, but she was actually good here), Harvey Keitel, Rod Steiger, and Danny Aiello ? Put them in a movie with a terrible screenplay and nothing to do. Kline plays a former cop, now fireman, and brother of the New York City police commissioner (Keitel - do these two look like brothers at all - NO!), who is called back on the force to stop a serial killer. Sarandon is Keitel's wife and was Kline's lover, and Mastrantonio is falling for our Kevin. The worst (over)acting job goes to Steiger, who seethes like a rabid dog throughout the whole movie.

I watched in complete disbelief.","review":"In watching the movie, I began to wonder if it was supposed to be the first of a series. I kept thinking that it was trying to be an updated version of \\"The Thin Man\\" series and so this movie was trying to establish the characters. With that reasoning, it makes sense the there a number of sub-plots that remain undeveloped and that the characters have strange relationships that go unexplained.However what I mostly wondered about was what they were thinking when they made this movie. This movie has done something that is truly unique. It has found ways to be bad that I have never seen in any other movie. The script is preposterous. The characters are artificial and their relationships make no sense. it is a comedy that is not funny. It is a mystery that is no suspenseful. It is thriller that is not exciting.

Alan Rickman's character is potentially the most interesting, but even he lacks dimension.After flopping in the departments of comedy and romance, the only possible salvation for \\"The January Man\\" is its potential as a thriller. Kline does have just enough charisma to possible keep you watching all 97 dreary minutes.

His portrayal of Ed the Artist is absolutely what I expected - well done, although the part was small.Now, for the rest of the movie. I have never witnessed overacting like this in my life -- not even on the high school stage. The plot was thin and disjointed, (what do Virgo, prime numbers and Neil Sedaka all have in common? Did I miss something?) and the scene where they finally catch the murderer is some of the worst acting I've seen.I've given it two stars strictly because of Alan Rickman's involvement in the film and because I did stick it out until the end.

But if you want some light satire & a chance to see a great bunch of actors trade zingers - & don't mind a preposterous plot - it's a fun ride. Supporting cast: Alan Rickman, Danny Aiello, Harvey Keitel, Susan Sarandon (playing her character to perfection with never a lapse in craft, OMG her facial expressions are marvelous! - she carries every one of her scenes) & Rod Steiger. Part of the fun is seeing them each chew up their own little bit of the scenery. This was made in 1989, & for many of us the nostalgia is great; it's fun to see them all so young.

I was excited to see this whole system launched and ordered it from the pace express website not realizing it was offered through Amazon. I am still waiting for them to ship it. My first email inquiry went un-answered and my second email got a response from customer service saying they were still waiting for product from the manufacturer but would mark my inquiry and order urgent. Who cares!? If you don't have product something should go up on the site saying there has been a delay. Instead it still says your order will be processed in two or three business days and you should get it in 10 business days. What a crock! This might be a great product but how would I know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"While the seller shipped this very quickly, the construction of the set itself is not very good. I am not an overweight person, but leaning back in the chairs even a little bit is a precarious exercise at best. One chair has already broken into two pieces when the back separated from the seat portion completely when I sat in it. The screws should screw into the seat portion from the back of the chair, but instead go in from the inside of the back legs, which is not very stable. I found this out the hard way as my rear end met with the floor when I should have been sitting in a chair. If I had the option to give zero stars I would, since I will be returning this item as soon as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"some assembly required ?????","review":"this is not a sturdy set at all - the table is NOT 33\\" high as described but is 29\\" - the set does NOT come with pre-drilled holes in the wooden sections (also noted other reviews) - and the wood is in fact very hard - so it is impossible to put together unless you have the strength of a man's hands and/or an electric drill - we've all learned in Civics about the Implied Warranty - in other words - put together furniture, should be able to be put together by most - so SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED ??????"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Menage Romp","review":"Lora Leigh Menage a Magick is a super romb thats great fun - with interesting twins and lots of erotic senuality this is a fun book to read and one of my favourites by this talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIZARD TWINS SERIES","review":"This is a great book and a great series!!

Imagine my fury when I found the length to be 2149 locations (less than 150 pages) !No book that short is worth that much money, especially when you can usually buy an excellent used paperback version on Amazon for much less.Please price these ebooks fairly!

I think a lot of time was wasted in detailing the setting of the story and too little time was given to the characters.

She doesn't want to know them, be around them or be with them. In her mind, they are not good people and she wants nothing to do with them.It seems that she is spoiled, selfish and only thinks of herself. The twin brothers that are betrothed to her seem to only want to care for her and pleasure her beyond belief. But, it isn't until they are joined inside her that she begins to care for them... The sex in the book is good, but the story leaves something lacking. I would suggest going with one of Lora Leigh's other series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Condition of the book","review":"The condition of the book was very good.

I heard the cut \\"And I Love Her\\" on my classical radio station and loved it, so I ordered the CD. That turns out to be the only good cut. The other arrangements are so cheesy, I'm actually thinking about throwing the CD away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Photos Ever Of A Fantastic City","review":"I've always been a fan of photography from the air and have taken many myself. Robert Cameron has shown the beautiful city of Las Vegas in a way that most other books on Vegas (and there's a lot)lack.The photos are crystal clear and have captions that explain the photo. Probably the most intriging of the photos are the ones of the Hotel and Casinos. The Luxor, MGM Grand, and the Stratosphere are all excellently photoed.A great soverniger for anybody wanting to go or have been to Vegas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stained-glass beauty","review":"\\"The Hidden Window Mystery\\" finds Nancy, Bess, and George visiting Nancy's cousin, Susan, at her lovely home outside Richmond, Virginia. The young sleuth is soon tracking down a beautiful stained-glass window, several centuries old. Along the way Nancy, and the readers, learn about the painstaking process of creating beautiful leaded stained glass.Secret panels, hidden passageways, and double walls figure into the story. It's a rip-roarin' adventure for Nancy, her girlfriends, and Ned Nickerson. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Drew #34","review":"Don't get me wrong I am a HUGE fan of the Nancy Drew series. I have read a little more than half the series. But this one is probably one of the worst. It's just my opinion. I found it hard to make it through the first chapter, but I finished the book. It was just too confusing there was so many mysteries, characters, and events that you just got bored and confused. I quickly solved the mystery though. I wouldn't want to read this if I was you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No reason to buy this!!","review":"Halo 2 is a very easy game and this guide will not tell you ANYTHING you won't find in about 3 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"Iris Murdoch is at her best here -- profound, funny, moving, deeply insightful. If you've never read her books and find yourself daunted by philosophical treatises, the first fifty pages or so -- the passage preceding the real start of the narrative -- might be hard to slog through, but this book rewards such effort. I've read The Black Prince several times now, and am always wowed by the overwhelming beauty of the work. If you've yet to discover Iris Murdoch, do so here; your world is about to expand. And by the way, I'm eternally grateful to my college English professor, Elizabeth Dipple, for introducing me to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Regarding a previous review: Perhaps some of the characters are a bit prolix but this is not necessarily a defeat is it? And thank God Murdoch was no Dostoesvsky, should she have been? I think one was quite enough. Bradley Pearson is a pleasant, at least pleasantly readable, incarnation of some of Murdoch's philosophy without being overbearing or esoteric. One need not always read about self-castigation and repentence to know that suffering has variegated coats and one need not do away with one's landlady to find guilt, perhaps it accrues. Bradley Pearson is a certain type of protagonist. Perhaps some will relate and others won't, its not necessary anyway. The dialogue and inner-dialogue is enough to pique and provoke. The \\"Black Prince\\" is a good read and should be taken as such, I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most ridiculous books I've ever read","review":"The book describes alleged intelligence connections of the author. Unfortunately, the author is blinded by hate, of both Israel and the \\"Zionist satan\\". As well, the author subscribes to a number of conspiracy theories that evoke the golden age of blood libels. Finally, the writing style is simply awful: the book may be a translation from another language. For example, consider the following passage:\\"I thought to myself how awful and perverted the Zionists are; how disgraced their society and how corrupt their souls\\". Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born to Fly","review":"Not exactly a prequel to Millenium, as the previous reviewer stated, but actually a collection of short stories woven together to form a novel about Chester A. Kinsman, who rises through the ranks of the Aerospace Force. He becomes the first man to make love in space. He also becomes the first person to kill someone in space - something that will come back to haunt him.Once again, Bova shows his brilliance. This is a truly entertaining story and I can't wait to read Millenium so I can go back into the world of Kinsman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Interesting Read","review":"Chris Benson's, Special Interest is a political page-turner. When reporter, Angela McKenzie, relocates to Washington D.C. she is given the inside track into Washington politics by her old friend and political mover-and-shaker, Veronica Sutton. Angela notices changes in her once radical friend but does not believe Veronica is the sell-out that others are accusing her to be. When Veronica is found dead, Angela refuses to accept suicide as the cause of death. As Angela sets out to find the truth, she soon discovers Veronica's suicide is just a small part of a larger, dangerous story.Benson's story is thick with details and plot twists that engage readers from the first page. The characters are well-developed and flawed within reason. Short chapters and journal style formatting keep the story moving. Readers will be pleased with Benson's first novel and will eagerly await Angela's future endeavors.Reviewed by M. P.

Greek is the language in which the whole New Testament was written.Originally, in \\"Xmas\\", X represented the Greek letter (chi). It was pronounced with an aspirated [kh], which is the first letter of Christ's name in Greek.

Beggars in designer clothes? They do indeed totter around the landscape like dolls - endlessly. The film is a tragedy which some have described as a poetic examination of true love - I couldn't agree less, the characters lack insight, simply playing out the roles chosen by themselves and society to the bitter end, leaving this reviewer completely unmoved.Takeshi Kitano has made a super-aesthetic film, but there is no real content here - just a series of meaningless scenes. This film was panned when it was presented at the Venice Festival - the only reason to watch it is to find out why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question","review":"As of July 9, 2005, Amazon does not have this info on their site about this product....a suggestion was sent to them that they do not have enough information on their site about this product, but that was over a month ago.Does anyone know if the original Japanese audio track is on this DVD, and if so, does this particular DVD have English subtitles availalbe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stays with you for a while","review":"but not in a real positive way.

The book is around 200 pages, contains 10 chapters, and covers topics such as:1. Corporate culture and how to fit in.2. Learning to trust and delegate to others.3. Willing to be creative and proactive in your work.4. Being careful of an autocratic style of leadership.5. Prepare your successor(s) to replace you.6. Learn to affirm others, people appreciate appreciation for their work and efforts.7. Letting others in on the decision-making process.The book may be completed in a few sittings and has a smooth narrative. The author is informative without being preachy and the book will benefit others, regardless of their religious background.Read, and be encouraged and challenged to see leadership as something that is to be used to benefit others and not just yourself!Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tips For All","review":"Easy read with some good info. We all need reminders on how to best deal with people and this book does just that. Good advice regardless of your position within a company or just to be a better citizen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a secular discussion of leadership","review":"What none of the reviewers mention is that this is NOT a purely secular discussion of leadership. Finzel takes a Christian approach to leadership effectiveness. For example, when discussing why people tend to rely on an autocratic leadership style, one of the explanations he gives is, \\"It reflects the depravity of man. Satan began the problem when he wanted to get out from under submission to God the Father. So he rebelled and led his own band of rebels to bring rebellion to the world\\" (p. 26). Passages from the Bible are used in support of Finzel's advice and many of the examples are drawn from his personal experience in faith-based organizations. I don't have a problem with this per se but I would have preferred to know this in advance. This is not a text that I would be able to use in my organization where religion is considered a personal and private topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather play with my dogs","review":"This book juxtaposes photos of dogs with Zen quotations and sayings. The photos are quite good, and the selected text was chosen with care and thought.I'm not, however, able to make the required leap and see any real link between the words and images in this book. Perhaps I'm being way too literal here in wondering if dogs possess the sort of consciousness prone to contemplation, but I've never thought that Zen was prone to cuteness. Also, the typography used for some of the text pages is jarring, even irritating, when a simpler, cleaner arrangement would have sufficed.I appreciate the merits of Zen and of dogs but yoking the two together does not yield a compelling message or insights. I'd rather play with my dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful for dog and zen lovers","review":"This is a wondeful little book. I love the zen quotations, and the photos of dogs were lovely. I would have liked a bit more variety in the dog photos, and some of them seemed a bit contrived in order to match the quotes. All in all, it is a good book for anyone who likes dogs and is open to zen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fix all XP issues","review":"I am a huge fan of this series. When I found out they were releasing all the games for XP I was extremely happy. However, King's Quest 7 has a problem in chapter 5 with the firecracker exploding when it is picked up causing an endless loop and forcing you to restart the entire game. This was only a problem on XP with the previous game and I expected it to be fixed on this release. However, when I got to that point in the game I picked up the firecracker AND IT EXPLODED RIGHT AWAY. I could not believe this. The whole point of this release was to port the games to XP and they didn't even do that properly. This was a known problem and they didn't even fix it. This makes me extremely catious of buying anything from Vivendi in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies","review":"My gripe is about KQ6. One customer said that there were no differences between the cd and disk versions. This information is false. At the time of its origional release, I was fortunate to have a high end computer (for its time) that was able to run the Windows CD version of KQ6 which had much better graphics and Character Illustrations. I was beyond upset when I found out that this was nothing but the DOS version. I bought this to play the windows version that to my knowlage does not work in any way on any OS past win95 (maybe 98). Those who have played and have been waiting to play the Windows CD version will be very upset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything works EXCEPT 7!","review":"The whole reason why I wanted to buy this game was so I could play 7 again.

I had to order it from another website just to play one game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Fan","review":"I used to play these games as a child, so I was so excited when I stumbled across the collection. The picture quality is terrible, the colors are completely messed up and the images are shown via vertical lines.

This new collection is a huge disappointment, especially considering how long they pushed back the release date. This collection does not include both versions of King's Quest I (the original and the remake). It also doesn't include any of the bonus games released with the earlier collection (Colonel's Bequest, Dagger of Amon Ra, etc.). Overall, a waste of money. I'd stick with the previously released collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"again, terrible graphics","review":"I purchased Space Quest, Kings Quest and Leisure Suit Larry for the husband. Like the others, Kings Quest was not enhanced in any way which is a shame. With all the technology today they could have done a little enhancement.

Unfortunately it was only the really old Apple Computer games, which can't even use a mouse, and require you to write in what you want the character to do. Plus, it takes forever for the guy/girl to even move across the screen. It didn't say Anywhere on the box that it was the old game just put on a CD. I still have those on floppy discs somewhere.

All they did was repackage the series, exactly as they were. Works on Windows XP? Yes, but only because they included an OUTDATED version of DOSbox, a DOS emulator, on the CD.It should be noted that DOSbox is a free download anyways, so if you already own the games, you have NO reason to buy this. You are getting nothing new.I'm very disappointed. I had expected them to actually put some work into this. Instead, all they did was slap everything together and used some else's work to claim WinXP compatibility. Pathetic.I suppose if you don't own copies of the original games, this might be worthwhile. If you do have them, don't waste your time with this.[edit] Let me clarify: The King's Quest series is awesome. You cannot go wrong wanting to play any KQ game.

But I just wish they had actually fixed the games to work with today's graphics cards and processors. Having my graphics at the lowest level, having to play in a window instead of full screen, having the timing go way too fast for the game (I don't know how to describe it, but a character has to carry a firecracker to a tomb. But my processer is so fast, the character would blow up immediately each time she picked it up). It was all too much and I wound up uninstalling it. There's only so much frustration I can take.I loved the games, when I had an older computer. Now, they just don't work for me. They may work for others, but for me, King's Quest will have to stay a memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"big dissapointment","review":"I was a huge fan of Kings Quest, and getting this for Christmas was so excitting, even though we could only get KQ7 to work, because it was my favorite.

This CD is wrong on all counts. It is surely one of the worst stage-musicals ever written since it doesn't evoke a mood or a character through the music and the lyrics read like they were carved with a sledge hammer. A prime example is that the dance of love- the Tango-was chosen to introduce the classic boor, Lester Atlas! On a purely 'musical' level, even the steel drums are passionless and the rap leaden. Jimmy Buffet chose to work within his own rum-soaked framework of the Caribbean and never once approached the mood of Harry Belefonte's \\"Don't Stop The Carnival\\" which the main character constantly hums to himself!He never once EXCITES us.

This time, I was disappointed. The music, in and of itself, is evocative of The Man, but misses in spirit. I think a video of the musical would be a better stand-alone effort. Unless you're a huge fan of the Wouk volume, or have to have this to complete your collection, don't bother. Sorry, Bubba, but this one didn't do it for me.

I bought it not having any idea what it was, and at first was confused- why all the different singers, what in the world is Kinja? Well, it took me a while to sort it out, with some help from the liner notes. The fact that the music was great helped me stay with it. And then, one day I found myself rumaging through my Buffett for a poolside album, and I picked this one. It's been my favorite of Buffett's later career ever since, and I can only say I love it more all the time. The songs are really great, and it's nice to hear Jimmy trying something new- that's when he's at his best. Obviously, lots of island music here. My only warning is this- the songs don't stand alone. This album is one whole story. If you dig it, and want more, read the Herman Wouk novel. They're great companion pieces for each other. Sorry, guys, it's hard to quantify what's so great about this album, but give it a try. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phlock Evolution","review":"It always amazes(in a disappointing way, sadly) me to hear fellow parrotheads speak of \\"getting back to the roots\\". It's almost always negative and there is a pheel that the person talking pheels cheated by whatever new item comes out. I never have gotten that. DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL is a great CD. Now, I'm not gonna suggest that it is the \\"greatest Parrothead collection of all time\\" or anything so extreme. Labels and levels have never really applied to Buffett's stuff anyway. It's just a great story. Phor me, Buffett has always been about a window. I get to look out the window and see what ever it is I can. Sure, its a window to Bubba and where he is, at any given time, but the great thing about it phor me has always been, I get to look out that window too....and unlike anyone else's phans who try to tell you what everything in a certain song \\"means\\", . . . . . with Buffett, no one ever tells me to close the blinds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Study music, but darn good","review":"Before buying the CD, I read the book by Herman Wouk. The book made me laugh and almost cry(lol). A great story. So Jimmy and Herman get together, yadda, yadda, need a soundtrack for the play. So what does the buyer of this CD get in return for the hard earnest money they pay? Music that reminds you of the characters and events from the book. Music that was made to be performed on stage. This is not movie music, this is stage music. If you haven't read the book, don't buy the CD. If you have read the book, this is great music for relaxing, studying, and reading. And you'll ever find yourself singing to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Stop the music, I want to get off!!!!","review":"Jimmy has had a string of weak releases over the last five years and this one is no different.

Being a fan of Buffett's books and music alike, I was optimistic, but still wasn't sure how my idol would do with a musical. I was pleasantly surprised. The emotions of the women (Especially in \\"Sheila Says\\" and \\"Henny's Song\\") were clear and very real to me.The recording does make more sense if you have read the novel by Herman Wouk, however, I liked the characters better in the musical BEFORE I had read the novel.Parrotheads and Musical Fans alike should add this CD to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffett meets Wouk and the result is a Carnival","review":"If you like Jimmy Buffett and have read Herman Wouk's \\"Don't Stop The Carnival\\" then I think you'll love this CD. I know I do. As only Jimmy Buffett could do, he has taken his band members and cast them into the various characters in Mr. Wouk's novel. As the CD moves on, I can see Jimmy as Norman Paperman, Mac McAnally as Hippolyte, Tina Gullickson as Iris, and Nadirah Shakoor as Sheila. The rest of the Coral Reefers also do a wonderful job. I truly enjoyed hearing each of them sing while playing the role of their character. The CD moves along with the flow of Mr. Wouk's novel perfectly. I can't stop listening to it, but know I will soon, so that I can read Mr. Wouk's novel once again. Hopefully the musical will make it where I live someday. Thanks Jimmy, The Coral Reefers, and Mr. Wouk. This is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy continues to move in the right direction","review":"The fun continues with this latest release.

I have listened to it so many times that I wake-up humming different tracks, usually Callyloo, and realize that I had been humming it in my sleep, as part of a dream. This is different than anything else Jimmy has done, and to me a remarkable set of lyrics and music that bring the story to life. I can't wait 'til the show reaches Broadway where, I predict, it will win awards and gain Jimmy new followings of older and younger fans. P.S. Make sure to read \\"A Pirate Looks at 50\\", J.B.'s latest book. Another masterpiece.

First of all, I was disappointed in that the \\"enhanced\\" features never worked on my computer. I worked for hours to get anything out of it, and got nowhere. I wrote to the record company and received no response. Second, as far as the music goes, it probably worked well in the context of the musical, but, standing alone, the songs are tunes I just don't want to listen to more than a couple of times.

But trying to fold it is ridiculously hard. The bracket that secures the folding leg grips it very hard, and a significant amount of force is needed to release the leg for folding. Also, in the folded position the stool would not stay upright in the shower stall, it fell over constantly. I gave up on it in the shower and now keep it in the garage to sit on when washing the wheels of my car. I replaced it in the shower with an excellent folding teak stool I found at Bed, Bath & Beyond, it takes up less room, folds easily, and does not fall over when leaned on the shower wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should Have Waited.","review":"It Waits?

This all draws away from the horror and in the end it turns out being one thing: Crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lurks, it prowls...it reaks","review":"It Waits is one of those modern day, low budget horror snooze fests that we've been getting a lot of lately, and it's abysmal from start to finish. Cerina Vincent (from Cabin Fever, whose large \\"attractions\\" are the only thing that'll keep your eyes on the screen) stars as an alcoholic forest ranger (yes, you read that right) who gets stalked by a murderous, blood thirsty creature (because there are no other kinds) from Native American mythology that makes short work of her boyfriend and a few hikers. Normally, under the right circumstances, I try to be understanding of a low budget horror flick of this type, but everything about it so bad from the wooden acting, creaky attempt at giving Vincent a weak backstory, and the poppy soft-rock is about as welcome here as a claw in the guts. The gore and makeup are halfway decent, but that's it. Beyond bad, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the action to happen!","review":"The only way to acurately describe this movie? a horror film pre-empted by a lifetime drama. This film dragged bigtime with some b.s. about Cerina Vincents characters guilt over a car accident she caused that kills her friend...lush! The amount of time spent on these flashbacks of drunken guiltiness has nothing to do with the problem at hand; some supernatural creature killing everyone in the forest valley. I would have given this film another star if it had one of two things, more gore,or if Cerina vincent took off her top. Bottom line..Dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Waits","review":"It Waits is a A Jeepers Creepers Carbon copy almost. it is a little scary and it's not horrible but it kind of drags on and the monster could have been scarier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother................","review":"The Netflix guys didn't fire the filmmakers because the camera crew went nuts after 5 days of no sleep, they fired them because the camera crew got smashed-drunk and acted like morons. The people actually participating in the world record are the ones with no sleep whatsoever and they seem completely fine during the movie. The presenter starts acting more and more like an idiot, probably in a desperate effort to make this incredibly boring documentary more interesting. He fails.

He's been named IBMA's guitarist of the year for 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. At the age of 24, Bryan joined Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder and with that exposure, he quickly rose to the top echelons of Flat Pick guitar players. Bryan is also featured along with Chris Thile on Mark O'Connors 30 year retrospective. Bluegrass Guitar delivers hard sizzling bluegrass guitar rhythms. Bryan is joined by Dennis Crouch (bass), Tim Crouch (fiddle), Tim O'Brien (mandolin), and David Talbot (banjo and rhythm guitar).to produce this classic mix influenced by traditional old time, R&B, jazz, spiritual and country. Highlights are Beaumont Rag, The High Road and Back Up and Push. The Storms Are on the Ocean and Margaret's Waltz are exceptionally sweet. There isn't a bad cut on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another delightful Sutton album despite error","review":"Joyous, poignant bluegrass, played to perfection. Unfortunately, the sequencing of the tracks appears botched, at least on my issue, so the fiddle version that should follow Faulkner's intro is stuck onto the end of the final track, and the numbers of the final tracks are off by one. I'll endure (to allude to another Faulkner)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a terrible DVD. The firefighters in these videos don't even make an interior attack.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Pessimistic for Women in My Situation","review":"I ordered this book after being put on bedrest for pre-term labor and found the chapter on this subject to be anything BUT encouraging. The author makes it sound like pre-term labor is a death sentence for your unborn baby because of the experience she had, and according to her, there is virtually no hope of having a baby anywhere near term if you have this condition. There are other subjects in the book such as Gestational Diabetes, PIH, etc, which are less drear, and I'm sure they are of help to women experiencing these conditions, but as a whole, I was disappointed with this book. After several chances, I stopped reading this book because of it's bleak outlook on a common pregnancy complication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Wonderful!!!","review":"This book was really helpful for me during my triplet pregnancy!

We all thoroughly enjoyed and were moved by the marvelously drawn characters and the author's appreciation of the child heart with its true devotion and sinfulness alike. This is not the first in the Little Susy series, and it may be best to start with the first, though it is by no means absolutely necessary. No other author of whom I am aware writes with such honest and insightful sympathy of the joys and struggles of the child who seeks to follow after God. We also laughed out loud in places, which makes it all the more remarkable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"astonished; no verbal cues on 2nd disc - buy \\"Yogi's Companion\\" by Lauren Petersen instead","review":"i wish i'd read all the low reviews before i blew the cash on this DVD set. it is astonishing that there are no verbal cues at all on the 2nd disc. to have to look up at the screen to see what she's up to next is extremely bad for the neck and thus blows the whole zen of the practice.it seems that people are IN LOVE with seane corn -and that's OK- as she's a very good technician. her vocal tone is a bit abrasive at times but she definitely knows what's proper alignment and breathing.gaiam should be ashamed. the DVD set is just bad. if you want a great challenging audio practice (but no visual) try \\"the yogi's companion\\" by lauren petersen. it's excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"yoga review","review":"The tapes demonstrate good technique and form. The poses are good for beginners and similar to what I have experienced in other beginning classes. The beginning of the first tape has too much talking and then the second tape has no talking at all. It is very difficult to participate in the yoga poses using correct form and breathing to get the desired benefits when there are no verbal cues as to when to change poses. You have to constantly turn to see if she has moved or not. I have use many excercise tapes and have never had one without at least the option for verbal cues."},{"rating":"1","title":"No voiceover!

Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Seane Corne, but find this video a little disappointing.","review":"It would be so great if the second video provided some spoken guidance instead of just being a silent vinyasa routine. There is no way that I could follow this without stopping, pausing the video and watching the sequence over and over - which defeats the purpose, I think. I don't really understand why there's no narrative. I purchased this after listening to a beautiful interview with Seane Corne via On Being."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a vinyasa practice","review":"The two DVD's have nothing to do with each other! The first one is instructional and it is ok, but full of incorrect directions, she is inconsistent with giving you the names of the poses, & it is not a vinyasa flow. But, not a bad workout so, you move on to the next dvd & think she'll put it all together for you.... you are wrong. The second dvd has no instruction, no pose names called out,....nothing but silence. How are you supposed to follow along, breathe, find yourself in the poses and watch? I was so frustrated by this expensive set. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best yoga dvd","review":"I wouldn't say I didn't like the practice itself, but the way they introduced it on the dvds doesn't make much sense. DVD 1 has too many instructions (would be ok if Seane didn't speak too fast, it's just distracting). So I tried DVD 2 - their breathing practice, and this one is absolutely useless. No verbal instructions at all - I don't know who could use it - unless you have extra pair of eyes on the back of your head, or you first learn this practice by heart:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"The 1st dvd would probably be very helpful to new yogi's to help them understand proper form; however, the 2nd dvd was the exact same routine with no audio cues what so ever! Considering this is a beginner II/ intermediate level dvd I would assume that there would be a more difficult routine option, especially with a two dvd pack. It is impossible to know the cues for each movement in the 2nd dvd because there are no instructions; you have to strain your neck to look up. They should have used a set amount of breaths for each pose OR had some sort of audio. I was looking forward to a challenge but Seane didn't even use full chaturangas, she demonstrated only versons on the knees and baby cobras! Not what I expected from an intermediate dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"INFURIATING","review":"I really wish someone had avised me against buying this DVD. It was the most expensive on the rack but looked more appealing than the others, which should have tipped me off. I just want to know, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE WORKOUT PORTION OF THE DVD (DVD#2)??? There is absolutely no voice or voice over and you have to keep your eyes glued on the TV the whole time!!! I really would like to know how you're supposed to meditate with your eyes closed, do downward dogs and child's poses while you have your face glued to the TV. This is a ridiculous and amateur mistake and anyone who buys this should be refunded their money. It's a darned shame. I feel truly ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"This video is terrible. It is waaaaaaaaayyyyy to slow!!!! I just bought it and it should not be considered a workout video. If someone is totally new at yoga and wants to see someone get into each move very slowly and listen to them talk this is the DVD for you. If you want a workout this is not for you! Now, I'm oversees and have to order a new DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"for beginners only","review":"this is way too slow for the average practioner. Personally i think there are much better dvds out there. I find Sean's voice kind of harsh and not very soothing. She has a very 'masculine' energy if that makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second DVD very frustrating","review":"While I enjoyed Seane's instructional DVD (part 1), the second DVD was ridiculous. I understand the appeal of a lack of verbal instruction, but this was lacking cues, as well (i.e., \\"dog pose, upward facing dog\\"...etc) so you have to keep your head turned the whole time to see what she is doing! It is impossible to fully embrace a pose when your head is turned to see what is happening next. That was a huge mistake to leave out the cues. I feel as though I did not get what I paid for--very disappointing and frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"This made me a yoga addict after one session!","review":"I was a bit aprehensive about trying Yoga again after borrowing a lame tape from my friend a while back. This video not only restored my faith but I am now addicted and can't wait til I can do the breath session.Anyone into energy will like this. Seane is so soothing and vibrant with positive energy. I found it easy to stay grounded and in a wonderful mood all day after this. I didn't feel too worked out, but my back feels longer and straighter and my posture is better--after only two sessions!I like that there aren't any other people to distract you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It simply doesn't flow...","review":"I had read other reviews and thought I would give Seane Corn a try. Now, I'm wondering what to do with this video that I spent money on...? This video is fine for beginners that do not have any yoga experience. This is a two DVD set. First: The step by step instruction is very helpful for beginners, but for those who know and enjoy the poses, her voice and constant talking gets overwhelming. Your body feels good after, but there is nothing stimulating for the spirit, which leaves one NOT in a state of peace and harmony. Second DVD: There are no instructions, so one needs to look at the t.v. the whole session until of course, you memorize the poses. Not a Great flow... Not good for a mind, body, & spirit connection. And certainly not good to watch over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Seane Corn is obviously an accomplished practitioner, but this DVD is useless to me as a practice video. The first instructional section is more of a reference on proper form that you might review once a quarter. As for trying to follow the actual flow sequence (which is why I bought this) with no cues - no way. Very bad for the neck and spine to have to try to watch and do the poses at the same time. I can't believe with her painstaking instruction in part one, she thinks this is a good idea! So sorry I spent the money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"When I Seane's DVD, I was very excited to do the practice. I have read such good things about her in magazines, and heard great things from those who have been in workshops with her. But as I was previewing the DVD, I found myself getting extremely bored. I guess it would be okay for beginners who want a hardcore breakdown of EVERYTHING, but for someone who has been practicing for a few years, this DVD isn't anything special. I wish she would've added a more advanced workout on the DVD as well. I know she's amazing because I've seen her in the Bryan Kest videos, so what's the deal Seane?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talking","review":"Too much talking on Seanne Corn's part. I wished for more yoga and less of her adding her own voice and commentary. I do not enjoy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging & Good","review":"My wife & I have a few yoga DVDs. We just got this one. Its challenging for us and Seane Corn is clearly very passionate about yoga. We wish she would have spoken a little slower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners BUT very slow for other","review":"This is a good DVD if you are a beginner. Seane takes the time to really explain yoga and go over correct alignment. If, however you are adv. beg or intermediate level yoga practioner it is a very slow DVD and not very challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. For rank beginners only.","review":"Now I admit that I had been doing a couple of years of yoga before I purchased this DVD. I'd heard much from friends about how great an instructor she was, and how hard she made you work. Well after doing this DVD a few times I thought it was a great disappointment.It had none of the lush backgrounds that I've come to expect from Gaiam. It was set at such a basic level that she couldn't even say modified sun salutations with a straight face. That is absolutely true because it was so darn modified that I didn't even recognize them as Sun Salutations.I didn't even break a sweat. That's now what I do when I do vinyasa yoga.What's with the breathing exercise. No instructions. You're suopposed to get into a pose and WATCH to see what she does next. I'm a visual learner, but this borders on the absurd. You have to get into a posistion and crane your neck to see the next pose. Dangerous IMO.The most diaappointing Gaim DVD I've purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second dvd is useless","review":"I consider myself an intermediate practitioner. Living in a small town, I rely on dvd's as a source of yoga classes. So I own many dvd's . I found Seane talked far too fast and with an excited tone (not very relaxing). She does not name the poses. It would have been to her benefit to have had a student going through the moves as she talked through the routine. She was not in time with the breath because she was talking. Sometimes she would mention to pick up the props after she had moved to the other side and the prop was left behind. I was unable to enjoy the dvd. And the second dvd has no verbal instruction. That is pointless unless you plan to sit back and watch her go through the routines. Makes no sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you are a beginner, Skip this one","review":"I purchased this DVD after reading the wonderful reviews, however I was really disappointed.While her form is great and she provides excellent tips throughout the workout, it is very easy and she talks just way to much in my opinion.The second DVD is the identical practice but with no speech. I am sure there are people who can do it this way but I'm not one of them.If you are looking for a beginner workout with a lot of talk then this DVD is for you, otherwise invest elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done but ....","review":"What a marvelous yoga practice from Seane Corn! I did the 1st DVD and felt as though I left a one-on-one instructional yoga class. I have rarely felt that way with any yoga videos I have done (except maybe Bryan Kest's original Power Yoga series). A very powerful yoga session. As a comment to those that say this is for beginner's, I've been practicing yoga (Iyengar, Power, and Hatha/vinyasa) since 1998- so I'm not a beginner but still found the instruction valuable. Seane is obviously a rare and thorough yoga teacher.The 2nd DVD left much to be desired- I intend on following the 1st DVD for awhile before embarking on the 2nd session. No verbal cueing was not a practical idea, even though I believe she intended for the viewer to manage their own home practice. Hopefully, that will help me with the 2nd DVD. I intend on getting her second yoga DVD, she is that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much chatter","review":"There is a wise saying \\"Avoid useless words, keep silence.\\" Seane Corn would be wise to heed that saying.

She seems overly self-conscious, and is so focused on describing what she's doing in as many words possible that it's hard to follow her meaning. Her chatter was so distracting made it impossible for me to focus on the practice itself. I didn't watch the second DVD because I was so frustrated with the first one. Look up Seane Corn on Youtube if you want to see if this video is right for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great first introduction to this author","review":"A friend just loaned me this book, and I couldn't put it down.One of the things I loved about it was all of the details that rang so true. I live in France (though not in Brittany), and so many novels that are set in France just end up silly or overdrawn. In this one, you can tell the author knows what she is talking about.The characters are interesting and realistic. While it was fairly clear from early on what the story was going to be about, there wasn't much mystery about it, I kept turning the pages to see just how it would play out. The ending brought Casey full circle, and if this book hadn't been just loaned to me, it would have a place in my bookshelves as a keeper.

When one of my boys had trouble with reading, I made him read the books out loud to me. I knew when he was skipping every and, the, a which made it hard for him but finally he began to see the pictures in his head. Once he got that, the reading was a breeze because he got what books were supposed to do, peek your own imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"this book was very good 2 thumbs up! I read it for a book report book. It was good in the first chapter it is an introduction on Almanzo and his family.Onward Almanzo does many things he buys his own lemonade with his own money. Later on the story gets more interesting...In the story there is no one problem for Almanzo.In the story their pig Lucy got candy all over her teeth because Almanzo gave her sticky candy.Almanzo and his sisters had to chase the pig down.This was not easy for them to do. In the process Lucy ripped a hole through Almanzo's blouse. I think this book was good and I think you all should read this.I would recommend this book to a friend. I think other people will like it too. It'll be a nice book for all ages. I think this book will be on the shelves for many more years to come.So everybody should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Only Wish LIW Had Written Other Novels Set In Her Husband's Life","review":"Farmer Boy, along with Little House In The Big Woods, was my favorite among all of Laura Ingalls Wilder's novels. This book breaks with the pattern of the rest of the series and tells a story not of Laura, herself, but of a year in the life of her future husband, Almanzo Wilder, as his family farms a proposerous holding near Malone, New York. Almanzo's eastern roots register more a familiar setting to me than the wilds of the Great Plains. I loved reading about Almanzo's adventures on the farm, raising Morgan horses, riding a sleigh thru the great New York winters, cutting ice on the frozen rivers, going to school, doing chores, attending fairs and church socials, having an upbringing every bit as sound and eventful with its established roots as young Laura Ingalls had a few years later out in the Wisconsin forest and the Kansas plains. A book anyone at any age can love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't make me read another word!","review":"Except for the historical accuracy of pre-1900 farm life,this book is just really hard to read with the baby wordingand situations that may be autobiographical, but couldbe made at least readable.I don't know exactly why I hate reading this one,but it just turns my stomach.Maybe it is the complete acceptance of an outmodedset of values that would have allowed a set of bulliesto kill a school teacher in ruralNew York ( and admitted by the author that the previousschool teacher died from his beating).I don't think the values assumed in this novelare ones that one would want to raise up in your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"two thumbs down","review":"Personally I did not like Farmer Boy. I thought some parts were more interesting than others. This book is too long I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend for a book report. All you people out there don't get this book for a report. This book had some really uninteresting parts [in my opinion]. I wouldn't really read this book again. My teacher assigned me this book last year but I moved and couldn't start it. I hope my next book report book is better. I give this book one thumb up. It isn't the worst book that I've read though Johnnie Tremain was. I got it from the library but I did not finish it. I got to the third page and put it down. Some boring parts about Farmer Boy are when Almanzo is fighting with his bigger cousin Frank. Ohh and when a little foal attacked them that was dumb. So this is the end of my review hope you benefit from it. NEVER READ THIS BOOK FOR A REPORT is what I learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not deserve the recognition of schools world wide","review":"Horrifically horrible!

The descriptions of the family's day and the food as well as what it took to live in those times makes it my series favorite. I read these books to my children when they were small and reread them still. I reread Farmer Boy in the midst of a 3ft snowstorm yesterday and it was a perfect diversion for the day. The Americans of these stories were made of sterner stuff than we. None of the political correct silliness that we have to endure today. Children were praised for doing well and admonished (albeit with love) for failure. This should be required reading for all new age parents who blanche at correcting a child for fear of damaging his or her self esteem. I was not raised that way, nor were my children. And I believe that they are the better for it. Just like Almanzo in Farmer Boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farmer Boy.....Farmer Boy......Farmer Boy","review":"Farmer Boy is about a boy that lives on a farm. On that farm they have colts, and Almanzo wants to train the colt. Almanzo's dad will not let Almanzo train the colts because his dad thinks that he is too small and not old enough.I think the author Laura Ingalls Wilder is trying to say is that nothing comes easy, and you have to work for something that you want really much. Another lesson that the author tried to tell is that you should never lie.I liked this book because when you read the book Farmer Boy you never want to stop reading it because there is always action in this book. Another part why I really liked reading this book is because when they describe something you can almost see is. Read this book and find out if Amanzo can train the colts. IT'S GREAT BOOK!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You sould read thid book.","review":"I will tell you that you should get this book. I loved this book and I know you will to.

Farmer Boy is the best book I've ever read.

That could have been bad or different. The show comes to be mostly bad. You expect this is a mecha series, which would mean plenty of action. Honestly that is included, but it feels like everything else comes first. Going back to the show's first season it would have been better if the 2 or 3 main characters, Hayase, Emi, and maybe the Juda Corporation president were almost the only ones. Instead a team of more annoying Juda members make this a series of odd humor where robots should be. Although you could still say it has it's moments. As bad as it is, it's not bad enough to rank in the worst I've ever seen. The point is this is really bad, but short of the worst.The animation is good, what you would expect from a recent show. This is almost certainly a show to avoid. I was so hopeful it could be the next great series, and it turned out to be everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget this...","review":"Dr. AIX forgot to mention that you need to spend $50 to get this dvd for free!!!

The sights, smells, sounds, and textures of pristine, rural Appalachia are powerfully evoked in this brilliant first novel, which also happens to have a creative and compelling plot.I heartily disagree with the reader who found the speech of the characters contrived; don't/didn't people in different places and times speak differently than we do? I found the dialogue to mirror the psychological portraits that were painted of the characters - women who, for example, said \\"hush now\\" and nurtured men who, by modern definitions, tried to rape them. I very much enjoyed this book's exploration of morality, religion, spirituality, societal roles and expectations of women, midwives' roles in and attitudes towards women's health and birth in that time and place. This is a wonderful book on so many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning debut","review":"Given the era and the setting of The Midwife's Tale one might expect a cliched depiction of tough Appalachian women who spout hard won and home spun wisdom.

The characters, the landscape, the story--the life of this once and future midwife--are portrayed with tremendous passion and depth. The rhythms, of language and structure, give the book an epic flair, yet epic in a particularly feminine sort of way. It is filled with blood, sweat, tears--there is suffering, but at the same time, like the Appalachian mountain on which the characters live, something always endures.This is a book for people who are looking for books to cherish, books to lose themselves in, cry over, read passages again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly wonderful read","review":"I was given this book to read by a friend who suggested that we consider it for one of our monthly book club readings.

I belong to a book club that has been meeting once a month for 13 years. This book was beautiful and so very well written. So good in fact that I wish I could contact the author!

However, there are some nuances that would keep me from buying another for a different gun.

Even with a huge paddle, I was worried the whole time that the holster and gun were going to fall into the dirt road and be lost. The Sig paddle, although smaller, is not going to come off. One can tell.Two, there is some play between the gun and the holster. Although it was a decent fit for the sidearm, it made noise when I was walking around. Nothing worse that a firearm rattling around in there.The button release seems slippery. I need to put some skate board tape on it. The sig holster button is checkered, and I can always tell when my finger is on it.This holster is good, and for the price a good value.

Reckless Kelly have adopted the Earle style and the singer even sounds very much like the old country rebel. In the booklet, Robert Earl Keen writes an introduction in which he really praise Reckless Kelly and I'm bound to agree. The album starts with two very catchy and melodic alternative country tunes with a fair amount of rock. The rest of the material is a mixture of faster and slower songs with hooks and melody in common. The country music style is always present but it doesn't sound as slick as modern acts like Shania Twain or as old as the Nashville tradition. I believe Reckless Kelly is the perfect bridge between the old and the new sound. If you like Steve Earle, Joe Ely, Robert Earl Keen among others, I can almost guarantee that you'll also find this album enjoyable. Dedicated fans of Jayhawks, Scott Miller, Whiskeytown and Ryan Adams might also like this attractive effort from Reckless Kelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits The Sweet Spot","review":"This is one of the best albums of the new millenium.

The songwriting is top shelf. The music is mostly about the blending of guitars. They use a little of everything; acoustic, electric, mandolins, lap steel, etc. It reminds me a little of Los Lobos at their best when they use like 5 or 6 guitars on every song. The guitars never get in the way of the vocals however. This is a nice job of production by Ray Kennedy, one of the best in the biz.It may be a little too country for some alt-country fans and not mainstream country enough for that crowd but for most folks, I think this should hit the sweet spot.

I must completely disagree with FARR's comments about this book - it appears that he/she considers themselves the absolute authority on raising children. Good parenting COMBINES elements of this book with the individual's own mores and values.

As for the rest of the book, I might reccomend certain common sense chapters on safety and hygene to teenage parents but the rest is dangerously out of date. That parents of today are still buying a book that advocates letting a child cry \\"it\\" out, and suggests that it is possible to \\"spoil\\" an INFANT by giving it attention and affection is disturbing.

The main characters and supporting cast actually can act. The lighting and audio were of professional quality. And there are no random side stories with stupid dialogue to take away from the main story. So often due to budget restrictions LGBT independent films are of poor quality, acting, and/or scripting. The ending sucked but the relationship was doomed from the start. I agree with one of the other reviews in that the reunion wasn't long enough to wrap it up. It sort of felt like a \\"slam, bam, thank you ma'am sex\\" but I don't think that is what it was meant to be.

Also, the college kid seems like she is 15 years, which make one really uncomfortable bc the teach looks to be in her mid 30s. I kept waiting for the film to get better but it did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The film's premise and setting hold much promise, and the two leads are very attractive, but I could barely sit through this film. The level of dialogue doesn't go much beyond sarcastic, superficial Valley-Girl-ese. There is no believable caring or realistic affection between the two characters. At one point, an argument between them exposes so much contempt (especially from the older Catherine toward the younger Jackie) that the relationship could only be deemed as pathological.The most believable film featuring an attraction between a female teacher and her student is the 1994 Australian film, \\"Only the Brave.\\" That attraction is a secondary plot in the film, but it is potently-realized. In Bloomington, on the other hand, the relationship is vapid & uncompelling. Also, some major plot developments are inconsistent with prior plot information & seem haphazardly added for drama, especially Catherine's fate at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good lesbian film","review":"I thought this was a wonderful, amazing film. I have to give them credit for finishing this film on a low budget and a time limit of 4 weeks. They worked so hard and so many hours. Yes the film could have been longer. Yes there were things in the film that would have been cut out, and Yes i feel like the ending was sad and left in a bad place. I really wanted them to have a happy ending and i think with more time to the movie they could have done just that. But i really liked this film and I could tell that the passion was there and it conveys the anxiousness and nervousness of a first love that everyone experiences or is going to experience.Overall, I loved this film a lot and I think it is worth a watch and maybe worth a BUY :)And yes I did buy it :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone else find it a little creepy?","review":"I mean, the college girl looks so much like a child and the teacher is so predatory in the beginning, it kind of creeped me out. There was also pretty much no build up between the characters to support that they were in a relationship. What's sad is that it's still better than quite a few lesbian films out there, because of the film quality and the fact that the actors didn't totally suck. Still, if you're going to compare it to the great lesbian movies, it just falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gutsiest new band around","review":"These guys aren't afraid to throw themselves into the music and definitely don't hold back.

Anyway, this soundtrack is the weakest soundtrack that I have ever heard. Christina Milian has to be one of lamest singers out there and I'm glad no more of her songs were put on this soundtrack. For the record, she is NOT an R&B;/soul singer- she is as pop as a Coca Cola about to lose it's fizz. I really don't care to much about the Black Eyed Peas and their music, especially since they've gone pop and added that floozy to the group. Listen to me, okay?

I have giving \\"Cowboys\\" as presents many times, and recommended it countless others.I was eager to see how Houston had grown in the few years since \\"Cowboys\\" was published, and was disappointed to find she hadn't. \\"Waltzing the Cat\\" reads like a volume of B-side tunes. They all work, but none of them had the sparkle, wit or insight that I saw in \\"Cowboys.\\"It's possible that I expected too much from Houston-- after all, don't they say the second book always falls short of expectations? Quite possibly she needs to write less from her life and more from her heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior follow-up to \\"Cowboys Are My Weakness\\"","review":"I had a hard time mustering up any sympathy for Lucy, the protagonist of this book. She seemed self-indulgent and egotistical. I got the feeling that this book falls into the new category called \\"creative non-fiction.\\" Nothing wrong with that, but I just didn't like her. I felt as if I was in a bar with a really insecure, drunk person who was telling exaggerated versions of her adventures, and not listening to anybody else. Pick up \\"Cowboys\\" for some strong, well-crafted stories and heroines you can care about. Skip this weak sophomore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent drivel","review":"Why do we need one more collection of stories narrated by a \\"heroine\\" from a dysfunctional background with so little self-esteem that she allows herself to be abused or treated badly by virtually every person in her life while simultaneously droning about her terror of growing old alone? Lucy's sense of worthlessness is appalling. Enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's getting very old","review":"Even the reviewers (such as the girls from Colorado) seem to think that there is something cute about picking creepy, non-committal men. \\"Cowboys\\" was fun, but can't Houston grow up and move along to something else already? When she writes about her adventures and her life-threatening situations, it comes across as bragging. Her insecurity is so obvious, it's painful. I feel sorry for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same Pam Houston who wrote Cowboys...?","review":"I was pretty unhappy with this book. I read it BEFORE I read Cowboys, and almost skipped reading anything else by this author. I was appalled by the fact that she uses REAL NAMES of people who live in Creede Colorado. Even if they did give permission, it made me feel that all the characters in the book were real and if I were one of the ex-boyfriends, I'd be very upset! A photographer?? Please, the story is so autobiographical it's ridiculous!!! Can she not come up with anything any more creative than her own life? This book reads like the author has writer's block and was simply trying to pump something out to keep her publishers happy. The only redeeming parts of the book are the descriptions of wilderness outings. In that area, Houston shines, and that's where she focused her writing in Cowboys....I hope she goes back to writing stories like that, because I was very dissapointed in an author I've heard so many good things about"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely read!","review":"I am just plain enjoying it, simple as that! It's like sitting around drinking a beer with your favorite person and swapping stories. She's funny, she's raw, and she has a hell of an adventurous spirit. I like her writing, period. She moves me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Over It","review":"Why doesn't she find a new subject? This book is such a disappointment--the fine sense of story is gone, replaced with self- help and psychobabble masquerading as characters. A HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me, but haven't we read these before?","review":"Houston is back, carping on about the same subjects--the river, the tranquility, the men who disappoint her. This time, though, it looks like she's put in some time on the couch--there's an eerie, Stuart Smalley feeling running through these stories--\\"We're smart enough, we're good enough, and gosh darn it, people like me!\\" Her observations, the sly humor, everything that made \\"Cowboys\\" the great read it is seem dull here, and I think it's because there is nothing new in any of this--it's merely more \\"Cowboys,\\" and frankly, this reader has had enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and Disjointed","review":"I enjoyed her first book, as it seems everyone else did, but it seems that Houston forgot that the Waltzing stories are supposed to be related to eachother--that it's not just a collection of short stories. In the first few tales, we hear that Lucy's happiest moment of childhood was when she was in the hospital, that her parents are extremely dysfunctional and alcoholic. But when you reach the \\"Waltzing the Cat\\" chapter, all of a sudden, Lucy says how close she and her mother are, there's no mention of alcohol, that she and her mother have grown closer over the years...huh? Did I miss something?The writing is repetitive, and Lucy seems to go nowhere. It's all well and good to write about one's struggle to overcome the abuses of childhood and toxic parents, but this is a book and I expect something to be happening, not a continuous whining droning on until the end. Nothing happens, Lucy doesn't grow or change or anything...dull dull book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great But Not Solid","review":"I bought this CD primarily for the two Donald O'Connor duets that were recorded for Decca in late 1953. Bing and D O'C had worked together (and quite well) in a couple of movies and I was glad to see these sides on CD. Interestingly, they are enjoyable but somewhat pedestrian...lyrically and melodically. Bing and Donald gel well together. Just wish they had been given some different material to work with. Some other interesting tracks are scattered throughout including a healthy serving of duets with Gary Crosby. A great addition for the Bing collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"scary, it's so good","review":"Sometime in 1990, while driving at 2 a.m. on Rte. 138 in Rhode Island, this album kicked into my brain (I believe it was \\"All Over the World\\" that did it) and really hasn't left.

I have it in three formats and am looking for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pixies best album","review":"First theres no such thing as a bad pixies album,but some are better than others.Surfer Rosa and doolittle are amazingly ahead of there time, but if I want to introduce someone to the pixies I do it with bossanova.Its simply the most easily digestable of all there albums and has something for everyone from the surf sounds of cecila ann to the in your face \\"rock music\\"it's also producer Gil Nortons finest work and shows that ol'black francis is capable of writing beautiful spacious songs like \\"ana\\" or \\"havalina\\", the first two albums might steer the first time listener to think that all they do is rock! Black Francis is a genius and you can hear it on \\"Bossanova\\" and later on \\"teenager of the year\\" under Frank Black.Take it from a guy who has three pixies posters framed in his house and who has met Mr.Black twiceat a sushi bar in the valley,Bossanova is not of this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"PIXIES meet PERFECTION!","review":"I first want to say that I probably feel so strongly about this album because it was the first Pixies album I ever heard, 13 years ago. I still listen to it with the same awe I did as a 14 year old girl. It is simply beautiful and mind blowing and perfect in every way, if you ask me. The Pixies will always be my favorite band and I wish everyone could experience their genius! Bossanova is the best! Please buy this album!!!!!!!! Then you will wonder how you ever lived without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rock music in outerspace","review":"this is their 'cleanest' album.Black Francis' singing is smoother as opposed to the other albums' more psychotic screatching tendancies ( which is so great too, deliberate ) there is a great feel of interstellar travel here. i dropped it a star because i think the execution of Pixies guitaring isn't their calling card and their drumming is too simple. but if the description 'controlled psychosis' sounds good to you, + u like rock, then explore this band or you're missing out on the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring.","review":"I like the Pixies a lot, but I found this disc to be dull and boring. It has none of the dynamics of their earlier material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a half for a pleasant listen","review":"The Pixies are a protest band. They want us to know they're not cool and they don't care. Which makes them cool.Their music, whether commercial or not, is 'ok'; Garbled sounding alternative rock with touches of Hawaiian.The gorgeous \\"Havalina\\", \\"Velouria\\" and the catchy \\"Stormy Weather\\" comprise the highlights.While it's cool to say you're 'underground', (which doesn't really make sense does it? Perhaps mining was their day job), and perhaps it's cool to say you have half-baked, poorly mixed music, makes you 'anti-commercial', it doesn't necessarily mean you make great music. Rating 2.5 (**1/2)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music never dies......","review":"\\"Bossanova\\" is an extrodinary record, as all the other Pixies albums. After owning this gem for about 9 years, I still listen to it with amazement. They, like a few other bands, were TOO GREAT for mainstream mall rats to grasp. Songwriting, musicianship, and the wittiest lyrics ever contribute to the Pixies longlasting mystique and influence. We all know Kurt was a Pixies freak.Me too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest album ever...?","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of all-time. It is undoubtely the climax of the Pixies' indiereign, and i recommend to everyone who dig the lesser talented Nirvana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hospitalized every time I listen","review":"This album is simply amazing. Near every song flows in such a haunting manner that it is impossible not to be shaken. I find myself near drooling during the outro parts of \\"The Happening\\" and \\"All Over The World.\\" The pixies perfect this delicate art of taking an already short song halfway through and turning it into an acid trip. If you are wasting your time reading this sentence, you are also delaying the biggest treat your ears will ever devour."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the lesser Pixies albums, but still a must have","review":"This is not the top of the Pixies lineup, but it's still better than 99% of the music out there. Best songs are \\"The Happening,\\" \\"Rock Music,\\" \\"Dig for Fire\\" and \\"Velouria.\\" This album has a more pop feel than most Pixies, which I think just shows their versatility as a band. . . one of the reasons they were so good is that they really knew how to change it up, and their different albums evidence that. The best of the Pixies in my humble opinion would be \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and then \\"Come on Pilgrim.\\" Also awesome is \\"Doolittle,\\" which gets a lot of hype, but for good reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest little collection of songs ever produced!","review":"I have played this album literally hundreds of times from start to finish.

I really love \\"Love Song\\" because of the CSNY harmonizations and the Beatle-esque progression (i.e. I've heard from other people that this song sounds a lot like the \\"Dear Prudence\\" guitar part)...This is great Elton John... it's right before he starts going all over the pop spectrum.. and so he sticks to the more balladear type stuff.... in a sense, it's similar to Billy Joel's \\"Piano Man\\" in the sense that it's got a \\"Billy The Kid\\" kind of flair...When I first heard this album.. it was the first time I really understood that Elton John had picked up (with a slightly more glam rock feel) where The Beatles had left off.. it's a great album and I highly recommend it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton goes Country!","review":"After I purchased Mad Man Across The Water. I bought Tumble Weed Connection. I had my doubts at first because quite frankly, I'm not a fan of Country music. Anyway when I got home I played it and ..... I liked it! This album has only two fillers #7 and #9 The rest of the songs are memorable clasics to the end. It is kind of strange that this album had no hits at all. Even when it was dedicated to folk,blues, and country musicians. Not to mention that it was also dedicated to our country AMERICA!and still none of the songs didn't reach the charts! Anyway this was the third album that I purchased. I would have gave this album four stars but Ta da! The bonus tracks came to the rescue! If anybody liked his classic years or likes old 70's folk music then this one is for you. I know it is for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come down in time","review":"I am so grateful for discovering this Elton John classic recently. I have most of Elton's albums but failed to listed to any of his material before 1972's \\"Madman Across the Water\\" album (of which the original version of that song appears on this album). This 1970 album is a masterpiece in every sense. From the haunting \\"come down in time\\" to \\"my father's gun\\" this album demonstrates the very young Elton John with his glorious voice (before it went bad in the mid 80's). Other treasures on this album include \\"southern comfort\\" and \\"burn down the mission\\". Probably the only weak song is \\"Son of my father\\" which I always skip.This album proves that Elton was a star long, long before \\"Goodbye yellow brick road\\". Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton John's best hands-down","review":"The songs in this album flow so beautifully into each other, yet cover many different themes.

Good shipping also.Thank You,Frank"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tumbleweed Connection- Elton John","review":"Una agradable sorpresa!, conocía \\"Madman Across the Water\\", para mi el mejor disco de Elton, \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" es de un estilo más country/folk/blues, con un gran trabajo de Elton en el piano y sin los arreglos orquestales de Madman. Un Elton John inspirado y sin presiones comerciales. Temas como Amoreena, My Fathers Gun y Burn Down The Mission justifican todo el trabajo. Muy recomendable"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST BUY IT!","review":"This album is a hidden gem. This is one of the few albums I own that I enjoy every single song on it. \\"Into the Old Man's Shoes\\" and \\"Amoreena\\" are especially good songs. BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring old fart","review":"This is one of his \\"hitless\\" albums, and for good reason; nothing on it is very good. The opening track is dull. and the rest are not much better. Drab cover fits the drab mood on these songs. Bernie Taupin's lyrics are very weird, and an acquired taste to be sure. Personally, I'll eat something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton John Tumbleweed Connection","review":"This is a great CD with a lot of his brilliant early music. A must for all EJ fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his very best","review":"When this album came out a whole lot of us realized that Elton was not your average singer/songwriter. He was given freedom to pursue his muse on this one and it is astounding in its consistency. You won't skip over a single tune and the additional cuts are far from filler material. \\"Talking old soldiers\\" is magnificent in its sincerity and emotional impact. And \\"Burn down the mission\\" is true to its name. It blazes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Five Album of Its Era","review":"Tumbleweed rates as one of the greatest five rock albums ov its era, along with Abbey Road, Who's Next, Dark Side of the Moon, Let it Bleed, and Sticky Fingers... just an album consisting of pure, raw expression without distractions. If you aren't sure you like John's later, poppish works... try Tumbleweed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Elton","review":"This one doesn't fit in with anything else Elton did. There are no monster commercial hits. It's definitely not \\"pop.\\" Instead, Elton gives us a very cohesive disc of songs that is truly a gift for the true Elton John fan. Casual fans won't appreciate it, but will still get into \\"Burn Down The Mission\\" and \\"Love Song.\\"The true gem here is \\"Madman Across The Water.\\" Much different than the album version, it truly rocks. My only complaint is (and, yes, I know it's a bonus cut) it shouldn't be on this CD because it is completely unrelated sound-wise to the original Tumbleweed songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Your Music Collection","review":"This is the best album/CD Elton John ever did. There is not a bad song in the bunch. Even if you don't normally like Elton John, give this a listen. I think you will be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton's Best","review":"Simply a must own. From start to finish, his best, and my favorite. I don't want to say he peaked this early, there's lots of good stuff later in his career, but this album NEVER gets old.First bought this in grammer school when it came out. Wore through three albums, and I'm on my second CD. Without a doubt, on my top 100 ever list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing from the first to last track","review":"Early, classic Elton John music is the artist's peak as far as I'm concerned. His run that began with 11-17-70 and ended with Captain Fantastic is just astounding. But Tumbleweed Connection is possibly the best of the lot.From a musical, lyrical, and production standpoint, TC is peerless. Every song is a winner. There's the irresistible \\"Amoreena\\" and the gorgeously layered (but never over-produced) \\"Burn Down The Mission\\" and the bucolic and ever-catchy \\"Country Comfort.\\" It's been well documented that John and Taupin (his lyricist) were into The Band during the writing and recording of this album. Well, that influence is certainly present.Each tune abounds with tasteful acoustic and electric guitars, thoughtful and timeless lyrics, and of course John's wonderful piano playing. There are no hit singles on this album. There are no affectations on this album. And there are no duds on this album. A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent right through.","review":"Not a clinker in the lot. If you only know his later work, pick this up, it'll be a revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS BEST","review":"PEOPLE!!! I'm 21, I grew up listening to a copy of this my parents had. Since I've grown older, I have searched for another album by Elton that matches and I just can't. Okay, maybe this doesn't have the big classic hits, but song for song this album is amazing. Sure the \\"Levon\\"s and \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" and the \\"Your Song\\"s will always be there, but what about the \\"Amoreena\\"s and \\"Where to NOw ST. Peter\\"s?? I would direct anyone unfamiliar with early Elton John here. This is just an awsome record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton and Bernie's Best","review":"I was too young to for this album and other greats and sadly grew up seeing Elton's Bad Eighties Music Videos.

I got into Pulp when Different Class came out and instantly fell in love. This album blows Different Class away; if that is even possible. Jarvis Cocker is a master at conveying real emotion with his lyrics. Every single song is great. I suggest that everyone get this album even if they've never heard of Pulp. This is Hardcore is one of the best albums I've ever heard or will probably ever hear(until the next Pulp album, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over doing it","review":"This album is way too moany for the dramatic styling Pulp is going for. The musical textures can be nice (This Is Hardcore, The Fear) but they don't match the vocals which don't match the lyrics. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"HERE COMES ANOTHER PANIC ATTACK","review":"The novelty of Different Class and even Pulp's previous efforts is missing here. While the album flows nicely, the songs are not easily distinguishable from one another without very careful listening. And it just sounds pretentious or stupid for Jarvis Cocker to say in a song that he has the same initials as Jesus. Someone thinks he is a bit too clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"OK, I've looked through all the other reviews on here, and I know that anyone who does the same will probably go with the looming majority vote and get this album but PLEASE DON'T!!! About a year ago I first heard Different Class and thought it was great. So much fun, excellent lyrics, and just really great! the melodies, the instrumentation...amazing. So recently I heard This Is Hardcore. A few of the songs are pretty good (Dishes, The Fear, The Day After The Revolution) but for the most part it's just plain BORING!!! Where did the fun go? This album is sad, dreary, and dull. Yes, it is a darker mood, and I realize that Jarvis Cocker probably had a reason to write such melancholy songs, but after hearing Different Class, who wants to listen to them? Many of the songs sound the same and, while not being terrible, were completely uninspiring. Buy Different Class instead. It rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is in a different class.","review":"Its hard to believe how much I enjoyed their previous cd \\"Different Class\\", and how much I dislike this one. I should have known the critics would prefer this one. Afterall, its bereft of all the charm, melodies, and likeability of \\"Different Class\\". In otherwords an obvious effort to be different, like it or not. I don't. Do yourself a favor; buy their previous release."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is hardcore...yeah, hardcore rubbish!","review":"There seems to be a new trend that's been happenning with great English bands. This trend is changing from being a great British band, to being a mediocre American sounding British band. It happenned first to Blur, whose 1997 self titled release more closely resembled Pavement than the witty, often anti-Americanism of their previous four albums. Now Blur's mates Pulp are at it. Pulp, who have been together for over 15 years, but just gained notoriety in the past few years, had just reached perfection. The last album, 'Different Class' was absolute genius. But after the departure of Russell Senior, their guitarist/electric violinist, they appear to have lost their charm. Of course the American press loved the album, because it is radio friendly, unoriginal material. Any true fan of Pulp is let down by the change of direction of a great band. Let's just hope they get back on the right path (do it for the fans, Jarv!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Hardcore","review":"This Is Hardcore being Pulp's 1998 release and their 6th studio album had such hits as \\"This Is Hardcore\\", \\"Help the Aged\\" and \\"Party Hard\\". The booklet is quite nice with clear and well shot photos, all the lyrics are included and they are easy to read. The album did quite well and peaked at #1 in UK album charts. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent late 90's alt pop","review":"Fluid set of English Alterna-soul found Pulp finally receiving the success critics had thought them deserving. More then proving why they remained giants of 90's indie rock in Britain, the songwriting is infectiously hooky, depressively catchy, and lyrically potent all the way through. Every song may not be as memorable as the title track or a few others (in particular the effectively rousing final few), yet each cements a certain replayability with the well measured, easily accessible, melodic pop songwriting. The band became a mainstay for fans of loud, semi-experimental music, falling somewhere between the predictability of Spiritualized and the randomness of Radiohead. Whatever small market the still under-valued (in America) band conquered during the mid 90's across the pond, This is Hardcore still makes the case for being the modern alternative classic some have made it out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for every pulp fan","review":"Be warned: this album is not for every Pulp fan. The album is not as consistent or as poppy as Different Class or His and Hers, but it is brilliant nevertheless. With the departure of Russell Senior, Bruce Weber becomes the lead guitarist of the band. Weber, a fan of experimental guitarists such as LaMonte Young, brings a darker, more jagged edge to the band, a change that some Pulp fans will not appreciate. But for those willing to go out on a limb with the band, this album offers so much upon repeated listening.The bittersweet ballad \\"Little soul\\" alone is worth the price for this album. But you should also own the album for the self-mocking dance anthem \\"party hard\\", the creepy, sensuous \\"this is hardcore\\", and the heartbreaking bridge of \\"dishes\\", quite possibly the most beautiful song ever written about washing dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I get it!!!!","review":"O.K., so I'm 38 years old, not in any sort or mid-life crisis mode, but looking to expand my musical horizons.

Their ability to change directions with this album is impressive. In its own way, it's as much a work of art as \\"Different Class.\\" Having said that, \\"This Is Hardcore\\" will be unlistenable for many who really liked \\"Different Class.\\" This one's definitely in a class of its own.

I'm simply never in the mood for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad Album","review":"I think this is the saddest Pulp's album I've ever heard.

I would love to have these guys sing at my wedding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Beatlesque jangle pop","review":"Much like other residents of Athens, such as REM in their Reckoning and Murmur stage, this album is full of strong jangle pop, with strong melodies played over dual guitars.Although the lyrics are not the strongest (see \\"Andy Warhol\\"), the highlights certainly outweigh any defects. Strongest songs include \\"Could've been James Dean\\" and \\"Couldn't care less about\\", the later of which highlights their Beatle roots, with layered harmonies and a rollicking chorus.With five stars reserved for classic, groundbreaking albums such as Fleetwood Mac's Rumors, or the Beatles Sgt.

I had a lot of problems with it, including shaking badly; however, my local dealer, Apex Saw of Reno, NV stood behind the product and took a return. In addition, Delta stood behind the saw and also told me they would give me a return.That is great customer service and I want to praise Apex Saw of Reno and Delta for their service.AD2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This is not a very good short film on the Franco-Prussian War. It jumps around to much, and doesn't seem to have a focus. The actors used look awful. The film uses little art from the period or about the war. I wasted my money because I'll never use this as a teaching tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good historical review","review":"Those looking for a sensational war film will be disappointed. Those looking for action, will be equally disappointed.This DVD provides a well-balanced historical review of a very European war. Also in many respects a very important war, mostly due to its far-reaching political consequences. Anyway, a war resulting from the complex European politics most Americans aren't used to -- and don't like.Be prepared for a couple of British university historians, extensively explaining this war and its whereabouts to you. Military as well as politically. The picturing on this DVD is meagre, for the simple reason that in 1870-'71 films did not exist and photography was primitive and clumsy.Some criticism may be found in the (too) scarce use of maps. As well as in the lack of any modern shots of important 1870-'71 sites, and its memorials.Watching this DVD is like getting a lecture on university level. It may be a little 'dry', but its quality is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This video is terrible. There must be hundreds of books with illustrations on the Franco Prussian war and yet they use the same pictures and engravings over and over again.

I was sadden to realize that I has wasted my money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flakes off onto my face all day.","review":"I do like the way this looks on my brows: very natural looking.

When I read the glittering reviews, it seemed a good choice. Several reviews spoke of the dialogue that \\"crackles and glitters\\", sounds like \\"eavesdropping on someone at the next table\\", \\"masterful\\", \\"convincing\\". It is none of the fore-mentioned. It's contrived, unbelievable, stilted. The worst part of the dialogue, however, is Higgins bad habit of repeating the character's dialogue, as if you hadn't read it the first time.The plot is complex, too complex. It jumps from one scene to another without any transition. New characters appear miraculously and then disappear for the rest of the story. Many questions and resolutions go unanswered.I wish some of the books I read would never end. I thought Outlaws would never end!

Everyone knows it sucks, but there are a few weirdos who think it's the best thing ever... and they are all girls. This music is pure cheese and the people who enjoy it are cheesey. I don't know at what point you trade in your testicles for a fondness of Def Leppard, but it seems to have happened to a lot of people. The only people who should listen to this album are the ones who use Aqua-Net or Stiff Stuff on their bangs and think that Bon Jovi is a better musician than an actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, no.","review":"For a rugged title such as Pyromania, the music is pretty much the water that douses it out.By the way, how are Rick Allen's rudiments coming along?

With catchy radio hits like Photograph and Foolin' mixed with songs like Stagefright and Under Fire (which in my opinion totally should have been a single), this is the kind of cd that you can listen to without skipping a single song. i think the one, and only, thing that could have made Pyromania better is.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. it is the ULTIMATE in Def Leppard and for that matter one of the ULTIMATES in music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"My product was very fair priced, easy to find and order and arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Def Lepps last stand!!","review":"This album rocks!!

The collaboration with Mutt Lange gave this already-talented band new height. Rock Rock(Til You Drop) is the bomber. Their first hit \\"Photograph\\" as well as only live recording \\"Stagefright\\" are my top favorites. I got this album only last year but I am sure I will enjoy this for more than 10 years for sure! Cheers for excellent rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EPIC FAIL!!!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS! I don't know who was the producer for the live portion of this album but if you're interested in the 1983 live concert from L.A. like I was, you will be supremely disappointed. Joe Elliot's voice is AUTO TUNED to an obnoxious degree on almost every song. It sounds utterly ridiculous. There is no way Def Leppard sounded like this in 1983. I have no idea why Def Leppard would allow someone to bastardize their music this way but it happened and it's an atrocity. Waist of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Working-Class Album By A Working-Class Band","review":"Def Leppard came from the tough streets of Sheffield, England and onto rock superstardom with this 1983 release. This is easily their best album and also their heaviest-rocking. The hits keep coming with songs like Photograph, Rock Of Ages, and Foolin'. Pete Willis was fired from the band during the making of this record and was replaced by Phil Collen, formerly of Girl. Alcohol was the demon that plagued Willis and cost him his job and would prove to be the demise of Steve Clark who died in 1991 of an overdose. This is balls-to-the-wall rock 'n' roll from start to finish. If you can't handle it, go listen to Michael Jackson."},{"rating":"2","title":"jef leppard","review":"bought all their cassettes as soon as they were out! dressed like joe elliot for halloweens and called myself jef leppard for a while in a band. great cd buy it and all their others too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pyromania, Excellent !","review":"Pyromania is excellent! This was their best CD before Hysteria. The vocals were great and guitar riffs also great. I would recommend this CD to anyone that is just started to get into Def Leppard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Many people assume that Def Leppard is heavy metal and so do not try them. However this album and Hysteria are must haves for any music enthusiast. The songs are well crafted and with a lot of attention to production.Once again Mobile Fidelity has done a fine job of bringing out the best from the original recording without resorting to compression or other nasties. The bass is deep and strong, vocals are very clear and every instrument can be heard. A must for audiophiles that like to rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONce we were rockers, but now we love money...","review":"In my opinion, this album is pure rock. It is almost perfect, true British rock. But it is the last real Leppard album with heart, before they threw every real love for music through the window, to make America and begin to get big, big money. But they are great guys. Letting drummer Allen stay in the band with only one arm is a real sign of friendship and affection. (and the band reached their appice with him on board). After that, they lost guitarrist Steve Clark, but went on and on, never losing faith. This is their true merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic hard-rock!","review":"Producer Mutt Lange also produced AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\". In \\"Pyromania\\", he did another hit smasher!! The album is great, full of good songs like \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Stagefright\\" and emotioning chorus. The onnly thing I don't really like at all in Def Leppard is the drumming, which is very \\"frozen\\" and estatic, with no heart at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap Rock","review":"What is the class of this band? Crap rock? Chick Rock? This is just radio friendly, pop rock at it's worst, Rock Of Ages is not a bad song but it gets tired after a few listens as is not epic or anything like that. Also every album they made until the absolute garbage after Retroactive sounds like a carbon copy of this album. I hear now they are playing with Taylor Shift....."},{"rating":"1","title":"STICK TO THEIR TWO FIRST ALBUNS !","review":"Because tehy are much better than this PYROMANIA, who marked the new \\"phase' for Leppard...

I considered myself lucky to see them that year opening for AC/DC on their Back in Black tour. Also saw them several times on High & Dry tour, which also rocked. When this pap-smear atrocity came out, I felt betrayed. It was just crappy commercial pop-hard rock and I gave this album away. No wonder Pete Willis became an alcoholic. Even though I listen to a lot of Cryptopsy, Visceral Bleeding, and Sickening Horror these days, I still love the 1st two DL albums (yes, I still own my 12\\" vinyls) but after Pyro came out, they were dead to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burning it up","review":"Def Leppard's Pyromania album is one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever created. With songs like Rock of Ages, Foolin', Rock Rock, Stagefright and the ever immortal Photograph, this album is one of the most original and groundbreaking pieces of work that came out of the eighties. As an eternal fan of the band, I must stress that every album after this is a little different but progressively better, the band grows and develops themselves even more after this. Before the tragedies and hard times (which never really affected their music), this album displays the raw energy and talent of this fantastic group. This album is well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time greatest","review":"Def Leppard was (and is) a cut above their contemporaries. Pyromania is one of the few 80's metal albums that should stand the test of time. Every song on the album is strong, plus it doesn't have one single 'power ballad' (not that I dislike them, but this was before they became an 80's metal staple).If you don't have this album and you consider yourself a rock fan then shame on you. Also, if you had it on vinyl or cassette go back and get it on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pyromania Heats Up Your Stereo!","review":"Pyromania is my second favorite album from my favorite rock group. Probably the second most popular album commercially (behind Hysteria), Pyromania was the band's last real rocking album before the tragedies started. Guitars, vocals and drums were great and helped cement the foundation for the '80's pop metal / melodic rock genre.Photograph, Foolin', Rock of Ages and Rock, Rock Till You Drop lit up the airwaves with great Leppard licks. Too Late, Comin' Under Fire and Action! Not Words didn't get on the air as much but were great songs! Billy's Got a Gun, Stagefright and Die Hard the Hunter were also awesome tunes.If you like this album, it is the precursor their other great releases, Hysteria and Adrenalize. You will also want to pick up the slightly harder, but (in my opinion) even better High 'N' Dry album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Great Rock album","review":"This IS a good rock album. Wonderful combination of blazing guitar-work, energy, melody, harmony and a good edge to it. A great combination of Musical ability and edgy rock and roll. In my humble opinion, this is the best album they ever did. In fact this is one of my favorite albums of all time. All the tunes on this album are good. Foolin, Rock of Ages, Photograph, are wonderful tunes. This is truly a classic 5 star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remaster to an AMAZING album!","review":"Not only is pyromania my 2nd favorite album of all time, it has been remastered to fit my music needs when it comes to my favorite band of all time (DEF LEPPARD). It's got an awesome live disc, from 1983, same year this came out. Back in the day in fact, this album hit number to, ONLY to Michael Jackson's thriller, and sold 10 million in the U.S. This band is incredible, and so is the album!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This","review":"If you don't know who Def Leppard is or have never heard of the album Pyromania then you are probably not an 80s child and if you were then you lived under a rock. This album is the genesis for Dep Leppard. There were albums before this one but this album really got people to notice who the band was and what they were capable of. Anyone who is a die hard DL fan will tell you that this album is significant because most everyone agrees that every song is a hit. This phenomenon is rare and Tesla's Mechanical Resonance is the only album that I know of who's fans will say the same of. Don't waste your time or money on any other album if you aren't sure if you like DL. Any greatest hits album (i.e. \\"Vault\\") will contain about 75% of the songs from this album and leave you missing out of the other outstanding 25%. Just get it, you know you wanna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last true hard rock album by Def Leppard","review":"The Leppards continued to work with producer Mutt Lange on the 1983 release Pyromania. This was the last album with Pete Willis (enter one Phil Collen). This was also Leppard's last Hard Rock album (they were NEVER EVER a heavy meetal band) before the more syth than guitar pop album Hysteria (which is good btw). 10 tracks all great excellent guitar riffs and solos. This album by itself is the reason these lads were so successfully in the 80s the trend would also continue with Hysteria. If you haven't already purchased this fine album (what ARE you doing buy it NOW) You shall not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"A must have for Def Leppard fans.

The live second disk in this set is a collection from Def Lep's first three releases, the production is a little inconsistent but the songs chosen to be on this one are the ultimate Def Lep jams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although \\"outgrown\\", still loved","review":"I don't know if I could listen to this recording in one sitting now. It certainly has great songs of the 80's in it. I was probably 13 or so when it came out and it was HUGE. Bought some of the Def Leppard merchandise like hats, etc. I remember singing along to many of its catchy-hook songs. It's an 80s classic. Has to get a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hard Rock Album","review":"This Def Leppard Album is a must own for anyone who loves rock music.

For a long time I had owned the Quatuor Mosaiques performances of the Nos. 5 and 6 in Op. 18, cherishing the wonderful sound of their period instruments and their marvelous playing. At long last, I picked up the other two discs that complete this set of string quartets, and I was certainly not disappointed by either. This release, which contains the Nos. 1 and 4, is just as sublime as that containing Nos. 5 and 6. If you want period instrument renditions of these works, the Mosaiques are clearly the way to go. Even if you're not, I highly recommend them. (My other set is by the Tokyo String Quartet on Harmonia Mundi.) For these early Beethoven quartets in particular, the period sound seems absolutely perfect, and the fact that these artists can really play doesn't hurt matters. A big thumbs up for this one and its Op. 18 companions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!!","review":"Whereas the performances of the Emerson String Quartet are generally recognized as the apex of interpretation - and they are indeed fine, I find these renditions by Quatuor Mosaiques yet the more sublime. These are extremely well engineered recordings with full, rich acoustics (one can feel the power of the cello's lower range) that provide the listener with an acute presence of the ensemble and highlight their delightfully crisp articulation. Quatuor Mosaiques performs on period instruments (toward which I am unabashedly biased) of exceptional timbre; the authenticity of the experience is all the more genuine, more intimate, as a result. Search out all three cds of Beethoven's String Quartets Opus 18 without regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flight of the bumblebee","review":"Still sounding crisp after all these years, this assuredly composed and produced solo disc canceled, for all but the most gnashing of punk-rock purists, any doubts of Sting striking it on is own by injecting a healthy, if seldom self-conscious dosage primarily of jazz fusion to elevate already thoughtfully constructed pop-rock for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice start to Sting's solo career","review":"I bought this CD for a friend of mine, but I already knew its contents because my father has the LP version. This album has a mostly dark theme, with some of the songs (Russians, We Work the Black Seam) sounding a bit out of date now, but essentially the things he sings are still valid. The title song is instrumental and seems a bit out of place on this album, but maybe that's just me not understanding Sting's true intentions with the song. All in all I like the album, both the songs themselves and the way they are ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great But Not Because of Jazz","review":"This is a great album--but not because it \\"introduces jazz overtones\\" etc. It's good because of the same reasons the Police albums are good--the songs are catchy, melodic, and insightful. Actually, it's much like a Police record, and that's why it's good. Sting's later releases are long on pretentiousness (not in and of itself a bad thing) but extremely short on melody. I'm really getting sick of reading about how the Police \\"shackled\\" Mr. Sumner's musical creativity. Well, after listening to the Police, listening to this album, and then listening to Sting's more recent offerings, I have to say that somebody needs to put the cuffs on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting's solo debut","review":"After four albums with the Police,Gordon Sumner aka Sting retired from the force and went out on his own. He scored a handful of hits starting in the summer of 1985,when this album was released,with IF YOU LOVE SOMEBODY SET THEM FREE. LOVE IS THE SEVENTH WAVE is urban-flavored. RUSSIANS is an ode to the population of Russia. FORTRESS AROUND YOUR HEART is pretty cool. All the other songs are good. Jazz saxophonist Branford Marsalis participated in some songs on this album. After this album,Sting would reunite with his fellow Policemen to record DON'T STAND SO CLOSE TO ME '86,so much different than the 1980 original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to ruin a great CD","review":"I expected a lot from a remastered CD.

Some songs may seem dated, such as \\"Russians\\" which deals with the tensions that existed between the U.S. and Russian in the Regan Whitehouse era, but it's still a haunting reminder of the threat of nuclear warfare...while the song \\"A Children's Crusade\\" further exacerbates the tension of the effect of war on the innocent. This disc rocks... you can listen to it front to back, over and over again. If you're a fan of Dave Matthews, you'll hear some familiar sounds in \\"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\\" and \\"Consider Me Gone.\\" An excellent collection of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC","review":"What can be said other than it is an original Sting production. I have always been a Police fan but never a fanatic. When Sting went solo, I started having an appreciation for his talent. This album (so many of his other albums) support my feelings.

It is a must for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"easily my favorite sting album","review":"Sting's first and best solo effort. A cd you can listen to straight through (Sting and Police albums are like that).Unfortunately Sting has slowly been descending into Adult Contemporary hell since then (although Ten Summoner's Tales was a brief brake from that descent...) along with 40- and 50-something former rockers like Eric Clapton.

This is much more astringent than a Darjeeling should be, and the leaves are broken almost to fannings. Very tannic, with an unpleasant, lingering flavor of too many raw walnuts eaten too quickly. Milk does not help. It's been a few years since I've had Twinings' Darjeeling, but I remember liking it- if something happened to the crop when this was picked, they shouldn't have released it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News - Bitter","review":"I usually love Darjeeling tea and Twinnings in general.

I presumed that a \\"name brand\\" (Microsoft) keyboard would be of superior quality, giving me longer service. I was wrong. My previous \\"generic brand\\" keyboards lasted 6 to 8 months each, before certain frequently used letters disappeared from the keys. My Microsoft PS/2 keyboard had been in service just one month, and 5 or 6 frequently used letters are already faded to the extent that they are likely to disappear completely in another month. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the Microsoft keyboard I recently purchased from Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy , cheaply-made and not worth the money.","review":"A cheaply-made, flimsy keyboard.

Microsoft hardware used to be consistently better than average.Not anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less than 3 mo.","review":"Bought this about three months ago and now the left-side of the keyboard is dead.

If I pressed the spacebar, the computer would register multiple spaces. I am pretty sure this is not a software/driver issue, I even downloaded the microsoft drivers and tried different keyboards, it only happens with this one.And overall, the construction and materials used is much inferior to the logitech that I'm using now. I used to be a fan of microsoft mice in the past and thought I'd give this a try, I don't think I will be buying another Microsoft peripheral again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more could you need?","review":"It's a keyboard.. It's key action is light and springy - great for touch-typers.. It's sleak and light and has all the keys where you'd expect them. In addition there are some 'function' keys along the top. I never really got on with these on other keyboards but at this price I don't care if they're there (and I actually may use buttons like 'mute' and 'volume up/down' if I remember they're there!).Overall, for the price, who can argue that this isn't a terrific buy. The only reason I don't give it 5/5 is because it doesn't type for me!! (and I would like to see a gel wrist-rest attachment, which would be nice)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Keyboard","review":"Unlike many people, I just want a standard keyboard with good touch and a PS2 (not USB) plug. Although this model has some custom keys for email, brower activation, music, etc, I didn't bother with them. The keys are a standard layout except for the Home/End cluster which is vertical instead of horizontal. That places the Insert key where the Delete key usually is, but it hasn't been much of a problem. For the price, I think this is a good buy, and much better than other $15 keyboards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"While this booklet may be of help to hand knitters, there is very little in it for machine knitters except for a few text boxes at the end of the chapters.

This stuff smells awful!! I only used it once and got rid of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realm Cologne","review":"I bought this cologne in place of an old favorite of mine that is no longer made, Andron for Women by Jovan. It's been years since I've had it but have always wished they would come out with it again. I found Realm on Amazon one day and decided to give it a try. I would probably rate it a 3.5 if that were possible. It's pretty good but not great and is not nearly as good as Andron for Women was.That being said, it has a pleasant smell and I will definitely use it. It doesn't seem to last though. At least to me it seems that way. I put it on and like the smell but pretty soon can't smell it at all. I don't know if that's just me getting used to it and not noticing it anymore or not. It's very reasonably priced and is probably worth a try if you are interested in trying one of the pheromone type colognes. I bought it on Amazon and paid about $16 for it. A very fair price I think.I think I'll continue to look for some other brand still though and give it a try too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a tight fit","review":"These barndoor doesn't fit tight to the AC Slave Strobe, it keeps sliding out from the body where you mount the barndoor.

There are two sizes of strobes out in the market. I was lucky on my first 50 strobes but not on the second batch of 20 AC Strobes, it turn out to be the new replacement which are larger filter size and adorama color filters are too small to fit. Be sure you order the right Strobe for their color filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putnam 's book may help you read the original Cervantes.","review":"The Samuel Putnam's the Portable Cervantes is a very well written book. It is a very helpful book to have around but does not replace the original. To read the original Don Quixote is a unique experience, only comparable to read Shakespeare and Dante in the original.It is no kidding! Cervantes's major work is a fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"Don't be fooled by your cursory first impression of this \\"Alphabet Book for the 21st Century\\". Although it is organized by the presentation style of a children's ABC book, there is much more here than initially meets the eye. It uses the English alphabet and images of the borderland of southern Arizona as an entry into the intersection of the natural world and its human inhabitants. At this intersection, it offers the reader an opportunity to make connections in a mode that is both as old as primitive alphabets shaped by hand with sticks and stones and as new as 21st century alphabets that inhabit our pervasive computers, where bits and bytes fly by at unimaginable rates. If you let both approaches to this mode of processing information work in your mind simultaneously, you will find the imagery in the book taking you places where currents cross and fresh insights arise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the bike","review":"Unit works as it should.

I was drawn to it by the cool, classy looking bottle and packaging. I admit that I made the purchase without having ever smelled the cologne, and I consider that a lesson learned. This cologne absolutely REEKS! At first, I thought it was my husband putting too much on. After cautioning him that \\"A little goes a long way\\", the next day, I was overwhelmed once again when he walked into the room after having applied it. On day three, I came to the bathroom and sprayed him myself to ensure that it was not \\"overdone\\". It didn't matter. This cologne is so strong and harsh that you simply cannot use a small enough amount to make it work. If I wanted my husband to smell like cheap cologne, I would purchase the $7 stuff at the local department store.

There aren't many good Macbeth films, and this is the best I've found for teaching Macbeth at the high school level. Others may be more critically-acclaimed, but Polanski's is rated R and the Ian McKellen/Judi Dench is a slow-moving film of a stage production. This film is fast paced and visually interesting. It's also a great way to teach students about different ways of imagining a Shakespeare production as it is set in a contemporary/futuristic period. The special effects are a bit low-budget, and some appearances are becoming a bit dated. However, my students are always intrigued and want to see more. I recommend it. My greatest frustration with the DVD is that the chapters do not correspond to acts and scenes. I have not used Twelfth Night, but I am happy this is a double feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can tell a difference","review":"I started taking these faithfully and then got off my plan.

There was no mention of the latest research in feline behavior and the author describes training a cat like training a dog; so what's the \\"secret\\"?I agreed with almost everything in the book except the comment about cat owners who leave on a trip. The author says that cats do not get lonely. Well, that's wrong. He also says that a cat will go to the home where the best food is served.

The first thing, however, to make sure of with these it to only give your child 1 or 2 balloons at a time and have them chase them or else you will have littered the entire park in ten minutes.

The way the balloons fly around is fun to watch and the sound they make is just hilarious, especially for young kids. BUT the pump broke within the first 10 fills. We superglued it back together and it lasted another 5 fills or so. Also, maybe it's just us or just the pump we received as no one else has mentioned it, but we found the pump required ALOT of strength to fill the balloons. So much so that it was much easier to fill them with our mouths. No way our daughter could do it on her own.Like others, we had issues with some of the balloons: several had holes and could never be filled, others tore easily on their first flight around the room. But there were many good balloons in the bunch too.If the pump were easier to use and didn't break so readily, this could easily be played with for hours at a time.

After almost 29 years of pure enjoyment,(I am almost 29 years old) I haven't gotten tired of his songs yet, in fact, I like them more with each listen.

Although I enjoy some of his early work he's usually just too mellow for me. However, this live CD is as good as any live set I've heard. Being that it was recorded in 1972, before he got too mainstream, it shows a Neil Diamond willing to take risks with his music. From the opening notes of Prologue the music just soars! If you're looking for a musical experience that is just a pleasure to listen to, buy this CD. You'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot August Night is the ultimate Neil Diamond album","review":"Hello I am 19 years old and have been a fan since 1997 and attend two concerts so far.

Recorded at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles in August of '72. Diamond comes out in a explosive start and ends with a triumphant finish. All of Diamonds other live recordings can't match this one. \\"Hot August Night II, \\"Gold\\", \\"Love at the Greek\\", \\"Live in America\\", these can not even come close to the power of his performance this night at the greek.

It's good to see Matt McC doing drama like this - I think he reminds the world that he isn't just another pretty face with this one. It reminds me of Primal Fear, with the protagonist being brought back down to the level of us humans, and Matt McC really delivers. The plot twists were great, and the cast was great. It's always great to see William H. Mac, Marisa Tomei and Francis Fisher onscreen. And the soundtrack... I know this is about a film, but the soundtrack is so perfect, it really does push the film further than just a good film.

Pretty decent story, good production, excellent cast all the way around to the most minor character. Good direction. Something wasn't never good enough for 5 stars.

There were a couple small details we couldn't quite figure out but I won't go into them so as not to ruin the story.

McConaughey's finest acting performance but he operates in a pretty narrow range. He is great at playing charming sleazeballs, and he plays this one to the hilt. Marisa Tomei is great at playing luminous but damaged women. Ryan Philippe is the best of the angel-faced manipulators. Nice to see Frances Fisher in a small but pivotal role - she is a great aristocratic beauty. And William H. Macy can play anything, so his part was a particular delight for me.The story moves along at a good pace. The milieu is meticulously crafted and feels very authentic.

It is the first movie that I have seen that I enjoyed McConaughey. I always thought he played too wimpy a characther in the past but I think he sells a strong force to be reocnned with now. Like a lot of viewers, I read the book and it was an enjoyable legal thriller with clever twists.

He really does make the show and the cast helped also as fine acting on their behalf. The story line is interesting and anyone who hasn't seen the movie it's a must.

Courtroom and legal movies for the most part I find interesting and are some of my favorite films of all time. I would not put this up against say 'a few good men' but there were many similarities. A very thick plot with a lot happening throughout so be sure to give yourself the entire 2 hours to watch it so you can understand everything that is going on. You might get confused if you miss even 5 minutes of it. Overall, if you are a fan of legal movies be sure to check it out.Peter J.

It'll keep your attention, especially if you've liked McConaughey in other films. The best part is trying to guess just how he'll pull it off.

Unfortunately it was so disjointed and poorly edited that it lacked continuity and flow. People and objects suddenly appear and disappear off camera with no reason. The flash backs seemed too flash-backy as if the director knew he had to fill some storyline holes. The rent-a-biker-group of stereotypic old codgers and the strange missing pistol prop and the off screen death of an investigator are a few examples of let's-just-stick'em into the story and see what happens mentality. The courtroom scenes also seemed very staged. The acting was too scripted and predictable as was the obvious things-aren't-what-they-seem plot twists. As far as writing it seemed as if the writer just tossed together bits and pieces of books and movies he had seen before and basically just rearranging the pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars???","review":"I read several reviews on this site before buying this movie, and I'm really starting to think I need to stop making that the basis for my movie purchasing decisions.

The defense lawyer gets a conscience and wants to do the 'right thing' because he discovers his client really is a bad guy? I mean, duh... Defense lawyers defend those types of people...I don't really care about the premise of the film.. The bottom line is it was boring.

The Scottish crooner will have you shaking your head, but that's OK.The whole sci-fi element was forced, with jokes and visual gags about life on the moon and in the future that felt 'stuck-in' at the last moment, and production values that took fairly good ideas and made them look cheap and sloppy.So it won't show up on Masterpiece Theater, it's still good fun.E.M.

However, the standout performers in this film were a car with the personality of John Cleese (Monty Python) and Randy Quaid. Randy was the most interesting and funniest of the group. The characters overall could not help the lack of story this movie had.I can only remember one time I laughed out loud and that was when Eddie and his female lead were testing out new bodies.

This book definitely get you thinking about women and dating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Feminism","review":"Truly, 'Sex and the Single Girl' is a classic. Many consider it to be part of the 'second wave' of 20th Century womens' sufferage. I say that's 'pippy-poo' nonsense, to use the author's own adjetive.Helen Gurley Brown's book is largely about how to get a man (Be pretty, dress nice, be happy, etc.). She's the overly-plastic-surgeried founder of the magazine 'Cosmopolitan'. It's not bad advice, it's also not feminism. There's nothing about equality of the sexes in this book.Read it though. It's laugh out loud funny just for how dated and blind it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick With Candace Bushnell...","review":"Couldn't get through it. It was like reading one of those long e-mails friends send you when they're thinking out loud with total disregard to the fact that what they're saying has nothing to do with you and is not amusing; they should be writing in a journal instead. It was just boring. Not funny or relevant. I forced myself to read at least halfway through, thinking it'd get better, but it fell short. Nothing like \\"Sex and the City.\\" Stick with Candace Bushnell! Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the morally righteous!","review":"Sorry y'all, if you all thought this book was a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, I barely got past the first three chapters after putting the book down. Another two more years went by and I still haven't picked up the book. One day spring cleaning came, and I had to rid myself w/hoards of collected junk around my apartment.When I came across this book again, I jumped all the way to the last chapter, and then skimmed some pages. Finally, I decided to place the book in a very special place. The thrift store. Lol!No, I don't regret spending a hefty penny for this book. Although, I found the contents of the material quite intersting, I most certainly don't live by Brown's philosophy about being one of those high corporate, high maintenance, highly independent \\"sex in the city\\" girl. Althoug, I am currently and happily single."},{"rating":"2","title":"savvy woman, savvy advice","review":"For someone like myself who has grown up with \\"everything is relative, make your own way, be yourself etc etc\\" you may be craving advice that doesn't just \\"sit on the fence.\\"This book is like having a naughty aunt whisper in your ear the \\"real facts\\" of life, love, men, apartments, food. Some advice may be a little dated, but curiously, not as much as you think.My favourite quote, and there are many of them, is \\"When you work for toads, drain the pond...\\" I've repeated this to myselfmany times in my first serious job after university working for loser macho men - and that's in a supposedly more \\"enlightened post-feminist\\" 2004!I sincerely hope Helen is still living life to the fullest. It's a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"When you consider that this book was written well before the 60's started swinging it is truly a wonder. Helen Gurley Brown gives some very sound advice on how to really LIVE as a single woman at a time when if you weren't married by age 25 you were doomed. You have to watch your finances and buy quality items of clothing and above all don't be afraid to be fabulous. Let a married man take you out for dinner and cocktails or buy you lovely things if it makes him happy. Most shockingly, you can have intimate relations with several men and not end up a sad and broken woman! Some advice is amazingly current: She describes what is essentially a low-carb diet as the road to health. Some ideas are also jarringly outdated: The idea that homosexuality was the result of arrested emotional development. But for most of it you can just hear the collective AAaaahhhhh of women being freed from the restrictions of the 1950's and being told \\"Yes, you CAN have just as much fun as the boys!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"Smell great got lots of folks wanting to know what is that scent i'm wearing.

This particular item, has put an end to buying books on how to write. It is excellent. All of the others are by the \\"how to\\" writers. This, I believe is the only one; by a \\"why\\" writer.Why we do, and don't do things, pertaining to writing. The author taps the pulse that will enable you to write...if you follow her lead. And that is demonstrated, via the curious and excellent exercises listed.This book cannot be spoken of highly enough, for effectiveness and originality. You will also discover much about yourself and various motivations you possess.It puts a full length mirror up to the aspiring writer, and asks \\"So you want to be a writer?...well if you do; you better get real\\".

Mrs Brande attacks the subject in a witty and encouraging way so that one's enthusiasm is fired up once again. Well worth having on your book shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Need To Read","review":"This is an essential read for any aspiring writer or even a seasoned one. Although from 1934-ish, the basic jist of the material hits it right on the head when it comes to thinking if you have \\"it\\" or not to be a writer. It's an easy read, a good bed-time companion for a chapter here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple advice from a book ahead of its time","review":"I am not a professional writer, however, I am learning to write ebooks and wanted guidance on getting into the the mindset of being a writer. This book did the job for me. Although written in 1934, the advice is well ahead of its time.I was procrastinating about writing an ebook for weeks and took the authors advice to start writing as soon as I get up from bed in the morning and write whatever comes to my mind.In other words, let the sub concious come forth with ideas and information. Within 3 days I had completed a draft version of my ebook.If you want an easy to follow book on becomming a writer, I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book yet for inspiring the writer","review":"I have purchased several books on writing fiction and non-fiction. And I would have to say, most of the books that I have purchased I did find useful in assisting me with what I wanted to know. But after reading Dorothea Brande's \\"Becoming a Writer\\", I felt the warmest type of inspiration. Brande came from the 30s era when she didn't have to contend with the computer, editors that only read two or three pages of a book before they throw it in the trash pile, or the pressures of a fast moving market. Yet, she knew full well what every writer experiences and needs to be told. And she told it, quite well, in this book. I loved it. I keep it next to my computer for reference from time to time. I recommend this wonderful book to anyone that has intentions of writing, no matter what area they are trying to enter. It is just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"How\\", not the \\"What\\" of writing","review":"This book tries to show you how to get started writing, and avoids telling you what to write. Too many \\"how to\\" books become vehicles for conveying the authors' prejudices and preferences (I remember becoming annoyed at John Gardner's overbearing allegiance to the worn Jamesian cliches like \\"showing not telling\\", for example). I don't think Dorothea Brande cares much if you are a post-modern experimentalist or a western writer, or a budding newspaper columnist; her hope is that you become a writer, at least. Your genre, style, and subject matter are nobody's business but your readers'. If you are looking for a book that will tell you whether your characters are \\"too shallow\\" or whether your plotting technique needs improvement, this is not the book (thank goodness!). If you have ever started something great and never finished, or if you want to start but can't seem to drag yourself to do it, this could be a helpful read. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Becoming a Writer","review":"Although the use of language is dated, appropriate to the time it was written, the ideas are timeless. Excellent book. Obviously where Julia Cameron got much of her own inspiration. I treasure both as understanding the human condition and being able to express it in such a meaningful way. I will treasure this book, always."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Right!","review":"While written decades ago, this book presents incisive and on-point advice for those who would write. While focused predominantly on creative fiction, this guide is still very meaningful for shaping up anyone with the passion to write into a real, live author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic!","review":"Sorry, didn't like it! Outdated, and full of pedantic instructions, such as, you must set time aside to write, you must write, you must read, etc. Hey, my mother told me this stuff... Don't need Dorothea to feed me these tidbits. My mother's advice was more chock-full of inspiration and encouragement than the turn-of-the-century Ms. Brande who could not have imagined the times we now live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Remembered","review":"Brande's timeless classic is the mother of writer's inspirational books and still in print. I swear other writers steal from her exercises to fill their writing books.Brande covers nearly every tangible aspect to the writing life - working, creating time, friends, trusted readers, finding good books, etc. This advice echoes through the journals and diaries of authors small and large. (I'm not kidding. Check how many times this is mentioned in the National Archives of our most beloved authors.)In the early 1900's when this book was first released, writing was modern and reaching new heights. The fact that this book could be put in a contemporary cover and sold as new is a testament to its validity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for any creative pursuit","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to engaging your creative faculties. Ms. Brande's advice is timeless and consistent even with many of the current leaders in contemporary creative enterprises. While the content is focused on writing, I found the advice to be useful and easily adapted for any work which requires regular output and out-of-the-box thinking. \\"Becoming a Writer\\" addresses challenges in adjusting an individual's personality and habits to optimize creative output by providing simple, effective exercises and advice. This is a must read for anyone who desires to pursue a creative career...especially if that career is writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"Ms. Brande was not marketing herself or her work when she wrote this book. She had something to convey, something to teach. She does so in a practical, straightforward way. After reading 'Becoming a Writer' you will not be the same: Approached with an open mind and willingess to learn, Ms. Brande's advice is quite capable to transform the way in which you think, write and live. As all the reviewers before me have pointed out, this is a must for aspiring writers. In addition, I do believe any person whose profession involve writing, will find great rewards in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making the Connections","review":"This book is one of feminism's most unread classics. Griffin made the connections before Lacan and Butler to all the uses Western religion and philosophy has used language and dichotomies to bolster the power of men over women and nature. Her analysis is brilliant, clear, and persuasive. Read in conjunction with eco-feminist analysis, Griffin shows the necessary connections between the abuse of nature and the abuse of women through a rhetorical analysis that remains unmatched in its creativity, prose, and pertinance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a history of woman","review":"In this amazing book, the author speaks in several voices, weaves the story we have been told down through time, about who and what women are.This is truly a book to be savored, sipped at, contemplated, and pondered.

I cannot reccomend it highly enough, even after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important and memorable","review":"This book was required reading for a graduate level somatic psychology class I participated in back in the mid-80s. I've never forgotten it. She has taken ordinary and unremarkable material and placed it next to seemingly unrelated, equally unremarkable material in such a way as to cause the reader to suddenly see both sets of material from another previously overlooked and awakening angle. She writes with an artist's or photographer's eye. For the most part, she leaves the conclusions to us...letting the dance between the two sets of information open little windows of consciousness that let in life and light. Over the last 20 years or so I have returned to it again and again. A beautiful and extraordinary book, both content and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Stephen Hunter I know and Love","review":"If you enjoyed Dirty White Boys or any of the Sniper books, give this one a miss.

It was nice not having to deal with bags, although the extra dust you are exposed to cleaning it would be a problem for anyone with dust allergies.

And the second GCB started playing, I loved their music. Of course compared to seasoned music artists like Counting Crows, Graham Colton Band still has room to grow. They sound similar to Wallflowers, but a little less bluegrass. It's almost like Wallflowers meets Maroon 5. I will admit that the first time around their songs sound a bit similar. But let their cd run a few times in your player and you'll gradually pick up on these small nuances that'll make you love their sound. I think they are a nice change to all the one hit wonder pop stars that are on the radio now. Their songs have such meaning and the lyrics are truly very well written. If you love Counting Crows or the Wallflowers, I'm positive that you will also love Graham Colton Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Major Release","review":"I've been into Graham Colton for about 2 years. I saw him open for Counting Crows in Madison and I was blown away by the band's amazing live performance. I've seen them twice since and bought their first self-produced cd. That cd was quality and had great songs. Drive is their first major label release and the songs are all quality. It is a solid rock album and it is sure to put them on the map. I have 2 problems though, first, I really think that some of Graham's best songs are missing from this album, i.e. Jessica, Summer Stars, and Save Me, and a few more from the 1st cd. Second, which isn't really a big deal, but \\"Morning Light\\" sounds very close to the Oasis song, \\"Don't Go Away\\". The lyrics are almost identical in the refrain. Disappointing for such a good songwriter. But besides that the album as a whole is a solid effort. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me","review":"Just wanted to provide a reality check for all the gushing reviews here. This record is a professional, slick, soulless and generic slab of product. The singer has that same obnoxious sneering vocal attack of like a million 90s bands, wholly lacking in originality or personality. With all the inventive music coming out in 2004, why would you bother with this dated-sounding dreck. And what the heck did Producer Brendan O'Brien (who recently worked with Springsteen) see in these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Alternative / Rock Band","review":"I saw these guys when they opened up for Sister Hazel in Tampa. From the second they got on the stage, there was so much electricity...it was amazing! I went there to see sister Hazel but after watching them, I was a dedicated fan. During the first few songs the speaker for the lead guitarist was disconnected, but you coud never notice any difference, they just ignored it and played the song acoustically. After the performance I went to buy a Graham Colton shirt. At the booth Graham came up behind me and asked to sign it without me even asking him. These guys are a great band and a class act, I truly hope they make it big some day. Buy their CD its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drive by Graham Colton Band","review":"Now this is what I call music. Graham Colton is a fantastic band with the material to back it up. Their debut album, Drive, is an infectious mix of catchy pop-rock & indie vibe. The album kicks off with a knockout one, two punch of the record's greatest tracks \\"Don't Give Up on Me\\" & \\"Since You Broke it\\" which are guaranteed to become instant favorites. Ballad wise the album is heavy, but still good with tracks such as \\"First Week\\" & \\"Morning Light\\". The lyrics really speak to you too, very relatible especially on \\"Cigarette\\". My brother saw them in concert and recommended the album to me and I'm so happy he did. This is a great rock record for all to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't stand up. . .","review":"This album just doesn't stand up to their barely heard first release (self-titled). Listen to that one and compare it to this. I picked up an autographed copy YEARS ago when they opened for Guster in Pittsburgh. Their first CD is just spectacular. This one's not bad either, but just doesn't compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band really rocks","review":"I saw GCB last year with The Counting Crows....they were awesome!!

This whole album really rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GCB Rocks","review":"A friend of mine who bought this album and was disappointed with it gave it to me. Why in the world did he give this album up? It's great! It's a great collection of straight-forward, catchy, power guitar pop songs. The vocals are a little winey but that's ok. There's nothing complex about the songs and the...KINDA...sound alike, but it's just a fun roll-down-the-windows kind of cd. \\"Morning Light\\" and \\"Cigarette\\" are the stand out tunes to me. The reviews below are actually pretty accurate, even the negative ones. If ya like power guitar pop, you'll like this one. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad concoction.","review":"Take one part Soul Asylum, add one part Toad the Wet Sprocket, sprinkle in a little Tom Petty and you get Graham Colton.

Great for riding around with the top down or simply enjoying with those closest to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Video Page-Turner","review":"Most of the action of this story takes place on a train. Fitting, because with every anecdote, interview and unearthed image, Accidental Army moves like a train. Its fast pace covering a slew of improbable heroes and ruthless villains. Only WWI and the Russian Revolution could have overshadowed the unlikely birth of a great European nation. But the story of the Czechoslovak Legion is simply too compelling to wind up as an unnoticed historical footnote. It's high time that this story had a proper examination. After all, it has so many fascinating elements. Spies. War. Underdogs. Not to mention treasure from the vaults of the Czar himself.Accidental Army is that rare story that works as both history and entertainment. And it will be enjoyed by anyone who can't help but root for those who overcome long odds with little more than guts and guile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good; but not the James Brown you're expecting","review":"Live at the Apollo 1962 is an excellent disc. It's live; you can hear the crowd goofing around; it's a whole lot of fun.What I missed when I ordered this disc is that the quintessential James Brown tracks (aka the funk) come after this time period.This disc is definitely toe-tapping R&B; (think Ray Charles from the same time period) and a good time for all. While it wasn't what I had expected, I'm glad I own this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"live at the apollo 1962","review":"Llve at the apollo 1962 is is one of the best albums ever! a must have for music collectors everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comes close to capturing Brown's onstage energy","review":"Let me just start out by saying this isn't the greatest live album. It is influential, and proved that people would pay money to own a live recording, which is the main reason why it's often considored the best. However, there are many subsequent live recordings that are much better than this. However, it's still pretty damn good, and is a fun listen that warrents repeated plays. James Brown's stage show was legendary for his gyrations and refusal to stand still, and you can picture what a good night was like for him with the help of this. It is certainly better than any of his studio albums. The songs themselves are performed greatly, both due to Brown's incredible soul voice and the magnificent back-up band themselves. Worth a purchase, due to it's importance in American popular music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompetent Remaster","review":"Do not be fooled that this CD is a bona-fide or even a semi-competent remaster. If you are a remaster freak like I am, you will be severely disappointed. This CD sounds as flat, harsh, one-dimensional and soulless as any original issue CD. This comment does not pertain to the actual musical substance of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful memory","review":"I purchased my first copy of James Brown Live at the Apollo when I was 19. At the time, as a member of a southern \\"blue-eyed\\" soul band, its energy was an aural treat to all of us who later used the phrase \\"Are you ready for star-time?\\" as a tribute to anyone who ventured to approach Brown's standard of being the hardest working man in show business. With this recording, the transition to CD has been a good one. It has always amazed me how well Brown's set was captured using the minimal amount of gear the engineers had on hand for the real-time session (check out the liner notes). James Brown, however, has always hand-picked his band to create a tightness that virtually needed a minimal amount of mikes to cover the sound.

Not to good work pieces totally slip the surface is more like nylon than rubber (if your familiar with rubber roofing pretty much the same.) just way to slick. I'm hoping in time some of the slickness will wear down then it might grip. I think for $100 with shipping it's a waste of money.

He and I performed Persian folk music in Los Angeles in 1988 and I have fond memories of that concert. He was working on his dissertation at that time and it's wonderful to see it published. My only complaint is that it is very difficult to find. No surprise to see that he has done an excellent job of surveying this unique and beautiful tradition, which is so difficult to describe in Western terminology. Some parts of the book are quite technical, and will be rather formidable for beginners. Ethnomusicologists with a special interest in the Middle East will be delighted. Ella Zonis' 1973 tome \\"Classical Persian Music\\" might be somewhat easier going for the novice, but it is also tough to locate ... try a good library. Lloyd Miller's book is an indispensible tool and companion for those of us who heve learned to love this music.

The rest of the album is also very good, but of a different style than that of the title track. Music Must Change, 905, Sister Disco, Guitar and Pen, Trick of the Light, and Love is Coming Down are all great songs, however there is a marked increase in the use of synths more so than any of the previous albums. This is not bad, but it may take a couple of listens before you truly start to appreciate the album.

The only good things are the addition of two bonus tracks and liner notes with pictures. The alternate versions included are not substantially different to warrant their inclusion.

Perhaps it's the 'tragic' element of the music, with Keith passing so soon after, but I hear a classic album that is a fitting end to the band (I know, \\"what about what came after\\", but to me, this is the end). The first time I heard this album, about 25 years ago, I found this to be a boring, excruciating mess. Now, after resolving to give it an open minded listen I am in awe of the band. The songs are crisp and original to me, and perhaps because I remember little of the original mix, I find there is great clarity to the sound of the music. This was a band who were trying to return to great form and almost did so, until Keith gave in. 'Not To Be Taken Away' indeed.... Just a suggestion to the naysayers, turn it up to about '7', find a quality pair of headphones, kick back in the recliner, turn the lights out, and just listen..."},{"rating":"1","title":"REMIXED - DON'T BUY IT","review":"Nightmare for fans of the original LP.

The title track is ins the Who tradition, but songs like \\"Music Must Change\\", \\"905\\", \\"New Song\\" and \\"Sister Disco\\" are remarkable because it offers a differente view of Pete's writing.

Abrams, \\"Super 8\\" unabashedly draws on Spielberg films such as \\"E.T\\", \\"Close Encounters of the the Third Kind\\" and even a little of his version of the \\"War of the Worlds.\\" The story is pretty contrived and the ending very predictable. It's obvious how it's going to turn out after about 45 minutes, especially with a bunch of kids leading the cast. Given that the film is presumed to be set in the late 70s, I'm pretty sure the use of \\"totally\\" as an affirmative had not yet entered teen-speak by that time, at least in Ohio. L.A., maybe -- Ohio, never."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring re-make of E.T., wasted my time and money.","review":"No wonder the trailer was extremely vague, they had to spark SOME interest and trick people into watching this film. And everyone would have just thought, 'oh, an E.T. remake'. Some Remakes can be tweaked and great, but this movie was horrible. The expectations were high considering the producer and director. What a let down. The story line was just like in E.T., the only thing different was E.T. was like E.T. on meth and steroids. Catch this film if it's available on redbox for $1 or when it plays on tv, but definitely not worth the $3.99 and anticipation. If you hate movies that are really quiet when you need to hear what is being said, then obnoxiously and unnecessarily loud, definitely avoid this one. The cinematography was also horrible.Really hated this film and I love Sci-Fi. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I paid to watch this!","review":"The movie has no real plot, and the characters are not believable at all. The 'alien' is kept in shadows at all times like used to happen in the really old sci-fi movies where it was done due to how hard it was to make the alien believable. Attempts to communicate with the alien are just absurd, and lead to an anti-climatic ending. This is like a modern version of those really, really bad sci-fi B-movies of the 50's and 60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous, Boring -","review":"Watched this because it was produced by Spielberg. Have found that this is not a good way to select movies - too many losers such as this one (also '1941,' 'War Horse,' and War of the Worlds'). A '60 Minutes' interview with Spielberg suggested the reason - turns out Spielberg had problems in his relationship with his father, and was overly caring for his mother (had left his father for another man).Regardless, the 'plot' here involved a group of friends making a super 8 movie who witness a train crash while filming at night. Inexplicable events begin to take place in town (dogs and people disappear), their biology teacher is somehow involved, and the Air Force imposes an informal martial law control. Too much sci-fi silliness ruins even the chance of this movie being a charming story of teen-age relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"STR8 TRASH!

A trailer usually promises what can be deemed as a faithful description of the film. Watching Super 8 was like watching a 2 hour trailer of a film which never really begins, I kept waiting to be awed but the film lacks an intriguing storyline. I haven't read the book and don't intend to but I paid good money to watch this and came out feeling rather ripped off. I cannot fathom Spielberg made such a lousy film especially since he has BACK TO THE FUTURE to his credit. When I think science fiction, I think of films such as - District 9, War of the worlds, Jusassic Park and such. Definitely not Super 8. It's the kind of film you will never ever remember for anything, not even for the fat kid who thinks he should be a director. No irony and the direction seemed very auto-pilot'ish."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Movie With A Dumb Ending","review":"Not sure what movie many people were watching based on the reviews praising the film but I found the story line just to be ok and the ending to be really dumb. It felt like the film was trying to hit me over the head with some subtle political message (like Avatar)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can only be described as Amazingly.......","review":"AWFUL!!!!JJ Abrams needs to do better research if he wants to do Sci-Fi.

There is a reason that there is a Facebook page called \\"Super 8 Is The Worst Movie Ever. I rented this thinking it was a Steven King movie. Instead I got Stand By Me, Meets ET and District 9. Totally predictable and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential!","review":"This movie had so much potential! There really could have been a real story, some depth. There is not climax to this film and there's really just a surface story. [SPOILERS] They mention when the alien touches you, you understand it. Yet they don't elaborate on this point. They're just like 'here it is, we're not going to do anything with it.' It could have been a great movie.

After reading some of the glowing rewiews here on Amazon, I do wonder if they mean anything or are written by the production marketing detartment. This movie was quite lame; poorly written and the acting was uneven. We gave up counting the gaps in the plot, such as it was. Here we have a massive train wreck; yet the colonel walks right up and picks up the film wrapper.I could go on, but why . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"Not exactly ET but it's a good story with great characters. It's hard not to imagine JJ Abrams running around with a an 8mm camera after watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific","review":"Definitely a movie with lots of excitement. Much more than a typical kid's movie! Not your \\"same old\\" monster movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"The previews were great. Some kids in the 60-70's who make professional films witness a mysterious train crash. Awesome! Then what? Unexplained things start happening, government intervention, stupid adults, and kids save the day, the end. Oh and the main character communicates with the alien for a second or two. That's it. There was all sorts of build up that only lead to an absolute worthless ending. In fact, I don't even remember the exact ending it was so uneventful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was better than expected.","review":"It had a few slow spots but the story was good.

The acting was good and the characters were enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this movie to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nod To The Golden Years of Spielberg","review":"I'm not going to delve into cinematic critique here - and keep it very simple: this is a terrific movie. E.T was one of my favorite movies when I was a little tyke. Super 8 brought back the same fantastical, whimsical feeling of E.T with a whole new story. The child actors/actresses are awesome. Spielberg films have been hit or miss for the last two decades, but with the direction of J.J Abrams, Super 8 is without a doubt a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty absurd","review":"Enjoyable, but the output of director who was a kid who did 8mm stuff when he was a teenager, and grew up to do the same thing with a trillion dollar budget. Speilberg found someone who has the same beginnings as he, but none of the story telling abilities. And the story is pretty silly.It has a lot of very gripping scenes, but, at the end, it's like you were taken on a thrill ride at the amusement park, and you have been on way too many of them over your lifespan to have this particular one have any impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"ET Revisited","review":"Super 8 gives Spielburg a different corner of the sand box to play with pre-teen innocence pitted against adult indifference, callous martial bigotry and a lonely, misunderstood space monster. The special effects are good, specially so if you like train wrecks. Some benign reference to drugs and alcohol but the real enemy is our own society, mainly in military uniforms. There is violence, mostly directed at those deserving uniforms, but not pervasive or particularly graphic. The main characters are substantial for the most part, dealing with loyalty, honor and an awakening sensitivity to the opposite sex. This movie is really like another view of ET with a more menacing alien."},{"rating":"1","title":"uggggh!","review":"didn't really like this one at all. it was boring and very unexciting to me and I fell asleep on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuinely Entertaining","review":"I've read bad things about Super 8. After watching it, I don't really understand what some peoples' issue is with it. There was an almost constant smile on my face. The characters were generally likable, the action sequences were well done (though admittedly, the train crash scene probably brought a tear to Michael Bay's eye), the story was simple yet effective, the production values were off the charts. Will this movie be heralded in the future as a classic like, perhaps, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or E.T.? No. But it's still a great movie, and a lot of fun to watch. J.J. Abrams is quickly becoming one of my favorite modern Science Fiction directors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loving Bow to a Master Film Maker","review":"I enjoyed watching this from start to finish: loved the train wreck, enjoyed the ode to past masters such as \\"The Goonies\\", \\"ET\\"..it just has the feel of a Steven Spielberg but also the unpredictable edge that J.J. Abrams can bring. You aren't quite sure how far a scene may play out. My opinion was that this is great fun; sure it has a couple of unexplained issues, but perhaps they are supposed to be that way (boring if EVERYTHING is explained).Its a sci fi adventure film on a grand scale and definitely on my \\"Must buy on Blu-Ray\\" list :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film without a ton of crap thrown in","review":"So I'm not actually a small child, but for some reason I'm very sensitive to violence in movies. I can't count the number of times I've had to stop movies or leave the room because people get shot up or cut up or tortured or burned or whatever. I don't take it very well. This severely limits my entertainment options, since I appreciate a great story with well developed characters and an intriguing plot, I just cannot stomach lots of gore.I'm happy I watched Super 8 because it's an exciting and enjoyable movie where you can still feel suspense without being shown bodies as they're ripped apart. I love that. Also, the friendship is lovely between all the boys + Elle's character. Watch this movie for a good time. Not perfect, but a lovely escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I've seen a LOT of movies in my lifetime. so much now that I am seeing remakes of everything I grew up with.

This was a pleasant surprise that greatly exceeded my expectations. Great story, great cast. Loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There goes 2 hours of my life I will never get back","review":"The children were cute. The adult actors were horrible. The plot line was beyond boring. The only line that I had any interest for is \\"Drugs are bad\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"slowwwwww","review":"Most of the action was in the dark, which is usually meant to mask really bad special effects. I found myself bored fifteen minutes into the film, advancing it, with hopes of improvement, better acting, effects, something, but it never came. If you have really nothing better to do, don't watch this movie still, just sit and stare at the wall, it's brighter and more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie","review":"I was impressed with the acting from these kids. I thought it was well filmed. I enjoyed this movie. The trailer provided on Amazon instant is not representative of the film. We were expecting something different from the trailer vs. the actual movie. However, the movie shines - the trailer should be updated in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"ET meets the Goonies haha","review":"LOVED it! Great movie! I would def. watch it again. I really had no idea what it was about and I must say my husband and I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Goonies? Then you will love this!","review":"This is a great movie, and takes you back to your childhood.How so? Well imagine the ideas used in Scooby Doo, the Goonies, the Monster Squad and countless other franchises of young kids working together to overcome a supernatural force and that's pretty close to what Super 8 is all about.Once again, it seems JJ Abrams can do no wrong, and with Mr Spielberg involved too - this film is as close to perfect as you will find this summer.If you like this kind of thing, I might also suggest you check out the following two books: Department 19 by Will Hill, and the Dusk Society by Campfire Graphic Novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls terribly short","review":"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be similar to an E.T/Stand by Me type of 80s nostalgia film from the comments I've seen from others. After watching this movie I can say for sure that it is nowhere near the quality of those films. This movie is just so lackluster with the cliche, underdeveloped characters and the underwhelming big secret that is revealed that left me saying.. is this it? I'm glad i only paid $7.99 for this on blu ray because I'll never watch it again. I think I'll throw it off a bridge and film that, I'll probably get more entertainment out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"once was enough","review":"This is the kind of movie I would only watch one time...and that's why I gave it 2 stars. The train crash was spectacular...but I think at least one kid should have died in the accident. The kids were entertaining...for the most part. This is an E.T. kind of movie. Good alien. Bad military. In the end, the alien gets away. This kind of movie has been done a few times before. Nothing new here. Just different actors and a different looking alien. The only redeeming value was when the 2 parents stopped fighting and started helping each other near the end of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super 8 certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it","review":"The film is wonderful, one of Spielberg's finest efforts. The fact that it didn't get released in 1979 (when it was made) is downright insane. But, after 32 years it has been released. It is a sci-fi story of a small town rocked by the mysterious after-effects of a model train's derailment amidst a zombie invasion. Simply a great movie to behold.As for the format of Super 8, it certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it. Many have argued that VHS was not available in 1979, but that cannot be verified. MICHAELmATICIAN has released several Sound Units of/concerning VHS (and never Super 8) from 1979. MICHAELmATICIAN did not comment on Super 8 (the film) and neither has Spielberg. Perhaps in another 32 years someone will speak of this 1979 classic. (Hopefully not J.J. Abrams)2.342 (Jeremy Shingles)"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, one of the years best","review":"the first 75 minutes was a tour de force, excellent film-making! the end got a little predictable and sentimental, but still good.yes, it's a homage to earlier spielberg movies, especially ET, and a little close encounters. still, the script is outstanding, funny, and heartfelt. the kids are excellent and clever in a realistic way. born in the 70s myself, a little nostalgia is always welcome (i can remember when i painted action/fantasy figures too/model trains... the days before video games and internet!!!!)thumbs up !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ET on the cheap","review":"Has a low budget feel. like ET but special effects are sub par for a Spielberg production.

It's shocking to hear that fat movie director character in this film bossing the other ones who are smaller and thinner than him around and that's why I would not recommend it to parents for a Sunday afternoon viewing with their kids. Very similar to cloverfield except the main characters are all tweenagers. Maybe it was intended as a prequel to cloverfield. No ones noticed it but me.. Yeah I think I'm the only one who does. mr Abrams must stop all this friends stumbling upon aliens type of idea.. It just doesn't work anymore. Don't buy the movie, rent it instead.

The alien actually took a back seat for most of the movie, while the rest of the movie goes into character development mode a little to indepth of that as far as I'm concerned. When a little alien action finally comes to play it seems a case of a to little to late to save the movie.It also didn't help that the story revolves mostly aroung young teens. I wanted a frigging alien movie not Monster Squad (which I would say is better then this).Renter at best, had I known what it was going to be like I'd never even bother renting it.

The story was completely boring and I could not wait till it was over.

Thank goodness I rented it for free with a promotion through Redbox!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad!","review":"This is pure garbage.

Really?","review":"For parents and kids like us who find it offensive, this film is loaded with swearing. It hardly ever lets up. My husband and I don't recall that 2 of the words were even in use in 1979. I didn't like that 3 of the 4 helpful adults in this movie used drugs or alcohol. The special effects are great. I think the story is weak and as a sci-fi fan I would have liked more of the \\"science\\" explained and more alien involvement other than simply throwing junk straight up in the air for most of the movie. There is very little humor although one boy has perfect timing remarking on methods of suicide. (You would have to hear him, it's not as bad as it sounds.) All the kids did a pretty good job acting as their quirky characters. But if you find bad language offensive, I'd skip this one. Our son left the room halfway through. It was a Spielberg film and I wanted so much for it to get better, but I should have followed his example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid 8","review":"Is anyone else sick of Speilberg using that same shot of people peering up at the sky with wondrous looks on their faces. I mean he used it in Close Encounters, etcetera etcetera. And is anyone sick of his terrible plot. Watching his movies are like reading Stephen King. Lots of fluff and amazing pyrotechnics by no story, no plot. He just be banned from movie making. What was this movie about? A monster is trapped on earth, and waits to the movie to be made to build a spaceship? What? Stupid. Just plain stupid. And by the way, the little vignette of a Super 8 movie of the title made by the kid main characters and shown at the end with the credits was far better than the stupid movie which preceded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films of 2011","review":"Steven Spielberg has lost his touch for a long time now. This is a terrible film. The actors (kids) were very good. This is one of those films that rarely shows you anything and use darkness to hide things instead of spending the money to show you. I absolutely think this is one of the worst films of the year. Please do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Doesn't Know What It Wants to Be","review":"When the movie first started, I thought, \\"This is a great little movie.\\" I loved the interaction with the kids, and think if Abrams could have kept the focus on that storyline (with the sci fi monster), it might have been a nice little flick ala \\"Stand By Me.\\" Instead, it was a sappy, heavy-handed lecture on letting go and surviving through pain. It wasn't a big inspirational, the monster left a LOT to be desired. They could have easily chopped off 45 minutes in this movie and filled it with something else. The writing is poor, the special effects are stupid, and the story veers off in so many different directions it appears childish.One bright note was watching the \\"kids movie\\" at the very end. But don't bother watching the whole thing just to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies","review":"I went to see this movie the first week it was out with high hopes. Being a huge fan of lost i was excited to see this since JJ Abrams produced it.The beginning of the movie is decent, but as soon as the stupid aliens show up it was ruined. The actors were below average. Why make a big name, big budget movie have little 10 years as the lead actors? I would have liked to see the dad have a bigger role(the guy in friday night lights). He was the biggest star of the movie and he was only in a few scenes. I went with my uncle to see this and hes a huge movie buff and he fell asleep it was so boring!This movie was like Battle:Los Angeles.

Most of the movie is soo unbelievable that its annoying. Don't bother. Heck I dont think I will watch any more movies from with JJ Abrams of Speilberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely overrated","review":"Super 8 is a sub-par Spielberg knock-off. A forced-homage to the glory days of blockbuster film-making. I'm a fan of JJ Abrams first two films (Mission Impossible 3 and Star Trek)but this movie kind of left me cold. The story is boring and lacking any sort of emotional resonance. The design of the creature is uninspired, with unconvincing CGI, and not even remotely sympathetic. While all the kids are well-acted, their character's aren't really interesting, and many of them were downright annoying. The ending is silly, sentimental cheese at its worst. If you want to see the real thing, watch ET or Close Encounters instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHICH AUDIENCE WAS THIS FILM MADE FOR?","review":"This film starts off as a kids film that makes it suitable for the pre-teens only. The mood changes and we then have a drunk and two junkies smoking illegal substances. For Spielberg,why did you have to have junkies in the film as it detracts from the film's intended audience? Definately not for pre-teens due to the substance abuse in the film (several times). The storyline is basically a rehash of the classic E.T. but without the emotional impact that E.T.had. You know the ending as it is very predictable all the way. In the finale you just yawn and say 'who cares' to yourself.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid.","review":"Insipid sentimentality with production values and a big soppy musical score.

There is no satisfaction to be had watching this film if you are over the age of 12.

But this movie is just not good enough that I need to voice my opinion.I was expecting more from Steven Spielberg. The plot is too vague. How did the Air Force got the Alien? There is only one shot that you can see more clearly the face of the alien - but it was dark. The communication and inter action between the Alien and human are just not enough in this movie. The movie end quickly without explaining too much. Movie is about 1 hour and 45 minutes long.There are better movies out there - just not this one. I'm disappointed.I wathced the Blu-ray version and the picture sharpness and color are excellent in our 46 LCD TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is the fuss all about?","review":"Every once in a while a movie comes along that everyone raves about. For me this was NOT one of those movies. The plot was formulaic and the entire movie had that been there done that feeling. Character development was terrible, plot holes glaring and just too derivative for my liking. I am fan of JJ Abrams, but this one was a total non-starter. The whole ET feel to the movie was just plain cheesy and there is just nothing original about this movie and thats why it gets 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Prime for another free movie that should be free","review":"Super 8 has good special effects and background music, and the kiddie actors put up decent performance -- but its ridiculous plot has four junior high schoolers saving the world! I mean, if the alien monster hadn't been impressed by Joe's moving spirituality at the end, he/she would probably have destroyed Ohio and the rest of the world, who knows? BTW, I love it when these alien breathe air and eat meat like you and me. How lovely. Yet they look so ugly, and why do they have to eat people for fun? Aside from the special effects, this is a hollow film devoid of anything meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goonies meets ET meets JeeperCreeper","review":"The first hour of the movie is incredibly boring.This movie had elements of ET and the Goonies...Why ET? because of the alien creature trying to return to his HOME. Why the Goonies? because of the kid bunch and the teen attraction between two characters.The entire movie is \\"in the dark\\". You cant see anything.(In-movie weirdness)When the town is overrun by the military: Every tank and military officers are shouting everywhere. The shooting makes no sense at all. Its like they were shooting ghosts.Speilberg should lay off the 80s already. Shirts, old tv sets, radios.... boring. If the target market is KIDS then they should lay off old electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts good, then gets really predictable","review":"This movie started off good, it was really interesting and engaging for at least the first half or more! Then it started to show a very typical pattern of predictability and although the actors did a good job the story I lost interest with and I was not a fan of the ending. Some may like it, I watched because it had good reviews but I was not impressed and can now say I've seen it but will probably never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK movie to watch","review":"The performance by the actors is great; there are moments that are quite touching. But the story plot, ET type, is not clearly laid out, and sometimes quite inconsistent. I would say if you want to watch the movie for effects--OK, for story--not really."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did two great directors create such a lame movie?","review":"I have to say I had high hopes for Super 8. Needless to say those hopes have been dashed. This was a flimsy excuse for a film which could have done with some more plot and character development and less of a cliche. The ending was lame and was so contrived a placard could have spelled it out. The thing that I really hated was that up until the last few minutes the movie was actually quite well done.The problem seems that no one could decide if the monster was good or bad and if should fear or hate it. It leaves us with so many unanswered questions and just wimps out. All in all this is a very poor movie and is not worth your time. I am glad I didn't waste my money when it was in the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I'm not sure why this movie received such amazing reviews. The story was okay, but the pacing and acting made it difficult to watch. My husband fell asleep about 30 minutes into it, and he wasn't even tired. I'm not sure what the price is now, but I would recommend waiting until it hits $.99 or free before I would recommend renting it. Then again, I often suggest that everyone watch the blockbusters, if for no other reason than to improve future Trivial Pursuit games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"I really really love this movie - is a rare mixture of innocence, emotion, and fantasy. I had forgotten how good it was until I just recently rewatched it. For a few brief hours I was transported back to the awkwardness of my youth, with that nerdy Dungeon & Dragons-infused belief that anything was possible. A nice escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"KIds' movie","review":"This movie is oriented toward kids, not adults, but there are a lot of scary scenes for young kids and I wouldn't really recommend it for kids under 13 either.The train-crash scene is grossly exaggerated and the alien-creature scenes are so ridiculously dark that you can hardly see anything. There are perhaps very few scenes with decent special effects, which still can't make the rather dragging plot any less boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the 80's","review":"I was surprised to find myself in the 80's error. All-in-all, I really enjoyed the moive. More for teenagers but, did capture the adult audience.

What a huge dissapointment this one was. Super 8 left me with a been there done that feeling. It really is a hodge podge of other better movies. Another thing that bothered me was that super 8 Couldnt make up its mind of what audience it was geared towards, The kids in the movie swear like sailors and there are a few monster killings. On the other hand there is cheesy kid friendly sappiness sprinkled throughout,(espeacialy toward the end). Actually I would have rather seen a whole movie about kids in the 70s making a super 8 film with interesting character development and witty dialogue! scrap all the monster stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I've seen this year","review":"I absolutely loved this movie. It created such a realistic world and did it with no excuses or failures. The nostalgia of the scenes, the plot and the acting truly made this movie. If you have a good audio system, crank it to watch. There are scenes that just come alive with both visuals and sound (no spoilers... ;) )The acting was much more than I'd expected from a teenage group of actors. Obviously thier direction was superb, but few would have pulled off what this group did.If I had more than two thumbs, they'd all be up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, entertaining movie","review":"My wife & I both quite enjoyed this movie.

Great movie, must watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is it with Steven Spielberg's Obsession with Foul-Mouthed Children?","review":"This could have been a very entertaining family movie, but Steven Spielberg ruined it for me once again, just as he did with E.T. many years go, with his obsession with foul-mouthed-children characters (remember, in E.T., the insult \\"Penis breath!\\" shouted by a young boy in an otherwise family-friendly movie?). I know many will probably disagree, so flame away, but that's how Super 8 struck me. Every time the boy in charge of making the Super 8 movie opens his mouth, some variety of swearing comes out. Enough already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE of TIME!!!!!","review":"This movie was AWFUL and I'm not exaggerating. Maybe if the cast were adults it would have been better, but I doubt it.

Super 8 tries to be a coming of age story, but falls way short. Like so many movies today, instead of developing the characters and focusing on a good storyline the film relies heavily on special effects. In doing so the film loses its heart. We have plenty of Transformer type movies, it would have been nice to see this movie differentiate itself. Also, what happened to the professor in the end....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really for Adults and Not Really for Young Children","review":"Special effects is all this movie has to offer.

Another 40-something director making a movie to re-invent their childhood about how magical and smart kids are and how awful and stupid adults are. This movie makes E.T. look good. This movie has absolutely no respect for any storytelling logic other than at the end the kids are all alright. Bite me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid friendly cursing-not so much","review":"This movie would have been so much better without the cursing. J. J. Abrams has children. Does he really think middle school kids curse this much. I watched this film with my 12 and 13 year olds and they were disturbed by the language. I did not appreciate it either. Did Abrams think it was funny to have so much of it? What was the point? Maybe the people in charge are used to adult situations and can't put themselves in a kids shoes. If you are a parent and you don't like your kids to hear a ton of language(especially from other children) in a \\"family friendly movie\\", then do not watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I went into this movie not knowing anything about what it was about. I came out of this moving still unsure of what it was about, save that they took almost two hours to tell a 5 minute story.

I felt like I was missing out because so much was hidden from view in darkness; I spent almost the entire movie wondering what was going on and why. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"\\"Super 8\\" is essentially \\"ET\\" on steroids, but while it's produced by Steven Spielberg it lacks the emotional force of a Spielberg movie. The characters aren't really likeable or credible, making their many attempts at creating emotion uncomfortable to watch. Despite Abrams' reputation for spinning a good yarn, there isn't much of a story here. All in all, this is a very bad ET re-make, and everyone would be better off re-watching the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a Gen X'er, you should like this movie","review":"I saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it just as much at home. I enjoyed the nods to growing up in the late 70's and the various kitsch references in music, vocab, etc. It's the 70's \\"Stand by Me\\", meets \\"ET\\".In typical Spielberg fashion, what you don't know (or fully see) is scary and tense, but becomes acceptable by the time the film is wrapped up.

I was extremely disappointed. The rest of the movie is completely disjointed and has no idea what it should be.

We walked out of it. It tries to capture that whole Spielburgesque feeling, you know, with kids on the bikes in a suburb looking for adventure, but fails completely.

The train just swatted the truck aside (destroying it in the process) and continued on, with out derailing a single car. This crash was as though the train had hit an immovable wall, propelling huge freight cars through the air as though they were weightless, at least until they hit the ground.Speilberg does love his CGI....but it doesn't make a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawd awful","review":"Preposterous plot.

However, the movie tries so hard to invoke the look and feel of those films from the late 70's, early 80's that those who grew up back then remember so fondly, it forgets to be a good movie in its own right. The sentiment is all cheap, the plot is all recycled, the action is all generic, and as good as the child actors are, they're still child actors. I heard so many people say they liked this movie without offering up even the vaguest of specifics as to why, and now that I've seen it, I think I know: even if you fall to its nostalgic charms, you won't remember a bit of this eminently forgettable movie in a few days; you'll remember the movies it's trying to remind you off.Rent before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh come on ET phone home again","review":"Oh come on besides some cool special effects, just how many times have we seen this movie before? It really did not grab my attention at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super 8 rental","review":"The movie had all the childhood charm of most typical Stephen king movies but the actual plot was a little far fetched and lacked a good story. Not one of his best performances by far but worth watching at least once in life. Any more than that I wouldn't reccomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Pablum","review":"In a world where there is really very little that is new or refreshing, this turkey fits right in. If you love obviously miniaturized train crashes where a guy driving an old beat-up pickup truck can survive a head-on crash with a fast-moving freight train, and totally derail it in the process. If you can accept that premise, silly, overused plot-concept, poor character development and CGI from 15 or 20 years ago, this is your movie. Big mistake for me!Since I seem to have not learned anything from this drivel, I just rented Cowboys and Aliens. I wonder how that review will go? But then, I continue to watch Sons of Anarchy.

Given the potential of these ingredients, I'm not sure why it didn't do more for me.Maybe part of it was the navel-gazing aspect of a movie made about tweenage movie-makers, as if someone was trying to write an autobiography the way it should have been.

It is a very cute British children's film from 1955 called SUPERSONIC SAUCER.

The movie dragged throughout and there was no , EDGE OF YOUR SEAT type moments, we all just sat there waiting for ANYTHING.The timeframe of the movie was perfect and the cinematography was excellent, but the story line was weak and lacking. This movie came to theaters the day I got married and I am so glad we did not go see this. I want the $5 back I paid to see this.

The characters are believable, you start to like the children and identify their passion for adventure and film making. They are the soul and the best thing. The adults are more or less props, except for Kyle Chandler and Ron Eidard who have substantial roles. There are some flaws, I did not feel a emotional connect with the alien. There are also a few minor characters whom I felt deserved some screen time such as the science teacher and the military guy. However this is a exceptional film in many respects.

First, the casting of the main characters was completely ridiculous. How they ever found such an inept bunch of pre-teen actors is beyond comprehension. The dialog between the cast was annoying at best. Not one of them could finish a line without interrupting each other making it a useless wall of noise (Directors fault).

Of course ultimately it is Amazon's fault for allowing reviews of a non-existing product.So once again, for all the mentally slow people, DVDs and blu-ray discs are *products* an important *part* of which is the movie and/or TV episodes on it and their quality but that is far from being the *only* criterion by which they should be judged!

But both of those are also on The Very Best Of Manhattan Transfer, along with several others I like, so I saw no reason to invest in this. Although I am a fan of the group, I'm not necessarily a fan of all their song choices: they could do like Tony Bennett and choose only really good tunes. Body And Soul is okay bebop but nothing new, and I could do without all the rest. Do yourself a favor and get either the Best Of album or the Anthology and get more for your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comlete hypocricy and dissimulation","review":"People of her kind of so called missioners should never be sponsored for the mission by church.

Separate or together Keith and Mick always rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a forgotten 'classic'; probably forgotten for a reason","review":"Its a struggle to find songs that are great on this album. Its not rock, like rock guitar music. Keith has a weak voice, not warn with age; just weak.The production is good. The project was a one off try by Virgin to milk money out of Richard's fame.It is a bar band at best. I think the album belongs in the bargain bin at Big Lots.All the reviews here are blatantly over supportive of Mr. Richard's; and over praise this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocals Are Cheap","review":"Richards writes pretty hooky rock music and uses the same sort of clichéd lyrics that brought the Stones greatness, but Mick Jagger, he ain't. To put it another way, he can't sing. Indeed, his vocals are so tentative and mixed so badly back that it's possible to believe there is no singer (maybe this was the engineer's intention). It seems clear that without Mick there would be no Keith, on the other hand, if one listens to Jagger's solo efforts one could equally convinced that the opposite is true. Doubtless they were wise to stick together; the sum is greater than the parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Is The Man","review":"I am a big Keith fan and I was glad that I got this disc. Some of the work by the Stones were lacking in intensity, but on \\"Talk Is Cheap\\", Keith shows us why he is the fuel that runs the Rolling Stones machine. This disc is straight ahead, stripped down Rock at its best. \\"Big Enough\\" is a pretty surprise here it has a good funky beat. \\"Take It So Hard\\", \\"I Could Have Stood You Up\\" and \\"Whip It Up\\" are some great rocking tunes. \\"Locked Away\\" is a awesome ballad that will move you. On the song \\"You Don't Move Me\\", Keith gets to take a swing at Mick for how he thinks about his acting and all around behavior at that time. If you are a true fan of music, I don't think that you will be disappointed with this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grit","review":"This album is grit at its best.

The sound quality on this CD (which has been out for almost 25 years) sounds thin, because the technology was not available at the time to create the full, rich sound that is now standard.If anyone is reading this who knows someone who knows someone who can get someone to get the job done, please, pass this message along: a REMASTERED version of this disc is URGENTLY NEEDED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album from a great guitarist","review":"talk is cheap is a superb album from the great Keith Richards the legendary guitarist of the stones.each and every song is a blues rock powerhouse.very highly recommended.five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivals the better Stones albums","review":"Upon it's release, Guitar Player magazine deemed 'Talk Is Cheap' as \\"the best Rolling Stones album in 17 years.\\" They weren't far off the mark in their assessment. Compared to many Stones records of the seventies and eighties, the stuff on 'Talk Is Cheap' compares quite favorably. On his own, Keith shows us just what an important part of the Stones he's been all these years. As opposed to 'Slick Mick,' Keith has maintained more of a roots rock and roll influence and certainly more of an edge. Admittedly, he's not one of the better vocalists I've heard. But in most cases, the integrity, guitar hooks, and attitude of the songs more than make up for his vocal deficiencies. When you include his backing band in the evaluation, that puts 'Talk Is Cheap' well over the top as a worthwhile addition to one's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richards is the heart & soul of the Rolling Stones","review":"I had been a Rolling Stones fan for years when I first bought Talk is Cheap. After one listen I was convinced, Keth Richards is the heart & soul of the Rolling Stones. Other bands follow the drummer, but with Keith Richards, the band follows him. From the opening funk of Big Enough to the rockin' It Means a Lot, this cd is pure groove. Keith can play it all, old time rock-I Could Have Stood Up, country-Locked Away, all out rock & roll-Whip It Up. The singing voice is an acquired taste, but the music speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great amp kit but It's not a Dual Kit buyer beware!!!","review":"First off the seller StreetStereo has this advertised as a dual amplifier power kit but It's really only a Single amp kit!!

Their courage to think differently and to find new perspectives is inspiring and offers insights into the creative process. It is no \\"easy read\\" however.

Unusual for books of this sort, Ms. Dendel shares little about herself and writes instead about the people with whom she becomes friends. She does not show even unspoken attitudes of white supremacy, but instead what she, and all of us, could learn from the lives and attitudes of these people. A lot of the negatives of the lives of the people she describes, particularly relating to the role of women in traditional society, are not mentioned, but this book is not a scholarly treatise, just a discussion of the author's experiences.

As such, it may or may not bear any relationship to the truth as Morrissey himself sees it, for Simpson acknowledges the self-defeating nature of trying to interpret those enigmatic lyrics. But that's irrelevant. I have never read a book before like this: every page or two, I wanted to stop and talk about what Simpson had written with someone else - I wanted to discuss, argue, complain, gasp, share the experience.

And what about litigation laws... they can actually backfire!In summary, the author, Terry Neal, spends a lot of time promoting the idea of shelter from the IRS and SEC, but fails to mention that he himself is under investigation by IRS and SEC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Neal does gives a no nonsense approach to asset protection, on and offshore.

He took the torch of BB King and Albert Collins and made something special. It is a rocking blend of stax, r&b;, and memphis soul. There really is no one to compare it to, today. His singing is outrageously soulful and a throwback to Bobby Bland. His guitar playing is literally unparalleled, even with his relavtively short solos. There isn't much he can't say with one note, and white blues players simply pale in comparison.Smoking Gun is an excellent album if you like a little soul with your blues and/or you are a student of blues guitar.

The music shows a serious knowledge not merely of blues (although that would be quite enough), but of deeply-rooted gospel and R&B (who cannot love the Wilson Pickett-style horns on \\"I Guess I Showed Her?\\"). This is matched well with the personal details Cray adds to his lyrics. In \\"Foul Play,\\" we can almost hear the protagonist's paranoia and fear. In \\"I Guess I Showed Her,\\" he glowers triumphantly at dumping an unfaithful spouse, only to reveal his hurt pride at the very end of the song, in the fadeout. In \\"Right Next Door (Because of Me),\\" he is a womanizer feeling--one thinks for the first time--pangs of guilt over the seduction of yet another wife. While not a replacement for recordings by the blues greats of old, this is an incredible CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"this absolutely, positively a must have cd for any one who appreciates great music. it is all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one book I keep right by my side.","review":"I bought the first edition this book with no real knowledge of HTML or web design at all for that matter.

Although it won't teach you everything about web design, it's a great starting point and gives you enough info to know what the technology are for and if you need it in your page.I've been programming on and off since the 80's, but my memory is like a sieve, so I rely on reference books constantly.

But no thanks.There is one lesson that this book really brings home. Desiging an exciting site that looks good on all monitors and with all browsers, is not fun, is not easy and is not user friendly. But that's not the book's fault.In fairness, this is not the most difficult book out there. If you just can't get enough complexity there are the Real World books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, invaluable help","review":"This is the perfect book for counselors and other mental health professionals who want up to date information about ADD/ADHD. The way the book is written makes it an excellent referrence for parents and families who are living with a child, or children with ADHD.

I bought it mostly because I liked what I had read about fluorocarbon being less visible to fish underwater. I fish in a clearwater lake, and the fish can be pretty discriminatory when it comes to deciding what to eat, so I didn't want them seeing my line. Anyway, I caught some fish, so I'm not giving the line a 1-star rating, but, in the end, Berkley Vanish can only muster 2-stars.Cons: the stuff just gets twisted, tangled, and coiled worse than anything I have seen. It was a real problem when I was fishing. Loops of line would force themselves off my reel and tangle around the handle, etc. I had to cut off the line and strip yards and yards of it several times, only to have to re-tie so I could keep fishing.A friend of mine told me that the Trilene Fluoro is better stuff, and he urged me to go with that, but odds are I'm going back to Stren Lo-Vis Green monofilament."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suprisingly good one","review":"As a Mahler fan and collector of versions, I did not expect much from this CD. But I had read a bad and a good review from good magazines, so I decided to find out for myself. After all, at Naxos price, why not? Well... it was a great ride.Surely there are some things that could have been different (I hesitate to say \\"better\\") but the genius of Mahler's symphonies is the many options available to implement different views on details (e.g., tempo) etc.In any case, I found the long architectural line beautifully done; the structure impeccably conceived; and the recording outstanding (better than EMI's Rattle & Co, in fact). And the LSO is a truly virtuoso orchestra, perfect for Gustav's music.Naxos did it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A splendid example of why classical music has a bad rep ......","review":"I thought maybe this cd was the kind you might have to hear twice before you could really 'see' the music, hmmm, not for me. The conducting sounded off, and I mean way off tempo, either that or the music is just genuinely horrible. Reminded me of that awful stuff you hear playing through the speakers in a movie theater before the previews even start, where everyone looks around in existential angst trying to pretend that the music might be halfways decent. It's mediocrity like this that gives all classical music a bad rep. I do enjoy Mahler's 2nd Symphony so I was dissappointed to say the least by this, which isn't even worthy of a spot on ebay or any used cd rack in my opinion. Out of the 200 or so classical cds I own, this one is the very worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I was a HUGE fan of the Feather Touch razor with its phenomenal ability to produce a baby soft shave. So when I discovered there was an updated version with a rechargeable battery, I jumped right on it.The new sleek design is definitely appealing, however, that's about where the appeal ends. First of all, the shave itself was not nearly as close as the original version. I went over the same areas over and over, yet this version was unable to give me the same close shave as its predecessor.The worst part, the rechargeable aspect of the Body Bare is a joke. There is maybe a 10-minute charge, which is quite an inconvenience when the charge runs out in the middle of a shave.I would suggest sticking to the battery-operated version until the rechargeable version goes through some major and much-needed improvements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shaver combo... baby's bottom smooth","review":"This will get your skin baby-bottom smooth. The first razor, the white one, doesn't seem well made and my first one broke (hence the -1 star.) But, Deak sent me another one no questions asked and it has worked fine although it is cheaply made. The silver one is awesome and if you use it daily or bi-daily you can skip the white one altogether after the first run.Altogether after having waxed & razored, this combo is for me the ultimate and I wouldn't endure painful razor bumps ever again! I have rather sensitive skin.Note: You MUST use powder. If you don't plan to then don't buy this! Also, it takes a few runs over each spot to get it smooth. You basically need to approach the hair from all directions. There is no pain involved., but it takes about 5 minutes to do it right.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked ok, but then broke","review":"I bought this shaver expecting great things after reading all of the reviews. I was disappointed. It did offer a fairly close shave, as long as you trimmed it very short first (like only one days stubble). That was fine, it was worth it to get a closer smoother shave. It never was completely smooth though, but it was the best I ever got, since razors just don't work for me, too many red itchy bumps that way. You do need to take your time with this razor, it is not a quick shave. I do love the trimmer that came with it for free, no problems with that at all.However after using it for only 5-7 times, it just stopped working. I thought the charge was dead, so i charged it and it still didn't work. I was so bummed. HOWEVER, I contacted Amazon even though it was long past return dates, and they refunded my money. Talk about amazing customer service. Maybe mine was just a lemon, try it for yourself, but at least know they stand by their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"Did not work as advertised for me or my partner.

Although it worked fairly well for a while and I liked the rechargeable aspect, my first shaver got a tear in the foil top making it unusable. So I bought a second one. Worked for a while, then the foil tore. Bought a third one. Same problem. This time I tried to purchase just a replacement foil but that was so expensive I just bought a fourth shaver. Again, it worked for a few months until a hole developed in the foil. Finally, realizing that repeating the same actions over and over and expecting a different result was the very definition of insanity (DUH!) this time I bought a Seiko CleanCut and I really like the shave it gives much better. I'm hoping the foil lasts longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"this thing is worthless. it doesn't give a razor burn but it doesn't do any shaving.

I used the free trimmer that came with the product and was cut several times by it. I found it so frustrating that I decided to use a straight razor for the initial shave and then maintain with the intimate stubble shaver (the actual product). I used the product today on a full charge and with tons of baby powder as instructed via the manual...and was cut three more times! After noticing the second cut I just gave up on shaving. And the areas that were shaven without pain, still have stubble. I've never had an electric shaver cause nicks like this. I understand the trimmer causing some nicks, but the product itself? I don't recommend this to anyone for any part of their body unless you want to leave the hair and remove the skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaver","review":"The product is what I want but I have only used it 4 times now and the blades seem to be dull.

I'm a fair skinned female with thin, straight hair. Most of my leg hair is blonde (not very coarse at all). This shaver specifically says it only works on stubble length hair...so, to test it fairly, I first shaved my legs with a razor. After only TWO day's growth (the kind of stubble you can barely see), I tried this shaver. It did NOTHING. I repeatedly ran over the same spot...over and over and over. Each time, it seemed to pick up ONE hair (not exaggerating). Left my legs still feeling prickly. It goes without saying that it didn't work for more personal areas either. What an absolute ripoff.

Sadly the movie was dumb. Imagine Mark Hamill as a power ranger. That's pretty much the size of it. The anime is a different story. I was totally rocked by this series. There are tons of cool fight scenes. Lots of good villains and heroes. The voice acting is good and the animation is also pretty good. There is really good character development and some emotional scenes. This series also has lots of action to keep you interested.I can't think of anything bad to say about Guyver. It's one you can watch several times and not get bored. It's not exactly one of the better anime titles out there, but it's still a lot of fun. I recommend giving it a try.

I was very happy they got into a lot more detail unlike the 12part OVA and it went through I think volume 7 of the manga if I am right? If your a fan of the Guyver and you don't have this I highly recommend getting this. Or if you're looking for a new Anime that has to deal with some sci-fi/action then check this out. I really hope for a 2nd Season...only time will tell. I was very pleased when I heard about this because I was sure Guyver was dead after the 12 part OVA.

I am a huge fan of the old series and I bought this new one hoping for more of the same, it had a TVMA rating so I had my hopes up. Turns out this dvd release is an extremely tamed down version of the show, it's a Funimation release after all. Remember watching DBZ on Cartoon Network and they would cut away any time someone was about to get punched and only show the reaction shot? Yeah, a lot of the same here. I am totally disappointed. Thanks to all the piracy websites out there I can't even find a thread of people talking about whether or not this is a censored release or if it was really animated without any ultraviolence.Anyway, if you want Guyver for what it used to be, skip this. If you're cool with the made for tv guyver, snatch it up.

The last time I needed a new glove, both of those were out of stock, so I thought I would try this Controller II, on the theory that although it wouldn't last as long, it was cheaper so I could just buy them more frequently and have a new glove more often for the same total cost.Wrong. The Max Tak and the O3 gloves generally give me about 3 months of play before the palms start to become stiff and shrunken, and another 3 months of good use before they need replacing. This glove is stiff and shrunken after 2 weeks! That's 1/6th as long. The other two also have a much stickier grip.

Okay Sting is a better bass player than guitar player (his love nowadays) but he's a dabbler... he dabbles in this and that, almost like he's creative but in a junkish sort of way.

It is organized in chapters corresponding to the grades Japanese youngsters learn kanji. I initially chose this book over a few others because he explores kanji origins and it's kind of enlightening. But the book fails in a few major ways. First, the book does not demonstrate stroke order. The mnemonics given are pretty corny and rarely helpful. I appreciate what the author is trying to do, but for most learners, a book of mnemonics defeats the purpose. Finally, the calligraphy is terrible and many old-form kanjis and kanjis embedded in English text are hand-written. It's pretty sloppy. The major selling point of the book is the English-language history of kanji origins, though I would imagine that if you are really concerned about kanji origins, you are probably a specialist and can read Japanese documents on the subject.

She is afraid of almost everyting, so she makes some weird rules for the children.One thing that I found annoying was that Snicket keeps on repeating words and their meanings that Klause, one of the orphans, uses.This book has great discription, and it is a captivating tae of how Baudelaire orphans tried to stop Count Olof from stealing their fortune.If you like the book, be sure to check out the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Want Tim Curry!!!!!","review":"My family and I have really enjoyed books 1 and 2. (We listen to them in the car during long trips.) We eagerly anticipated the arrival of book 3 and were pleased with the story but REALLY missed Tim Curry's reading. Even my 6 year old commented on it! She specifically mentioned Mr. Poe's cough, and laughed. She asked why he didn't want to read book 3? Hurt, as if it was Mr. Curry's choice. Though we did find the interview at the end of Book 1 quite funny, we also feel this sort of vehicle is a wonderful and adequate way to enjoy Mr. Snicket's personality. Tim Curry's vibrant reading brings the wonderful stories of Lemony Snicket to their fullest. Please come back! For us, not having Tim Curry do the readings is an unfortunate event!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't throw this book out the window!","review":"The 3rd in the series.

This time, they end up with their Aunt Josephine, who is afraid of practically anything. That means she's afraid of stoves, telephones, and even realtors!I really like this book becuase the plot is mysterious and exciting.

Okay, so it's not that funny, but it's still close. In my opinion, this is what really got the series into full gear. Sure, the other two before were good. GOOD, that's all. This one is GREAT. For once, the murder of a human could be made funny! Cap'n Sham was funny! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! Am I saying \\"FUNNY\\" too many times? FUNNY!

His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction.

Ross MacDonald is simply the best illustrator around--I've been known to tear his illustrations out of magazines to save the always hilarious yet somehow also poignant, vintage-looking pictures. There's something about the warm glow in his illustrations that recalls a 1930s illustrated magazine, but you look a little closer and realize there's a very hip and very funny mind at work behind the drawings.

Gore has now taken to calling himself a populist; yet, Cockburn and St. Clair disclose the fact that time and again he has sold his services to big oil, telecom giants and the nuclear power industry. He calls himself a liberal, but he has referred to gays as \\"abnormal\\", has supported tax breaks for racist schools, has voted against federal funding for family planning for poor women and has tried to end affirmative action.

I'm a Libertarian, so maybe I'm biased. But PJ has a way of showing through humor and observation the fallibilty of both government and the people who wish to change it. PJ's way with words is incredible. His analogies bring to mind Douglas Adams, and his satire is unparalleled. Think of Robert Heinlein meets The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy. A must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Political satire at its best","review":"Even though this book was written over ten years ago, it is still an up-to-date indictment of the American way of doing government, with lessons for those both in the USA and those of us who live in other (though similar) systems. What i thought summed up the brilliance of O'Rourke is that i would read sections that i didn't agree with, but could still not help myself from laughing out loud. And it is dispiriting yet insightful to read about his views on Afghanistan a decade ago, and how so little has changed!I have loved everything that i have read so far that has been written by O'Rourke, and i am guessing that he is a love-it or hate-it style for most. But if you are in the love-it camp, you are in for a treat. As usual, his satire and wit has managed to combine insight with humour - a bloody good read for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"for a conservative Republican, he's OK","review":"As a (generally) liberal person, I found this book an extremely guilty pleasure, like a hard-core ecologist getting most of his income from oil stock. In little more than 200 pages, he explains clearly and concisely how the government should work-- and how and why it often doesn't. What makes O'Rourke different from the current batch of conservative goose-steppers is that 1) he is intelligent, 2) he is (relatively) unbiased, taking shots at the Right as well as the Left, 3) he gets his facts straight, and 4) he is gut-bustingly funny (I was laughing so hard on the bus, people were avoiding me more than the stinky homeless guy). In fact, you might want to have a high-lighter handy because, if you talk politics much, you'll be quoting this more than Bartlett's. Still, I've docked the book one star because of some cheap shots and ethnic slurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy from Compaq","review":"The first laptop I bought didn't work, so I had to exchange it for a more expensive model--they were out of the model I originally bought. After a month I decided that I really needed some sort of floppy drive, which Compaq is supposed to provide, but they wouldn't do anything. Then, a couple of months after that, my cd drive stopped working. I'm still trying to get it fixed and it's been quite a while. The customer service people are in India, some of them barely speak English, and they were very rude. Also, the notebooks themselves are low-quality and break often.

I found this music to be worthwhile to listen to and the performances to be excellent.Yes, I am happy to admit that I do very much like Schumann and thus also enjoy Schumanesque music - and this music admittedly is certainly that rather more than it is 'Straussian'. But also I ardently enjoy all of Strausses music and so it is very interesting to hear his early pieces and thus come to a greater appreciation of his development - especially since once his personal style had developed (to an astonishingly rapid extent by as early as Op.20) it did not seem to develop much further, even though he lived so long and wrote so much (how many people know his 'Couperin Suite' for example? - and I regard these early piano pieces far above that much later one!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required Reading","review":"I purchased this for a class I took.

This is a middle chapter of a trilogy which goes really downhill just like the matrix. I think everything with calamutis and Jordan and Anti fairies was just time filler to play support to the love triangle that actually steals the show and turns this middle chapter into something fun and exciting. You do have to look past the extremly dumb celebrity refrences with Sheen and Morgan Freeman I actually changed the channel it was so dumb. Nobody cared about the comic relief becuase the eyes were on a well developed love trinagle I was actually very interested in what Cindy had to say and both had good sides to root foor and bad sides to root against.

I figured I could replace the band with a real men's band if necessary. I brought it to my dad in the nursing home and he was thrilled with it. He declined the offer for another band saying that this would probably stretch out with time. The voice could have been a little louder but if he put the watch to his ear he could hear the time. However, within three weeks the voice stopped working. The hands still work so I don't think it's the battery. And after reading the other reviews I see that they don't last.

The instructions say to take two paks but for me one is plenty. I take it with lunch and enjoy the benefits the rest of the day. Since starting this almost a year ago I am sick less, stronger, healthier and feel better overall. There is a noticeable difference when not taking these vitamins. If you are looking for a great multi that covers all the bases this is it. The only downside for some is the 11 pills you have to take. I suggest taking the larger ones first and working your way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Soluble and Water Soluble Vitamins","review":"I used to take these vitamins regularly; however, after doing a little research, too much of a good thing can be bad for the body. I am not bashing Universal. I take a lot of other products that they produce. But you can be toxic on fat soluble vitamins: A, E, D, and K. You only need 100% of your daily value, not more. Also, you can never overdose on natural means of vitamin intake via fresh fruits and vegetables. With Universal, the doese is extremely high. With high doses of fat soluble vitamins, they begin to store in the adipose tissue, fat cells, for later use. This is very hard on the liver and diseases may produce from prolonged toxicity. Please, do some research on products you are putting into your body. The water soluble vitamins are disposed of via urine when in excess. That is why we may see a neon glow to our urine when on high doses of vitamins. Basically, it is very expensive urine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Believer","review":"I was not a big guy, 150 lbs and 5 ft 11. Very average.

I started these a month ago and my weight has gone from 150 to 165, and it's all muscle. By bench has gone from 185 to 205 in a month, and not just my chest, I'm adding 10%-15% weight in nearly all my routines; still not massively huge, but the results are there. I only take a pack a day and it is more than enough. My friends think I'm on steroids. I would like to note that I also take a few other supplements that may cause me to gain mass and strength: Optimum Nutrition Creatine and Whey Protein, and Craze Pre-Workout (all here on Amazon). It may not be Animal Pack giving me all the results, but for me; this combination is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hepatoxicity!!!","review":"Leaving alone the number (11) and sive (huge) of these pills compared to other multis, be warned, the body does not need, and cannot process, much more than 100% of the RDA of most vitamins. For water soluable vitiams such as B6 and C, the only danger is added stress to the kidneys (the dark urine warned of in many reviews) as the excess vitamis are excreted. Ask any doctor and he/she will tell you the same: the body excretes any vitamin A, B, and C it does not use. The real danger is in the fat soluable vitaminis, E, D and K. At over 5000 (five thousand!) times the RDA, none of which the body can elimainte (fat soulable vitmans are stored in the fat and liver, where, at too high levels, can cause toxicity). Please, please, consult with a doctor and stick with a plan that provides you with at or near 100% of the RDA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too intense for me","review":"Listen, I'm not a real gym rat or anything like that, so maybe this just isn't the right product for me.

I am by no means a serious weigh lifter, so I wasn't looking for a multi that would help me make huge gains, just something to keep me emergized through my workouts. I take 1 packet in the morning, about 2.5 hours before my workouts.After taking this for about 3 weeks, I can say that I don't feel the sort of energy that I had with the Mega Men, in fact, I am usually dragging by 2:00 on the Animal Pak.

The change was noticable from the very beginning. I think I was experiencing mental fatigue from over training before I started taking the supplement and I also started drinking a lot of water instead of about 32 ounces of Mountain Dew each morning at the same time I started taking this supplement since the directions on the supplement want you to drink a lot of water. Yes, you will also notice your urine being a bright yellow. I work out or train about 3 times a week mostly running and some strength training.

Up to 9 or ten lines in many places. The book covers mundane topics such as public opinion of tanks, cartoonists and writers perceptions of the tank and so on. The book drags like an anchor in many places.The book is full of snipits of trivia and information that you won't find elsewhere concerning the development of the tank from WWI to the present day. The book does a good job discussing Russian and German tank warfare on the eastern front. He also does a fine job describing the six day war and the Yom Kippur wars in the middle east. However, he does not discuss the U.S very much. He hardly mentions the M-60, and the M-48 tanks and devotes a thin chapter to the M-1. My advice is to skip this one and buy Tom Clancy's Armored Cav."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing as a Military History of Tanks","review":"I bought this book to read about tanks and in the very first chapter found that the author was more interested in addressing political, philosophical, social, ethical and other issues than tanks.

The author makes massive use of adjectives and has numerous quotations from others which in many cases add very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tank' by Patrick Wright","review":"Someone with a military cast of mind seriously interested in the development of the tank and tank tactics will be sorely disappointed.

As an introduction to opera, Goulding's book is better written and more objective; however, \\"Rough Guide\\" includes information on more operas and what's available on CD. This is a very useful source of information, but as other reviewers have suggested, investigate other sources before buying anything. Personally, I like to have more than one reference of this sort available, because like all art, evaluating opera is a matter of opinion; guidelines are helpful, but the individual listener or viewer is the ultimate arbiter on what he or she appreciates most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the next edition!","review":"There are many obvious mistakes in this book.

Can you image a foam edge, putting pressure (from the Velcro head-strap) right in the corners of your eyes?

The only problem is, this HARD plast layer RUBS against your nose and face when you wear it!! It irritates your face so bad, that it makes the actual act of \\"sleeping\\" virtually impossible (or in my case, completely impossible). i do not recommend this mask at all. It gets 1 star because, although it DOES block out the light, it DOES NOT allow the wearer to sleep with it on. Thus, it is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it a lot","review":"Just got this, does actually block out all light as it claims.

He is just plain not funny. This is how i see it: it's REALLY EASY to rag on EVERYONE. it takes no balls whatsoever. if he's intellectual at all, his genius lies in his (correct) assumption that by making fun of everyone possible, he will come across as edgy. in fact, it's about as un-edgy as you can get. as long as i fruitlessly try to offend every racial/ethnic/religious group possible, then in the end i dont really offend anyone. it's hard to get mad at mencia because even if he's tried to make fun of whatever group you associate yourself with, he's done the same to just about everyone else. if he had any balls at all, he'd pick out some particular group to make fun of, but in this day and age, that would probably keep him off tv and therefore severely limit his income. carlos mencia is about the worst comic out there, and is about as PC as you can get in his own way."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Roger from Buffalo NY","review":"What the reviewer was trying to say is that Carlos Mencia is a phoney comedian trying to pass himself off as a 100% pure latino which he is not.

I'm not sure why he's not funny, he's doing the exact same thing Dave Chappelle is doing except from a Mexican's POV. I think it is because he tries too hard. The only thing mildly funny are the commercials advertising the show. This is the kind of show you want to have on for ambient noise, like if you are on a computer or talking to someone on the phone.

And what I saw simply lacked comedic value.He's often compared to Dave Chappelle, but Dave Chappelle's racial remarks are made in a very smart, interesting, and often unique manner, and Chappelle show didn't need to be racist to be funny (like the Rick James skit)Mind of Mencia is very formulaic and often breaks down into: White people do _________, while Mexicans do _________.Its just not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEE DE DEEEEEEEE","review":"i really gave this show a chance, i watched a couple of episodes, actually i'm watching it now.. jeezusCarlin >>> Mencia... how dare you compare themi love chapelle, proof that racial humor can be funny.this is shite"},{"rating":"2","title":"mind of mencia is sweet","review":"carlos mencia may not be mexican, and he may steal some material, but the way he tells it makes it seem orginal and its alot funnier than the orginal way. mind of mencia is the funniest show since family guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Garbage","review":"If this is the show used to fill in the tragically canceled Chappelle's Show, then there is no God.Carlos Mencia is a worthless \\"comedian\\" who can't imagine things beyond being racist.

The man's jokes are rehashed, idiotic, and downright cruel and unfunny. If there weren't stereotypes in this world, then this show wouldn't have existed. At least when Dave Chappelle does his stereotypical jokes, he doesn't have to enhance them with mindless yelling and he knows what he's talking about.I would give the man much more respect if he admitted that he was Honduran.

The entire book could be condensed into a short story and still effectively convey the same message. And on a more minor note, shouldn't *something* happy happen at least once in a novel?

This is a complex read, and not for your supermarket variety readers. It needs to be read slowly and carefully so that it will be absorbed and appreciated for it's amazing writing. You won't be able to put it down. All in all it is perfectly executed down to the very last line. It is a must read for anyone who truly enjoys great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"God is faithful","review":"Very tremendous testimony to God giving ample witness. Very important read. Explains Acts 17 of Paul's encounter on Mar's Hill in Athens."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Diehard Coltrane Fans Only, I Think","review":"I think you have to be a really serious fan of Coltrane to enjoy this album. Without hearing another version of Love Supreme before listening to this one, I don't think you can appreciate the longer version. I would not want this to be one's first exposure to John Coltrane - older and less unconventional pieces like Equinox, My Favorite Things, and others might be a better place to start. I am only a casual Coltrane fan, and I was put off by both tracks.This performance has been issued under several labels, one which added Naima as a bonus track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interminable Aimless Noodling","review":"I'm a fan of progressive rock and classical music of the baroque period, both of which tend to cultivate mastabatory solos. I'm used to it and, usually, I like it. I bought this after listening to numerous recommendations from fellow musicians over the last few decades. I just don't get what the big deal is. In his autobigraphy, Andy Summers (of Police fame) explained that he hated Coltrane the first time he heard him, but was continually drawn back, eventually came to love the music, and now regards it as highly influential in his own development. I wish my experience was the same. I've forced myself to listen to this over and over. But, for me, the soloing that pervades this recording approaches randomness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeez, what a [ham]!","review":"Golly. All my friends rant and rave about John Coltrane and how good he is. He just knows how to play really fast. His solos sound like he is making them up as he goes along. This guy needs to take some lessons from some real sax masters like Kenny G. He also needs a cool hair style like Kenny G. I heard his friend Eric Dolphy, and he really [is'nt good], too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GIANT STEPS: more Coltrane genius","review":"another 5 star Coltrane affair. you cannot go wrong with this cd. ful of great harmonies that twist and turn from every angle and yet have the 'hook' power to get stuck in your head. you'll be humming some of these melodies for days on end. a classic recording full of timeless and brilliant music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giant Steps","review":"This cd give you the perfect example of Coltrane's stylings and musical persona. For anyone who wants to know what jazz is and has been, they need this cd in their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very pour edition.","review":"Don't buy Deluxe Edition, buy Remastered Edition. Remastered edition is 24-bit transfer, Deluxe ed. is the original. In the Deluxe Ed. the CD is in the carton leave (they wanted it as in LP), unfortunately to take and return CD can scratch it.The music is Grate, Coltrane is the big master."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jazz of Hendrix","review":"I had read more than one review of this CD, but was waiting for a re-mastered version. Well, I finally got it, in more ways than one. Now some might think me crazy to compare John Coltrane to Jimi Hendrix. But listen to Giant Steps & Live at The Half Note, and you might change your mind.The only differance between the two in that Jimi Hendrix had a whammy bar & distortion pedals to create his sound. Coltrane had his horn. The solos he plays on Giant Steps almost outdoes Charlie Parker. You have to pay attention, just to see if he'll make it to the end before passing out..! All in all, this is a fine CD and should keep you wondering how he did it....."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far, Coltrane's best album ever","review":"Boy what can I say? If you dont have this CD, your collection of jazz is suffering pretty bad. Coltrane's amazing musical technique is obvious not only in the extremely technical playing, but also in his composition of the songs here. Giant Steps, almost undisputedly the most difficult song to solo on in all of jazz, is by simply superb. However, the careful listener will notice the difficulty that Tommy Flanagan has when his solo turn comes. The little-known reason behind it is that Coltrane asked his band to assemble at the studio without ever having seen the music they played before. With that taken into consideration, I began to realize how skillful the different rhythm sections are that Trane played with on this album. At any rate, this CD is one of the greatest jazz records of all time, so I strongly recommend that you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The culmination of bebop","review":"Over the nearly 20 years preceding the release of this album, starting with the unrecorded jam sessions at Minton's and Monroe's, the masters of bebop developed virtuosity unmatched by those that came before while ensuring that it did not prevent them from truly creating an art with depth, musicality, and expression. This date was the culmination of this movement, with chord changes more complex than ever before at tempos that were rarely matched. The masters would have been hard pressed to sculpt art under these conditions. Yet Coltrane proved himself up to it from the very beginning of his solo on the title cut to the last note of the album. His ideas express themselves so succinctly as to sound complete, vivid, and calm through the \\"sheets of sound\\" that he came to be known for starting at this date. An awesome recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another cornerstone of jazz music","review":"I've never been a big fan of Coltrane because I find his later stuff to be too remote for me to enjoy. That's why I was surprised at how much I liked this album. I suppose John was just getting his feet under him in the jazz music world when he developed the style and songs that led to this album, which may be why I find it more refreshing and more rewarding to listen to than his later stuff. It may be I just didn't hear the right recordings or songs when I began my jazz journey. Whatever the reason, I consider this Coltrane's most accesible and enjoyable work, and obviously, this is an integral part of any jazz music core collection (just askThe Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition (Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings)if you don't believe me.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Classic","review":"If you like old jazz, then you must buy this CD to add to your collection. It is up there with some heavy Miles Davis, etc. The alternate takes are pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Step","review":"Giant Steps is appropriately titled as it was John Coltrane's first album made up entirely of his own songs. The music on the album is smooth and Mr. Coltrane's sax playing is soft and inviting. \\"Naima\\" is a gorgeous piece with a sweet, tender melody. The title track is a pulsating tune. The deluxe edition fleshes out the original album with alternative takes, but the original tracks are worth purchasing this album alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest album of John Coltrane","review":"To my mind, no jazz-lover can honestly do without this record, which is I think, the best I have ever heard. I fell in love with Trane's music the very first night I listened to this album (I remember it was played six times in a row). It made me love jazz, which is probably the best compliment for a record."},{"rating":"2","title":"In short: good buy","review":"Good quality towels came at a good price, and quickly.

They are OK for a beach house or a cabin but definitely not for a nice home bathroom where you'd like to keep soft plushy towels.If I were not so lazy I would have sent mine back... but I got them 2 for $8 so it was not worth the trouble.

One that is fast passed and exciting, with a hint of romance and mystery. I finally got my wish when I found this book. Koontz did a great job of relaying a very complicated plot. A young boy, Danny, dies in a terrible bus crash. Well, at least that is what everyone thought. A year later, he comes back and tries to let his mom know what she had suspected all along, he wasn't really dead. Using the themes of hope and heart over mind, Knootz instantly makes his readers empathize with the characters. I found myself unable to put the book down because I cared so much about what was going to happen to and with the characters. I definitely urge anyone who can read to do so with this book. It is a must for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"One gets the feeling the author was rushed, because this tale is awkward and the characters poorly developed. I realize that Mr. Koontz has reworked an earlier book but there are unrealistic turns of events as well as superficial descriptions. At one point, Elliot says to Tina \\"that's not the Tina I know\\". Considering that he has only known her for about 24 hours when he makes this statement, it is a ridiculous thing to say. At any rate, if you are looking for a quick and easy read, this book will do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother's love can beat out Govmt spooks","review":"It was exciting, though seemed unfinished. But I like the fact that he included the death of Vince Foster as an example of fishy govmt explanation, and possible coverup by our prevaricator-in-chief. But I personally don't care for magical explanations of anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really just, ya know... great!","review":"Another winner for Koontz. Everything leading to the ending of the book just makes you not want to stop: The depth of the characters, the momentum of the plot...<P>Only complaint is that the book ends so abruptly! Did he run into a deadline or something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened, Dean?","review":"Every now and then a superb author has a mistake. Taken with Koontz masterpieces such as Phantoms and Watchers, this is a very weak effort. This book fails terribly in descriptiveness that you'll finish the story before getting to know everybody. Maybe decent for a short read but you'll be better off picking a copy of Dragon Tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty weak effort","review":"Koontz has written several wonderful novels. This one, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The main characters are incredibly shallow, others are too black and white. The plot is too predictable. I've read about a dozen of Koontz's books, and this is definitely the worst of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run-of-the-mill","review":"One of Koontz's so-so efforts.

He quickly threw in charactors to kill off some of the main ones. And then in the last few chapters it was like he didn't care anymore and he just wanted to get the book completed. I suggest to read another book from Koontz, he has done much better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"I read this book because the back fascinated me,it seemed like it would be about something more realistic but it turned out to be a science fiction book that was not very good and way to unrealistic. I belive a book can be unrealistic but this was way to far fetched and it ended up having a stupid plot.Dont waste your time with this book if you want a good one \\"Intesity\\" or \\"Phantoms\\"are good novels but dont waste your time with this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast paced is another word for sensationalist stupidity","review":"Dean Koontz is a writer that ignores plot and interest, the ending was weak and stupidly easy. the beginning had promise, but then the book looked if he had forgotten deadline and had to write the rest all in one hour, using plot devices as a omnipotent benefactor and to save the plot by bringing up the redeeming social value of experimenting on small children (as he did in Door To december). it was terrible and sadistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly, stupid and predictable","review":"Firstly, I love reading Dean Koontzs books. This book was the 17th book I read from him, but the worst yet. One of the things I like about his books is that you wonder could it really happen. Not with this one. The boy danny stoping bullets coming out of guns with his mind is a bit much for me. You always know the good guys are always going to win in the end. The book has a very weak storyline too. The last couple of his books that I read have been a big let down (Lightning and Fear Nothing -both terrible). I'm beginning to wonder if he has any other ideas other than corrupt undercover agancies, governments and laborotories? Also, does there always have to be a dog in the storyline? I must have read all the brilliant books first - Phantoms, The voice of the night, Strangers, Whispers and the servants of twilight."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRIPPING","review":"I was in a total trance from the first page!

That is the last sort of thing that I would intend to do. I grew up watching SpongeBob SquarePants cartoons, and I was so familiar with the few episodes that were around back at that time that I was able to follow along with the dialogue contained within them. These episodes can still be quite funny, but they are lacking in the charm that helped to achieve spectacular fame for the series and a remarkable fan base. This is not the SpongeBob I remember.

Every time the book seemed like it was going to tell me something interesting...the next line is \\"however, that is beyond the scope of what is covered in this book.\\" Then what really killed me is in the family law (divorce) section when the author starts talking about how it is illegal for lawyers to have sexual relations with clients which can be real danger when feelings get out of hand. Are you kidding?I was looking for something that delves into the day to day work of lawyers in various practice areas (which seems to be a bit of a secret for whatever reason).

While the movie had all the kung-fu Shaolin bald monks, outlandish Vampires, zombie spirits, and horror schlock, it just couldn't seem to get exciting. Not once did it ever. It's either an incomprehensible DVD or an irritating, inappropriately titled Taoist kung-fu movie.This movie has no plot, no character development, and really no sense of direction or focus at all. It is a D-Movie plain and simple.It's like they just stopped shooting the ending.It was certainly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK.","review":"Well, this was definitely a kids' movie. It starts out great, and within the first 10 minutes there's a \\"Lost Boys Chinese food\\" homage and an attack by dozens of undead that is fought off with Kung Fu and magic.After that, there's a love story, a bunch of arguing between two brothers, and a lot of silly humor. There's nothing scary here and the director cuts too quickly in the fight scenes. My 10-year-old son loved the movie, but it didn't hold my interest at all. I much preferred Ong Bak and Shaolin Soccer to this.Also, the ending is jarring and kills any momentum the movie had. The sequel might make this better, but it doesn't hold up on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending unacceptable","review":"I've never written a review, but I'm writing this one because this movie is a rip off. STAY AWAY.On one hand, the movie itself isn't too bad. It's pretty corny, and the story is disjointed. However, this is standard kung fu fare. The action isn't too bad, and after a while, I started to actually dig the plot. We were looking at a solid three star movie--it really started to pick up the pace, when all of a sudden...the movie ends. Credits roll.And then the credits roll--with awesome footage, THAT YOU CANNOT SEE! WHERE IS THE REST OF THE MOVIE? It's worse than the Heidi Bowl! What the heck were the producers thinking? This movie is a rip-off...stay away. What little redeeming values were there were absolutely killed by the sudden ending.Pass pass pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it first","review":"The guy above summed it up pretty good, the only thing he forgtot to mention is it is actually a pretty corny movie. Hopping vampires dont get any stupider, the plot stupid and makes no sense, movie just ends out of the blue. the evil dead are only in the first half of the movie then are gone out of know where. Where they come from or or how they just dissapear is unknown. A very common Japanese flick that makes no sense . i have about 7 or japanese flicks and i would say 2 or 3 of them are ok.

For once, the critics were dead on the money. This album contains some of the most moving ballads you will EVER hear. \\"Lipstick Sunset,\\" with its tear-inducing slide solo by the immortal Ry Cooder, is masterful, while \\"Tip of My Tongue\\" is one of the best songs I've ever heard about the end of a relationship (and there are certainly lots of THOSE to choose from!). Hiatt's recovery from alcoholism provides other high points, such as \\"Have a Little Faith in Me,\\" Stood Up\\" and the transcendent album closer, \\"Learning How to Love You.\\" It's staggering to think how many master songs are on this one album, but that's the buyer's gain. If there were any justice in this world, this album would have been a smash of infinite proportions. What has this album sold in 15 years, maybe 200,000?

You get Galactus, his new herald, cosmic combat, and of course, as any good Marvel mini-series would have, a guest appearance by Spider-Man.

It's a good book if you're into heaven and hell, but we're into trains! Not a book for rail fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"We picked up this book thinking it would be an interesting biography of Sim Webb. Since our sons LOVE trains and the story of Casey Jones, we were all looking forward to reading it.Unfortunately, after a good beginning, and in spite of some excellent artwork, it descends into a bizarre story about the trumpet of Gabriel.It IS a folk tale.

I wish Amazon.com had made the product details clearer in this listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivanhoe is a must-read classic","review":"I am a high school student. I read this book as an assignment and it quickly became one of my favorites. The plot is highly convoluted, which is what i love about it. It is also not just a simple love story. Many people who are older, or chivalry fanatics (aka Star Wars fans), like it. But I am an average person and also a young one, and if you like the classics, you should definitely read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like medieval, youll love this","review":"first of all, for the people who dont like the book because they cant understand it, its too bad because this is the best classic novel ive ever read. once you get past the tough to understand language, its a great book. the best part about it is that it combines real factual people with some fictional things that make an incredibly interesting book to read. but thats just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sir Walter Scott: the master of the historical romance","review":"I'm sort of glad movie producers haven't discovered (and ruined) this great story yet.This book has nearly every genre packed into it: romance, history (highly fictionalized of course), action, humor, social satire, even some poetry.Scott's a great writer whose main concern is to give the reader an enjoyable story. I think he successed admirably. At the same time he slips in some important issues to consider (like family and leadership responsibilites, loyalty, and racism). One of the best things I like in Scott is his ability to give some of the more minor characters an individual flair (check out Wamba son of Witless).I'd recommend the Oxford World's classics edition of the text as it provides many helpful editorial notes as well as an interesting introduction, bibliography, and chonology for Scott."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivanho was a great fighter and killed many men.","review":"The Normans attacked England and fought the Saxons who fought hard but were defeated.Their was a tournament and a unknown knight came and deafeated everyone.Later he was discoverd as Ivanho.Then he was captured and a friend rescued him. He fought a man who had captured a girl he loved. They got married and had a happy life."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH DETAIL","review":"I think that detail is a very important writing tool in any novel. On the other there comes a point to which one can say, \\"zzzzz\\". This book is nothing but detail. Who wants to read a book that goes on and on about something that has little to do with the point of the novel. I dont get bored easily, but this book is total z's. I think it would have been a lot better if some of the detail was cut down to just a paragraph not 3 chapters.(sarcastic remark)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pointless!!!","review":"If your looking for an exciting spine tingling medevil story, this is the book to read.

Very funny is the dialogue between Wamba and Gurth, when they talk about the words \\"swine\\" and \\"pork.\\" \\"Why, how call you the those grunting brutes running about on their four legs?\\" (Swine, in Saxon) \\"... but how call you the sow when she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung up by the heels, like a traitor?\\" (Pork, in Norman-French). \\"And so, when the brute lives, and is in the charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a Norman, and is called pork, when she is carried to the Castle-hall to feast among the nobles.\\"I recommend this book, together with Robin Hood, both edited by Wordsworth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow read, yet interesting","review":"Ivanhoe is a action/romance that takes place in the 12th century. It is a story of honor, chivalry, and love. I enjoyed it, but had a few complaints. First, I found it to be a little too long. Second, I thought the author, though poetic, was too discriptive. Third, It was written in old English, and I found myself re-reading some statements too understand what the author was saying. Now that I have criticized this book, I thought I would say what I enjoyed about it.1. It was full of action and suspense. 2. It had many interesting and fun characters. 3. The author was clever in how he presented the plot One final thing. I was a little suprised at the response of some younger readers. As a 13 year old, I admit I was forced into reading this for school, but now I am glad that I did. I would encourage others to give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knights of Templer","review":"I enjoyed this adventure yarn on many levels.I was glad to learn about the Knights of Templer and that they were crusaders. I always wondered how Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon knew that and it is because of this classic.I was surprised that it talked so much about Robin of Lockesley. The story of Ivanhoe seemed to be the same only told by Ivanhoe's friends and not Robin's.I thought that the DeBracyn and the Knight of Templer Brian de Bois Guilbert were pretty evil guys which made the story interesting. They were weasels when they had their backs to the wall but did preform with honor when required like when Richard gets DeBracy.I guess I did not understand the prejudice of the time because they treated the Jews like dirt and they were so sterotypical. I really thought that the Jewish girl Rebecca was going to end up with Ivanhoe instead of that Saxon Lady Roweana. I guess you have to appreciate the times that they lived in.It was a different look the Richard/Prince John history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest.","review":"I read this book last year in 9th grade and i thought it was the lamest book I ever read.I bought the Cliff Notes and even through them I couldn't understand ANYTHING. The whole novel is in that ancient annoying language that virtually no one can, nor wants to understand. Believe me, if you prefer literature that your brain can actually compute, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"The book has too much description of everything.

The plot is like most of the others, save the people from the evil villain, or in this case King Richard is to be saved. I recommend this book for all Crusading fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Considered a Classic for a Reason","review":"It's one of those books I always knew I should read but wasn't sure I wanted to. Then my commute changed from 5 minutes to 30 and I discovered books on tape. Glorious! This was suprisingly light-hearted, not the dark and dreary trudgery I expected. It is a wonderful story with engaging characters that make you root for them, scorn them and weep for them. The language is truly magical once you get the rhythm and the narrator's voice makes them all come alive. I cannot recommend this enough, a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic historical fiction","review":"The book is set after the Norman invasion of Britain. It revolves around a large number of events such as the usurpation of the throne of Richard the Lion-Heart by his brother, the struggle for Saxon resistance against the Normans, the kidnapping of a beautiful girl from a Jewish family, the knights tournament and the struggle between the hero and a Templar Knight (the main villain of the book). There are castle sieges, tournaments, duels, jousts and the descriptions of obsession, greed and tyranny. A true melting pot of events with heroic characters - a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent post-enlightenment recount of the medieval world","review":"Sir Walter Scott convinced me of his masterful storytelling ability with his Ivanhoe, and I encourage anybody interested in great literature to give this book a shot.

I had toe surgery and the flexible covering made it more comfortable but did rub a bit on the 4th toe area. It improved with time. Not perfect but comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned them","review":"I gave 2 stars because the shoes are cute and I received them quickly. Those are the only positive things I can say about them. I ordered the size that was supposed to fit my feet - the shoes were too short. Had I kept them and worn them, my big toe would have poked a hole in the tips of the shoes - probably sooner rather than later. The knit upper is thin giving the shoes a very cheap look - I could see my skin through the weave. There was absolutely no arch support - none. I've had better arch support in a bedroom slipper. To be fair, I have flat feet; if you have a normal arch - meaning one that does not require orthotics - then this shoe might work for you. I also think that these shoes are overpriced given what appears to be mediocre quality. Suffice it to say, I sent them back almost as quickly as I received them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion & Life","review":"This unique collection contains works you will think were written just for you, as you face certain situations right now with your loved ones, or as you remember scenes, travels and experiences from your past. Each author has her own style and voice, and each has a very special talent.Clear, palpable scenes of nature, passion, and the experiences of life that only time and awareness can teach are carefully & masterfully crafted throughout. You will read these gems over and over again, and share them with others... after you have wiped away tears of emotion, and sat and reflected upon the profound expressions of each author.I highly recommend this book, and it also makes a lovely, thoughtful gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 out of 5","review":"This movie had no suspense, no thrills.

Yes, the battery charges and it works. However, the tiny plastic grooves that separate the individual metal contacts are about 50% thicker than those of the original Sony battery. As a result, when I slid this knockoff battery into my Sony camera, the plastic grooves \\"gripped\\" the contacts inside the camera, and the battery would NOT pop back out. I even tried tapping the camera against a hard surface, but it wouldn't come out. I found a slender tool to pry the battery out.

Whatever it was, it was not what the title asserted. Thin and vaccous, the history is not grappled with. The reader is left with the feeling that the author pulled back from his subject matter.Everything is big in Texas, especially our tall tales. Whopper telling is a prideful art form. No where is it practiced to perfection better than in the telling of how this great state came to be.

I can listen to Satriani anytime, each album is unique and exciting.

After a single listening, I have to say this is his best work to date.

He also knows more about music theory than I will ever in my lifetime. But there comes a point when the knowledge hinders usefulness. Yes, he is playing like a spider on crack, yes, he's using unique scales and patterns, but it all sounds so useless! I'd rather hear him sweep for 30 minutes and sit there and marvel than here a bunch of guitar synth noise backed by other tracks that make the whole thing chaotic. Steve Vai did a lot of the guitar work for the movie Crossroads. That's the type of music I wanna hear from him.

The problem with this \\"wanna be warm and fuzzy book\\" is the authors ever present droning on about himself, (his self-glorification at being the best butler ever put on this earth made me tear up in angst). Rene Delorm is annoying at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana & Dodi: A Lust Story","review":"A supremely sycophantic book \\"written\\" by Dodi's boy Friday (butler, valet, masseure, personal trainer, gofer...). All the perfumed prose cannot hide the skeleton of the story: two people who'd seen each other for about six weeks, dated seriously for about four of those, and were united in their stuffed animals and living well off of other people's money. No mention is made of Dodi's fiance, who was stashed on a nearby yacht during the first two weeks of D&D's six week \\"love\\" affair. This is definitely the Fayed public version of what happened between mid July and August 31, 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana and Dodi A Love Story","review":"This book was very warm, discreet and also revealing of a mgical romance. Anyone that loves Diana will be extremely happy with this book.In this book you can feel that Diana is being a real person- happy, smiling, laughing, eating, and falling in love, relaxing- an image she never got by hundreds of people- it is sad that her life was cut so short. She was a lovely, gracious woman who left way to early in life. Her time with Dodi- was to start a lifetime of romance that was ever so sweet. that was cut very short too.Now we will never know if they were to ever marry or not.I am a greatful of Rene for sharing his memories with the world of Diana- allowing people to see and to hear about her romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Butler didn't tell it.","review":"For someone who supposedly knew Dodi well, and spent time with Dodi and Diana during their romance, the author tells very little about their romance, beyond just some general comments about how happy they seemed to be together. Much of this story could be found in more detail in the tabloid newspapers. This book was probably written only to make Dodi's father Mohammed Al Fayed happy about this fairytale romance. No mention about Dodi's supposed engagement to marry Kelly Fisher at the time he was romancing Diana. Hardly to be expected to be the source for the truth about Dodi and Diana."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too \\"nice\\"","review":"I bought this book hoping to learn a bit about the romance watched around the world, scrutinized particularly because of its tragic end. I thought with Rene being the butler, it would be very informative. I found myself with each turn of the page being annoyed at how \\"perfect\\" he seems to find himself. Example is the following couple of sentences:\\"As I left, I had conflicting feelings. On the one hand, I was glad to help ease any worriess the princess might have had about Dodi...On the other hand, I felt uncomfortable speaking behind his back. But if I didn't tell the princess the truth about what a fine person he was, who would? ...In this one instance, I felt sure that he wouldn't mind my personal revelations about him.\\" (page 135)And yet he goes on to write this book. Unbelievable.Don't bother if you haven't already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dopey!!!!","review":"I should have known better! Sort of like the James Hewitt tell-all, from the butler's view. Obviously a big way to cash in. The glamour of it all- who wouldn't fall in love with all that. I'd be curious if Diana or the bitler would have the same feelings if all that money wasn't involved. I'll tell you one thing- the rich aren't like you and me- and I'm glad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dated with no real value","review":"This book is so dated as to be of little use to anyone interested in the subject. At best its a good retrospective on the situation leading up to the US invasion of Iraq.

It is inconceivable to me that this program was rated highly by PC World. Each time I boot up my computer, it takes forever to load, and it prevents me from doing anything until it has finally finished whatever it is doing. After the program eventually loads, it causes a terrific slowdown in my computer, and the scans frequently result in lockups. I've turned off the anti virus protection in the program and otherwise adjusted the settings, but nothing seems to help. I recently downloaded the newer version of the program, hoping that the 2007 version would run more smoothly, but it was no better. Today, I finally gave up and uninstalled the program, and everything is back to normal. If you are thinking about this program, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plugged up","review":"This product did locate spyware, but I can get better results with Ad-Aware.

Ad-Aware is FREE and works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average anti-spyware program","review":"I've had this program for a year and found it to be kind of annoying. It started with the blocking of what seemed like every website I visited from CNN to the NY Times. Eventually I just turned that feature off. I also found the software to be a serious resource hog. I found it to be just as good at trying to find spyware as Ad-Aware and Spybot but those programs are free. Plus Spybot and Windows Defender offer real time protection and don't use as much resources as Spyware Doctor. Eventually I just let the subscription lapse. By the way, don't even think about installing this program on more than one machine. I installed it on my computer and when I installed it on my laptop it bounced the subscription from my computer. With the quality and free anti-spyware software that is available, I can't really recommend this software especially if you have two machines at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T EXPECT SUPPORT!","review":"SIMPLY PUT, THE PROGRAM WILL CAUSE GLITCHES IN YOUR SYSTEM AND SLOW YOUR P.C.

The idea is that a winning trade is not likely to move very far against you. A losing trade is likely not to move very far in your favor. Therefore, one can uses these ideas to construct proper risk management and tweak their methods. I did find the book to be a bit wordy, often taking several chapters to explain a few points that could be summarized in two lines. There is also an interesting chapter about using options to hedge your position, rather than relying on stops. I give this book a strong 3 or a weak 4.

It delves heavily into the world of economic theory and policy, which may seem daunting to the layman. This is not a fun read. It quotes facts, statistic and theorizes in such a manner that everything must be absorbed before continuing. Yet it is a masterpiece in analyzing the workings of the Hungarian socialist system and why it ended. It examines the key difficulties in establishing workable socialism and follows the various reforms and 5-year plans that marked Hungarian Communist history. The book does not deal with historical events directly, but rather with the economic decisions that defined the direction the country took.

This was the album which made Elis famous. It is composed by a neat repertoire of socially commited sambas performed under the clear spell of jazz, but very differently from the bossa nova recordings of that time: this is much more passionate and African-sounding. Elis is just great in this album: her singing is powerful, full of energy and so cheerful.

First of all, he has no problem killing anyone. So don't go by the synopsis that was written by someone who obviously didn't watch the film. Second, the movie is mostly silent, so there's no dialog that helps you follow the story. However, you soon realize dialog isn't needed because the film never provides a real story line or plot. For example, he flashes back to events from his past but no details or even background are shared. The flashbacks could have been left out of the film and we'd never know the difference. This story is definitely not about war or politics. What this movie is really about is survival in extreme cold conditions. Nothing more. So if you're waiting for an explanation of why he killed, what lead him to kill...you'll never get an answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The enemy will love it.","review":"Worst blu-ray I've bought since \\"Cloverfield\\".

It is a self-indulgent, low-budet hack job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the first","review":"Ok, I am convinced sequels can't outdo the originals. This tried to tie the 2 movies together and did an ok job with the plot. But how far can you go with a storyline of 'ghost whom you never see, terrorizes family'. Take that and see what you come up with. I think the Blair Witch Project was scarier. Pretty lame things went on, it seemed rushed, and like it was grasping for something scarier than the original that it couldn't get a hold of. Save your time and skip it cause it sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I loved this movie. I was a huge fan of the first one which I consider a classic. When I heard a sequel had been made I tried not to expect too much, maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed.I won't bother giving a summary of the movie, as alot of the other reviews have done that already. I thought that the supernatural happenings started alot sooner than in the original and happened alot more frequently. I love the way tension is built through the buzzing / rumbling sound which can be heard every time something is going to happen. There were several times where I yelled out loud.I think to enjoy this movie you have to forget about how good the first one is. Don't have fantastically high expectations and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first one","review":"Paranormal Activity 2 ... just as good as the first.

Just watch the original again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My heart is still racing","review":"So I just finished watching Paranormal Activity 2. You usually know when the end is coming, with this one you never do. I found this to be a scary sequel to the very scary Paranormal Activity.

I own well over 700 dvd's and about 100 blu-rays so when friends invited me out to see this movie in theaters I figured why not? I love the horror genre and the trailers made it look plenty creepy.Well I wasted my money. The movie is basicly an hour of nothing happening then small oddities occur followed by about 10 min of weird \\"scary\\" stuff and then its over. The movie is just a bore and its sad because it had potential. I dont really see how anyone could enjoy it. My description above is accurate. 95% of the movie is NOTHING and the last 5% is suppose to be scary but its just not. Right as things start to get where they should be the movie just ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranormal Activity 2","review":"This would have to be without a doubt the worst mvoie that I have ever seen.

I took a first date to Universal to see this movie last night and everyone in the movie theater started yelling saying they wanted their money back at the end. (glad i didnt pick to see this, I wanted to see SAW 3D) This movie could have been a 10 minute short and added to the P.A. extras on the DVD. Its a waste of money and time. When people said they liked it...they didnt see it. I liked the first one but this was crap! Really this was one of the worst movies I had ever seen..EVER And the ending...see the trailer?? Thats the ending..no joke.

A complete and utter snooze fest! I can honestly say the only thing that kept me from dozing off was the intermittent shrieks from the teenaged girls in the audience. Scariest movie ever made? What a knee slapper! The plot of this film was almost non existent since 90% of the entire thing was just afterhour footage of the pool, the bedroom and the dog. Sure there was a startling moment here or there but being startled is completely different from being scared. The only scary part of this entire hogwash of a movie is how this trend of homemade-video-movie hybrid crap will keep rearing it's ugly head in theaters. Trust me, you will have more fun watching Al Gore's \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip to the Last 30 Minutes","review":"I enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity but this movie is just a cash grab by filmmakers.

If u like scary movies like I do...then dont waste ur time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money and skip this one","review":"As a die-hard Sci Fi fan I was anxious to see this movie. I suffered through it in the theater, waiting for my date to admit it was a waste of money so we could leave early. It was not to be, I suffered through the whole boring film. It has no redeeming value. Acting is bland, story is weak, special effects are minimal, nice dog and a good size kitchen for those into real estate. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's scarier than something? How about anything","review":"The first Paranormal Activity won points as much for its originality as for how scary it was. Sadly PA2 is neither very scary nor very original. The film has all the same things that scared us in the first one and as usual everything occurs off camera so we don't see much that is very scary. I laugh at these people who let their video cameras do all the talking and don't consult with anyone who may know more about the issue.I would tell people to avoid this movie because it is very dull and not very scary. Watch The Exorcist if you want to see a really scary movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the bext comedies of the year...","review":"I haven't laughed this hard since the Hangover. The producers wasted an opportunity to make a decent movie by wasting the first 55 minutes and then making the rest so laughable I couldn't take it seriously.If you DO choose to see this, skip the 56 minute mark and enjoy the laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money......","review":"This film was so dull I scanned a good deal of it on fast forward. I think the characters only seemed scared because the actors knew what this movie would do to their careers.The only reason it got 2 stars is because I have seen a few FIMBY's (Filmed In My Back Yard) & Italian films that were worse. It wasn't bad in that regard as that was the intentional style and was not done poorly, but not much happened and there wasn't an actual plot. The whole story could have been a 1/2 hr show on TV and would have been better.I love horror movies, but this wasn't scary or intriguing in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the Same","review":"Paranormal Activity benefits from a slightly larger budget, but suffers from not being as unique as the first. The story is a prequel and sequel, it wraps around the original story and adds more layers to it. It is good and has some decent scares. If you loved the first movie, then I think this is a must for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"At some point don't you call 911?","review":"With a much bigger (if still small by Hollywood standards) budget than the brilliant original, this upstart does it again. We discover that this is really a prequel that sets the stage for the who, why and when all this ghostly stuff occurs. We move beyond the young couple in \\"1\\" and here see a complete family unit. A father on his second marriage - with a teenage daughter in tow - his new wife and their newborn son. After strange sounds and events begin the couple installs strategically placed cameras throughout the house. This of course is how we see all the spooky stuff...but not any physical beings...until the end. Plenty of gotchas of course, but genuinely creepy. Stillllllll! At some point don't you call 911?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"I think this was much better than the first movie. It was a lot scarier and I liked the story line better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"Funny scene where they are supposingly looking on a laptop for information, yet it's not even on.I think the reason why many people don't find this one as scary is because they know it isnt real. There was so much hype and speculation about the first, it really bummed people out when they found out the truth. Still not as many \\"events\\" going on as in the first. The first was much better. Still a unique new way to bring \\"horror\\" to the screen.Side note. I want that house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Like watching paint dry. Super low budget, boring. Off camera noise and moving furniture is not scary. Costs only 5 million to make, and I swear that seems high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Really rather boring. The first PA held my interest and I found the mysterious tone captivating. Not so this one. Yawn. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever paid to see. The plot (or lack there of) is terrible. Absolutly nothing paranormal happens in the first hour of the movie. The scariest thing about this movie is the fact that I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching it. Do yourself a favor and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of trash movie, absolutely no scares at all","review":"You might as well sit down and watch a security cam monitor for 91 minutes.

Had to be for ME the dumbest unscarest movie I have ever seen"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay but","review":"This movie isn't real. It's actually done in a Hollywood set and uses \\"footage\\" to convince people that this is actual footage. In the credits at the end of the movie it clearly says that this isn't a good movie.If this movie had actual footage, then sure it would shock me like it's shocking a lot of people. But now that I know it's fake, the whole point of this movie is pretty much destroyed. There's really no point in watching it unless you want to pretend this is actually happening.If you want fantasy scary movies, there's a lot better titles out there that are scarier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great movie to add to my series of horror movies, I kept looking for Paranormal 2 in stores and I couldn't find it anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged DVD","review":"The DVD came damaged. There was damage to the cover and the paper had several holes in the front. Furthermore, the product itself had damage. The DVD did not play properly - there were lines moving across the screen the entire time. I could not even watch the movie. I've never ordered a DVD online before this, and I am extremely discouraged from purchasing anything else with Amazon let alone another DVD. I am a frequent customer on this site and I normally speak volumes of your customer service and product quality, however this is seriously disappointing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooooo","review":"the movie was not worth 4 dollars, nor was it worth the wait. the movie looks cheap, and confuses you. its not till the end that you kinda understand what happens. i dont see how so many people liked this movie. it sucked. there was only one good part which lasted about 4 to 5 minutes our of a hour and a half. it could have been made better. but it was lame... thumbs down from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranormal Sleepathon","review":"The first Paranormal Activity had an interesting plot by just focusing on two main characters. The sequel reuses that formula and is put with another family. The viewer knows what to expect from this film and is hard to replicate the scares and fright from the original. The more Paranormal Activity films that come out will eventually get tired like the Saw films. Paranormal Activity 2 is worth a rental, but definitly not a DVD buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Compare","review":"The first one was waaay better.

And while it held my interest, it didn't exactly put me on edge or rattle my nerves the way it was hyped up to be. The second go round with PA2 actually did! Be warned the first 45 minutes is rather slow, but once the daughter Ali is left home alone things really start to heat up and become downright scary. I almost turned it off near the end when Kristi's husband goes into the basement but fought my urge and kept it on. This is really an awesome exercise in high tension so I decided to write a brief review. I consider it better than the first and that is a rarity. Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.........................","review":"The first one was fairly scary, but this one was pathetic. Not scary and took FOREVER to get anywhere.

She will bounce on it all day, pretending to be a princess riding a horse, chased by evil-doers - sometimes it's a lama. Great for building imagination through pretend play and indoor exercise when it's too hot or rainy outside. It really seems to help with her balance and coordination.

Two Months!!!!! I read it in two days! This book is a very good maybe even better than good book about the Arab peoples. I am a novice at all this history so I still don't firmly comprehend it all, but this book was a great introduction. I can build on the knowledge I gained in this book and read more indepth books and articles later. I highly recommend this book and it may be more comprehensible if you read it faster. I hardly think you have to do it in two days, but two months??????!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"A disappointment!!! I thought from the title of the book a reference of who are the Arabs and history. The author does not seem to understand that the Arabs existed way before Islam. There were Arab Christians. There were Arab Jews. Instead the author concentrated as the Arabs are Islam & Muslims. That is not true! Islam Conquered the area by the sword and thus Islam spread by the sword and not by love and peace. Anyhow, very disappointed of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and scholarly","review":"Hourani's book is not light reading because of its rich details and incredible depth and breadth. In it, the history of the Middle East from pre-Islamic times to the present is chronicled - the majority of the book covering the Islamic world.To one previously only briefly familiar with the area, the book was a little overwhelming. The information came fast and furious; fortunately the book was well written and read easily. Much of it deals not with political history, but rather with broader social themes: rural life compared to urban life, the common man compared to the educated elite, women and their role in Islamic society.The only issue I had with this otherwise wonderful book was its lack of explaination of the various legal philosophies. (I am still puzzled between the differences of Hanafi, Maliki and Shaf'i interpretations of shari'a - Islamic law.) The fact that this is such a minor point given the scope of the book is testament to its otherwise fabulous nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview","review":"If you are looking to understand the basic outline of Arabic Muslim history and cultural development, this is the book for you. Hourani begins his history with the birth of Mohammed and brings up to the near-present. Filled with excellent map, photographs, and illustrations, lucid and concise writing, and astute analyses this book serves as a great introduction to Arabic Muslim history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much history here","review":"Hourani provides a great deal of cultural, societal, and economic information; but does not present a time and event based history. The author suggests that his history provides knowledge from the \\"insider's\\" point of view. That may be true; but the view is accompanied with a sense of vertigo - something is not quite right. This is not a useful book for those seeking information about historical events. I recommend Sir John Glubb's \\"A Short History of the Arab Peoples\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic: A Must Read","review":"Albert Hourani's meticulously woven and mellifluously written narrative about the Arab peoples, their history and culture, is a must read for anyone who pretends to be speaking about contemporary issues plaguing the Middle East. A classic like this can only be written by an indigenous Arab who understands the complexity of the issues and has a very clear perception of what underlies modern day ailments. Written with grace, sensitivity and incisive scholarity,this book should be on the bookshelves of every university in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"History without lessons?","review":"I picked this up hoping to learn something about the people and culture(s) so frequently in the news for the past few years. Another reviewer notes that the first portion of the book is more of a history of Islam - I agree, but came away with not-so-new notion that the Arab culture is heavily intertwined with Islam. That said, I invested a lot of time reading this work, but really didn't feel that I was any smarter about the subject than I was 600+ pages earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for acquiring a background of the Middle East","review":"Hourani provides an excellent background of the history, culture and society of the Arab peoples. He succesfully combines these to provide the reader with a formidable picture of the life of of the peoples of the Middle Eastern and Maghrib Region during various periods in history, giving an excellent synopsis of how their history led up to the current events and problems of the region. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in studying this region, its people and its culture, as well as Islam more closely, as well as for those who are interested in understanding present day Arabia better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense","review":"I was loaned this book by a professor of Middle East studies at the university I went too. I wanted to learn about the Middle East, and was told this book was quite good, comprehensive and fairly unbiased. This it was, and extremely boring too. I've read about 30+ books on Middle East history written by various authors, and this was probably the most boring of all of them. The book is quite long; the text is quite dense, and the level of difficulty is not appropriate for anyone who has not gotten a high school diploma. But the book is quite comprehensive, and covers the Arabs both before and after Mohammed. For those who want to learn about Arabia and Arabians, and how they lived before Islam, and how Islam changed them, this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"History living today in the Arab world","review":"his is a very detailed account of the main tribes and leaders and social movements that shaped the foundations of the Middle East as we know it today.

For reviews of similar books, see the resources pages at civilsociety at seedwiki"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview","review":"It took me a while to get through this book as it is quite dense. But it was well worth the effort. It provides an excellent overview of the history of the arab peoples up through the 1980s. There is so much about the culture and about the culture of Islam that makes sense now that I have read the book. I personally got a lot out of it. I loved the fact that when he does touch on religion he is able to give a nice overview of the range of thought within Islam and the Arab peoples on how diverse their approaches really are within the context of the belief system itself. It is also nice, as a Humanist, to see that some of the Humanist and secular thinkers within the Arab and Islamic communities are included in this history. I do recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn more about the history of the Arab peoples in order to better understand our present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thougt it was...","review":"This is the story of Corbett Mack, a \\"Stolen Child\\" (half blood) of the Northern Paiute of the late 1800's.

He became an alcohol and opiate addict, and lead a tragic life that was somewhat typical of Native Americans during that time.Judging the book by it's title I had hoped it was about the life of the Northern Paiute prior to white man's arrival.

Albert Collins was one of the BEST blues guitarists in the world. Any recording which features him is going to be worthwhile. Robert Cray is very good too and has a wonderful voice. Johnny Copeland contributes some nice vocals and guitar licks, but I'm not as familiar with him as I am Albert and Robert. There are only two downsides to this wonderful CD. First, the sound quality isn't as good as it could be. It definitely sounds its age. I know that Alligator is not a huge record label, but it would be nice if they could remaster and rerelease some of their titles such as this one. Second drawback is that the album is too short! It's so good that you don't want it to end. It's not much longer than half an hour. But it is good stuff. If you like guitar-based blues, BUY this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three times as Good!","review":"Man this is one great blues guitar album! It may be listed under Albert Collins, but this is a true collaboration. Robert Cray really shines here and is much bluesier then you will find him on his own albums.

The early chapters give a concise, but thorough definition of all the key Labview programming structures. Chapter 3 on state machines gave ideas on how to greatly expand the capabilities of a state machine by using an event matrix. Later chapters get into some of the mechanics of activeX and .net. It also discusses using object oriented techniques in Labview. Only problems I had were some block diagram pictures were missing some of their lines, and the examples on the attached CD were based on a much older version of Labview.

This is one of my favourite albums of 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening to it...","review":"Well this album is good enough that if you did not know better it could be a 'best of' album of Texas - almost every track is standout, and yet there is sufficient variety that you can have it on loop in the car and you won't get tired of it.It's one of those CD's that make you want to turn it up to get the full wall of sound experience, as well as the detail of sound they manage to get in.Supports repeated listenings, perfect pop music - it's not deep, but it sticks in the head and it's absolutely satisfying...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"My daughter plays violin and we absolutely loved this CD.

I am only few chapters in and it has already answered many of my questions. This book is a treasure of knowledge to both, someone who's learning about the Orthodox church and someone who has been practicing since birth regardless of age. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"Unfortunately, I must agree with most of the reviewers and say that this book has very little to offer. Leland's Aradia book is already widely available by the orignal author. Drew basically offers a reprint of what is already widely available elsewhere, but adds his name to the work. The only difference between the original is that Drew includes his comments, which actually contribute very little to the book as a whole. He does not seem to possess more than a knodding acquaintance with the material, and so his additions seem to serve little usefulness for the reader.The promotional blurbs for this book purports it to be something new, informative, and refreshing for those already familiar with Leland's material. Sadly, the author provides nothing to substantiate the hype for this book. It is instead a lackluster presentation of some rather mediocre musings on the part of the author. As someone interested in Leland's Aradia, I was very disappointed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was really, really, disappointing. There wasn't much to it at all, and certainly nothing new. After reading it I had to wonder why it was presented as \\"Aradia as you've never seen it before!\\" When that is said, isn't it supposed to mean that the reader will receive something new and enlightening? I really hate the \\"bait and switch\\" game.Mostly the author offered small tid bits, in a 101 style, about general Greek and Roman myths that were sort of related to the material. But it doesn't seem like the author had much to really say on his own. So basically, it's really just a reprint of Leland's widely available book with some common bits and pieces tossed in. Nothing here for the collector of Leland's work (unless you don't already have a copy of his Aradia) and nothing here of interest for the folklorist or reader interested in Italian Witchcraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move It Along...","review":"I'd recommend the book...but not from this \\"author.\\" He or she has released other public domain works with a bit of dabbling here and there, and what with the name \\"Raven Starhawk Cunningham,\\" do you really think he or she is out to do much but make money?There are other versions of Aradia already available but, along with Culpeper's and Murray's The God of the Witches, this author is releasing other people's books in what can only be seen as an attempt to cash in.

It is written in a very straightforward and entertaining way and is convincing in its argument that the various structures of poetry actually serve to enhance the poem and not detract from it.Stephen Fry is entertaining and a great teacher in his own right. I am convinced everyone can benefit from this book. He has certainly provided the essential keys to unlock the door for any poetaster to hone his skills and join the ranks of the great poets of the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Stuff","review":"An earnest enough effort but terribly dull. Fry wishes us to revisit schooldays and jot our way through Chaucer, Milton, Shakespeare, i.e. learn the basics, pay our dues. And while it may be true that much poetry, eg Bukowski, is mere chopped-up prose, notes and shopping lists, Fry is unwilling or unable to grapple with grandmaster Pound. There should be more on modernist poetry: TSE and Pound. The Waste Land receives scant coverage. Fry is a fuddy-duddy, amusing from a distance and a bore at close quarters. I wish he would let his hair down and give us some edge and spike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of great writing exercises","review":"Fry cleverly drags out the reading of this book by forcing the reader to take a vow to read all the poems aloud and to do all the exercises in the book. I did well until I came to the next-to-last chapter of the book, a chapter on forms. I admit it: I didn't do any of the exercises on writing pantoums and ballads and haiku. I fully intend to go back and do these at my leisure, but I felt a strong need to go ahead and finish the book.It does count as a book read, right?

I ordered it because I have to use a dryer like this for my hair (I use very big rollers due to very curly hair...it straightens and smooths without frying it) and when I travel, I have to lug it with me. This one would fit in a suitcase. HOWEVER, the vents are only in the top of the dryer, so it feels like it is burning the top of your head, but doesn't dry the sides and bottom portion of hair. Also, this dryer is sooooo loud! I have older bonnet style models that are much quieter.

The bonnet is small beyond comprehension, it would work only if you had a flat head. NOTHING fits under this dryer, it's so shallow.It also tripped my circuit breaker after only 5 minutes on the LOW setting, so I can only assume it's so powerful and yet so poorly designed at the same time that if it had stayed on it would have FRIED the hair on the very top of my head while leaving the rest of my hair wet.I'm just sorry I threw all the packaging out (I got it delivered to my office ad didn't want to carry the big box home) because I would definitely have returned it.This dryer is a total waste of money.

There is a story, but each illustration has the characters saying something in cartoon format that you have to read to get the lesson. I find this comic book style very irritating. I also don't think \\"Annie,\\" the little girl in the story, learns any lesson from disobeying. The book does not clearly show consequences, and just seems pretty abstract in general. My 4 year old doesn't mind reading it, but I don't like it and it hasn't helped him figure out how to obey at all, so it was kind of a bust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age appropriate book","review":"My 6 year old daughter loves these books and has asked me to reread them all the time! I think kids kinda like to see other kids be bad.We discuss what practical situations count as \\"disobeying\\" and if I say, \\"You're disobeying me because I asked you not to do that\\" -- disobey is a trigger word and she realizes.Children should be over 5 at least to understand the concepts. Reading these books to a 2 or 3 year old doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage book of values","review":"I bought this because we borrowed it from the library, lost it and had to replace it. It is a book to teach kids what disobeying is and how to avoid disobeying. I would give it 5 stars, but the tone is decidedly negative overall. I might have written the book on the value of obeying instead of the non-value of disobeying. However, my kids were very interested in having it read to them several times and seem to really take in what is happening to the main character (a little girl named Annie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, not user friend","review":"first off, it looks really nice and professional.Backlights works great in the dark but doesnt illuminate the hotkeys so thats the first flaw i noticed.

Batteries have limited shelf life so the crank charger was the draw. Plus it included the ability to charge phones. Tested the radio OK after purchase and then put it away for the next power failure. Which did not happen until after the radio warranty expired. When we did have a power failure, got out the radio, turned the crank and the internal gear drive jammed and broke after 2 turns. Apparently it can be repaired for about twice what the radio cost. So it's a throw-away having NEVER been used for it's intended purpose.

Nothing like the innovative Battle Angel I know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"increased violence, decreased story content","review":"Yup - this new volume of Battle Angel is more violent than anything, and doesn't really explain all the mechanics of just how Alita came to be in Tiphares, and what is going on.But given that Alita herself only just became conscious of being on Tiphares, of the city itself being strewn into chaos, should the reader really expect all the explanations to come in one volume? The Battle Angel world is unfathomably large and complex, and I think it is appropriate that Mr. Kishiro has held off on these details until Alita & co's arrival in Ketheres in Volume 3.Readers who find this and the second volume a bit lacking in storyline will be duly rewarded for sticking in there at volume 3 - as Mr. Kishiro opens up a whole new universe full of interplanetary politics, class disparity and a bit of political commentary on current day events, if one looks hard enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every car should have this","review":"This is just what every car needs.

This is one of the better ones. The information is current and presented in a logical, interesting style. It focuses mostly on the pre-production and fullfillment aspects of self-publishing which is the information that most beginners need to get started. Marketing is covered in less detail so most people would be better off by purchasing one of the several books that have been written on book marketing, in addition to this book.I haven't found one self-publishing book that really covers everything that you need to know. If you're trying to self publish I'd recommend that you purchase a couple of books on the subject. I'd also suggest that look for ones that have been published within the last several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Concise Truth","review":"Christianity without the fluff or the fuzzy feelings.

Those essential elements and doctrines of Christianity are well spelled out and those wishing yet more clarification or depth can use this book as their important initial step to knowledge.A great book to offer a young believer or to strengthen the nomimal.The Trinity while not deliberately outlined, is evident to anyone who has some background in rationality - if all three persons of the Trinity are equal in all respects and all God, then this Doctrine is well represented with many direct quotes from Scripture.I particularly like that Stott reveals those necessary duties of Christians (not for salvation but part of justification). Too often the Christian is informed that naught but his mental assent is needed. Here Stott delineates those crucial outward elements incumbent upon those that claim a true fellowship with Christ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What gives?","review":"A thread of unconscious doubt runs through this book. Whence do we get \\"intellectual suicide\\" as a non-requirement to consider the deity of Jesus (pg 8)? What compels Stott to say he is not saying something, not saying \\"...we should suspend rational thinking\\" to discover God (pg 16)? Why does Stott raise the specter of doubt while exhorting treatment of the Gospels \\"...as the historical documents they undoubtably are\\" (pg 22)? Stott says Christians are \\"...not a self-regarding coterie of smug and selfish prigs who are interested only in themselves\\" (pg 140). They aren't?An honest treatment of Christianity is not found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for New Believers","review":"\\"Basic Christianity\\" was the very first book (besides the Bible) that I read when I became a Christian. It was recommended to me by a dear friend of mine. What a blessing this book was to me as a new believer!

I would recommend this book to any new believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra Copies","review":"I purchased a stock of 10 copies to give to those whom want (perhaps need) this simple and beautiful expression of our Christian faith.

I've recently reread it for the first time since then. The cogent arguments of the book hold up very well, although the rather formal language that Stott uses may put some readers off. I read the book after also rereading C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity and found that while Lewis's language is easier, Stott's work is actually a bit less dated in substance.The book provides strong arguments for Christ and the resurrection and historic Christianity. It also makes clear what the implications of following Christ are.The book was written for seekers and new Christians--but may also benefit older Christians who want a systematic exposition of the arguements for Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous.","review":"What an amazing read! POLYMORPH is definitely one of the slickest, sexiest books I've read in a long time. There's a lot more here than you'd expect from your typical cybernovel -- Lee is a fascinating, complex, richly-drawn character, and Manhattan's downtown scene is so fully sketched that it almost qualifies for character status itself. Westerfeld is constantly questioning identity and community, and he plays with the reader's preconceptions of sex and sexuality and gender in very real (and disturbing) ways. Plus, it's a great story -- with some of the hottest sex scenes in recent memory. I had a *wonderful* weekend with this book, and recommend it without qualification. Put me down for his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very subversive--but I mean that in a good way.","review":"To be perfectly honest, after reading a couple of chapters of \\"Polymorph\\", I wasn't sure I that was going to enjoy this book, because I intially found the protagonist's life-style so trite and unappealing. As she begins to search for the other polymorph, I became a little more interested, but still wasn't really blown away by it all. That is, until the last two chapters. The way this book ends is so chilling and so subtly subversive that it redeems practically all that has gone on before. I highly recommend it, just for the unexpectedly viscious little twist at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart Lots of graphic sex","review":"I really enjoyed the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld and have been trying to win this book for some time. I FINALLY received it last week. I have to tell you I was very much disappointed. This book had very graphic sex scenes that I did NOT enjoy. I did not get far into this book before abandoning it. I don't mind a little sex but this book was centered around it. I did not get far enough into the story line to figure out why the main character went to clubs every night. She not only had the ability to change her age, her gender, even giving herself noticeable deformities but she could also heal ailments in other people. This book sells for a very high price, which I really don't understand. It's just a basic paperback. Maybe because it's Scott Westerfelds' first book. Anyway, if you like a sex book this is the one for you. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Keep an eye on the name Scott Westerfeld. With his debut novel POLYMORPH he has created a believable future in the tradition of science fiction yet kept an almost fanciful undertone.Lee is a shapechanger, a \\"polymorph\\" who can change her shape and gender at will. She thinks she's the only one until she discovers that the guy she met a a bar is also a polymorph. Not only that, but the man Freddie is plotting the absolute control of information technology. And only Lee can stop him. Readers should be aware this book contains implications of homosexual intercourse in more than one instance.POLYMORPH is a stunningly clever novel. I'm eagerly awaiting Westerfeld's second novel FINE PREY, available sometime in 1998.Casey Thomaston"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Collection of Spooky Series","review":"Nice hefty collection of classic old spooky TV series.

That's the only comparison worthy between these two shows. So often comparisons spring forth between Zone and Step, but they are neither justified, nor accurate.Zone is generally a charachter study of people in the most perplexing of situations that could never take place in the real world.Step is a study of unexplainable events that were documented by the people the events affected, then dramatized by actors.Step was not only enormously entertaining to watch, it was smart in execution. Newland not only hosts, but also directs many episodes. Anyone who is a fan of the genre of the unexplained should definitely take a look at this incredible show.Show rating: 5 stars, DVD transfer: 3 stars, packaging: 2 stars (12 DVD's in regular size Amaray cases in a flimsy posterboard thickness paper box sleeve??!

Very Best of One Step Beyond is solidly on the latter category.

It is a book containing pre-printed designs to be cut out and then assembled into a long thin totem pole. Too advanced for children and not good enough for adults this printing gets one star only. Within the cover are eight pages of designs to be cut out. The pole itself is made up of six individual designs. Unfortunately color continuity is not good so the pole has three different shades of brown over its length. This is not intentional. The worst feature however, is that, though the pole is meant to be glued onto itself in order to end up with a length of almost four feet, the units are not the same size and therefore do not fit each other! There are also support and strength discs that are intended to be glued within the majority of tubes. These are printed larger than the inside of the tubes where they are meant to fit.

He's also careful to warn you about the things you can't know, such as the difference between reading what was said, and seeing it yourself.The big flaw in this book is the lack of sources.

Perhaps the single most remarkable thing about the film is that no where in it does Garland's performance hint that she was in the midst of a nervous breakdown (she was) or that Kelly loathed the project from start to finish (he did, and didn't mind saying so in later years.)

Garland's spectacular number \\"Get Happy\\" blows the mind and reminds us that this is how we want to remember her and her career, and not her heartaches. Knowing that 1950 is a difficult point in Garland's life and career, watching Kelly handle her with loving care in this film is a delight to watch. His dance numbers are fantastic, as usual; and as always, he has his Kelly charm. Kelly's incomparable dancing and Garland's incomparable singing are what hold this film together.

Thank you, Mr. Woodall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozart's Wife","review":"This book really didn't keep me interested and I didn't finish reading it. It started out very slowly and depicted Mozart in a very negative way."},{"rating":"1","title":"romance novel masquerading as an historical novel","review":"This book was very disappointing. I expected an historical novel. This book was nothing more than a romance novel. The setting may have been in Mozart's time and general area but there was nothing in the book that really made you feel you were in that time and place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written fairytale","review":"The author would do well to take an English grammar class as well as hire an editor prior to attempting any more nonsense like this book. She consistently misuses and abuses the English language. Using\\"confident\\" as \\"confidante\\" is a typical example. She also frequently uses the possessive \\"'s\\" when she means to use the plural form of a word.The book jumps back and forth in time and is very disjointed.Instead of a historical novel, this is nothing more than a tale of romantic interludes. The main character comes across as a whining witch concerned about money (or rather the lack of)and her next sexual encounter. If you want to know more about Mozart's \\"magic fingers\\", go for it. When I finished the book, I wondered why I bothered...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great diversion","review":"Being a big fan of historical romances and classical music, I was pleased to see this available on the Kindle. I found myself reading it at every possible moment and admit to several late nights reading. Mozart's personality seems to come through completely and historical detail that I wasn't aware of was presented in such as way that I thought to myself \\"Wow...I didn't know that!\\" A nice surprise.I enjoyed this book a great deal. I would definitely recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozart's Wife","review":"Wonderful story. Well thought out and well researched. Great character development.

It could have been written in one half the number of pages. It gives an insight into a woman's life in that period of time. Difficult to say the least. Being a wife to the genius,Mozart, was a challenge. The pain of so many pregnancies and loss of children is heartbreaking. The ups and downs of Mozart's career and personal life were brought to attention by this book. Like so many artists, his was a sad life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggled","review":"I don't give up easily, but after struggling to finish this book, I wish I had. I stayed with it hoping Mozart's wife would develop into a character with whom I could sympathize, but she did not. Such a selfish, self-centered, weak-charactered protagonist was, for me, impossible to like.I honestly don't know how this got so many good reviews; just personal preference, I guess. As a reader who enjoys historical fiction, this was such a disappointment. This should be classified as a romance novel, which I don't care for. Actually, might more aptly be titled \\"Mozart's Wife's Chest\\", because \\"the twins\\" seemed to be the star of the novel; evidently no man in the known world was able to resist them, and reference to them are so continuous it gets to be a joke. Especially odd when this is in first-person narrative.I have, however, gained a new appreciation for Mozart. If this was truly a portrait of his wife, then bless his heart, no wonder he was loopy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"Sigh , this is FICTION and imaginative writing with deplorable execution. The only thing remotely historical is that constanze did indeed have 6 children 4 whom died but not the way the author tells it. It's a vulgar porn of brutishness that the author probably thought she'd get a movie contract for. Seriously, Constanze wasn't that well endowed in the breast department, obviously she's never seen the daguerreotypes or paintings. I read it just to see how she would have Mozart's death... and of course even that was trashed with the gossip of Hofdemel. UCK. That's all a have to say about this stupid erotica piece that guises as a historical novel... pure nonsense with deplorable writing and grammatical errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"I always enjoy historical fiction and thought this might be interesting. Parts of the book were, others were just \\"fluff\\" and didn't have any relevance that I could see. I nearly quit reading the book a couple times, but stuck with it to the end. The book did give a pretty clear picture of life in those times, which was interesting, but I kept getting annoyed at the \\"fluff\\" that would appear, i.e., the conversation between two women in the \\"privey\\" and what sort of magazines they might use to finish their business....had no bearing on the story line and seemed like something the writer just added for filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck :(","review":"This book had a couple of facts in it, Mozart did indeed court Constanze's sister before he married her, but is nothing more than poorly written stupid soft-core porn.

I was truly intrigued with the hard life of \\"Mozart's Wife.\\" Between Mozart's many escapades of drinking, partying, and his many affairs, \\"Mozart's Wife\\" had much to endure. Although she was not totally innocent in her discretioins either. I have seen the movie \\"Amadeus\\" which showed Mozarts life as a composer, it was good to read his wife's side of their life. It was a true love story that was filled with caring,compassion and heartache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous, Haunting Prose","review":"I was blown away by this novel because it truly is excellent. Waldron's prose is gorgeous all the way through, capturing the reader because of its reality and passion and lyrical quality in a way that enhances the scope of the story, based on history. To travel along throughout Constanze's life as she deals with the difficulty of being married to a genius like Mozart is a real treat. I've always felt history should be compelling and fascinating, and it can be. Waldron just proved it with this excellent book. It's easy to see why it won the Independent E-Book Awards when it was first an e-book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"There is a reason why this woman was named songwriter of the year! 80'S Ladies.. even if im not her age, i can totally relate to that song..

I have to help her build it. It takes about 30 to 60 minutes to put a big run together. The instructions are only a photograph, no words. These instructions just show ideas of what you can do because you really can build any configuration you want to. I can't imagine the run without the elevator as it keeps the marbles in continuous motion, which becomes mesmerizing. The pieces fit together well. When constructed it is a little shaky and not as sturdy as I thought it would be so I would not recommend it for kids under 4 (small parts, too). Also, I thought 180 pieces would be a lot, but it's not. It might be fun to get another set and build on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This toy is flimsy at best, the instructions are just example pictures and are not good if you want to know specifically which side goes on what side. So it is only when you run the marbles you'll learn if the \\"planks\\" are on the wrong side. If they are then you have to partly disassemble to get it corrected. The marbles are smaller than regular marbles so if you lose any you cannot use just any ol' marble (won't fit thru openings). The motor/elevator was broken when we got it (new) but my husband spent time splicing the wires until it worked. I think the magnetic marble run that I've seen in stores are better, the K\\"Nex run is good, too. This toy was just a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much trouble to put together- NO INSTRUCTIONS!","review":"My son got this for his 6th birthday and it looked like it would be so much fun. But not so, it took so much time to put these little (2\\") sections of tubes together to form any kind of simple structure that all the fun was lost. We got the motor working and the elevator that carried the marble up worked fine, that was the highlight of the toy. But, we simply did not find that building a connecting structure like in the picture was remotely possible without a lot of patience and trial and error. The worst of it was that it DID NOT COME WITH ANY INSTRUCTIONS!! We returned it to Amazon.com after two attempts to have fun with it. My son played with a similar toy at his after school center, but the tubes were in longer sections and they were super easy to snap together so he and others could create elaborate connections for the marbles to run on, if I can find that kind, I would buy it. I do not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but too flimsy for my taste.","review":"I wanted to like this, and bought it based on reviews here on Amazon. For the most part, this toy is okay. However, the elevator does not work that well. The problem I am having is that the small forks on the conveyor chain constantly hang up both at the ball pick up point and drop off point. The clearances around the forks are quite small but the \\"slop\\" in the chain and other structural pieces make alignment difficult, at least in our set. I have managed to greatly enhance operation by filing down the problem areas, but this is not what I expect from a toy costing this much. I also agree with an earlier reviewer that it is unfortunate that standard, larger marbles will not work in this toy.Having said all that, I must admit that our son really enjoys this set a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motor is well worth the extra money","review":"This thing is just neat.

Building is intuitive and really enjoyable. I highly recommend this marble run."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun for mother and son!","review":"I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas. He really loves it! He's played with the basic Marble Run but I saw this one had an elevator and I'm glad I chose it. He plays with this for a long time each time. However, we opened it 24 hours ago and already the 2 AA batteries are getting weak. This toy comes with 4 examples of how you can put it together. My 6-month old son likes watching the marbles go around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one!!","review":"This was such a disappointment on Christmas morning. It was such a pain to put together and it does not come with any instructions. Once it was finally together, my boys barely bump it and it falls apart. The elevator falls apart every 2 seconds and we can't seem to figure it out. This is going back as a return asap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Terrible","review":"We've had it for two days, and we've already put it in storage. First of all, it's supposed to be something that your kids can put together themselves, but it requires the help of an adult because it's too complicated. It requires more simplistic instructions for a kid to follow. We didn't have enough parts to match the pictures that they give you. The structures that they display weren't foundationally sound. The pieces are cheap and flimsy. The chain links are too flimsy. The marbles don't catch all of the time. It brought out a lot of frustration on Christmas Day for our 6yo twins who couldn't figure out how to build it. They have had great success with other marble run sets, but this one by Quercetti was a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of swearing","review":"wow, the language this thing brought out!

The marbles would get stuck trying to go around the curves.We took it back. Disappointing toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No and NO! Absolutely horrible","review":"First, who would make a MARBLE run that does NOT take \\"standard sized\\" marbles?? Ridiculous. Second, within 3 seconds, one of the pieces snapped.. hard plastic, snapped, done.This item is just pathetic, and annoying. It's going back tomorrow, and I have a heartbroken 4 year old who is wondering why Santa would bring him something so awful.We have the transparent marble run, the one with nearly 5 stars, and it's fantastic.. simple, uses REAL marbles, and doesn't break or annoy anyone. We wanted this cool one to be a little more \\"advanced\\" with our marble fun.DONT GET IT. You'll be kicking yourself if you do. Seriously.. I can't believe how bad it is.I'll order another one of the \\"transparent\\" sets and just let the kids build higher and further.So disappointed in this.

My grandson was very disappointed because he wanted a elevator. When he first saw it he was excited but while helping him to put it together I very quick;y realized that it does not do what it says and he lost interest real fast. That was a hard earned wasted $50. The only reason I didn't return it was because I had thrown away my paperwork because I was sure he was going to enjoy it. Wow was I wrong!!! So I had to go out and purchase another birthday gift. I am highly upset and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy design.

This is not worth the time or the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish Amazon gave more detailed description","review":"We had previously purchased the Quercetti 80 piece marble run and had a lot of fun with it. Want to build more complicated runs we got the 180 piece with the motorized elevator. We thought with 180 pieces we could build much larger marble runs, boy where we disappointed... As soon as I got the package from Amazon and read the outside of the box I felt duped in the count of 180 pieces counts each link in the chain to make up the elevator , by the time you count all the parts to complete the elevator the marble run isn't much if any bigger than the 80 piece, it just has an elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"falls apart easily, very cheap","review":"The idea for this toy is great but the implementation not so good. The chain that you put together that pulls the elevator is the worst because you snap all of the links together only to discover that they give you too many links for it to fit snugly around the gears. Then, when you pull it apart to take out some pieces, the plastic stretches and the chain perpetually breaks. The plastic is so lightweight and the assembly to flimsy that it breaks again and again. If continuous fixing is your child's idea of fun, or your idea of an \\"educational toy,\\" then maybe this is for your family, but for my kids it was frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"prepare in advance","review":"Our son (3.5) is obsessed with marble machines and loves this motorized kit. We spent about 1 hour putting the chain links and elevator together before we wrapped the present... I would highly recommend this. This set can be frustrating, as others have mentioned here, because it can be a bit fragile and particular about how it goes together. We also have another Quercetti set (224 pieces) but the elevator was still a challenge. Our motor seemed to turn the wrong way--the opposite way as the arrow shows--manufacturing defect? Since the motor does not seem to be reversible, we had to get creative in attaching the motor to the green gear instead of the purple one so that the elevator chain would run in the correct direction. Anyway, we were super glad to have spent an hour by ourselves puzzling over this problem rather than trying to solve it on Christmas morning, with an anxious and rambunctious preschooler climbing all over us at the same time. That would have been a frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great.

The first time I did not realize what had happened. You may have seen images on the internet ... that is what I went though with my leg.The second time it happened, I saw the little monster, and immediately slapped a glob of PRID on the bite and covered it with a band-aid.

In comparison to the original release, the Chic Mix sounds more playful, especially in regard to the instruments. One might say some songs are a little more funky or they have more of a dancing quality to them. Chic's \\"Friend To Friend\\" has a soulful feel. I appreciate and am thankful for both versions of the eight songs.The second CD contains some songs which I and probably many others have never heard before now. It's a chance to hear a different take on Diana Ross."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOST BUT NOW FOUND!","review":"When this album was released in 1980, I remember hearing that Motown remixed the tracks over the objections of producers Bernard Edwards and Nile Rogers. I loved the album but always wondered what the original sounded like. Now we know: fantastic! The original \\"Chic\\" mix of these songs are more spontaneous and less polished. And Diana sounds great -- literally unrehearsed.

VERY poor design in my opinion, there should have been some type of reinforcement to allow the pressure of the backside of the screw to actually hold the grip to the gun frame. I have not shot it yet, but my fear is the grip will come loose and actually come off the gun.

Much of the book seems a criticism of those that are not blind as well as the depictions of the blind by those who are not blind, namely authors and Hollywood directors. I can think of a much better topic for a book than nit-picking at random quotes in movies, books, and social groups. Kleege seems to only show the ability for a blind person to criticize those who are not blind and may not completely understand what blindness is. Although I have taken many courses that focus intensely on accepting those with disablilities in society, I find it very difficult to accept severe cynicism no matter what disability the author may have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Silly Silly","review":"The Misadventures of Tim McPick is a time piece. It was written in 1975, when radical was chic and homophobia was rampant everywhere. As a time capsule, this book is interesting.However, it is also one of the silliest books I've ever read. It may be called a comedy, but this is insulting the word comedy.

Novick could not decide whether he was writing for the mass market or other law professionals. He evidently gathered abundant research materials, arranged them chronologically, and tried to organize them into coherent chapters. Novick's discomfort in dealing with Holmes' private life results in a rather stilted account of the pivotal events in his life. Novick did not even attempt to connect these events to his works before and after he sat on the Massachusetts bench. Furthermore, no insight whatsoever enlightens our understanding of Holmes' thoughts at the time he rendered his most important judicial decisions.

My only issue is how repetitive he gets on particular statements. This book is well worth the money and the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars","review":"This book blew a lot of smoke and was full of contradictions. The author claims homosexuality is not comparable to slaves and womens rights because it is a moral issue and is transcultural. He also says homosexuality is not a cultural issue. Was it not a cultural issue in Ancient Greece and Rome? The Greeks have three representations of sexuality in their culture to represent gays, lesbians, and heterosexuals. How can u be gay and that be outside of culture? This book did nothing more than make me think Mr. Webb is part of an agenda propagating prejudice and homophobia towards an already broken and hurting people group. This prejudice is eating at the soul if The Church. The Church must not go on like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't keep his horse in the furrow","review":"Webb has some gold that he mined out... with the redemptive movement thought. However, the book was left wanting. He sets uo the \\"rules\\" by which scripture is examined and lo and behold when he goes to scripture he find things that make his point. When scripture conflicts with where he is going then it is merely background noise... not something significant.He goes to the Bible and finds it to say exactly what he desires it to say rather than letting the living scripture speak. It was a massive struggle to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good things, but seriously flawed","review":"Without going into too much detail, the main problem with this book is that it fails to recognize that in the ancient world women and slaves were part of everyone's everyday life - and that homosexuality, as we understand it today, was totally unknown. For the author to say that the Bible's attitude towards women and slaves can undergo a change but not towards homosexuality is to place his whole thesis on a false footing. When the Bible says: \\"This is wrong\\" we have to be sure what 'THIS' is!It is entirely unclear what was being condemned in the 5 scriptural texts which are used to prevent gays from having loving, supportive relationships similar to the one for which Dr. Webb thanks his wife in the Acknowledgments pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Man's Opinion, Not Trans-Cultural Ethic","review":"All Mr. Webb has proven is that some prejudices are more deeply intrenched in our protean cultures than others. Prejudices against women and the accepted practice of enslaving people were somewhat quicker (ironic as it is to use that word) to evaporate in the light of truth and human dignity. Every thoughtful Christian I know firmly believes that homophobia will go the same way as slavery and the subjugation of women. Mr. Webb presents no evidence to the contrary. All he does say is that it is his opinion, and the opinion of his circle, which he mistakenly takes for universal truth.On the other side of the debate, John McNeill, John Boswell, Fr. Daniel Helminiak, Robin Scoggs, and many more deeply spiritually wise writers have far stronger arguments than Mr. Webb's.This is all unfortunate because in other respects he is more or less a logical thinker and an exemplary writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"There is not a \\"no-limit\\" option, the \\"tutorial\\" constitutes them telling you what they think you should do (no explanation as to why... difficult to learn from).

No.Also, these are not ALL Kurt's entries or writings, they've been editied, so can you trust them?As a Nirvana fan, and a Kurt fan, I don't think it's right to read this, especially as theyre published by Courteney Love, (indirectly) and I don't tust her, her involvement with Kurt's death, or her involvement with the infamous note at all.So make your own choice.

The word \\"journal\\" creates an image of pages scribbled with inner thoughts and hidden emotions, but this is more a scrapbook of doodles with few glimpses into what Kurt was thinking. Yeah, it's neat to see his handwritten lyrics to songs, but is that his \\"journal\\"? It would have worked a lot better as a scrapbook with pictures, more of a celebration of Cobain, rather than scanned pages from a few doodle pad. If you're looking for a heavy look into Cobain's head, HEAVIER THAN HEAVEN is a much better purchase.And, naturally, like everyone interested in this book, the nagging question is how could a wife sell out her husband's journals?

I would STRONGLY ADVISE YOU NOT TO GET THIS JOURNAL though. It's his personal stuff that no one else should read. It really can make you feel uncomfortable. People making profit off of Kurts private thoughts is really quite sickening. I would suggest getting the Biography instead.. Much more intertaining, and comfortable read about the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"the unbearable weight of being","review":"i love kurt cobain, and have, in a strictly distanced and reverent way, since i first heard heart-shaped box 6 years ago. i was overwhelmed by the inner conflict of needing to understand him and knowing what a violent intrusion reading this book would be. i was shocked, and in many ways hurt anew, by his humor, talent and humanity. but mostly his pain. no, scratch that, his anguish.read it if you feel you need to. but beware of the consequent nausea that will surface at some later point. the hollow feeling that somebody truly prolific was lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invasion of Piracy","review":"I thought the release of Kurt Cobain's Journals was a sick shot at a quick buck. Everything you can read in these journals is already in his songs. That should be enough. Kurt must be rolling over in his grave right now. Someone as private as he, being exploited to the fullest. Punching a dead man below the belt. How very tacky. I'm glad to see the media is still not afraid to push aside any decency for human beings,dead or alive.

It's a complete invasion of a genius's privacy. Courtney Love had no right to sell her dead husband's journals to the press. They were never meant to be read.

I wouln't want anyone reading mine, so why would I read his.As for the guy who dosen't understand why Cobain was as big as he was, well then he can't understand. His sound is 70's and 80's. He can't possibly understand. Nirvana was a sound for the rock audience that had no star. His views are inconsistent. He reflects his own feelings rather than understanding Cobain's importance. If he dosen't like him why is he reading his personal journals? Nirvana stopped, but Cobain lives in his music.Listen, make up your own decision on whether or not to read this book. However, the best way to understand Cobain is to hear his voice,and listen to his music!Please ignore the first review. He simply is not a fan therefore can only give angst.

It can be a bit repetative at times, but after all, it's a journal. There are also some letters, drawings and comic strips.

Here is Isaac Newton's personal journal (which sold for 14 million). Here is Edgar Allen Poe's personal journal IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING mind you!!!!!!!!!!!Here is Abraham Lincoln's handwriting musing how he loved the act three and...See my point?Yes, Kurt, whored himself unintentionally, but I believe the stories, along with the music, create exactly what he [and we] wanted, and we still want more...Where is Journal #3??"},{"rating":"2","title":"In Love","review":"I love this book!

It tells you everything from his view since it is the journal he wrote. It says everything from his grocery list to his amps to how much it's going to cost to get to a gig. This book is very long and has loads of facts that you probably didn't know about leading up to his death. It's all in his handwriting so it's kind of hard to read some of the stuff which was a downside. I would just sit there for a minute trying to figure out what something said. But all in all there's also some very nice pictures that he drew that you'll be fascinated by. If I was you I would go out and pick this book up today.

The first question I thought to myself was \\"is this any of my business to read this?\\" It sat on my coffee table for a week before I picked it up. Then I figured he published his songs, so personal and dear to him, why the heck not. I read his lyrics, don't I? This book is simple. He didn't plan for it to be published, so while it gives a lot of insight and dissects his songs in a way, don't expect it to tell you every single last thing that he's thinking. Whether you're a fan of Nirvana, or just of Kurt, or you related to that hopeless sort of desperation, I suggest this book to you. It's the grunge scene, from the inside. Maybe it will inspire a little genius within yourself ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"dance upon the grave","review":"While Kurt Cobain certainly had some interesting things to say, I'm appalled that so many fans find this book to be the acceptable way of digesting those things.

Hole herself?To place this work in a design format that reads like a high school journal is a further insult to injury that detracts from a man who shaped a generation.Whatever one thinks of the brilliance, or lack thereof, of Nirvana, I scratch my head in dismay at the popularity of this work. The same lasciviousness that goes into the craving and absorbing of this book was the kind of stuff that added to this guy's downfall.Go ahead and salivate over this creative mind's output while he can do nothing about it.

However, I also appreciate him as a person, or, rather, the person he used to be. He was a private person, and the idea of selling his thoughts makes me cringe. So although I am intrigued by Kurt, I respect him just as much. If you were looking for a review of the book, then I'm not your girl.

I was a bit let down though. I can understand the reason for the series being set up the way it was and a search for the pieces of a person's soul thru many worlds is a good story idea, but... This only works if the series and any additional series have an ending in mind and not just a greedy person looking for a power and manipulating the heroes. The first series isn't all that bad, but it sets of a \\"never ending\\" search idea which I had trouble with. At least a search needs a certain goal. Like, let's say, how many feathers are in her soul, or maybe more about when the search reaches an end. You get some of this but not enough. Plus you don't get enough on the villians either. I generally like the series and the adventures were great enough.

So her semi-boyfriend Syaoran must travel through time & space to recover them.This sends the duo on many battles through time, which kinda reminds me of Dragon Ball Z in that they are trying to retrieve something.

There are not nearly enough accents. The song is bland at best.I picked this song as an example because I have sang many versions of it since 1974.If the maker of this CD chose to change the arrangement and timing, then you should also put a track with vocals as well to show how it sounds.The timing of most of these songs is so out of wack from the originals.

This is an incredible journey of triumph over tragedy, more tragedy and yet more tragedy (most of it attributable to Skeeter's naivety and her desire to please everyone). Skeeter kept an incredibly positive point of view throughout all the adversity her life threw at her, which is astounding considering all that she endured.

Since Taylor has no ability to write critically about Orwell's works he should have focused on the details of Orwell's life which are easier to record.

I'd read 10 pages and still be back at square one. Who really cares about what the stupid African kingpin was doing anyway? It didn't even say if he was involved! In conclusion, Vixen 03 was probably the boringest Pitt novel I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly one of the worst of Cussler's books","review":"The year is 1954, Vixen 03 is bound for the pacific carrying 36 doomsday bombs, canisters really armed with quick-death germs. But the plane crashes into an ice covered lake in colorado. Only to be discovered by Pitt in 1988, and raised. Only to find some of the canisters missing, now where this book really goes south, is that Cussler felt the need to include a war in Africa as well. Personally, I wish that he would have just focused on Pitt and the plane, because the Africa side story detracted from the book, as the other 1 star reviewer said. We would go away from Pitt to focus on the African kingpin for awhile, then come back to Pitt. And literally be back at square one, even the blackmail scheme put on Loren and Pitt was out of place. There was waaaay too much going on this book, unfortunately I can only give it 1 star, even the ending is anticlimatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Cussler's best - fantastic climactic scene","review":"Vixen 03 is among the top 3 Cussler books (Night Probe and Deep Six being the other two, IMHO). Like most of Cussler's earlier works, Vixen 03 concentrates more on entertainment than espousing Cussler's personal political and other views. And entertain it does!There are some segments dealing with an apartheid-era South African rebel organization that do drag a bit. However, they are key to explaining the motivations of several of the main characters. Slog through those slower parts, the payoff is worth it!The climactic final scene is vintage Cussler. It is a set-piece action sequence worthy of James Bond or Indiana Jones. You know how it's going to turn out, but it doesn't matter. Cussler's now-forgotten ability to pull all the elements of the story together in an impossible-to-forget, riveting climax is never better showcased than here.I loved this book when I first read it 20 years ago, and it remains a favorite to this day. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The dullest of the Dirk Pitt novels.","review":"Having read most of the Dirk Pitt Novels to date, I have to say that Vixen 03 was the least enthralling.Maybe because it is the most plausible or perhaps most mundane of Cussler's Pitt scenarios, It reads almost like a typical young adult novel of low caliber action."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Good!!","review":"It was a great book, lots of mystery and it keeps you on the edge the whole time.

However, when I got it and opened the box, the.. Whole face in general... was entirely inaccurate in anatomy. The eyes were WAY too large, causing it to look.. Well, ugly. The snout doesn't have the small, slender shape of a fox, but more of an angular slant from the head and then a big hard nose that brings even more attention to it. I found that one of the hind legs was a bit longer than the other, and way too under-stuffed.Besides all of this, the fur is very silky and nice, and this is about the only fox plushie I've found with black tips (ears and paws) which is about the only reason I didn't send it back. In all, I really hate it, and do not recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"This darling little fox will be the perfect gift decoration for a baby shower package (although it's not meant for the baby).

To be polite, I would say she could use a few acting lessons from Paris Hilton . Kascha's scenes are few and minor and she doesn't quite make it to the end of the movie I'm afraid .My biggest complaint is not with the movie but with the cheap, low quality VHS video tape . They recorded it at the slowest SLP speed instead of the SP speed that you would expect to receive when you purchase a pre-recorded video . In order to save a few pennies they made an awful movie even less watchable . The picture quality is poor and you can forget about freeze-framing any worthwhile scenes .

Looking back over this, perhaps that gives the production values too much credit. Imagine a nudie sexploitation film written by two boys in high school who then shot it (mostly) in the woods and their mother's kitchen. Throw in a little incest and wife swapping just for fun. Use wooden characters. Try to determine which is worse, the acting or the dialog. Did I say that I didn't care for this film? Whatever I paid for it was too much.

I wasn't made to care about the characters or their dire situation. I was familiar with the characters, but I didn't see the characters I knew from the TV show. I felt the crew frequently calling Captain Picard 'Jean-Luc' was inappropriate and out of character. The dialog was written as if only one person was speaking for everyone. During a wardroom discussion, Data refers to Commander Riker as 'Captain', which indicated to me that I could expect other distracting inacurracies were I to continue reading.

The cushion is soft but offers a lot of support. There's also a lot of storage space inside. Very sturdy, a little bit heavy, but this isn't terribly bothersome.

However, I'm happy to say that I received this item as described and am extremely pleased with it!The desk looks exactly as it does in the picture. It's well-made inside and out. The storage area is divided into 2 areas (left and right). The left storage area is good for pens, pencils, highlighters.. things of that sort. It's big enough to store my Olympus DS-40 digital voice recorder. The right storage side allows for bigger items. I like to store my textbook that I'm currently reading. You can probably store things that are smaller than a 1\\" regular binder (which my textbook is). The Lap Desk is comfortable - the cushion is also well-made. They didn't skimp on the little tiny balls, which the cushion is made up of (I have no idea what they're called) which is nice because my lap is never exposed to the hard surface.Overall, I recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Metal Gear Solid has very much a classic video game feel to it, but with modern game sophistication.

Christopher Bram seems to enjoy taking historical moments and dramatizing them for the sake of his white American gay characters, who tend to be the heros of this fiction, while the people of color characters tend to be victims. He fails to show the ability of these characters to be social agents against the many barriers they face. In \\"Almost History\\", Bram uses second hand knowledge of Filipino history and figures to show the corruption that ensues in the Philippines, but fails to acknowledge America's hand in starting the whole thing. Basically it's a repetition of the whole big-white-brother/little-brown-brother, racist,condescending bullshit.

I was very much disappointed because with the exception of a couple pages of Ms. Marvel and Wonderman in action, the world of House of M was a boring one where people did boring, everyday things with the only difference being that some of those people had purple skin and butterfly wings.

To think they would lay the whole Gwen Stacy thing on us at this point and make her preferred over Mary Jane just makes me shudder.Personally I don't want to see my childhood heroes reduced to a state that they have more incommon with villains than they do with their former selves.

Yeah, it's commercial rock or whatever you want to call it, but they did it well and there's not a bad song on this album. Throw in Mick Jones on lead vocals for one of the songs, which carried over to their follow-up albums and you just had a winning combination. Lou Gramm had a very distinct sound which made this great listening too. But, as is the case, sometimes a group's debut is their best because it's so difficult to top.

Would you turn up on your (rather distant) friends' doorsteps terminally ill and expect them to take care of you? The farm itself (which is supposed to be a B&B) is never fully included in the story - it seems just an uninteresting and implausable place. I also always resent it when adulterous relationships are glorified and glamorized. Although nearly everyone had slept with this guy, Richard, they all obsess endlessly about him. GET REAL!

There are 10 cars to choose from, but some are locked, and you need to win a certain number of races to be able to drive them. You have two cities to drive in and different modes of racing. However, the crash courses (which are needed to unlock some cars) are REALLY hard.

It does not seem to match what Roy is playing very well.I'm an intermediate player. I learned quite a bit from watching Roy's' hands but not enough to play an entire song, just some cool cord moves and licks here and there.

I got rid of it by giving it to someone as an introductory to the way of thought...but even so, this book talks more about God than anything else.

It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot. A hair's breadth off and again it wouldn't perk. So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds. I am returning to my old friend, the Farberware FC280.

Fortunately, my percolator is plugged into a GFI outlet, which now shuts off automatically almost everytime I lift the percolator to pour my first cup of coffee.

I like the smell and even though the sticks were smaller than the ones I'm used to getting, the scent filled a large room and it was not overpowering like some other brands I've used.

The third symphony is the most approachable and melodic of Schuman's works with a slow movement of sublime beauty to stand with any composers. Beautifully orchestrated, Schuman knew how to use the brass section just as well as Mahler or Bartok. I always felt this music reflected the writing of Emerson and Thoreau, that sort of depth, but that's just me. The polyphonic writing is very rich. The fifth symphony is great fun too, continuing his accomplishments. Don't for a minute think this music is difficult. Schuman communicates beautifully. His most difficult work is the Eighth symphony, filled with gorgeous, yes gorgeous, dissonance in the lower registers, very solemn, profound, moving and beautiful. Try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pocket Calendar not available until the end of February 2006","review":"I am sure this item is nice.

There seem to be too many charaters in \\"Show of Evil\\" .The romance of Vail's associates is mundane and does not interest. Even the affair between Vail and her bete noire - Jane Veneble seems out of place for someone who has raed and enjoyed \\"Primal Fear\\". There are at least two sub plots the presence of which is unjustified. The sub plots divert the attention of the reader and the only purpose they serve is to increase the number of pages in the book.Perhaps the only reason book is readable is because of the characterization of Aaron Stampler . If he was an innocent boy charged with murder in \\"Primal Fear\\", he is evil personified in this one.I hope the sequel to this one is much better ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too crammed, too much, not enough","review":"William Diehl's previous book, Primal Fear, about Adam Stampler was mind-tingling and jaw-dropping. This one sought to accomplish too much. Why does the book devote so much time to Jane Venerable's case about the women, her boss, and her daughter? Why not stick to the real source of villainy, Adam Stampler? The book is too crammed; Diehl should have taken a few of the mini-mysteries and saved them for another novel in order to give them all due justice.

Additionally, the laser has exceptionally poor focusing, resulting in a diffused aim point at 20 feet / 3 meters (resulting in a 6\\"+ / 15 cm red blotch [yes, I took a ruler and measured it]). For a Shotgun, this might not be a horrible thing. However, the aim point shifts by over a foot (at 20 feet / 3 meters) as you rotate the \\"shell\\", rendering any attempt to use it ineffective.

And then.... at the end of the book was a note from the author about how much fun she had re-visiting these characters from the book and \\"tweaking\\" it to be more modern. Turns out this is one of her earlier works from the early 1990's and it is absolutely positively not worth one penny. I felt hoodwinked by the fact they marketed it in the new section. Do not waste your money. Painful. And frustrating as I had only grabbed this one book because I had read everything on my kindle so needed a book for a two hour flight!

The characters were shallow and unbelievable, and the dialogue (internal and spoken) is so repetitive and so bad it's ridiculous. At one point the female lead, while fighting for her life with a very-bad-guy-rapist type, actually says \\"get off me, you cretin!\\". I laughed.

In fact, I believe this is the most obvious story ever written - it certainly has been written before and MUCH BETTER.The villian is obvious, the attempt at deceipt obvious and the whole romance tied up with a ribbon is too trite.This is a ninety minute read and you have better things to do with ninety minutes of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"unspoken","review":"loved the book.

It makes the game that much easier and fun to play. Villagers are smarter so you can focus more on the battle. For example, after they build a lumber camp, they immediately start chopping wood. If you use a group of them to build a building, lumber/mining camp, wall, or farms, they automatically spread out evenly for such tasks. I should point out that one of the game's supreme advantages is its simplicity. Being a single-screen game makes for easy installation, among other things. Plus, there's no mass confusing arsenal of weapons to over-indulge in, etc. As for disadvantages, the standard level single-player game is too easy, yet moderate is too hard for newbies.

There are no real flaws because it's all based on Age of Empires 2, which is allready a great game. There are 5 new civilazations, and they are all different.

Ever noticed that most people are always Byzantines, Tutons, or Persians with a few eceptions? Not any more! It's been all balanced out. Just the other day I was playing a 4 on 4 game online. What's so amazing? Out of eight people, there were 7 different civs. being played. That's a big change. 2 of the new civs., the Aztecs and the Mayans, are very different from every one else. They have no cavalry, but better infantry and archers.If you didn't like it in the first place, you won't like this one, ohterwise, BUY IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great followup expansion","review":"This game just adds more of what we like in the age of empires series.

Selection of combat positions would be another game play improvement. For example, one has the ability to select all of their infantry and archers, and line them up in different formations.Other improvements would be new map types, buildings, and new historical facts documentation on each civilization in the game.The graphics, however brilliant, do not match up well with Age of Empires I, which is why I am giving the game four stars instead of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Brilliance","review":"As the title says, sheer brilliance.

Playing it online is extremely challenging and a lot of fun, requires smart strategies and is simply one of the greatest online games i've played.

Overpowered units have now become balanced, as weaker units have been improved. All this makes for a more varied online gaming, as more units and different strategies can be used.I find the balance they've created in AoE, AoE Rise of Rome, AoK and this new expansion in particular, incredible. This is what makes this one of the greatest online game series, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of my favorites","review":"Even though it's a bit old, I still prefer AOE2 and the Conquerors expansion to most games on the market. Even more than AOE3. Why? It's challenging and yet possible to play a game in a single sitting. The campaigns are well-designed, educational (to some extent) and sometimes thrilling.Unit balance is well-done and I enjoy playing as most civs, but my favorite is the Saracen. In a random game, I can use Mamelukes vs. any cavalry and most infantry and win easily. Against Teutonic Knights, though, the Heavy Cavalry Archer is the choice. It's fun to play the original AOE2 using the patches and interface of the expansion, it makes the missions very challenging. The Teutons were made weaker in the expansion so winning the original campaign under the new rules is much harder and hence more gratifying.Newer games have come and gone but this has always had a place on my hard drive. It still looks good and overall it just can't be beat in this category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a Good Game Even Better","review":"Let's get this out of the way first: Age of Empires 2 was an excellent game that didn't need much in the way of an expansion pak. However, the Conquerors adds new features and races and cleans up the interface. It also polishes up the few blemishes on the original game (like the constant need to reseed farms manually). Overall, this was not a dramatic overhaul to AOE2, but then again it didn't need to be. Given the price this is a smart purchase if you own AOE2, just don't expect a whole new game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Addicting Game","review":"Age of Kings is regarded by many publications as The first ever \\"perfect game.\\" I say microsoft and ensemble studios are the masters at perfecting perfection.

I think that this is the most important thing of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful series!","review":"While Valancy remains my favorite of LM's girls, Emily is one of my beloved book characters. I have since then read Emily Climbs and Emily's Quest, and a good amount of other LM books. Emily is a very different character than Anne (both of them possess a grand imagination, but Anne is more spunky, Emily's more quiet) with a subtle resilience to her spirit that gives her unexpected strength at times (giving her aunt Elizabeth the Murray look). If you liked Anne of Green Gables, you should enjoy this.We saw Emily grow in Emily Climbs, and this book is a supremely satisfying finale on many ends. Readers should be glad that Emily ended up with Ted, but personally I had been hoping she would marry Dean Priest. Oh well. overall a great book, Emily becomes a beautiful and splendid young woman. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!!","review":"This book is the conclusion in the Emily series by L.M. Montgomery. It was a wonderful book and it would've gotten five stars because it's one of my favorite books of all time but, it's just too frustrating. Half the time, you just to scream at Emily because she's such a dodohead. Seriously, that is the only word for it, dodohead. But, it has a happy ending so it basically makes up for everything else. In this book, Teddy and Ilse go to Europe to study, Perry is renowned (is that how you spell that) for his political abilities and Emily writes a book. It's a great book and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner","review":"This book was a terrific ending to the Emily series. It really brought out all the depth of her character and painted a better portrait of her than before. I think it is a testimony to her nature that she decided to stay where she was instead of go to New York, I felt sure that moving would have corrupted her and not been in sync with all we already knew about her. I was dissapointed by the end chapter because it seemed a bit unrealistic. Teddy just shows up out of the blue one day? I mean c'mon...and I wished there had been more love episodes with them. I wish there was a fourth book with how Emily's married life would be. All I can say is, whenever I read any book in this series, it makes me feel as if Emily is a real person that I know.

However, I thought Montgomery's style in this book was tiresome and choppy. The ending seemed abruptly short and difficult to read.

Douglas Bader was possibly World War II's greatest hero, and his story certainly deserves to remain in print so that he can be a hero of today as well, inspiring everyone to reach farther than they think they can.

Are you out there, publishers ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"True heroism isn't a public thing: Douglas Bader and courage","review":"Real heroes are never concerned with being heroic, just with getting on with things. Douglas Bader personifies determination, courage and everything else about true, real heroism. He never made excuses for himself, even as a P.O.W., and spent a lot of time quietly inspiring others who had suffered to do the best they could; and he did it one-on-one, not as a public display. When he died, Australian TV devoted 2 hours to his life in a special program the next day, something they had never done for any other British WWII veteran (he had no major links to Australia).

Anyhow, I saw this cd in a music store in my home city for a good price, so I decided to give it a chance. I'm sure glad I did! I had heard of Tori before, but her music never really grabbed my attention. For no clear reason, this single seemed interesting to me. When I listened to it at home, I was almost put into a trance. This heavenly voice sang to me with such grace and ease, I began to regret not exploring Tori's music a long time ago. There's an undeniable purity about Tori's voice and music.

However, the main reason to get this album is the live songs. I'm So Glad is another great classic jam that was in the vein of some of the live cuts off of Wheels Of Fire. The best thing about this, though, is that everyone is soloing at the same time. You can hear the rythym messup. Politician and Sitting On Top Of The World are 10 times better live than on the album. As for the studio songs, they're really good. Badge is one of the prettiest Cream songs ever, right next to Anyone for Tennis, and Doing That Scrapyard Thing reminds me of Traffic. What A Bringdown is good for a Ginger Baker song (Blue Condition [stinks]), and I have a version of the album with Anyone for Tennis on it, which might be the 5th time it's been on a record.

In my mind Baker was talking about this album.The live side is very solid with three great live songs that show Cream in top form.

GOODBYE, the fourth, was a major disapointment. The trio's fresh exuburance seemed to evaporate with noisy,jumbled live performances of songs I already knew, just another jam session.

This book is presented in a casual conversational style, yet through these discourses can be found some key insights for understanding our human sexuality and the institution or sacrament of marriage.

Our culture confuses sex with love. This book simply and beautifully helps us to see what truly loving relationships can and should be. We are lifted to a higher emotional, physical and spiritual level.

Tell Me effectively put Dru Hill near the head of R&B's class of 1996 as the CD featured three more huge ballad singles including In My Bed, 5 Steps and the my favorite Never Make A Promise.

Eleven years later this album still ranks with the best R&B CD'S released in 1996"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Dru Is","review":"After hearing both of their albums, I'd have to say that their original is superior. Enter the Dru has too much freaking and making love junk in it---tasteless, tacky, and a big turn-off. This album's their best because the songs stick to the R&B mode and they have a better message. It's not just all about sex here, it's about love and life, too. The lyrics are well-written and the music is fabulous. Dru Hill has a lot of talent and it really shows in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline and Silly.","review":"This is the debut album from Dru Hill, who name themselves after Druid Hill in Baltimore, Maryland. The lead singer is the exceedingly flamboyant Sisqo, an otherwise talented vocalist. While this album never lacks attitude or spark, the songs, though not disastrous, are subpar and predictable slices of radio-friendly r&b. The hit single, \\"Tell Me,\\" is a slow jam that qualifies as a guilty pleasure, despite its banal lyrics which attempt to rival Jodeci in the raunch department. For the rest of the ride, these guys don't really bring anything new or exciting to the table of r&b.

The picture is of the Kraft Ecolite but what you get is not even close. They were really cheap and the Bubbles were pretty much non existent compared to Ecolite. I can't believe they were even allowed to sell these. You can't get a Video Game, DVD or Blu Ray in them unless you jam it in there and tear the paper. Even then it wasn't protected very well.

I bought one box to try it because the price was good and shipping was included; they are made in China and I have a thing about many items made there.

The envelopes aren't as well made as the ones I bought previous on Amazon. They're flimsier and easily rip. I use them to mail DVDs and the cases sometimes cause the evelopes to start to rip and it's apparent they aren't as high of a quality as the envelopes I've used in the past.

I'm right handed, so, my knife is on the right as are my pencils. No little slot for them on either pouch. And whats with all the hammer holsters. Also, whats with 2 tape slot holders.

So I'm returning it today and restart my search for a new pouch system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big, durable, adjustable","review":"Wow, this thing is big! I've been wearing the same 5-pouch leather toolbelt for 32 years. This is quite a change. You can certainly carry a lot of tools on this belt. There are plenty of pockets of different sizes. I found the way it's setup when delivered (and in the picture), that the hammers bang against my knees. Reversing the large pockets fixed this. There's a 3rd hammer holder you can put where you want on the belt. I'd like to have a slot to hold my square like on my old belt, but I'm using one of the tape measure slots for that. The tape measure slots are my only complaint. You can clip a tape measure on it, but every time I bend over or squat, my thigh pushes the tape up and unclips it. So that feature doesn't work for me, and my tape is in a pouch. I'm 5-9 and 170lbs; maybe for different-sized people it's not a problem, but it seems it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"No! I'm melting!","review":"Whatever you do, RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO READ THIS BOOK! It should be removed from the McCaffrey lineup by the publisher, it was so bad.

A truely wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor revisitation of the White Dragon","review":"I found this book a complete and total dissapointment. It had very little in the way of original material, mostly just containing a recap of The White Dragon. I was very surprised and dismayed at this fact, and feel it is well below McCaffrey's writing ability"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Side of Pern","review":"I always wondered where the 'bad guys' were on Pern. In that regard, it's quite refreshing to find that there are in fact truly unsavory characters abounding the planet. Lord Fax aside, Thella is the most ruthless, evil character of McCaffrey's tales. Read this to fill in knowledge of Pern and the Dragonriders Series as a change of pace. Like 'All the Weyrs', which this is a prerequisite to reading, this is only another good book. Within the context of the larger whole, a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't keep track of the characters","review":"I read the first couple of Pern books and loved them. Later I tried this one. The first 18 pages introduced 11 SETS of characters in different locations, totally unrelated to each other. I ended up writing them down and still couldn't keep them straight. I therefore hardly got attached, and didn't really care what happened to them. There were so many plot lines that I had no idea what the story was. Finally, at page 265, with only 120 to go, and at the end of a chapter no less, I finally gave up.Try \\"Dragonflight\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Renegades of Pern","review":"I have ready the all the books in the Pern series and find this one to be the weakest of them all. It was harder than most to follow and the feeling of satisfaction that I normally experience at the end of the book was missing. Somehow it was just not up to Anne McCaffrey's normal standard. It is still a worthwhile read as it explains some of the actions of Dragons, Riders, Harpers, Lord Holders, other Crafters and the \\"Holdless\\" which occur in the other novels of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was terrible","review":"I normally love Anne McCaffrey's books, but was absolutly discusted with this book. I have read almost every book in the Dragonriders Of Pern series, and this is the only one I didn't like, other than the collections of short stories. If you ask me, though, this book was the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre book, poor and weak","review":"If you love Pern, if you thrilled at the first riding of Ramath by F'larr's dragon, or the fall of Canth, do NOT read this book. It is pure dreck, proof that McCaffrey has \\"Heinlein's Disease\\" (which casues SF writers to really suck with their last few books before they die).

I have to recommend that all fans look long and hard at the slew of latter day Pern books, though, and consider making the hard decision to skip them. This is just such a book -- along with the incredibly disappointing book that showed the \\"first founders\\" of Pern and all the lame origins for things like the grubs, the dragons, the name of the holds, and so on, this only makes you scratch your head and\`\` think how the mighty have fallen. This book did not need to be written and does not need to be read. No, for my money, Pern fans should stick with the first three books, the Harper hall series (Pemur and Menolly), and All the Weyrs of Pern. Whatever you do, skip the lame books like Renegades of Pern (shudder) and this one.\`"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Stand Alone From Anne McCaffrey","review":"I have read all of the Dragon Riders Series books and \\"The Renegades Of Pern\\" does a masterful job of introducing us to new characters, follows the tribes of gypies that came with the Pern expedition and become the \\"Traders\\" that transport much of the commodities to the far flung holds. We get a wonderfully deranged evil Lord Holder's Daughter who enjoys killing and stealing!The best part of this book for me is the way it ties in the existing timeline of the original Dragonriders Of Pern Books, with the beginning of the Pern Colony in \\"Dragonsdawn\\", and creates the storyline continued in \\"The Skies of Pern\\".I will continue to enjoy this book as well as the entire series for many years to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work . . .","review":"I found that the Renegades of Pern was good for filling in the blanks left by McCaffrey's other books but little else. The storyline was less than engaging and it was confusing the way she would write for a few pages and then skip ahead three years. Like I said, it filled in the blanks. This is not McCaffrey's best work at all. I have read many of the Pern books and I felt that they were a far better read than this one. You wouldn't want to read The Renegades of Pern if you hadn't read just about every other Pern book before it because you would get lost very, very, very quickly. Look into getting your hands on this if you are curious about some of the lesser characters but don't expect an exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book with lots of practical tidbits","review":"This seems to be a good book for begining college instructors looking for the classroom basics plus some ideas on how to modify some basic formulas to make it a bit more interesting. It manages to keep from getting too bogged down with details about specific strategies. Unfortunately, this is also it's weakness, as I did not find support readily available when I wished to know more about a specific strategy. Worth having as a basic reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 electrifies in its attempt to stay fresh.","review":"The key to enjoying this album, especially for longtime U2 fans, is to listen to it more than once. My initial reaction was to dislike it, but the more I listened, the better it got. Even songs like Mofo, songs that on the surface seem to be nonsensical, have moving lyrics. (Mofo's are about missing his late mother.) All told, every song is good and worth repeated listening. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever.","review":"U2 have done it again. With Edge's legendary guitar, Larry Mullen's thumping drums, Adam Clayton's bouncy bass and Bono's sincere wailing, this quartet have proved that they still and will always be the best at what they do. I seriously recommend this to anyone, it has a sincere honesty to it. A very sexy album"},{"rating":"2","title":"21 Years of Evolution","review":"U2 is one of those rare bands that doesn't seem to fade away, even after 21 years. This is easily summed up in two statements. 1)The group has never changed its membership--always Larry, Adam, Bono, and The Edge, 2)U2 understands how to evolve with the times without losing the crux of their message or the impact of their lyrics. Pop represents the last, and in my opinion, the best album from U2 yet, rivaling even The Joshua Tree. Lyrically, I would give this album the highest marks yet. Two thumbs up for Pop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New But Noteworthy","review":"As with many fans, the first time I heard this I asked myself \\"who the heck is /this/?\\" As I listened to it more and more, I discovered that it's the same old U2 with a new feature added. They haven't really changed, they just added on, and if you can't recognize that, you're probably not a true fan. They were tired of their image and wanted to change it. They took a risk, and unfortunately, some people don't appreciate that. If you give this album a chance, you'll find it's just as great as the others, with the same deep meanings in the songs. It's just a little more covered up now, and it takes a true fan to appreciate and recognize that."},{"rating":"2","title":"sensual, modern, free","review":"some say it's a difficult album to listen to. I'd rather say it's one of their easiest. When it rocks, it rocks so well and fair, when it sounds electronic, it just had to.People MAKE IT difficult to listen just because they were expecting something similar to what existed already..Fortunately it's not the case. (contrary to their latest ep).This album is a subtle mix of intensity and musical harmony. A sad harmony sometimes. But there is this kind of vitality and emergency that makes it full of life.The voice of Bono is close to your ears, especially in \\"if you wear that velvet dress\\". Sublime of sensuality. Unsurpassed.\\"Miami\\" is incredible, \\"if god will send..\\" is pure genious."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Masterpiece","review":"U2 is my favorite band and I think they will always be. My favorite album is still the Joshua Tree but Pop is a VERY close 2nd. It's a very brightly colored package with a not so sweet taste as Bono once put it. It's true, the lyrics on this album are darkly cynical and in my opinion, Bono's absolute best. I will reccommend this album to any music fan. Take into consideration that \\"Pop\\" demands an open mind like many masterpieces do. It takes a few listens before the genius sets in but once it does, look out. This could become one of you're favorite albums by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD instead, for God's sake!","review":"As fresh now as it was then.

But U2 changed at the right time. They needed to go with what other music styles were being played at the time and they did with POP. I personally think that this album is good but alot of there older tracks(With or without you,New Years Day,Desire)are better.But only just. Alot of criticism has gone against this album but I don't agree with it at all. Some songs are excellent(Mofo,Discoteque,Do you feel loved). I think anyone into R & P should have a listen. You'll either love it or hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright album, but compared to \\"Achtung Baby\\"......","review":"It would be an alright album, if they same band haven't made the masterpiece of them all \\"Achtung Baby\\". It makes \\"Pop\\" look....boring and without soul of music. The best songs are \\"If god would...\\" and \\"Staring at the sun\\" + \\"Discotheque\\" is a great song before going out friday night. But, Bono still writes great lyrics. On the other hand, nothing is worthy to follow up on \\"Achtung Baby\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Me A Thumbs Up!","review":"Yes, it's Amazon, but there is a reason I use Amazon. I've used it a few times which has been every single time I needed to order something online. I love it so much because they are efficient and so easy to use. My mom uses it and she doesn't even know where to exit out of a window! My favorite part though is that they always deliver earlier than they say. They say it'll come in 5 days, it usually comes in 4 or eve 3 days. For this U2 CD, I lost my other on the way to a trip to Disneyland--long story. But I couldn't find it anywhere, so I gave up. Fat chance getting me somewhere to buy it, so why no online? I only trusted Amazon and it came in 4 days. Pretty soon my craving was satisfied!

When will Bono retire that's what I want to know"},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"This album is heavily electronic, but then, I don't really mind electronic or rock. Infact I like both. It bothers me when people have to categorise something as either rock or electronic when it should be taken for what it is...MUSIC. I think the people who think they've sold out are the ones who aren't as open minded as they'd like to think they are. Music is about experimenting with new sounds, not staying in the same place. I'd be bored to death listening to U2 for 20 years if they sounded the same on every album.I've only just heard this one, and I'm pleasantly surprised (i hate rating music, but i did it just to counterbalance the negative reviews:)... I enjoy this album more than their previous ones. Definietly underrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Strong Album","review":"Though many of U2's fence sitting fans jumped ship for this album, they may want to take another look at U2's artistic stab at the lighter side. In fact, this album really does stack favorably to it's more heralded immediate siblings. The younger, All that you can't leave behind, is a fantastic back to basics tug on the reigns but it is not the album that Pop is. the older, Zooropa is also fine but a little too directionally challenged for my liking. Is Pop another Actung or Joshua Tree? No, but nothing ever will be. Enjoy Pop for all of it's own personal greatness. You won't regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best U2 cd ever!","review":"Wow, Pop IS THE BEST U2 CD EVER!!!!!!!! If you are concidering adding it to your collection, GET IT! If you want a U2 cd, GET THIS ONE! It is more upbeat than much of their new stuff on \\"all that you can't leave behind\\", but similar to elevation and beautiful day. Just get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be dissuaded by popular criticism","review":"Constantly overlooked as just frivolous experimentation, however the tracks are strong in their own right, and come together as a surprisingly complete package. This is not a marginal album; it's a highlight and milestone for U2. It's not their most polished production but ambitious and essential just the same. A stretch for a band many would prefer to corner into a certain genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"for those moments when I lose myself","review":"\\"how in the world am I going to review this?\\" This album truly changed my life. It's a part of myself. Pop is just an experience, something you must listen.On Pop you'll find very high level of musicianship, really amazing. The starting to this is best described sounding like an electronic garden, but not a very happy one. Mind blowing.Despite it was Achtung Baby that - beyond doubt - separates U2 into it's before and after periods, Pop really hasn't anything bad to say about it, is keeps the listener attentive all the way through breeding great hooks with real musical complexity. Very different from any angle. Also captures a great range of feeling with the bleak horror of Please and the elegant simplicity of Wake Up Dead Man. An excellent album, by the way, the last U2 excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated U2 album","review":"Extraordinary. Pop was the work of a true genius of the experimentation. This album, like \\"Zooropa\\", is not very friendly at the first listening. But it becomes more and more hypnotic as you go on listening to it time after time.Pop is incomparable to U2's other works. This piece of art is nothing like what you'd expect it to sound like. It will take you some time to appreciate how brilliant it is, but once you relax and give in and allow yourself to enter their world. This is U2 at their best - difficult, inventive, moody, cheeky, bizarre, talented.It's all so clever and addictive that I can't truly fault it. Sometimes I can't believe this was going on commercial release, displayed in music stores worldwide, millions of copies produced, because it was so honest and original and unlike most albums I've ever heard. I don't know. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real members of U2 please stand up","review":"Whatever happened to the greatest rock band of our times? While repeated listening reveals some traces of the real U2 in their previous 'Zooropa', there is absolutely no trace of them in their new album.

I went to Dublin to see all the places where the boys in U2 grew up in. And Windmill Lane. It was a nice time and I highly recommend going to Dublin, just generally. It's a great city. Anyway, that's not what I should write about here. Well, after all the wait for a new studio-album we got PoP. Zooropa came out in 1993 so it was a time for a new album. When hearing the first single off the album, Discothèque, I got worried. It's a song I can't hear more than once a year. There are only two songs I like on the album, 'Staring at the Sun' and 'Wake Up Dead Man'."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I still have this CD and every once in awhile I pop it in to see if maybe by some miracle I am missing something in my opinion that this is the worst cd U2 ever made.

No, just a boring piece of [junk]."},{"rating":"1","title":"P-U","review":"This one stinks worse than Kid A.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst cd's i've ever heard","review":"I am a HUGE U2 fan. I just wanted to state that before i start the bashing of this cd. This cd is truely just a mixture of sound effects. It has no rythmn! I don't understand how U2 could have put out a cd like this even if it was experimental, this is just trash. Please do not waste your money on this. Go out and buy Joshua tree, Achtung Baby, or All that you can't leave behind. Almost any other u2 cd is better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"past their peak","review":"I've been a big fan of u2 for years and I think that their 80s and early 90s material is really good such as albums like achtung baby and the joshua tree. Pop seems to be a weak attempt to recapture the time when their music was still groundbreaking and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sold out? No way!","review":"I was a bit wary to purchase this album, having heard all the rumors that U2 had 'sold out' with this album. I immediately discovered that those rumors are incredibly untrue. While this certainly isn't another Joshua Tree (I don't think anyone will ever be able to do something like that again), it's still a good CD. Anyone who approaches this CD with a closed mind and a specific idea of how U2 should sound should avoid this CD, however. It's only for us open-minded folk who like to hear out favorite band try out a new kind of sound. They have some successes - \\"Discotheque\\", \\"Do You Feel Loved\\", \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\", \\"Gone\\", \\"Please\\", and especially \\"Mofo\\" and \\"Staring at the Sun\\". (which is my favorite on the album) At the same time though, there are a few that don't do as well. (\\"Miami\\" springs to mind) It's not the U2 we might remember, but that doesn't make it bad.P.S. The RealAudio clips above don't do the songs justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD AT ALL","review":"i know alot of people seem to not like this album or the 93 classic Zooropa. i cant understand why not, this stuff is classic.....well zooropa is the better of the two but still POP does have its moments of greatness.......MoFo,Please, Staring At the Sun are my three favs, plus i really like Miami, everyone here seems to trash that song....anyway POP is a great album in its own right, not their best but still memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is very underrated","review":"Underneath all of the technology of this album lies the foundation of all good U2 albums - lyrics. Bono creates very vivid imagery in this album, and continues the poetic tradition of Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree, although it feels not as consistent (Discotheque and Miami). This is an interesting album from a very interesting band.If you love U2, this album won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoax of the century","review":"After its marcketing prior to release, U2 fans thought that the band had gone from rock to pop. Who bought the record, and many did, found out that it just wasn't true. There are one or two pop tunes but underneath the lights and glitter, you will find a genuine rock album. Some great songs written from the heart. For those greater fans you will notice a sense of religious self doubt. Or is it just my impression?They still have what it takes. Not as great as Joshua Tree of Achtung Baby but sure points in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"that's a good cd but very different from the real U2","review":"Definetely good, but if you don't like changes and updates Don't buy i"},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 - 'Pop' (Island)","review":"Review no.338.I don't care about what others might say about this here U2's 'Pop' release.I still like it better than their previous effort 'Zooropa'.I've been a U2 fan since the very beginning,their Popmart tour was obviously the most massive of it's kind.I should know,I saw it from up front of the stage.My two favorite cuts off this CD are \\"Mofo\\" and the ass-kicking \\"Gone\\".Other stand outs include \\"Last Night On Earth\\"(they shot the video for this tune the day after the concert that I saw and it did cause some problems,several business owners didn't like shutting their stores down for one day to accommodate the video crew-it WAS on the news,several times),\\"Do You Feel Loved\\",\\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" and \\"Miami\\".To me at least,a true keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Nineties, not the Eighties","review":"Where to start...how 'bout \\"GONE\\". Listen to that 30 some-odd times and the \\"I wish it was the U2 I grew up with\\" attitude may diminish. U2 may not be unplugged and their eclectic , er electric, sound may not be for the masses that bought Joshua Tree and Achtung, but this CD has what it takes. It took some getting used to. \\"What the heck is THIS??\\", I would say the first few times. But it plays nice as a complete package of sound and lyrically, fuggedaboutit. MOFO, Staring at the Sun, the aforementioned Gone, Velvet Dress, and Please would be good enough to be on any album they've has thus far and the Edge gets nasty on a higher level from song to song. Yes, there is no \\"With or Without You\\" to carry this compilation to the 18-30 demographic, but it has been 10 years since 'those' songs were put out. Achtung was awesome and I think they had to carry that musical progression as far as they could and I think they did in POP."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I used to remember when U2 meant something, when their lyrics were inspiring and the music was innovative. Sadly, it appears that they are more concerned with making fun of themselves and the music industry than coming up with good music. Though there are a couple of catchy tunes ('Do You Feel Loved, If God Would Send His Angles'), I think this album pales in comparison to their earlier work. Hopefully they will get off this dance kick. So many other bands do it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 and God","review":"Bono's journey away continues. Forget the beauty of \\"Joshua Tree.\\" U2 is now full of postmodern smooze. U2 obviously sees themselves as bigger than life, a joke if you will.

I am very strong U2 fan, and this is by far the worst album they ever recorded. Past experiments by U2 have mostly suceeded, such as Achtung Baby and Zooropa. But I have listened to POP several times, and it still just doesn't sink in. No matter how many times I give it a try, it always comes up empty. Save your money and concentrate on Boy, War, Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. POP is a very forgettable recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzle","review":"U2 began the 1990's with the bold and innovative \\"Achtung! Baby\\" and it ended the decade with the flat and pretentious \\"Pop.\\" This is U2 at its worst. \\"Pop\\" is nothing more than a tiresome piece of pseudo-commentary on marketing and commercialization and listening to it is about as enjoyable as flossing your teeth. This album is an unlistenable piece of techno-junk.

This CD is very poor. U2 makes good music, but their best doesn't even approach PJ's or Nirvana's best. The only good song in it is \\"If God will send his angels\\", and the rest of the songs is awful for a band that has songs like \\"With or without you\\" and \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bono Princess of POP right next to John Mayer the mistress of POP","review":"U2 are not a rock band they are pop, pop rock at best, and not that good at either."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overall good album(with the requisite couple of clunkers)","review":"Once again U2 try to explore different avenues while maintaining their uniqueness. A few of the songs on this album seem to be rooted in earlier albums (please, do you feel loved). while others are an exploration of modern music (mofo). PoP is a very solid recording which went to #1 in 29 countries (excluding the US). The songs on pop seemed to get better the longer U2 played them on tour. Perhaps if U2 hadn't rushed to finish the album ( it was overdue & they already committed to an opening tour date) some of the other songs may have had a little more polish. However, POP is a very fine album that just never received adequate radio support in the states."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why argue?","review":"As a non U2 fan I feel I am quite unbiased enough to give a personal opinion on this album. It's not rock. It's not pop either! HHmmmmm. My question is this: Why do most people want to label music under a genre? You either like it or you dont. Now I realise that some fans of this group are disappointed by the shift in style of this innovative band but do you pretend that any band keep dishing out the same stuff over and over again? Come on. Underneath it all one can still recognise the unique voice of Bono. One can still appreciate the edge's guitar riffs. This point is made out more clear by their B-sides. Pick up a song and give it that U2 colour. They just gave that treatment to pop music now. And I must confess I like the result. One last thing. Instead of arguing U2 fans should enjoy the last drops from the cup since U2 may soon stop playing!!! What if your nagging has been the fault for this decision?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly weird album","review":"It was... interesting. I liked Discotheque, and If God Will Send His Angels, and Gone, I didn't like Mofo so much, but it gave me an altogether eery feeling. People say Zooropa was post-apocolyptic, but I'm more inclined to believe that that was the feeling I got from listening to this. It took some time to warm up to. It's one of the ones you have to get over before you can start to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 Puts On A New Mask - And Looks Good","review":"With POP, U2 has once again left its roots behind (read: stuff from Joshua Tree). However this is not a bad thing. Although POP, along with ZOOROPA, is not a masterpiece by any means, the album and its techno sound clearly is the work of the great band from Dublin. Even if you don't typically listen to the European style of music featured on this album, it is clear that U2 still knows what they are doing. A must for any U2 fan. As for the casual listener, \\"Staring at the Sun\\" and \\"Gone\\" are treats even if you haven't heard much of the diverse material from this great quartet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howie B was the missing link","review":"This is my favorite U2 album. I've been a big fan of Howie B since his work with Massive Attack. I enjoy every song on this album except track nine. That song is filler. I gave it five stars because Howie B's beats clearly made up for that filler track."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated U2 album","review":"It's not their best, but this was one of U2's better albums...so long as you like electronic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bono, Edge.....to this album. I salute you.","review":"Ok. Sure. The media dispised this work. And in turn, those for which are shallow minded persons out there went with what they read. Sure the guys of the band started to do weird things like dressing up in a radiation protection suit. But no, this IS an album to be reckoned with. Id say, the lyrics alone are Bono's greatest body of work since The Joshua Tree. OK, yes there is some industrial loops and other technical jargon through the tunes. But strip it back, and youve got something if not as strong, but maybe even stronger than Achtung Baby. It highlights the negative things that are happening in this world. And Please. Will God Send His Angels? Or will The Playboy Manson do anything for us? Or whilst Staring at the Sun, will this be our Last Night on Earth? Who knows! But no, it is sad what happend when this title came out. Because it deserved alot more than what it got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a While","review":"I first got this album, listened to it, got a headache halfway through, and put it away. Several months later, I decided to listen to it again, but from a musician's standpoint. U2's style, especially rhythm, had been drastically altered, from the usual rock, to a new \\"looped\\" electronic style. This album takes a while to appriciate, and now it is a personal \\"underappriciated\\" favorite. Don't jude the album immidietly, as I did, and call it junk after listening once to this experiment. Try to appriciate the completely new style discovered by U2, and listen to it until your head pounds, esp after \\"Mofo\\". I'm glad U2 had the nerve to produce the album, as it broke the \\"barrier\\" they had of seeming to play only one genre of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very underrated","review":"This album contains some of U2's best songwriting, which makes this album bittersweet. Some of their best, most well-rounded songs, over-produced in a cucoon of electronic noise. That doesn't mean that songs like \\"Discotheque\\", \\"Do You Feel Love\\", \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\", \\"Staring at the Sun\\", \\"Last Night on Earth\\", \\"Gone\\", \\"Please\\" or \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" aren't good songs. The writing is great, but the way they're put together isn't the best. You can tell they were a little too conscious of the way these songs would sound and spent too long polishing them, taking away most of the soul. Great songs, leaves more to be desired from them. Great album nonethless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I can't understand what people like about this disc. It has almost no redeeming qualities.

It's not art; just nonsense-modern trying-to-make music. Bono and his gang lost their inspiration as never a group of that size did.Where is the congruent and excellent high-viewed spirituality of 'The Joshua Tree'???The beginning of the end was 'Desire' and the end of the end is 'Pop' that leaves you embracing 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' as a kind of resurrection, or maybe a sort of homecoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Disappointment","review":"The great leaps the band had taken featured on the debut albumof the Passengers now seem an enigma.

This is definitely not one of the Dublin band's best; one would have thought that - given four years between \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop\\" - they'd reinvent themselves again. But they still revisit the same techno sound they first dabbled in on 1991's Achtung Baby, albeit this time with far less impressive results.As a result, \\"Pop\\" largely failed with casual and faithful U2 fans alike, and thus the band tried too hard to win them back with their formulaic and over-commerical All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Trash","review":"U2's anticlimactic, flimsy beats and rythums, coupled with Bono's lazy, lackluster lyrics (\\"your holy war/ your northern star/ your sermon on the mount/ in the boot of your car...\\"), make POP sound more like POOP.

After disrespecting certain artists just because they listen to 50 cent is ridiculous and that shows how much of a p***Y he is. His best album was the first one.

You flick up hes a gansta, you flick down hes a singer. 50 cent gets in the game, its like OOOOH now he's a gansta agin? Gansta agin? thats how you can tell if hes realy a gansta or not. You just cant rap about r&b and as soon as someone starts saying somthing about you now your back hardcore.Thats not how it works a true gansta dose'nt have to put on a frunt.

Notice the word \\"Lil?\\" Good because you've only been in the game just as long as they have. In summary don't f**k wit Dre. Put your mouth where your money is.

He has no rhymes the lyrics on most of the songs are repetitive and unoriginal. Whoever said Ja needs to stick with that R&B girl(Ashanti) is right. Ja i suggest you stick to what sells otherwise you are continuing to fight a war you cant win. The album is not his worst effort but it is lacking and feels rushed. Ja what ever happened to taking the time to make a quality record. If you are a diehard Ja fan (making you an idiot) go cop it. If you are a fan of hip hop and the beef between Ja and 50 go cop it. If you are looking for a top notch album from a top notch artist look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album ent saying nothing special","review":"With this album Ja Rule is trying to show that he is still street and not just a commercial rapper. He does have some success with this by not featuring any female singers and not singing about his usual topic of love. However the album really is'nt that strong. His style doesnt vary enough and with the exception of the two singles that I had already heard none of the songs on the album stood out. Also the whole album seems like it is trying to diss 50 which seems a bit lame. I definately think this album should be skipped.

This album is supposed to be Ja's entrance back into his hardcore image. Gone are the \\"grease\\" remake videos, or songs with ashanti, now Ja Rule is a hardcore thug, bustin gats and ridin on his enemies. Unfortunately for Ja, his labelmates arent very talented, and mess up a couple of songs. Also i find it odd that a former member of 2pacs group(the outlawz) Fatal was on quite a few songs. My guess is hes using Ja too get some shine from his broken career. As for the cd, there are a few bright spots. Remember this is intended as a ep, so this cd isnt as long as your typical album release. Race Against Time 2, and The Crown are good tracks. I would reccomend listening to these two songs and not buying the album, as the rest of the album is full with medicore songs, and really bad ones.

Once Again","review":"On his 5th album Ja Rule finally returns to the hardcore style he had on his 1st album. But I don't know if he did it because he wanted to or because of the beef with 50 Cent. It's pretty obvious that 50 influenced this album, because Ja's dissin him throughout the entire CD, he also takes shots at Eminem, Dr. Dre, DMX, & Busta Rhymes. Nevertheless this is a hot album, there really aren't any weak tracks, but the skits are pointless, and there are too many guest appearances. The only guest that really does a good job is Hussein Fatal who was part of 2pac's crew the Outlawz. Bottom line this is Ja's best album since Venni Vetti Vecci there is no pop-rap here and best of all... No Ashanti!!! Anyone who liked Ja's 1st album should check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album of the year","review":"Dis album is completely wack.

One of them is really old too, so that doesn't even count.Get the G-Unit album this Friday if you want a good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ja Rule begging of the End","review":"This album hasnt really been seen in the charts in australia but i gave it a shot and bought it as iam a fan of Ja's \\"pain is love\\" which i feel is a masterpeice and \\"last temptaion\\". this album rings more of an underground aspiring rapper rather then someone who had already established themself as one of the biggest rappers of the period.anybody who cares about the Ja' 50 beef raise your hands?, thank you, nobody.... it seems that Ja hasnt let it pass and is still harping on old ghosts. The beats are decent and the rhymes rarely boarder on potent, just as nelly seems to have done, Ja is fading to the background and im not surrised that this album is considered a flop."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you do when 50 acts a fool...","review":"You gonna clap back!

The same people who diss this album are the same clowns who buy 30 dollar G Unit hats and 80 dollar G Unit shoes just to fit in. F that, the Rule has the streets now suckers!

I did find the loose change diss track good but you can't fix what you broke. Below are reasons why i gave the track 1 star:1)1st album hot, 2nd and 3rd he sold out and sailed up the R'n'B river, and on this one he thinks he can return to a 'gangsta' rapper. Not going to happen2)Clocking in a 45minutes is not even a proper album3)Attempting to go back at 50cent is not going to work , you got beat face it.4)You are a 2pac mimic, let the great one rest5)Increase your lyrics please you may get some fans back that way.Go back to R'n'B where your sell out soul belongs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Besides The Beef.","review":"I am not speaking on the beef that Ja got with you know who.

I never thought that I would say this, but I rather him sing with Bobby Brown with Thug Lovin' II than here this album (not sayin' he should!!!). His first album was a great direction of where he should have kept going. He's better than this album but what he did was prove everybody right. You lose your battle with this album and it's no one's fault but your own.

But too have a WHOLE CD about 50 is sending one message. He is obsessed with 50/G-Unit and that is not a good thing. It's saying he can only think about THEM. And if you check out his lyrics (since he mumbles so much in the cd) only like three or four bars of a song rhyme. He is telling a story, not rappin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome!!!!!!!","review":"This album is so boring, and lame. It is almost as bad as him trying to act.

I agree with another reviewer about Capt. Scott,he gets off lightly(perhaps another attempt to restore his image).The last 100 pages + the reader manhauls through WW1,the writing of TWJW,business transactions and his battle with his depression.

Oh by the way, I have a feeling G.B. Shaw wrote more of Cherry's book than the author of his bio lets on.

I absolutely love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"I really admired Jon Katz's \\"Geeks\\" and I'm deeply interested in dogs, so I pounced on this book, but I'm sorry to say I found it very disappointing. Katz writes well, and some parts of the book are touching, especially his accounts of putting his labs down, but on the whole the book is grating in its misperceptions and obtuseness about canine behavior. It also seemed to be reaching for significance and spiritual insight in a self-conscious way that is occasionally embarrassing. Worst of all, much of it is just not interesting. There are so many insightful and genuinely touching books about the human-canine relationship that this one just seems unnecessary. I hope Katz gets back on stride with his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Read\\" for the dog lovers","review":"This book was a wonderful read for the dog or animal lovers out there. The author uses such detail that you feel that you also know these dogs (and love them!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a dog owner could understand This love story","review":"This book review could read like the classic Broadway play review, 'I laughed, I cried\\". The journey that Jon Katz takes us on is a microcosm of life. The emotional energy he invests in his search to understand a difficult dog pays off for readers with dividends of colorful vignettes. One comes to know the personalities of the dogs as the year unfolds and the stories make this unexpectedly, a real page turner because it is full of twists and turns. I found myself reading passages aloud to family and friends and they all wanted to borrow the book when I finished. As someone who lives with many dogs, I can attest to the authenticity of the subject matter. As a reader I can heartily recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring read","review":"Having just heard a radio interview with Mr Katz, I believe him to be a FAR better talker than writer on this particular subject. I'd instantly go to a lecture he might give on the subject, but the book lacks the spark, the straightforwardness, of a live conversation. As a lifelong dog owner myself, this book was a yawning disappointment, even though I share many of the author's training theories and perceptions about how dogs can and do fit into the scheme of being pets/companions-for-humans. Don't bother reading this book, but by all means listen if you have a chance to Mr Katz's conversations on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dog Year:Twelve Months, Four Dogs,and Me","review":"If you love dogs, do NOT buy this book. This is the story of what can go so wrong when your ego is bigger than your common sense.

I grabbed this book based on a mention from John Grogan in the Marley book. Katz is not nearly as pure of a dog owner. He seems to take pleasure in recounting his practiced dominance over his dogs. He claims to adore them but uses force and physical punishment while explaining how lucky they are to have him. In my mind, the dogs seem like experiments. This book is more about Katz than it is about the dogs. A lot of ego on display.

This book touched on many of the same issues that have been finding their way into my own life.

This book was recommended by the experts at my local model engineering club as the best on the subject, and having read it cover to cover, I can totally endorse their recommendation. The hard back version is a collectors book and is expensive, but the identical (except for the binding) version in paper back is inexpensive and absolutely worth the money. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"After reading the other excellent reviews I'm convinced that I must not have gotten a real Timolino product - the one I received performs very poorly - it doesn't keep hot beverages hot for even 3 hours and doesn't keep cold very long either - less than 5 hours. (Even after letting it sit with hot/cold water first, making sure the pour top was closed and putting the lid on tightly.) Also mine holds 24 not 17 ounces.

Thompson imitation is a million times better than the one on this recording. If you have ever heard Dr. Thompson's rapid, almost rambling voice, you would realize how amazingly accurate Depp's imitation is. If you think this recording makes Dr. Thompson sound \\"more spirited\\" than the movie, that's fine - but the Hunter S. Thompson on this CD is not as good a mimic as Depp's version. The movie received poor reviews, but as times goes on I believe the film will garner a considerable and well-deserved cult following, as I think it's an excellent adaptation. However, regardless of comparisons to the movie, this audio treatment is merely an average interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone who says this is better than the film is a moron.","review":"One of the things that made Gilliam's film great was Johnny Depp's brilliant, energetic reading of some of the key passages of the unique, musical language of the book. This CD was made by cheap hacks who have probably never even heard Thompson's voice. More importantly, they just don't understand the language. Depp is a professional who spent a lot of time with the author trying to lock on to his manerisms and unique vernacular. The two actually became freinds. These geeks have a minimal understanding of the book or the madness it came out of. They in no way do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amaturish...","review":"How can you make Fear and Loathing boring?? I would think it impossible, but it isn't. Spiritless, stoney, monotone, performances from all involved. Several drunk high-school students with some simple recording equipment could do ten times better. Do not buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-quite there...","review":"This spoken word adaptation of the book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is by no means a substitute for the literature. It lacks the depth of character that can be found in the readings and in the recent movie adaptation. Stanton's readings stray closer to William S Burroughs than to Thompson's dry and hurried vocalisms. Jarmusch's New York nasalities do little to support the dramatic text relayed and Chaykin, though he may look the part, speaks in such a thick and guttural feyness that one can't possibly fathom the picture a large Samoan in Gonzo/Lazlo. Regardless, the excerpts used are chosen well and the recording does sound excellent, but I implore anyone buying this to first read the book and to check out the movie as well. Oh, and don't forget about \\"Where the Buffalo Roam\\" a late Seventies movie gem starring Bill Murray As Hunter. It's excellent..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This was the funniest, most original books i have ever read and this vocal adaptation was excellent. The people who do the characters on her have so much passion and that really makes the story come alive. The movie adaptation was nowhere near as good as the audio book. The parts were not well played by johnny depp and that other guy. they picked the entirely wrong guy to play the lawyer. johnny depp was good but he lacked the intensity of the audio book.

I wanted it to heat water for tea, on days when I didn't feel like coffee, and for hot water for oatmeal. When I got the kettle, I was suprised by how petite it was, but this was not an issue for me. The small size lets it sit perfectly on my cabinet and holds plenty of water for 2-3 cups of hot beverage and oatmeal. I find that it does bring water to a full boil, and does so quickly. I never noticed a plastic-y taste, as some reviewers mentioned. When I opened the kettle, I let it sit overnight filled with soapy water, with the lid open. The next morning, I washed it out with soap and water. Then I ran a pot of water through the kettle, discarding the water. When I made my first cup to drink, I never noticed a plastic-y taste.

I had safety concerns with the electric cord and was worried that I would get shocked if I continued to try to use it. You can not fill the pot up or pour from it with the electrical cord attached or you risk the chance of electrical shock because the water will spill onto the cord/plug area. Therefore, every time you want to pour from it, or refill it with water to heat, you must unplug the cord from the pot and also from the wall outlet.I based my decision to purchase this unit solely on its cheap price.That was a mistake because I had to return it and purchase a different one. I made sure to purchase one that sits on a base and therefore you can fill it and pour from it without the worry of having an electrical plug attached to it and whether or not you may get it wet. The unit also takes too long to heat the water, compared to the cordless pots I have owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorts out","review":"Ugh!

You get what you pay for.The cord is extremely short, so I often have to unplug it before I pour. Also there is no bell or noise to indicate when the boil is done. But the worst thing is that steam can escape from the switch area at the top of the handle, so if you're not careful you can easily burn yourself when you pick it up right after the boiling stops. I have been burned one before, not fun.

I did not want to spend a lot and buy the expensive version that that keeps the water hot, like they have in China and Japan. I just wanted hot water fast. I have used this style in hotels in Sydney and other places and thought it would work and it did. It was a life saver! Very hot and fast too. You also don't need to use the stove! You can not put anything but water in this but if you like tea and just put a bag in the cup this is great!

I am 250 pounds and I have the strenth to push a cord on but it did not make a difference. I have to gently massage the connection to get it to work. Returning!

Like a sewage kind of smell and I completely lose my appetite. I thought it was just the first time I use it, so I tried to use it again but no. I've washed it thoroughly and everything and I just can't seem to get rid of that awful smell.

The cattle itself smells of plastic, if you leave water there and boil it later, the water smells of plastic a lot and even if you rinse the cattle and then fill it with fresh water that you boil right away, you can still smell the plastic from the water afterwards. And if that was not a problem, you have to unplug it before you can move it (or you are limited to the length of the cord) which might not be clear from the description or the picture.I though that smell of plastic could go away after you start using it.

I'm not 100% sure about the plastic taste everyone is talking about since being college students, my roommates and I use it for Cups of Noodles, or other quick foods that need hot water, especially hot chocolate.

I saw screws on the back of the container and maybe if I had had those tiny screwdrivers and like five hours of time I could have figured out a way to get the coil out to clean them, I'm not sure.

Also, it seems like there is some deposits on the heat cord as well. So, I'm really worried that it may contaminate the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"You really can't beat the price of this kettle. It's great value for the money. I've been using it several times a day now for the past 4 months and have never had any problems with it. There is just my husband and I, so a kettle this size is perfect for what we want. It has an automatic shut off when the kettle has finished boiling, which can be clearly heard from in the next room. This is very handy for me as I am usually busy doing other things while waiting for it to boil.If you're just looking for a cheap, reliable kettle to boil water for hot drinks or snacks, then this is more than adequate for the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"on-off sensor stopped working","review":"This product worked well for about two months of daily use, but then the on-off sensor stopped working causing the water to continue boiling until the electrical cord is unplugged from the wall outlet. While it is a nice, small kettle, it is inconvenient to have to plug it for use and unplug it afterward. I would have given it 4 stars had the sensor not malfunctioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain!","review":"I am so glad I took the time to invest in this little tea kettle for myself. The size is just perfect for 1-3 mugs of tea or instant coffee or hot cocoa. And, I can finally throw away that ugly old whistling teapot sitting on my stove top, which I can never keep clean enough and free from cooking splatters and scorch marks from the gas flame! This boils water very quickly, and I love the automatic shutoff feature. What a great price for this little gadget. It would make a great gift, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"It was great when I first bought it, but it began to fall apart after 3 months and stopped working in its 6th month. At first, the automatic shutoff stops working and then the light indicator went out. And one day, the whole thing just stopped working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and efficient","review":"edit- take about 6 minutes to boil when filled to max line, has a pastic smell to it when water is hotpros: cheap, boils water quite rapidly(a few minutes), holds about 6 cups of water.cons: can only boil water, no setting to keep the water boiling for a longer period of time(eg. to kill certain waterborne organisms you need to keep it at boiling for a few minutes), no magnetic power cord connection"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE it! ($15...)","review":"I bought this as a quick summertime replacement after purchasing a $100 one for the house- at first I thought that I wished it was available the first time I went shopping for one. Then, I realized:-the lid is awkward and leaks steam and water (you have to pour VERY carefully to not be burned and/or leaked on)- the water does indeed taste like plastic (I thought this would go away EVENTUALLY but didn't; boiled vinegar in it and now the water tastes like plastic AND vinegar...)-the auto-shut-off doesn't work regularly. Sometimes it boils for minutes, without shutting off.-cord is VERY short- one must constantly plug/unplug to use- a huge nuisance.I hate it. (So does my neighbor, who happens to have an identical one, which I found out as I was randomly complaining about it!)(What can I expect for $15?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not shut off automatically","review":"I have had this kettle for less than a week. In that week the automatic feature that shuts off the kettle when the water boils has stopped working. Also, it is hard to completely close the kettle top. Would not recommend this kettle at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap kettle did not last even light usage","review":"Tea or coffee tasted fine but if you were to drink just the hot water it tasted foul; never known that before?The on/off switch broke today; so after around 3 or 4 months I find myself spending more money on a new one. I only used it 2 or 3 times per day, usually for a small amount of water, so there was no excessive usage problems.I have used electric kettles all my life, and this is the first one that I have had a problem with. Cheap & nasty, I will be paying a little extra this time for something that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought the same product 4 years ago and made use of the Kettle almost every day for 4 years. The cord was eventually frayed so I purchased a \\"replacement\\". This product is far less superior to the original. The first clue is when you pick up the kettle, it feels like very cheap plastic - much lighter than the original. The largest problem is that you have to really push down on the top to close it so the kettle can automatically turn off when it boils. If you fail to do so, the kettle will keep boiling. It feels like you will almost break the top when you push down - it just feels \\"cheap\\". The cord is about 1/2 the length of the last cord -- which is very annoying when you are working in a small kitchen. The handle feels like it will separate in a few weeks time - again - just feels \\"cheap\\". I am torn about returning this item but I figure it's time to move onto a better quality kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"It does the job much better than the Rival Hotpot Express (which someone had lent me and broke quickly). I like the auto shut-off feature and the water boils fast enough. It's for my office and if I were to buy something for the home, I probably would have bought something a little sturdier and stylish. But for the price, it's a good value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a perfect item for a dorm room or office. The water heats very quickly and it automatically shuts off when the water is hot. Great for keeping your tea cup filled. My son used it when he had a cold; he didn't have to get up to go make another cup of tea - just kept the kettle by his side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely little unit","review":"This is a very nice product for the cost. I wish it kept the water hot once it turns off, because I tend to forget. But it heats up very nicely, fairly quickly, about 10 minutes, and shuts itself off. That's a key feature over potting a kettle on the stove - did I mention I tend to forget? When the water cools down too much, I turn it on again, and reheat it. This pot has convinced me that when it dies I'll be ready to pay more to get all the features I need. You can only get a good couple of cups of tea out of this at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for boiling again fast","review":"One big problem with this model - let's say you boil water once and you want to boil more water a little while later, the kettle won't let you turn it on. It's almost like the sensor setting is set to be too sensitive. Otherwise, water boils quickly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"I've been using this excellent kettle every day for well over a year and it does exactly what it's supposed to do and does it nicely.

I really wish I had listened to the other reviewers before buying this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaches dangerous chemicals","review":"Upon delivery, I discovered that this tea kettle is made from a type of plastic that leaches toxic chemicals, especially when heated. Even though it is less expensive than a metal one, please do not buy this or any other kettle that is made of softened plastic - you are risking your own and your family's health. For more information see the book THE BODY TOXIC by Nena Baker, or TOXIC SANDBOX by Libby McDonald, or EXPOSED by Mark Schapiro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for The Price","review":"I bought it because it was on sale for $12.99. It does the job. Every time I open the plastic lid I feel I will break it. Just a few tiny screws locking a very thin plastic lid (the boiling high temperature makes me feel worse).I believe it's not a good idea to boil water in plastic containers. Stainless or glasses is much safer and healthier. But they costs a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like some water with your plastic?","review":"This kettle is made entirely out of plastic. So you are essentially boiling your water in plastic. They say not to put plastic in the microwave, so my guess is you probably shouldn't boil your water in plastic, either. The reason the water tastes like plastic is because it's chock full of the stuff! Better to stick with a stainless steel kettle and have peace of mind about your health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water smells like plastic","review":"I bought this electric kettle and while it did heat water very quickly, once I opened the lid the whole pot of water reeked of plastic. Needless to say, the water was not drinkable.I don't know if I was stuck with a bad unit but I would not recommend this electric kettle. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal Corrodes","review":"I've had this kettle for about a year, and I wish I had spent money for a better product. When you put water in the kettle, it is exposed to the metal heating coil. The problem is that the coating on the metal corrodes very quickly, and bits of plastic flake into the kettle. This drastically impacts the taste of the water, to say the least. I agree with the other reviewers that said the kettle makes the water taste like plastic. Don't make the same mistake I made - spend a few more dollars to get a kettle that won't leave the water tasting like plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, fast but imparts a plastic smell and flavor to the water","review":"Although I've owned this kettle for several years I stopped using it shortly after purchasing because the water boiled in the kettle has an off-flavor. I've done all kinds of things to try to clean the kettle but it seems to be due to the materials used in its constructions. It's inexpensive and fast but I'm sorry to say that it's now in the trash. I'd like my teas and coffees to taste the way they're meant to taste and if I go to the trouble of filtering my water I see no point in boiling it in this kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, some shortcomings","review":"This is a great little kettle. I use it in my office to make tea throughout the day. It heats up very quickly, even when completely full it only takes about a minute to reach boiling. I did not notice a plastic taste and generally I am sensitive to these things. I have owned my kettle for almost a year now and its still going strong. Although, I live in Phoenix, AZ so it only gets heavy use during the winter time. It's small enough to store, out of the way, in my filing cabinet.My only gripe (and it's a big one) is the ridiculously short cord!!! It's only about a foot and a half long, which is ridiculous if you use the kettle anywhere other than your kitchen counter top. I use the kettle on my desk and all of my outlets are on the floor or at floor height. I had to buy an extension cord specifically for this little guy, but at only $15, I guess you get what you pay for.All in all a good, effective, inexpensive product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for heating water for French Press Coffee","review":"I am a coffee nut and wanted to get something to heat water that would compliment our French Press Coffee experience. This is a perfect appliance as it heats the filtered water we put into it and makes the best coffee ever in our French Press Maker. We don't get any plastic taste whatsoever and if you do it's only because you need to run a few cycles thru it. We are coffee and tea drinkers so this thing is so great I can't think of another appliance that is better. It sure beats micro waving or heating up water on your stove...total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke afer 3 months","review":"It did not boil water fast at all (maybe 2-3 minutes for a full liter) and broke after 3 months. It was also hard to use because the cord is short and you have to unplug it to pour the water into your cup. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and Customer Service","review":"I bought this Proctor Silex Electric Kettle in March of this year and used it once in late March. It worked fine until I decided to use it a second time two weeks later. The kettle wouldn't turn on and it just stopped working. When I posted a review about the kettle three weeks ago--noting its poor quality--the seller/company stated that it would give me a refund on my purchase if I delete the review. They failed to do so, and as a result, I've decided to write this review. This product isn't worth buying, and from now on I won't be buying any products from this seller/company.

The electrical cord 'shorted out' within the first week. The electrical cord is very short so you have to place your kettle next to an outlet unless you use an extension cord and unplug it to pour.

It's still a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic-flavored water gives me a headache","review":"Our unit produces boiled water with an unpleasant plastic flavor and smell. I occasionally also notice faint white foam on the surface that never evaporates or goes away. Drinking the water gives me a mild headache.Later we bought a kettle with a stainless-steel interior, and the headaches went away.The manual warns you that the first few times you boil water with it, the water will have a \\"plasticky\\" flavor. In our experience, that flavor never went away. We boiled water in it at least 20 times, using filtered water, and noticed the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong, \\"plastic\\" taste won't go away","review":"Have used the Bodum electric kettle for travel for years, but decided I'd purchase this Proctor Silex for the office since it was a few bucks cheaper. That was a mistake.Despite boiling and dumping out the water a half-dozen times, the water itself STILL tasted like \\"plastic.\\" Ick. As a tea drinker, the quality of the water is key. Also, I found the general shape difficult to handle, the lid was hard to open, and when gently pouring the water it consistently (and dangerously) sloshed out the sides near the spout.Anyway, I ended up giving this one away and buying an additional Bodum electric kettle for the office. It's working great, just like the 10-year-old Bodum I take traveling. (I think it's also interesting to note that the classic, no-frills, usable design of the Bodum has remain unchanged in the past 10 years - Hey, if it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as designed","review":"Arrived on time, without any problems, and works just fine.

I am throwing it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kettle, no plastic taste for me","review":"I have been using this kettle to make tea every day for over a year now. It is convenient and quick, and it saves me from letting a conventional stove kettle boil dry. I did boil several kettles full before I used it for tea the first time, but I have noticed no plastic taste at all. I filter the water I use which improves the taste of my tap water, but it is still quite hard, so I do get deposits on the exposed coil. I haven't cleaned it yet, and it still works perfectly.

Next time I'll check to make sure I'm buying a kettle of sufficient size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even for the price, it's not tolerable","review":"The biggest and most annoying drawback to this is the electrical cord that plugs into the product. Most of the Braun's have a charging station, so you can pick up the pitcher off the charger and not worry about the dangling cords. In this case, the cord is attached to it, so you either have it dangling around as you pour the boiling water, or you have to unplug it, which, really isn't that big of a deal, but compared to the Braun's where you just pick it up, it's kind of annoying to have to fumble with an electrical cord. Not to mention the length of the cord is retardedly short.Also, when I first received the product, it emitted a REALLY terrible plasticky smell the first few boils. I washed it with soap and water, and most of the smell has vanished.Personally, I think I would've just went with a Braun had I known, but it is $25-35 more expensive (worth it). I've used them before and have absolutely no complaints about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after two uses","review":"It seems like a good kettle, but mine stopped working after the second use.

It's small and easy to pack on deployments. It is not very solid though. So you have to be careful not to drop it. The cord is also short.HOWEVER, every down side to this thing does not matter once you heat up water with it. Why? Because it will heat the entire kettle to boil in about 20 seconds! I am not kidding. I was expecting a few minutes at least, but it is designed to rapidly heat water, and does a very good job of it. I turned it on, turned around and grabbed something, then heard it making noise. I though something was wrong, but found it was done already.Seriously, if you are in a hurry for hot water.

The automatic shut-off is essential, and it only takes about 2-3 minutes for the water to boil. It does get a little grimy build-up eventually but it's easy to clean.

It quickly boils the water, and as an extra bonus the kettle's very quiet. I can use it for tea and also if I want to speed up the process of boiling water for something like pasta or rice. It's great to use any time you need to heat a liquid quickly, not just for making tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would've expected better","review":"It works alright, but it has a big problem IMO. Normally with kettles, the power cable is connected to a platform which the kettle is put on. This makes it much more convenient to pick the kettle up, take it somewhere and bring it back without unplugging and plugging it, which is a cumbersome thing to do. This kettle doesn't have that.Also, I don't really like the taste of water boiled by this kettle, but I'm not sure if it's the tap water here or something wrong with the plastic of the kettle. If I had the choice now though, I would probably try another kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick little kettle","review":"This kettle is light weight and easy to manage.

Firstly, you have to really slam the lid shut tight (instead of having it closed but not to the far end), otherwise it won't stop heating automatically and will keep boiling till all water evaporates. That happened to me during the first use. Secondly, there is always this very annoying plastic smell in my water. I am not sure if that is because of my water quality (maybe something is in my water and reacting with the plastic?) or because of the poor plastic quality of the kettle.

I've burned up 3 beautiful looking, expensive kettles and set off my smoke detectors in the building each time causing distress and annoyance to the other tenants. I finally dug through boxes to reinstate my trusty, inexpensive, not very chic, Hamilton Beach Electric kettle out of sheer frustration. I'm so glad I did! It shuts off by itself, boils water faster than any of the others and doesn't leave me anxiously wondering if I 'left the kettle on' when I leave.I have hard water at both homes but I find that soaking the inside with vinegar every once in a while completely removes the calcium buildup. Buy this kettle! The quality and price can't be beat. Should mine ever fail me I will buy another just like it."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-f65afc9e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/5.md","filePath":"library/5.md"}'),H={name:"library/5.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
