All the kids I know that have watched this performance loved it! Good Job Guys!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh.... My.... God...","review":"This CD is beyond words. It is so different from their previous efforts. Tomorrow the Green Grass is the Jayhawks' finest hour of their first stage (5 stars), and this is their finest hour of stage two (also 5 stars). The first couple of songs are more musically accessible than the last half, but that is the great thing. They start swerving around during the second half (perfectly exemplified by 16 Down). The lyrical undercurrent of the album is so, so (to ape a Replacements' line) sadly beautiful. The lyrics speak to the underachiever in us all about the pain & loss the band has experienced; or at least felt like it has experienced. \\"Trouble\\" makes me want to cry & hug the band. \\"Man Who Loved Life\\" & \\"Big Star\\" talk of continuing on when no one really cares. Fitting songs all, from a band who has survived against the expectations of everyone to make a landmark album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jayhawks are incredible...","review":"The Jayhawks are one of my favorite bands and when I heard that Olson had left the group I was very skeptical of how this album would sond. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know how they did it, but they did. It is the best thing they have ever done (well, maybe tied for best with Tommorrow, the Green Grass).Everyone should write them a letter so they will continue to record, and Dammit start buying some of their albums!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A self indulgent trip down mid-tempo lane","review":"Mark Olson left the band, and this is what was left. There are some fine songs on this record , but they are few and far between - and compared to previous Jayhawks efforts, it is quite inferior.The last track, the Sound of Lies, is a classic, as is Bottomless Cup. The Man Who Loved Life is also a nice song.However, there are far too many slef indulgent mid tempo snoozers on this record. Louris is a great talent, but it appears his judgement on this record wasn't fine tuned.I really dislike to say it, but this record belongs next to all Izzy Stradlin's solo , Filter, and 4 Non-Blondes cd's at the used cd stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Olson=No Songwriting","review":"If you're a fan of \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" or \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\", as I am, you'll probably be very disappointed with \\"Sound of Lies\\". Gone are their trademark harmonies and catchy tunes. Instead of sticking with what they were best at, no-nonsense country rock, the band apparently chose to go in a whole new direction and ended up sounding like one of many very ordinary second-rate alternative bands. The absence of Mark Olson is very apparent, as the songwriting quality on this release is very poor..... It really bothers me to think what a great band they once were and how far they have fallen. Save your money for something you'll actually listen to more than once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Jayhawks album!","review":"\\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" is an awesome album, no question about it. It's a classic, almost flawless effort that sounded familiar the first time I hear it and which doesn't stray from its core genre. \\"Sound of Lies\\", on the other hand, is a much more complex, diverse, challenging and nuanced album that keeps growing more and more interesting with repeated listenings. For me, one hallmark of a great album is how many songs can be your favorite over time. With \\"Sound of Lies\\", that's about half of the album. I just don't get tired of listening to this one. The songwriting, the singing, the musicianship, everything is first-rate and it all fits together. Having seen the Jayhawks in concert last year, I should add too that Gary Louris is a phenomenal and vastly underrated guitar player. This is definitely one of my \\"desert island\\" albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leicester Bangs Review (1997):","review":"The Jayhawks - Sound Of Lies (American)Hands up everyone who thought we'd seen and heard the last of The Jayhawks. With the departure of Mark Olson the general consensus was that they wouldn't record again, but they're back with what's proving to be a fine album.The first side is classic Jayhawks. Gary Louris is in great voice, and the harmonies with Karen Grotberg add a whole new dimension to the band. With one quality song after another, it's good to hear them back again and on top form.The piano led opener \\"The Man Who Loved Life\\" provides the perfect start, before \\"Think About It\\" and \\"Trouble\\" begin kicking in. The latter reminiscent of CSN's \\"Our House\\", though nowhere near as annoying. Other highpoints include \\"Big Star\\", \\"Haywire\\" and \\"Dying On A Vine\\"Some songs do miss Olson's voice but \\"Sound Of Lies\\" is still a great record from a great American band."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This Traveling Band Was Not Well Recieved...\\"","review":"That sentiment, from the album's \\"Big Star\\", sums up more than a decade's worth of frustration and confusion as the Jayhawks found themselves suddenly without co-founder Mark Olson. It is in this bare-bones and honest assesment of his friendships and his career that de-facto leader Gary Louris turns in his and the groups most personal album to date. In stark contrast to 95's \\"tomorrow the green grass\\", the guitars are turned waaay up, the harmonising almost vanquished. This is one of the best rock bands in America crashing down, determined to re-invent themselves without playing to modern gimmicks. This is an all new Jayhawks. Hallelujah."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joyous LP","review":"I hadn't really heard anything about The Jayhawks until I got hold of a copy of 'Weird Tales' by Golden Smog. The Gary Louris tracks really stood out (e.g. Jennifer Save Me) and so I thought I'd sample one of their albums...and what an album. Each song, be it a ballad or a straight ahead rock track, soars. The band have an all too rare ear for great harmony and melody in songs which also have depth. This band will never be that big in the UK. However for the enlightened few on this side of the pond this album is a rare treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"The Jayhawks were introduced to me by my brother a few years ago. The Sound of Lies completes my Jayhawks catalogue. I agree with some of the other reviewers when they write about each Jayhawks disc being strong but distinctly crafted works. Sound of Lies gets better with each listen. A great cd to play along with on your acoustic guitar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fans of Les Blank won't be disappointed","review":"J'ai Ete Au Bal is loaded with toe-tappin performances and fascinating interviews by musicians like Clifton Chenier, Canray Fontenot, Harry Choates, Marc & Ann Savoy, and countless other brilliant Cajun and Zydeco performers. Also, some of these musicians talk about the origins of Cajun and Zydeco music, as well as the differences between the two. Unlike musicians in many other forms of music, you really believe these musicians play for the sheer love of the music (they sure aren't in it for the money, because most of them aren't making much of it). J'ai Ete Au Bal will make a fan of Cajun and Zydeco music out of anyone. Another great film from Les Blank and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Blank does it again","review":"This documentary on Cajun/Zydeco and its evolution is a delight. It covers what people do in Louisiana, when they're not eating. (grin)Has the same feel Blank's \\"Chulas Fronteras\\".His \\"Yum, Yum, Yum\\" (on Cajun cooking---which covers the rest of what Cajuns do when they aren't dancing and singing)(double grin) is one of my top favorite videos of all time, and I worked in a media library for years, so I've seen a LOT of video/film. A lot of Blank's stuff is hard to find, and often can only bought public performance (expensive). If the price seems a bit high, just know these are videos you will watch over and over.Watching this video and \\"Yum\\" back to back----It's the next best thing to a trip to Louisiana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aye eee!","review":"For Cajun music perveyers, I found this an excellent all round great pick. It documentary style didn't lessen the music or the personalities of the various musicians and the times they lived through. There's plenty of music and interesting stories that takes you through the history of not only the music, but the Cajun culture. Though a bit of an old production, it remains timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"This method of instruction just does not work.","review":"I will post this to the first four books of the series, which I bought all at once.I was hoping this series, as popular as it seems to be, would be the Go equivalent of Yasser Seirawan's \\"Play Winning Chess,\\" but this series has nothing in comparison. I agree with other reviews that describe the books' lack of depth. There is actually so little information presented in the first four volumes, that they might as well be combined into one book for the same price as one of the books. There are also glaring typographical errors throughout every copy.Don't let the glossy covers fool you, in my opinion, this book series is nothing but a money grab. (This volume would be a great accomplishment, if it were 1000 pages longer...Most of the book lightly brushes upon the life and death of stones, but in doing it so lightly, it really does not convey any worthwhile information for playing the game)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd rocks","review":"Although Ice T only raps on the title track, if you are expecting an Ice T record!!

Reading Tara's prose is the next-best thing to visiting Hawaii. Her lyrical depictions of the surface of the water or the texture of the palm fronds, are as rich as any photograph could be.

You could easily visualize her mother's ways. How any of Karen's daughters survived to become responsible humans, is a miracle. I also loved the history in the book. The ending was very anticlimatic, but then Karen appears to be the toughest drug addict ever. Very sad that she wasn't considered sick enough for a psyciatric hospital, despite the suspected knowledge that she was injecting herself literally anywhere she could...her feet and possibly her face. I also found it touching that three sisters all by different fathers, where able to stay close when the one person they have in common is such a lost cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Peek Into Another World","review":"Book is well-researched - the history & descriptions of Hawaii. Overall, this book is a tribute to her mother, and I feel sorry for Tara, now in her early 30's. She has not ACCEPTED that her mother is a self-centered, immature, lying, thieving, irresponsible, promiscuous drug addict; Karen could care less about Tara and her sisters. Tara's own life is on hold - no husband or children - while she waits for Karen (\\"Still, I have hope for the living\\") to grow up. She needs to accept reality.

The photography is simply gorgeous and it's worth buying just for that. Sister Wendy's analysis of the figures is full of her usual insight, and free of the condescension one might fear from a religious person discussing pagan deities.

The only thing this dance pad met was that it had a wire that could connect to my PS2 and that it wouldn't slide around.The pad itself is VERY crinkly and it seems almost baggy, like there's an excess amount of nylon-plastic. The good news is, it's slightly thicker than the regular thin plastic dance pads (the red-pink-blue ones)Unfortunately, it makes a loud crinkly noise - similar that of a diaper made from wrapping paper.The box says \\"more sensitive\\" so you're \\"less likely to miss\\" but it's a bit TOO sensitive. The arrows extend a little farther into the center, so even if you stand in the middle, you're likely to hit a button that you don't want to hit.If you're a beginner and you don't have any expectations for a dance pad or you'd like a durable dance pad that's better than the thinner ones - then you should buy this pad.But for 14.99, you should be reminded that your expectations shouldn't be very high."},{"rating":"2","title":"This pad is totally worth the money","review":"I'm new to DDR,and I wanted to buy a good dance pad,but didn't want to pay alot of moneyfor one.This pad is really great for anyone,beginner or advanced player.I liked the fact that the pad won't slide around while you're dancing,and the buttons on the pad respond verywell so you won't miss any dance steps.Overallthis is a great pad.I've only had it for a few months,but I think I'll get alot of play out ofit for a long time.Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"dance pad","review":"best pad for the price very happy with performance. works for all sizes adult to five. kids love ours"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR, MAJOR SCAM","review":"This may be one of the biggest scams perpetrated on music fans since Milli Vanilli.Billed as a \\"tribute\\" disc by \\"various artists,\\" one might reasonably expect to hear Goo songs performed by an assortment some of today's better pop/rock/alternative artists.

I came away from this one with an \\"oh, well\\" kind of feeling. While I appreciated the author's fact based account, I was never able to really \\"get into\\" this story. McDaniel came from a life of extreme poverty to become the first Black person to win an Academy Award. The book goes into great detail about McDaniel's life story, her parentage, her work in vaudeville, her work on screen and on radio. We also read about her multiple marriages, her fight with the NAACP and her last days as she fought diabetes and breast cancer. The running theme of this book is courage and perserverance, of which Ms. McDaniel had a lot. I wouldn't recommend this for purchase, best to get it from the library. 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't bother to finish it...","review":"I purchased this book for my book club and was terribly disappointed. This book is full of grammatical errors and mistatements. The author writes like a historian and is very lengthy in her descriptions of Ms. McDaniel's life. The cover is right when it says \\"exhaustively detailed\\"...READER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"I had looked forward to reading this book but was so disappointed. Hattie seemed a lovely woman and good actress but this book bored me to tears. And the repetition of complete paragraphs was disgraceful. Truly the worst book I have ever read in any genre. A shame Miss McDaniel's name was connected to it. Save your money and rent Gone With the Wind instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of the word count consists of one word - racism.","review":"Get this one from the library. It's more of a history of racism (as defined by the author) than of the great Hattie McDaniel. Hardly a sentence is written throughout the whole thing that doesn't remind the reader that there are racial differences and history behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I was looking forward to reading an in-depth biography of Miss McDaniel - this wasn't it. Very dry reading, and for some reason the author felt the need to use the subject's full name in every sentence. If you didn't know who you were reading about just by the title of the book, you would certainly be sure of it by the end of the first chapter. By the end of the book, you were sick to death of the name Hattie McDaniel. Definitely written by a teacher, not an author who had any interest at all in her subject. A truly boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very poor recording","review":"I was very disappointed when I received this CD.

It's actually very good - just different. I guess it's like when Bob Dylan went electric - some of us just were not ready for it at the time.

The Ramones have the catchiest tunes out of any band's exsistance. Get This One!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disaster!","review":"Only Phil Spectar could kill a Ramones record. Bad idea, still bad. The Ramones are my favorite band, have been for years. I own all of their albums, and play, wear-out, and rebuy all of the albums. From \\"Ramones\\" to \\"Mondo Bizzaro\\". But this album, the only one, I never pick up to play. I have it on vinyl, from the early 80s, its the olny one I did'nt replace to cd.Over produced, horn sections, wall-of-sound? Hello! Three cords, four leather jackets, a grimy club and a thousand fans was the magic. Not trying to find where to put keyboards into a Ramones album. I hate to blast a Ramones record, but buy another one, any one.

Thats from a middleage women to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bad production can't ruin good songs","review":"Controversial.. blah blah..You already know the story.Phil Spector's production on this album is awful. The sound is muddy, the group's instruments are buried under layer after layer of god knows what, and if there's one band that has no need for friggin echo, it's the Ramones. All that said, there are some great songs here. It's the same 50s and 60s influenced Ramones of earlier albums. It's just unfortunately muted a bit by the production.My favorite song on the album is Danny Says. It's a really nice Velvet Underground homage (who themselves often paid tribute to the same type of music that the Ramones obviously loved). Danny Says is also the only song on the album which doesn't seem to suffer from Spector's overproduction. In fact, Spector may well have been the best producer the song could have possibly had.If you're a fan of the Ramones, you'll probably like the album. Whether you love it or not will probably depend on WHY you like the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fl*ppin' Album!","review":"So Many Great songs! GREAT! GREAT songs.I stayed away from this one for some reason.How did I ever think this was inferior to their other stuff in any way?I think some d*ck friend of mine liked this; that must be why I steered away from it.Stands with and above any raw crazy rock ever.And it sounds great. Folks who whine about this audio quality must have set some real strict expectations on the Ramone's sound.I don't know the back story and it sounds great to me.It sounds authentic, high-fi, rockin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Production matters","review":"Phil Spector should have been on trial for murder years ago. Murder of an entire band's appeal. I'm a pretty big Ramones fan, and I'll be the first to admit their later work is totally lame, but the blood of this record is on Spector's probably alreadly bloodied hands. (I mean, chances are, right?) Don't get me wrong, his wall of sound works some places - - pretty much of all of his work with The Righteous Bros. is quality i.e. \\"Unchained Melody\\", but \\"End of the Century\\" is totally flat. Even still, the music on it is only OK. If someone somewhere pulled a \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" on this album I would at most give it 2.5 stars. Anyway, save your money. Personally, I wouldn't even check this out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"This album is kind of strange . . . one of the world's fastest punk bands it seems is trying to give way to pop songs without any really hard edge to them. Only a few songs are memorable, some are funny, but really a pretty weak effort. The cover is better than the music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you know you care about what I have to say","review":"This is my personal favorite Ramones album. Yes, the first few had all of their greatest hits (Blitzkrieg Bop, Judy is a Punk, Sheena is a Punk Rocker, etc) but this one has great song after great song after great song. From the pioneer-ska song of \\"Do You Remember Rock & Roll Radio?\\" to the powerful statement in \\"Let's Go!\\" to the kick-... energy in \\"Return of Jackie and Judy\\" and \\"Chinese Rock\\", and even down to the sentimental side of the Ramones in \\"Danny Says\\", this album just works on all levels, so if you're a Ramones fan, and you don't have this, buy this! If you think the Ramones are a one note/they get old fast band, buy this! If you don't fit into either category, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight","review":"This cd is tight.

I don't feel I am mechanically challenged but this was the ultimate, deliberate, total confusion on how to put this thing together. They couldn't have put all the instructions for one style in a contiguous listing? And each section was completely vague on what bike(s) it was referring to, like no model numbers, model families/ranges, etc., just vague high level descriptions. After 20 minutes of reading, I gave up trying to figure out what to do and passed the bike on to my next door neighbor who has a son, to build, and grandson, to ride, who could possibly make some sense and use out of this.

Although the rear axle is heavy steel, why risk banging it up?) Just remember that a trike drives differently than a bike. My two wheeled bicycle can weave in and out of rush-hour traffic, as well as go on uneven surfaces, hilly terrain, etc. The Schwinn Tricycle is best on flat surfaces and can't weave in and out of heavy traffic easily (it is not designed as a racing bike because of its heavier rear).

The fenders do not fit properly and don't seem very durable. They rub the tires because they don't fit properly (they don't cover the tires). Had to adjust the rear chain already. Of course, it is past the date to return it so I will just have to keep trying to find out where the clunking is coming from. Meanwhile, my special needs daughter is not very happy either.

I have never owned a adult 3 wheel bicycle, but this was definatly not made to drive on anything but flat surfaces with little grade. My mother almost drove hers into the ditch after several attempts riding it on a slight grade. The seat springs are very weak making the stability issue more prevailant.

Furthermore, it is asymmetrical powerwise, it steers to right. Basket is heavy, but you may decide not install it or replace it with a lighter one. The assembly instructions were poor. If you need it for exercise or mobility, it is not a good choice. It is heavy, it takes storage space, and it requires a lot of power.

The book is alive, and if you put in only a few hours per week, you can finish it in three months or less. After finishing the first book -Level 1- and this one, you will then be able to read Hebrew text from the Chumash, and it will change your sense of the Five Books of Moses"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hebrew Level 2","review":"I just finished Level Two. My favorite chapter story was #7: \\"Saving Lives\\". This is a good series, but has two drawbacks: 1) the glossaries do not contain all the words used in the book. 2) there are no answer keys to the exercises. This is OK if you have a teacher, but for those of us studying on our own, it can be a problem.

I have two cats, just about a year old now, and they made a terrible mess with the sand litter I was using. Plus, I had only had one cat before and I had underestimated the increase in smell with two cats. So I tried this stuff although it is considerably more expensive than I wanted to pay. I just love it. The cats still manage to knock some of it out of the box, but there's far less mess than there was with the sand, which seemed to get all over the place. And it masks the odors very well (not completely, but better than anything else). The litter does have a distinct smell--it reminds me of the kind of smell one finds around barns with the hay and horse feed. I notice some people find it objectionable, but I rather like it. And it's much, much better than the cat pee smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must read... really, I needed to read it for college","review":"this is one of the worst books I was forced to read.

Navarro is accompanied by Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis on several of the cuts here. Who knew? The combination of Navarro, polished and sophisticated, with Davis, earthy and virile, works amazingly well here. Navarro never plays a dull or indifferent solo. There's always a lot of fire and precision. His playing embodies the elite bebop trumpet styles of Dizzy Gillespie, Kenny Dorham, and Clifford Brown. On the other hand, Davis is the perfect foil for Navarro. He plays athletically in the lower registers, evoking the honkers and screamers of the bar walking tradition. It sounds like these two styles couldn't possibly work together, but magically they do. The contrast is exactly what makes this work. Even though I love bebop, I always considered it kind of cerebral and oddly remote. But when I hear Navarro and Davis work together, I'm thinking, who knew mainstream bebop could be so soulful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Origins of Man","review":"Excellent BBC documentary on the origins of man.

The actors playing the cave people look just like that--modern day actors playing cave people. I can just see the director saying,\\"Blake, you're hungry! You're tired! You just killed the mammoth and must carry meat back to your mate! Makeup--he needs more grime!\\". It's bearable the first time you watch it, but then you spend the next time through hoping that some big predator will leap into the scene and crunch them all so you don't have to watch it again.

Having now watched Walking With the Dinosaurs at least sixty times, I can definitely tell you to save your pennies & get a different DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the realism","review":"What made the \\"Walking With...\\" series worth seeing was the creation of photo-like moving pictures of prehistoric animals as they may of been. \\"Walking With Cavemen\\" falls far short of this. Modern humans have bigger heads and higher foreheads than early Hominids. Putting actors in monkey suits results in unbeleivable pictures of early ape-men with big heads and high foreheads.This series has always tended to spoil the images with cheap melodrama, and this one even more so. In real biology the herbivores have to greatly outnumber the carnivores. In the \\"Walking With...\\" movies they always seem to have a world where its the other way round.Give us more beautiful images, and less violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD on this subject","review":"Having watched the tv debut of this series, then the purchased DVD I would have to complement the final product as a better effort, especially from the choice of narration. This topic is very difficult to do, especially with animation of human-like animals where we can be more critical than with dinosaurs. The story lines are a bit tedious but interesting. Still it is difficult to believe we can reconstruct the behavior of the apes and human predecents based on our current database. I still think the effort is worthy. The graphics are very well done, possible not appropriate for a young viewer. In one scene the \\"cavemen\\" kill a hooved animal and then degut and eat it. My wife sent our 7 year old out of the room on that one! Perhaps it is such realism that makes the Walking With series so well received. Overall a good effort and worthy purchase for such a difficult and challenging subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking with Cavemen","review":"This documentary is totally inappropraite for children and should not be advertised as a part of the \\"Walking with...\\" series.

Her clarity and colorful insights into the music are revealing. She's more faithful to the score than the average, and her dynamics are more contrasting. The Finale of the Symphonie is exciting, although not as passionate as Gibbons', with the only restriction of a lack of technical endurance in the middle of the movement, the brilliant passage before re-exposition. Even so, most of the time she negotiates the difficulties of the piano writing very well.The Magnard is not familiar to me, but I really liked it. Her performance is penetrating and inviting. It was a revelation to me.I didn't rate this CD a 5 star because of Alkan's performance of Marche Funebre and Chanson de La Folle Au Bord La Mer which sounded a little cold to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nancy Drew book Ever!","review":"I have read many Nancy Drew books and I am continuing to read them.

Of course, it still disheartens me to see the ranks of individuals that try to discredit him. Unfortunately for them, Noam does thorough research on his arguements.

Not to be missed is the question and answer session in the special feature part of the movie. In it, Chomsky takes on some pretty hard-on questions such as How would he respond to 9 11 and his take on the guerilla campaigns in parts of South America.Chomsky's thesis is irrefutable: we are all hypocrites and we are all responsible for our government's actions.

Mr. Chomsky's arguments concerning Iraq are equally erroneous in that they describe that country as though it is almost as benign as Switzerland. More accurately, Iraq is 99% Muslim and is therefore dedicated to imposing ubiquitous Sharia. The schism between el Qaeda and Saddam has only to do with bickering over who will be the next Caliphate.

NO wonder that Shore and Baldwin's careers have evaporated. Imagine ten year old kids who have access to a camcorder and you still could not fathom how bad this movie is.

If you watch the interaction between Baldwin's and Shore's characters you see lot of things taking place that two straight men would never do. A lot of the jokes play on homsexual subtexts. I watched this move twice with two groups of guys and said nothing and everyone in each group said the same thing afterwards. Not that they thought the movie itself was gay (it was just bad), but that the actions of the two male leads were very homosexual in nature and would be very reminiscent of what a gay couple might do."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were You Thinking Big Bertha!","review":"This movie doesn't even come close to as great as Son-In-Law was, I guess thats all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is unwatchable.","review":"This movie makes me want to vomit.

We are supposed to believe that Shore and Baldwin are two lovable scamps, but they come across as two obnoxious idiots who aren't the least bit funny. I can't believe that Baldwin, who has talent, would appear in a Pauly Shore film, who couldn't prove he had a glimmer of talent to save his life. I tried to watch this film when it premiered on cable but I gave up halfway through. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocently Stupid","review":"This movie is hilarious. Of course, I really like Pauly Shore and have pretty much loved every movie that he has been in. I like how they (Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin, who has gorgeous eyes, btw) are innocently stupid, totally ruin the experiment (you could see it coming from the second they decided to stop at the \\"mall\\" and pee, but who cares, it is still funny) and then do their best to rectify the situation. I guess I like it because I am really into trying to save the planet and it shows that if we all worked together (instead of about 99.7% of the people just trashing it) we might actually have a chance at saving the planet, also it was really fricken funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUIT HOGGIN' THE K-Y!!!","review":"If the Peace Corps is the toughest job you'll ever love, then Biodome is the stupidest movie you'll ever laugh at.

What passes for comedy these days is darker than the news of another Twilight sequel in the works.But the worst, the most untalented, the greatest affront to not just comedy in our nation or on our planet, but the universe itelf...is the abomination that is Pauly Shore.I know his parents owned the Comedy Store on Sunset Boulevard--that explains HOW he got in--what makes no sense at all is that he finds a job after pinching off another grotesquely-failed assault at humor.The horror...the horror...."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Wrongs make a super wrong...","review":"Take 2 bad things and put them togerther to make something incredibly bad, namely Pauli Shore and Stephen Baldwin.

Actor\\\\VJ pauly Shore plays a role of a Junior College Student. Him and his best friend (Stuby) get locked inside of a Bio-Dome for one year. What most people will NOT figure out about this movie is that its Jack Blacks' (Shallow Hal, Orange County) First Movie but do not quote me on that, and also, if thats not all, Australian Sensation Kylie Minoge also plays a very important part in the film.

Your friends may abandon you, your dog will leave you (shave poochie poochie!), and you'll forever be labeled as that sad, bio-dome addict, but hey, who needs a dog anyway? Get a squirrel! (Only make sure he doesn't get anywhere near the fertilizer or kerosene) I also have to warn you that if you're a snobby movie critic, you will, without a doubt, hate this movie.

We have Pauley \\"the Weasel\\" Shore doing his thi-ing. Then we have the black-sheep of the Baldwin clan; Billy. Together they land themselves in a major scientific experiment. The story is well dumb, but could have better if actual funny people could have played their roles. Shore and Baldwin just try too hard at being something they are not:funny!

That's why I love Bio-Dome. It's just silly all over. The concept is utterly ridiculous...2 stoner community college kids mistake an enclosed environment, the bio-dome, for a mall and get trapped inside for a year. If you enjoy Pauly Shore in all his silly glory, you'll have a lot of fun with Bio-Dome. Don't take it too seriously...just watch and laugh. For those who enjoyed Encino Man and Son-in-Law, Bio-Dome will do the trick.

But most of this was just plain tedious. So much so that I got up and took a shower, and when I came back I felt like I had missed absolutely nothing.

Five or ten minutes went by and I was approched by the theater manager. \\"You must be watching Bio Dome\\", he said. I responded with \\"yes I'm afraid so\\".

No. (And I love both of those movies.) However, it is funny. Yes, the plot is unbelievable. And the characters are two-dimensional. However, there are some really strange, weird, funny jokes in it that made me laugh.To all the people who didn't like it - I understand that Pauly might not strike you as funny. There is a fine line between really annoying and funny - and for me Pauly is on the funny side of that line. However, for the folks who think that it has no worth, that all copies should be destroyed, and nobody in the world should ever watch it again - Really?

Fortunately, not only is \\"Bleed\\" a great song, but on this album I found three or four other songs which were just absolutely amazing. The entire album is actually very, very good. Its style throughout has moments that are a little too heavy for my particular tastes at this point, but a few years back I would have been calling this album perfect (I gave it five stars only because I couldn't give it four and a half). In my opinion, this is how metal should be done. It has varied use of piano and keyboards, clear (but still powerful) vocals, some great riffs & leads and, most importantly, a tremendous sense of melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST POWERFUL BAND TO COME ALONG SINCE SAVATAGE!!","review":"For years I have been waiting for a band that would impress me as much as Savatage has for years. Though no-one can impress me like Savatage and Trans-Siberian Orcestra (same band-different names), these guys certaintly do a fantastic job. The best band to come around in years. The vocals are very clean and amazing, superb talent. The musicians here are all very well organized, much talent. I put these guys in a class of their own. I don't think they sound like any other band out there on the market today.

This was the Talking Heads's first album. It was released in mid-September of 1977. The songs have very cheerful tunes, but the single, \\"Psycho Killer,\\" is a little different. It's a psychedelic tune that is \\"David Byrne's Signature Song.\\" This album would later be a landmark album. The reason I give it four stars is because it's a little raw. It was produced by Tony Bongiovi, Lance Quinn and Talking Heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Talking Heads album EVER!!!!!!","review":"This album is a MUST for every Talking Heads fan. It's wonderful sound is simple yet complex and none of their proceeding work comes closes to touching it. Songs like Tentative Decisions and Happy Day are masterpeieces. Psycho Killer is only the tip of the iceberg on this album. The first track reels you right in and links together the rest of the album.

It felt like we had landed on another planet. There were a lot of folks with longish hair sitting on the floor clearly confused by the sounds they were hearing, while the Talking Heads sweated and pumped out their intense,somewhat dissonant but hot/cool, funk/punk, rock and roll. Thirty or so art school types jumped around in front of the band like it was the second coming of what's his face. I'll never forget it and I never have. Wow! My record collection expanded remarkably after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have in Any Album Collection","review":"This is the definitive Talking Heads record. The Heads were basically art geeks from RISD in 1977. While Led Zeppelin was wowing kids from the Island at Madison Square Garden with guitar riffs and light shows (& I love Zep!), Talking Heads were singing quirky energetic songs like \\"PSYCHO KILLER\\", and \\"NEW FEELING,\\" \\"PULLED UP,\\" \\"THE GIRLS WANT TO BE WITH THE GIRLS,\\" \\"DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE GOVT\\" and more. They played at seedy clubs like CBGB blew people away with ther nerdy hyper intensive style. This is top notch stuff. I still listen to it 25 years after I first heard it. It blows me away even now.

He's got a far better strike rate than Raphael though, and whether that's because the acts he works with are more fully formed is a moot point, they're certainly more fully formed when he leaves their company. The Singles are a case in point, they hail from Detroit (of course) but they don't go in for all that sub-swamp blues/garage malarkey, rather they prefer to batter their way around a seam of power-pop that's more rock than roll. For a while there Detroit looked like it had been relocated to Louisiana, here though it sounds like someone's humped it on to a trawler and dragged it across the Atlantic to Liverpool. That's some trick, and this is some band.Suzie Q"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money- This book is awful.","review":"This book is just terrible. I bought it as a reference and to so that I wouldn't have to write down everything from dance class. But upon reading it I find almost every dance is presented in ways I have never been taught or seen practiced in any of the clubs here in San Antonio. I think maybe the Salsa step was the same and some the rumba but all the other dances just look wrong. Also the dance frames shown are the type of holds I have been taught as wrong. ( hand on the poor girls kidney instead of higher up.)

Give it a try, I can assure you that you will spend a lot more for other discs that you will enjoy much less. This CD is best when listened to as a whole... while there were singles released in 1983 the songs form a journey that is best taken in the dark, cool, calm of night.

I think it's great. The case fits well, although the printed symbols don't line up exactly with the symbols on the player and it is a little slick. The belt clip did take a minute to figure out but once you discover it screws off it's not a problem to attach. The kickstand allows the player to stand up on my desk so I can see the information scroll by as the music plays. The screen protectors prevent scratches. I think the people complaining about scratches had the case with plastic cover, not the LCD screen protectors. (PCMicrocenter.com has both versions if you want to compare) I like the cover and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but could be much better","review":"Like the other reviewers, I did have some problems attaching the beltclip. Some sort of instructions would have been nice.

Originally I had purchased the leather case but didn't like the fact that it made the player look bulky. So the solution, or so I thought, was this cover. upon arrival everything looked pretty good. It fit snug, came with screen protectors. After having it on for about a week I removed to find that it had scratched the holy hell out of my player!!! The very thing I bought the stupid thing TO PREVENT! In all honesty there are now between 40-100 small scratches and circular scratches on my player.

First, it's on the slick side -- I had a similar case for a different player that had more grip to it, giving it a much more secure feeling in the hand. Second, the material bordering the screen discolored almost immediately; within a day it went a light yellowish brown.

Small dust particles and debris entered through the slide-touch opening, and completely destroyed the acrylic surface. Now I have to purchase a cleaner, and even that may not be enough to remove all the scratches this case has caused. On top of that, the metal stand has two rubber tubes that keep the player upright--in time, these tubes will stretch, eventually rendering the stand useless (the tubes will roll back, causing the player to lay prone).I give it two stars because I can still keep it in the case, I guess?Thank you for reading my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"no screen protectors","review":"Half the reason I chose this product was to get the included screen protectors, which weren't included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Clip Broke, Lost My Zen","review":"The belt clip broke on day 3 after I got it.

It's just that little bit of quirkiness that keeps this from being no more than an ordinary story from the days when Hollywood was cranking out a new romance/musical/comedy about every week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated","review":"The art direction in this movie is incredible. It is one of the ultimate \\"New York as nightlife fantasyland\\" films (like the 1936 Melody, and Astaire's own \\"Swing Time\\"). The DVD replicates the silky B&W images just fine, especially the finale, which looks incredible on a big screen TV. Though Astaire tended to blow this off as \\"one of those big Metro things\\", it is a fun movie with a cool Big Band feel and a dream soundtrack, and Eleanor Powell is a revelation--it's too bad she isn't as well known today. Though the silly harlequin ballet doesn't really belong, I'll still take this over the pretentious MGM musicals of the 50s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fabulous","review":"This movie was corny but the dancing was terrific...the quality of the video was very good...received in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy and funny musical","review":"I happened to catch this on TV some several months ago and I really liked it.

If you're easily offended or put off by the type of content you'll find in here, don't buy it. If you're looking for debauchery, you've come to the right place.Personally, I wasn't really shocked by anything I read so far...but we're living in a more jaded time than the one the Grand Marquise lived in.

And it is not easy because we know that the kind of conduct described is not just Sade's imagination. We see cruelty, torture and degradation everyday in the news and around us, sometimes sponsored by institutions that are supposed to defend human dignity and justice...but sadly, we are getting used to it...or worst, some of us even try to bring up justifications to it...But maybe Sade is correct and we are just being hypocrites about all this because we happen to be the weak side...Who knows??

But the place he died in was because of this book. Let that be known as a fact, that he was arrested and held by Napolean because he was believed to be the Anonymous writer of Justine, which he was. This book is what placed him in the asylum until his death. He was a sick mad man. But he was also a sick genius. And in the end it wasn't his bad nature that put him in jail, but his \\"bad\\" words.

This failed attempt to turn a life-philosophy into a novel (if that was even the goal?) De Sade could have used an editor (I guess no one wanted to share a cell with him), the book is extremely repetitive. The characters are not people, just mouth pieces for De Sade and his detractors. As a work of literature it is as big a failure as Ayn Rand's literary efforts to advocate her libertine philosophy in the economic sphere with \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" You may complain that literature wasn't his aim.

It is long enough to suggest that starting at the beginning of the book is the long way around to finding what everybody knows.

Ironic that a show set in the future can be so depressingly stuck in the past when it comes to race-based \\"comedy\\". Perhaps the creatives should be pitied for being brought up in an environment where slurs against the British are regarded as acceptable and even normal, despite so obviously shocking this is the the rest of the world.

The rest is a mix of sloppy extras acting, repeated scenes of guards walking and running up and down and some bad CSO that hadn't been seen since the Pertwee era. There's a neat premise with the Minyons looking for their long lost race bank so their culture and people won't disappear. Their race bank is hidden in the middle of the newly born planet protected by the insane computer, the Oracle. Sounds decent, but it just moves at a snail pace.

He would burden his customer support staff with the task of \\"selling\\" ideas to already frustrated callers, most of whom lack the authority to 'give the OK' or make any type of company or corporate sales. It's the type of strategy that is responsible for the moral degradation of America's business ideology, a pass-the-buck ideal where the responsibility to generate sales is placed upon the lowest common denominator and shifts the blame off those who are truly responsible.

I've read every book on it that I've come across, both mundane-oriented and spiritually-oriented oriented. Yet there was always something that I just didn't \\"get\\". And after each book I previously read, I came away with the thought, \\"Okay, but now what do I do with it all?\\"Finally I get it. Jaxon-Bear is seeing from beyond the fixation of the Ennea-type looking back on the true nature of the entire system. He is not aligned with other books on the Enneagram because he is not caught IN the illusion of the fixated type, he has his perspective to see the entire game.I am now free of my compulsion to act out my type, while still allowing for the inclinations of my type, while enjoying the liberation to not BE my type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also somewhat disappointed","review":"I agree with the other slightly disappointed reviewer. The author too often relies on stereotyping, generalizing and anecdotes. I thought, the enneagram refers to the character of individuals. If that is so, how can Jaxon-Bear refer to entire countries as one type if they are made up of highly diverse individuals. Where do drop-outs or regime critics fit in who were born and raised in a country? That is where his stereotyping (mostly negative anyway, i.e. Austrians only bathe once a week) comes in. How can the author consider himself spiritual and still revert to such superficial narrow-mindedness? On the positive side, he does give some valuable insights in childhood dynamics and trauma that would explain fixations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced insights into the Enneagram","review":"This was such a good and insightful book on the study and practical use of the Enneagram model for personality typing. As something I have been studying and developing a growing interest in over the last six months, this book has truly complimented my understanding of the Enneagram and has provided an improved ability to use the model with greater insight and subtlety. I would recommend this as helpful reading along with other more basic insights to the Enneagram (such as those by Riso and Hudson) as you look to understand this enlightening and useful model in the pursuit of personal spiritual growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This book provides some interesting insights, but veers away and does not give appropriate credit to Enneagram pioneers. It is inconsistent with other Enneagram topology books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away","review":"I've got to say, the title of this book, The Enneagram of Liberation-from fixation to freedom, by Eli Jaxon-Bear, delivers exactly what it says! The book is like no other Enneagram book I've come across, mainly because of the insight Eli has into the true nature and function of the Enneagram. Eli uses the Enneagram as a mirror to discover where the fixated ego originates, and thus presents the possiblity of continuing to indulge in it, or a being free of it. Within this very cover is the doorway to Liberation. Those interested in freedom, true freedom, have found the end of the search right here! What a truly glorious gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Pass This Book Up!!!","review":"This is truly one of the most powerful and useful books I have read, in years of searching. Eli Jaxon-Bear beautifully discusses the nine styles of character fixation, based on the ancient teachings of the Enneagram. With deeper awareness of our own fixation, we are able to catch ourselves in our own destructive dances, and let our pure Self take over. Eli brings years of study of the Enneagram to this book, but even more importantly, he brings truth and clarity that radiates from his own purity and enlightenment. If you are earnestly seeking Truth, this book is a necessary companion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointing","review":"Despite high hopes for this book I found it a bit disappointing. The author uses a subjective, anecdotal approach to describing the different types (e.g., \\"Females Fours usually have great boots.\\") as opposed to an objective description of the principles underlying each number. Also, apparently most of his contacts from which he draws his anecdotal descriptions are women (for instance, the section on Childhood Setting for Twos has very little male gender or gender neutral info - it is overwhelmingly geared to females, as most of the book seems to be). An emphasis on the negative aspects of each type while excluding the positive aspects makes for a bit of a depressing read. Some interesting ideas but not enough for me to enthusiastically recommend the book. For those interested in this subject, I'd recommend \\"The Wisdom of the Enneagram\\" by Riso and Hudson - they actually accomplish what this author set out to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"Thoreau has been a long time inspiration to me.

My minor younger brother and sister like Western movies too and they often share the couch whenever I have new western DVD / BluRay from Amazon. But, with this film the story is different and I have to stop the film halfway because of nudity and frontal exposures which is not suitable for minors. I also feel that the film is rather \\"graphic\\" in showing close ups of someone getting shot at in cheek, chest and forehead. The film could have been better and the element of typical \\"Cowboyism\\" is missing. As for the film, I am not going to screen it again at home in future. I'd rather watch the old rusty westerns from my VHS collection. This is my personal opinion, I do not mean to harm or hurt anyone's sentiments.

The script is terrible and the actors take characters (like the James' and Youngers) that should be exciting, and deliver their lines in a droning monotone that is simply sleep inducing. The story seems to meander all over the place as though the script writers (which included the Keach brothers) weren't completely certain how they were going to tell the story. The dialogue in several portions of the movie is painfully bad and plays like cheesy melo-drama. The movie seems to be going for a gritty and realistic tone, but it's rather flat and just plain dull. The only thing it has going for it is the novelty of the casting, and that is simply not enough to make it worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff Riders","review":"The DVD I received was new but didn't play on two different DVD players or the computer.

It's a wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Riders","review":"For the Amazon team:- The movie came on time and is excellent in quality.As for the movie, what an excellent cast and entertaining plot. Who doesn't enjoy watching the tales of Jesse James and submerging oneself in such stories. The film is extremely watchable even now, and leaves little reason it garnered high praise back in 1980 when it was made. Purely from a female perspective as well, there is a lot of pleasing \\"eye candy\\" in the form of all the acting brothers who took part in this movie (which I must say, goes a long way to increasing the believability of the performances and the relationships which are vital to the plot).Many thanks Amazon for being able to offer such good quality films which are no longer available at my local video stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Guy Movie","review":"Good western and a very good guy movie. Put it on the shelf next to The Wild Bunch, Shane, Unforgiven, The Shootist, etc. (although not as good). This is about the James Gang. The Youngers, the James, the Millers, and the Fords are played by real-life brothers: the Carradines, the Keachs, the Quaids, and the Guests. Has one of the best knife fights in film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable film....","review":"I am partial to a good western and this sure fits the bill. I am not a history buff of the west and I don't know of the accuracy of this film. If most films were historically accurate they would probably be somewhat boring. A good example is the OK Coral. I was entertained. I own the DVD and will watch it whenever I want to see a good western. I also concentrate on different parts of the film with each viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the james and youngers ride again","review":"This is the Western that out Peckinpahs Pekinpah!

Long Riders is a wonderful movie that hits the target and then some. It's a real Western gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tale","review":"If you want to see a great take on Jesse James- this is it,Ry Cooder's music is what made me always want a copy- but the acting is top of the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Riders","review":"The Long Riders is one of the most convincing westerns that I have ever seen.

The dynamic of having brothers acting as brothers seems to have been the perfect cast. This movie should stand along side the other great western classics like The Sacketts, or The outlaw Josie Wales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Western","review":"This is a solid action packed western. Also try: \\"Lawman\\",\\"The Wild Bunch\\", and \\"Chato's Land\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough and Underrated","review":"The Long Riders might be the most accurate portrayal of the James/Younger gang on film. James Keach plays Jesse as a severe, violence prone character who robs banks because that's where the money is. It's light years removed from the recent Rob Lowe version \\"Frank and Jesse\\". Walter Hill didn't whitewash his characters, at least he didn't whitewash them as much as previous and subsequent directors have. Their bloody finale at Northfield Minnesota is presented with no punches pulled. This is a fine, hard little Western. If you've seen the terrible \\"Frank and Jesse\\" you owe it to yourself to check out this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Wave Ska at its best","review":"This compilation of the Dance Hall Crashers early work is a great sample of the state of the ska revival of the early nineties. All of the songs are listenable, and some truly standout. My favorites are Keep on Running and My Problem. If you can keep from moving on those two tracks you must be dead. A lot of the material deals with relationships, mostly bad ones, but the upbeat music and dueling vocals will make you forget that this could be just another pop record. The group and their pop/ska/punk sound are definitely different than any other and you will either love or hate this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a serious survey of international printmaking","review":"I have long looked outside the US for great contemporary printmaking, so when I found this book I was really excited. What a disappointment! The book is dominated by North Americans while nearly ignoring the rest of the world. The real world of printmaking is almost the reverse - there is so much more going on in printmaking outside the U.S. than within it. Merely being a teacher/friend/colleague of the editor does not make someone an important artist. Being an art professor does not make someone an important artist. Nearly the entire printmaking faculty from one editor's alma mater is included! This is not a serious survey; it is a small step above coffee table book with an astonishingly pretentious title. There needs to be a serious survey of international contemporary printmaking, but sadly this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Printmaking on the cutting edge.","review":"I agree with other readers that the term \\"Internation collection\\" is a misnomer, however, the content of the book is on the cutting edge of printmaking today. Abstract work in printmaking is highly experimental, controversial, and above all, necessary for the advancement of the medium. Also, the terminology used in the book is common knowledge to anyone in the know of the world of printmaking. I enjoy this book very much and have placed it among my special collection of art books."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEAVILY SLANTED TOWARDS ABSTRACT WORKS","review":"A HARDCOVER BOOK FULL OF COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS, BUT WITH LITTLE APPEAL TO THOSE INTERESTED IN ANYTHING EXCEPT ABSTRACT PRINTS.

Natasha is brassy and ready to take on the world. Striker is used to being in control and has a hard time dealing with the uncontrollable: Natasha. Roger is sweet, a man who thought he wanted to live life alone until Natasha and her two bodguard friends, Pit and Bigun, bring him into their fold and form a family unit with him.The North has Stephanie Plum, the West has Kinsey Milhone, and now the South has joined the ranks with Natasha Chamberlain. This is one great read. I was pleased to read that the author has made this into a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"FIRST & LAST\\"","review":"This is my \\"first and last\\" Christy French novel. I'm a huge fan of romantic suspense. After reading all of the previous customer reviews, I couldn't wait to go out and buy my own copy. I paid an \\"exorbitant\\" amount for a paperback, over $20, due to the way it's printed. (It's \\"printed on demand,\\" or some other such frivolity.) Still I didn't complain. When I started reading this book, I was completely \\"floored\\" by the dialogue. It's so lame, and at times, just makes no sense. It was really hard to keep up with who was saying what. I kept thinking, \\"Okay is this Stryker talking, or one of the bodyguards.\\" Natalie's antics teetered from \\"the unbelievable to the absolutely absurd.\\" It was not funny. I did not laugh once with the few chapters I struggled through. I guess I would just have to say, \\"It's just not well-written.\\" Could this be the reason Ms. French has to go through an independent publisher? Believe me, stick with the authors you know, and the publishers you trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"(...) I was expecting great things from all the reviews, but it really is an awful book. The scenarios are extremely unbelievable. The gist of it is that Natasha and two other men are hired to protect a computer geek whose life has been threatened. The security they provide is a joke and in real life, the computer geek would have been dead within a day. I could say so much more, but I can best sum it up by urging you: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zany","review":"Natasha Chamberlain is young, impulsive and quirky to the extreme. Her dream is to become an investigator for the firm she works for, so she accepts a job as bodyguard to a hermit millionaire, hoping this will be a stepping stone for her. Not! Natasha's impulsivity keeps landing her in trouble and irritating the hell out of her boss, Jonce Striker - a man she's had the hots for for three years.Lots of laughter with this one. The characters are fun, Natasha's antics funny, and the mystery as to who's trying to kill Roger a good one. I especially love the dense duo, Pit and Bigun, and the changes that take place with Roger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the writing-style of this writer!","review":"\\"The Bodyguard,\\" is an exciting romantic drama that was so good I have read it twice already!

But this one just don't get it. To much of a good thing is sickening, and she is. I really don't get why the hero falls for her. He seems so nice. Beurk ! Don't bye this one, just get it at the library if you really like the author (not one of my favorite). After 60 pages you just can't stand her anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"Keeping in mind that this is of a light, fun genre, it's a very good read. I have trouble writing \\"excellent\\" only because I measure against the books that make me want to call in sick so I can keep reading, like the Girl With a Dragon Tattoo series, or even the Hunger Games. This series is really fun, though, and the writing is good (though if I read \\"you're my world\\" one more time I may puke). Aside from the romantic element (which is still mostly good), the comedy is good and the plot for each of the series is never boring and has lots of surprises. Plus, the lead character and the author are both animal people, which makes them good people. The proceeds from these books are donated to animal organizations, and they aren't expensive, so if you're on the fence about them, perhaps that could help tip the scale for you. You won't regret it, though - they are a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Sparks Fly","review":"I am enjoying these books SO much!!! Natasha is a hoot!!!

I believe that this book is written by a man, that has been influenced by what he thinks women want. The fact is most women dont know what they want. This leads to the problem of trying to be something that may or may not be right. Women, like men want to be turned on by someone...they are not looking for friends, ideally during the process you become friends and lovers but the platonic/advice giving/exchanging type relationship goes nowhere 90% of the time. In fact, if you develop a good friendship first with a woman, she will not let it become intimate because of fear of \\"ruining the friendship\\" this is a well intentioned book, but not helpful in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can get a better one.","review":"I find this book full of unnecessary information. One example is a chapter about health. If I want to know anything about biceps and triceps, I'll buy a book specifically on working out. (The author has also mentioned something about cholesterol.) One particular book I HIGHLY suggest is \\"How To Succeed With Women\\" by Ron Louis and David Copeland. It is worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke!","review":"I purchased this book with high hopes. I figured anything I could get out of it would be well worth it.For starters, this book provides very little new information for dating techniques/strategies. It is all common sense; that is any of it that's even of any use. He goes into so much detail about your personal appearance and hygiene, it practically undermines the whole purpose of the book. Mr. Wray also seems to put a lot of stock in being a 'friend' of a woman, that this will somehow improve your chances of starting a relationship with them. Anybody who thinks that having a 'friend thing' going with a woman and that it will somehow transform into a relationship is sadly mistaken. Sorry Mr. Wray, I'd rather try my luck at the bar anyday. (Something he repeatedly discourages.)While I haven't read many dating books, I can't say I recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Men and Women!","review":"I've read this book many times and highlighted all thie things that I use every day.

This is a great book if you like the style personally. I, however, do not. I prefer the MUCH more difficult style where the skin tones look buttery smooth but I like the book anyway as it's always helpful to know more technique whether you ever use it or not.

No more suffering through commercials, no more watching something you hate because nothing else is on. After you've rated a few shows your \\"Now Showing\\" list of recorded programs always has something new and worth watching.

Took about an extra hour to download and install and then another 5-6 hours to be able to fully use the unit. My advice: after getting the Tivo going, force it to make it's daily call to download the updated software before doing anything else. This will save you a minor headache.Otherwise, this thing is great. If you have a lot of shows or movies that you would like to regularly record, you should purchase a larger unit. I have DirecTV and the recording at basic quality is not that great, but it's tolerable. So far, medium quality does just fine.

First of all, if you are playing with more than one person, it takes way too much time. Bets are made one player at a time, so the people you are playing with have to wait until you are done in order to place their bets. That makes you feel rushed.The game also freezes up and stagers. It froze up on me twice the first hour I played.In all previous gambling games you could only play one player poker. I thought just possibly that your cards could be shown on your VMU, and then you could play poker with all four controlers. Not the case, only one player can play poker, slots, video poker.Graphics are nothing special, rather bad for DC. And If your going to have computer players that say things then at least have them say different things. About the 2nd time you hear the computer player next to you say the same thing they just said, you turn the computer players off.Slow, slow, slow.

I sometimes have to try to press play over and over again until it is recognized. When reading an MP3 CD it takes quite a long time to read all the tracks. When playing from track to track, there is a slight delay between them, as opposed to having a nice flow from one to the other (terrible for mixed DJ CD's).

When the player did play CD's it did so with a lot of background noise with a relatively \\"flat\\" sound quality. This even occured with original audio CDs.I returned this thing and took a stab at a Rio Volt and haven't looked back.

Okay, make it two. One, earbuds. I haven't found my other headphones yet, but I'm working on it. Secondly, the day I recieved my Expanium, it was announced that Napster would be forced to shutdown. I have no problem with them charging fees, don't get me wrong and I'll gladly pay, but if they shutdown completely I'll be stuck with the one CD I already have. No matter how the Napster deal turns out, I'll be happy with my Expanium for as long as I've got it. The sound is excellent, it can have more music than anyone could possibly want on a single C.D. As long as you have a C.D. burner, you'll be in great shape with a Philips Expanium. I even went out and got a Philips CD burner just so I could burn my own CD's and not have to use my dad's computer frequently.

The single biggest appeal to me was the ability to use CD-RWs, but I have been unable to make it work so far and they can't help.If this will do what it claims, it will be awesome, but if you buy it you better be well-versed in how to create the MP3 CDs.

Was looking for a nice outdoor clock for the porch, while the facade is pleasant it certainly wasn't worth $40+, maybe a $10 clock and still a hefty profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"The clock is exactly what I thought I was getting, in so far as material quality and appearance. However, the clock portion only worked for a very short time. The minute hand keeps getting hung up on the hour hand, so therefore, it really doesn't do what it's suppose to do. There is no way to take the face of the clock off to adjust the clock hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Item","review":"This item came in a timely manner-it was for my husband on Father's Day. He really likes as do I and it is easy to read and looks great on our sitting porch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an outdoor clock!","review":"This clock appealed to me because I thought it would be a nice gift for a pool owner that I know. It has rusted and stopped working due to being outside. I do not recommend this as an outdoor item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter was never so fun","review":"What a great book this is. Usually when we think of Impressionists we think of summer, but as this book shows, they painted in winter, and great paintings too.The book begins with scholarly, well-written essays on Monet and Japanese influence on him, Pissarro, and Sisley, then comes the catalog with paintings by all of them as well as a few by Renoir and my favorite lesser-known impressionist, Gustave Caillebotte, as well as Gauguin. An especially nifty feature is a chronology of winter weather and pictures of it in the newspapers of the time. This makes the book part of climate history as well as art history.The quality of the reproductions is excellent and the concept is really interesting. If you like the Impressionists, take a walk on the winter side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pahntom TV Miniseries","review":"A little bit long, but it keeps the attention of viewers of all ages. While it wanders somewhat from the book storyline, it is a moving piece that leaves you feeling wrung out with emotion. The music is spectacular. I'm glad this product is finally available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom- love it!","review":"I am so grateful for the fact that I found this movie. I have looked everywhere for it. Phantom of the Opera with Burt Lancaster was virtually impossible to find. Only the new version and old horror versions are available in general. This is a great version and I wish more people would watch it at least once. This version seems to be the best one (to me). Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can they possibly top this one?","review":"Great writing with excellently crafted characters. I could really get into the story and found myself holding my breath in fear, anticipation and hope more than once. Wonderful humor used appropriately and of course the signature Weber & Ringo military strategies. In an nutshell..when's the next one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You HAVE GOT to read this one! Subtle alludes too!","review":"This book took off exactly where the first left off! The Marines, with a bunch of new recruits, continue their march to the sea in hopes of purchasing ship transportation across the monster filled ocean.Getting to the city near the coast was as hard as getting transport. Of course, battles for both had to be fought and won. But with each battle the challenges get harder. Ammo was not unlimited and few of the original Marines were left.A bit of romance was thrown in for the fast maturing prince. And the readers get a few surprises thrown at them!***** Not as many battles as the first book in the trilogy, but just as great! I do not know which author subtly alluded to the \\"NANCY BELL\\" poem near the ending, but it was done so smoothly that I can not help but wonder how many people noticed it. This is the best Sci-Fi series I have read all year! I am eagerly awaiting the third book. Highly recommended! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"David Weber and John Ringo have done it again. They have produced a nice, tightly (and seamlessly) plotted book that makes one read it from cover to cover in the shortest time one can. I read it in one glup and all I can say is: Thank you, gentlemen. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down after _March Upcountry_","review":"I like Weber's work generally, and I enjoyed the prequel to this book, but I almost couldn't get through this one.There's some good stuff here. The plot's interesting, and includes worthwhile character development and compelling hints about what's going on in the broader setting, out in the galaxy. It also becomes clear that we're looking at a long book series; the characters are nowhere near the end of their travails.But: although I like military fiction in general, this book gets bogged down in looong passages about tactics, artillery, manufacturing schemes for ammunition, &c.; ad nauseum. My subjective impression is that more than half the book was not critical to the storyline--more fun for an avid reader of National Defense Magazine than a science fiction nut or follower of Prince Roger and his loyal crew.If Prince Roger hooked you in _March Upcountry_, buy it in paperback and be prepared to skim heavily. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Roger and his remaining bodyguard continue their trek to the spaceport, solving problems and acquiring new allies along the way.More of the same, so much so that it didn't hold my interest and I skipped chunks of the book before completely giving up. This series would have been a great single book, but there just wasn't enough story to stretch out into a Lord-of-the-Rings-style series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have stopped with the first book","review":"I really liked March Upcountry, so when I saw this one, I snapped it up. Big mistake. I didn't even finish it--there's no character development, no real moving forward of the plot. Now that Roger is grown up, I guess there's nothing more to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"such an incredibly helpful book","review":"Offers a critique of how both fundamentalists and liberals exhibit an \\"improper\\" confidence, as both give way to a post-Enlightment understanding of the nature of truth. Very helpful overview of philosophy, epistemology, and very, very faith-affirming to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliness","review":"Essentially asserts that, since knowledge is difficult to come by, and since certainty is virtually impossible because all experience is subjective, that the Bible should be taken as historically accurate.Asserts that believing that Jesus actually rose from the dead, requires the same amount of faith as believing that 2+2=4. Because we only 'really know' that 2+2=4 because we are willing to accept our current society's definition of '2.'Ignores that this same philosophy can be applied just as easily to defend *any* other system of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great coloring books for older children!","review":"I bought this coloring book, along with several others, for my grandaughter's birthday.

I was expecting a performance a notch below SRK. Boy was I wrong. This movie has more English lines than Indian, da songs are terrible, the dialogue even worse, and priyanka Chopra's acting is simply unbearable. Simply put if u are a fan of old school Hindi movies such as KKHH, DDLJ, KKKG, RNBDJ, etc, and are seeking similar romantic Indian entertainment than run in the opposite direction if this movie. I wasted 2hrs if my life with this garbage, save your 2hrs for anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"Well, for those of you who have not seen any Bollywood films, this may be a good place to start, along with DIL BOLE HADIPPA. In my family, we LOVE Uday Chopra! He has a self-deprecating humor that seems to be part acting and part self-revelation. This is a great story and has music that will stick in your head for WEEKS at the least :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource!","review":"I love this book simply for the massive about of information that is presented in a simple format. It is great for students and teachers of English, and I would recommend this to any writer, as well. A few things will eventually become outdated, but it is fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodness me, goodness me...Industrial Disease!","review":"While the song Industrial Disease was the album rock hit from Love Over Gold, Telegraph Road is an epic masterpiece that grabs your heart and holds on. It is one of those songs that nearly everyone can relate to. Mark Knopfler's wonderful lyrics and haunting guitar will keep you coming back for more. Highly recommended.....and worst of all young man, you've got Industrial Disease!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it again...","review":"I've been a so-so casual Dire Straits fan for quite a while. I came upon this recording many years ago and it passed from my listening stack.But it left an impression. At this point in my life I'm revisiting some recordings that left a mental mark, so I purchased it again this time on cd.And I love it again. The ethereal feel and mood (and playful FUN of Industrial Disease), wonderful instrumentation and playing that builds compositions and not singles...it takes me on imaginary journeys. I love to just sit back, soak it in and let it take me way.A standout performance in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Album...","review":"...from one of my favorite bands of all time.Incredibly played and recorded.A must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love over Gold more solemm than usual","review":"When Dire Straits released their debut back in 78 with Sultans of Swing the bluesy catchy song sent people scurrying out to buy this album and for the most part weren't disappointed.Four years later this album was released.Although expecting to find a similiar sounding album what I got was a collection of a more transitional pieces of music.Telegraph Road runs 14:20,while the rest are under 8 minutes.Industrial Disease is kinda humorous in its sick way and It Never Rains shine with a masterful guitar solo which makes up for the ones you don't hear as it was drowned by Alan Clark.Perhaps it would of been different if David Knopler hadn't of left but a change had to come for the better.Although it is wasn't a comercial success its in a class all by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"THESE REVIEWERS BELOW ME NEED TO SHUT UP","review":"How could anyone hate this great album?

Nothing but clicks and pops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather weak","review":"After three more or less great albums, Dire Straits released \\"Love over gold\\" in 1982. This album is not at all comparable to the earlier stuff and only the song \\"Telegraph road\\" reach former heights. In fact, \\"Love over gold\\" is a rather boring album and the material lacks the attractiveness of tunes like \\"Sultans of swing\\" and \\"Tunnel of love\\" to name a few. I would say that this album is mostly for dedicated Dire Straits fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It takes love over gold... to do what you do...\\"","review":"I've been listening to Dire Straits for a while now, and this has to be my favourite album of theirs. My favourite song has to be Telegraph Road with it's powerful lyrics and Mark Knopfler's stunning guitar work. The song starts off slow and moody, and near the end there is a mind-blowing solo mixed with powerful drums, keyboards, and of course, a guitar. The other songs are exceptional. Private Investigation, Love Over Gold, and It Never Rains really show how powerful and deep Dire Straits can be. This is a must have CD that can be listened to from beginning to end. Get it, NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huddy","review":"For me (only my opinion) the 2 songs Telegraph road and Private investigations alone are worth this CD. These are 2 amazing musical arrangements that is really really hard to find these days. I'm not saying the other tracks are bad. My other favourites are the Title track and \\"It never rains\\".I have been listening to this album for more than 10 years in cassettes and older CD versions. I even tried to get a LP version recently. Then I found this and picked this up recently as this is a remastered one. Believe me when I say this is the best version I have. The sound is full compared to the older CD version and I get an amazing feel when I play it every time. This is a very good remastered version. Highly recommend this remaster to all the quality conscious dire straits fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Over Gold","review":"One star off because the product took too long to arrive and the CD cover was cracked. CD works fine though. Price was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"mark knopfler's finest moment","review":"\\"Love Over Gold\\" is my no.1 dire straits album. Why?1. \\"making movies\\" and \\"brothers in arms\\" are good albums, but patchy at best. \\"love over gold\\" makes the most over merely 5 epic tracks.2.\\"telegraph road\\" is highly poignant with a striking narrative. it's intriguing as it's ambitious, and is still the most interesting 10+ minute song in my books.3. the other tracks are good esp. \\"private investigations\\" and the title track, but they still stand out from the mostly pedestrian dire straits catalogue.4. \\"love over gold\\" still sounds great when you're sober. i find much of \\"brothers in arms\\" is enjoyable after three stolis, and it takes a few VBs to enjoy \\"making movies\\" from 'skateaway' on.if you want to know where it's at for DS, buy this.

Love Over Gold is a terrific albumand has the best epic in history, Telegraph Road. 14 fine minutesof that includes great guitar work.

Uviller and Merkel's thesis is that the right to bear arms was an individual right, but only within a collective context of service in a state sanctioned, regulated and disciplined militia. The book has it right. Uviller and Merkel are well researched. This book is not a polemical such as Halbrook's \\"That Every Man Be Armed\\" - it is historical scholarship. A must read for anyone who seeks a scholarly and objective, as well as balanced approach to the understanding of the Second Amendment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enlightening","review":"This is a must read for anyone who really wants to understand the truth about the second amendment.The authors present an impressive amount of historical research to show that the second amendment protects an individual right to bear arms only in connection with an organized citizen militia. Some have claimed that the second amendment protects an unconditional right to bear arms. However, an objective examination of history, reveals that this notion is undoubtedly false. The term \\"bear arms\\" referred to military service at the time of the writing of the second amendment. When deciding on the language of the second amendment, the first congress debated whether conscientous objectors should be exempt from bearing arms. Obviously, they weren't talking hunting or using guns to defend one's home against criminals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation of the Facts","review":"The language in this book is verbose, hard to read, one almost has to be a college professor to understand it. Once you do get through it, you find that the authors, while putting forth facts about the concerns between maintaining a militia and not having a large standing army, totally ignore facts that show that the intent all along, of both federalists and anti-federalists, was to protect a pre-existing, God given right of individuals to keep and bear arms, for any reason, including hunting and self-defense, but most importantly to resist a potentially tyrannical government. They also repeat standard gun control arguments, e.g. the word \\"bear\\" only had a military context when it came to firearms, even though the minority report from Pennsylvania expressly requested an amendment that would protect the individual's right to \\"bear\\" arms for hunting.

I purchased the C40 assuming that the overall quality would be good and that the acoustical sound would be at best acceptible. The one that I received was defective in that it buzzed/vibrated when certain notes were played (sympathetic body vibrations). Also, it could not be played in tune-i.e. the fret/nut/bridge alignment was off. So. I suppose this is typical for a $100 entry level guitar. Perhaps I got a bad one.

For me, it took too much energy translating the various acronyms for different subject matter answer patterns, and the jargon is pretty thick. The crowded graphics, charts, and different typefaces, and the use of his own personal contractions in the examples made this book a slog, and without real concentrated effort to understand his \\"method\\"(which I would much rather spend on other studying) I didn't really glean much that could be useful.

There I had the good fortune to work with Professor Delaney who was then the Department Chief of the School's Criminal Law Education and Research Department. In my view, Professor Delaney's \\"How to Do your Best on Law Schoool Exams\\" book is unique among a multitude of law exam technique books. It is appropriate for beginning and advanced students. The new edition is supplemented by a dynamic website that elaborates on points that are explained in the book. The website also updates in accordance with new testing trends, e.g. multiple choice questions. Prof. Delaney offers refreshing criticism of most law school pedagogy, and its failure to prepare students for their exams. He has a good description of the practice of mystifying and obfuscating legal principles. His methods are effective for students from their first year to the bar examination. I would recommend the book without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great aid, recommend to others","review":"You aren't going to be taught, most likely, how to write an exam answer in law school.

This book provides a feminist perspective of life in Egypt in the 1950s. Although the book seems to criticize romance novels, it seems to me that the book fell into many of the same problems (although this is not a shallow romance novel). Everyone is trapped in these political marriages and desires to break free to be with their true love.In my class, we compared society as described in this book to society in the early 20th century, as described in al-Hakim's Return of the Spirit. It is interesting to use the two books to see how much society has changed (and to see how, in some ways, Egypt today is more similar to Egypt at the start of the 20th century than in the mid-20th century)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.....","review":"This is by far the worst game I've ever played.

But having been a three guitar band, now reduced to two, and then adding keyboards from Christine McVie to round out their sound, even expand it, this set of material is just wonderful.In no way abandoning their blues roots, they also expand beyond that into other realms of expression, from the '50's to the emerging progressive music of the '70's.'Hi Ho Silver' is a great tune with a lot of spirit, 'Station Man' tips to their blues/rock foundation, 'Wishing Well' is a great tome to the romantic, 'Jewel Eyed Judy' is a great torch song, of sorts. And the rest that just demonstrated that this incarnation of the band was by no means worse off with the loss of Pete, just different, even presaging the eventuall arrival of Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks after the departures of Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwin and Bob Welsh."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just plain stinks!!!","review":"This is Fleetwood Macs worst cd ever!!!

This time, for Fleetwood Mac, was when they were a boogie-up beat band following Mick's mesmerizing rhythms, Christine's melodies waving like sea-mist in the wind. There's a Jeremy? I should remember, I read the liner notes enough, but this music is captivating. I have not gotten too much of this whole album. When \\"Jeweled-eyed Judy\\" plays, I am suddenly younger to an era when rock was simple, direct, and everyday life.

I used both the shampoo and conditioner, and by the time I got out of the shower my hair felt just like straw (and yes, I left it in for around 10 minutes while I showered). After blow drying and styling, it felt a little better, but not much - and the natural shine I have in my hair was dulled.

What my (and presumably all) business students are looking for are more immediately actionable knowledge, practical skills, and a much more compelling presentation.

We also get to same some of the annoying questions answered. That is where the movie falls short. This movie tells basicly no information on The questions left us in the movies. It seems like they wanted to leave it so open that they decided not to give any information. The time however was not replaced with any extra scary scenes. In fact there was only one or two scary scenes in the movie. The rest of the movie was filler scenes. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Watch it alone, in the middle of the night, with a beer or wine or two. Very fun, creepy movie. But it's really gotten old by now. In 1, like the Blair Witch project, you were supposed to think it was found footage.But in this movie, the daughter finds a way to record everything all over the house, and the recordings fail as part of the plot. SO WHAT ARE WE WATCHING!!??The parents don't even bother trying to act, and I stopped bothering trying to pay attention.

This year, the pickings are very slim, as this is by far the worst film of the four. Scares are few and far between, the acting is terrible, and the film is ALMOST IDENTICAL to Paranormal Activity 2, with the same exact ending as Paranormal 3.With a budget this big and a devoted audience, it is an insult to the integrity and to the intelligence of the loyal fans to put out a lackluster film such as this. They have obviously run out of ideas and are already rehashing the same scenes over and over again. Unless you are a huge fan of the franchise, don't seethis film. Not only are the first three better, but they are almost identical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give no stars for this.","review":"My boyfriend and I have watched all of the Paranormal Activity movies, and we thought this movie was the worst of the \\"found footage\\" genre, much less of the series! First of all, it took about 40 minutes for anything remotely \\"scary\\" to happen, and even that was a crapshoot. The only thing about the film that I liked was the Xbox Kinect ir lights, because at least THAT was something different. The ending was horrible, we get it supposed t be about a cult, but it didn't even make sense! (Don't want to include spoilers...then again I can save anyone who reads this about 13$) Overall, this movie was only made for the suckers, (i.e. my boyfriend and I) who would buy this movie thinking it would be as good as the others. Wait for netflix to have it, it's just not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that bad...","review":"But still not that good.For me this franchise died with part 3.A lot of people are complaining that part 4 doesn't make sense.I read the whole plot on Wiki so I guess the movie made more sense story wise.But still...they're continuing on with the story that was set in part 3 so needless to say...I wasn't impressed.Recommended rental for diehards only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranormal Boredom","review":"I think the industry has taken this too far or \\"heaven forbid\\", I'm too old for the same thing over and over.

Boring, poor acting, low budget, remake over and over of the same story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The camera is never dropped","review":"This movie was bad for soo many reasons. Reason 1. The makers tipped their hand becuase everytime somone is going to die, the camera focuses directly on the person in the frame, blocking out the background. When the background is obscured you can't see what is happening behind the person on film, when suddenly they turn around the killer is there waiting to make a quick end of them. And it seems weird that while some characters are running in fear they never drop the camera. If I were being chased by an evil entity the camera is the last thing I'm running with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective.","review":"Stand alone the movie would get 2 stars.

This time I didn't go off the expectations from the trailer like PA3.(Which I think is false ads) And as I predicted it wasn't anything compared to the trailer. First off the way the story goes absolutely no sense and false pretense from the original again. But there is good news, it ended the story with the characters but after the credits there is a spinoff ending video of another story that is probably going to be the next 4 mess ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"I had actually forgotten that I had pre-ordered this movie, so when it showed up it was like a surprise present to me from me!

PA 1 and PA 2 were occuring at approximately the same time, so it was a good reconciliation of the chain of events as we experienced them. PA 3 offered more of the backstory as to why these events were happening. PA 4 is tied to that backstory.My biggest issue with PA 4 is that, where the first couple of movies offered a reasonable and believable cause for the remote cameras and coverage, this was more of a stretch. It involves the teenage daughter and her tech savvy boyfriend networking the electronics in the home to offer 24/7 coverage, plus carrying their laptops or camera everywhere with them to capture events outside of the house. It was ridiculous. Even in moments of extreme duress, they always had the camera recording.There were some good effects, my favorite being the scenes involving the XBox Kinect data points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Gem","review":"I've been a Fleetwood Mac fan for years, all the way back to when I was a kid in the 1980s. Of course, that is post-1975 FM I am talking about, as my first introduction to FM was when \\"Tango in the Night\\" was released in Sept. 1987.Years after my first foray into Rumours, Mirage, Tango, etc, I discovered this album. This is not Buckingham-Nicks FM. A great album; the title track alone is worth the cost. Bob Welch died in 2012, and most year end \\"passed away\\" lists did not even mention his passing. That is a real shame, because he wrote some great songs for FM during his time as a member. Don't let his 1978 remake of \\"Sentimental Lady\\" scare you off, either. The \\"Future Games\\" album is not full of MOR Adult Contemporary tunes. This is old school, bluesy, gritty FM.If you are burned out on Buckingham-Nicks era FM, this one is worth checking out! There really is not a bad tune on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ethereal Experience","review":"I was in high school when this album was released and Fleetwood Mac was one of the bands I enjoyed the most. Having discovered them at the close of the Peter Green era, I was at that time very surprised at how different a band could be with a slight change of personnel. Many have put their stamp on Fleetwood Mac's music through the years and it was here that Danny Kirwan made his mark. The title cut, Woman of a Thousand Years, and Morning Rain are all good songs, but the one that left an indelible impression is Sands of Time. I remember the mournful guitar of Kirwan and the melancholy delivery of the lyrics bringing tears to the eyes of young men who considered themselves hard. The power of that song alone is reason enough to buy \\"Future Games\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing piece of musical history...","review":"It still stuns me that this incredible piece of our collective musical past seems to have been forgotten by so many.

If you are looking for a solid technical reference on modems, this isn't it.

As I make breakfast shakes every morning, lack of a blender was not an option. I bought the Waring based primarily on the Amazon reviews and have been very satisfied with it. It's not fancy, just a low and fast speed (like my Cuisinart), but works well and gives one the feel that it is built to last. Not real excited by the plastic mix container, since you have to hold it down to keep it from vibrating. I preferred the lock-down, glass mix container of the Cuisinart; but will trade longevity for a slight convenience disadvantage.

Perhaps for a bar where it is on in 5 second bursts it would be satisfactory, but for my use -- mostly pureeing -- I found that I was dreading using it because it needed to be held to keep the vibration from moving all over the counter and with the noise I felt as if I were standing next to a jet engine revving up. I have since gotten a Vitamix -- a much more expensive machine but one which works smoothly, powerfully and meets my needs. If you can spend the money on the Vitamix, don't waste it on the Waring. And if you can't get a Vitamix, then get another machine -- even if it takes a few seconds longer to puree, you will be happier with the total experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I think this product has a great motor perhaps, but I didn't like the way the top fit, plus I felt like I needed to keep my hand on the id.

The Waring website says this product is sold with a glass carafe, but they don't sell the glass carafe as a replacement part - only the plastic.If you think you're going to crush ice or use the power of the motor, you're going to have big problems with the plastic carafe.

The container on top does not \\"seat\\" itself firmly on the base; it does not lock into place for safety; and it does not pulverize a tray of ice cubes at all, much less in 3 seconds, as was one person's experience. Thinking I had gotten a defective machine, I called Waring only to be told that none of their blenders lock into place and one is supposed to hold the top down on the base while blending! The tray of ice cubes stuck in the blender without blending, and the personal chef I had in my kitchen at the time and who was watching my personal demonstration said, \\"No, no, that's not ok.

Additionally, the replacement carafe is expensive and also plastic (subject to failure).Bottom line: if this blender had a stainless carafe (or even glass), you may pass it off as a commercial quality.

If you like big handbags, high heels and accessories that make a statement, you will absolutely love it.Few months later - I still love it, people ask about what I am wearing, I would not sell it for the double of I what I have paid for it.

It is HUGE...and I do mean HUGE on a more than average sized woman's arm.While the watch face appears to be circular on the photo, it is not...it is more of a large horizontal oval (if that makes sense) with enormous, highly stylized numbers.This watch might be most appropriate for someone in the creative fields or someone with more of a \\"goth\\" taste in jewelry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Album","review":"If there is one album in the world I could not live without, it's this one. Fagen is brilliant here, but without his usual biting cynicism. That's not to say that this album is peppy, poppy or optimistic. It's more ironic and tongue-in-cheek, yet still a great listening experience. I have everything Steely Dan, Walter Becker and Fagen have recorded and it's all terrific, five stars, yet for some reason this one stands head and shoulders above the rest, so I guess it should get more than five stars. This is probably preaching to the choir because all Steely Dan fans must have this album, but if there are any out there who don't, buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true essential","review":"where do i start? the genius of Fagen&Becker is well done on this great disc.I.G.Y,Green flower street,new frontier,ruby baby the title cut with the great Val Simpson from the dynamic duo Ashford&Simpson.the vocals,words,music have a strong soulful feel all over them.Donald Fagen created a master piece with this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quintessential album of the '80s","review":"When I first bought this album on vinyl, I remember the salesperson saying \\"Hey, thats a nice album!\\".

I wasn't lucky enough to be born and grow up in the fifties, but this album brings them to life. Inspirational stuff.This album is certainly different to Kamakiriad, but not better, not worse. My suggestion, buy both along with Guacho and AJA from Steely Dan. You will then have the best of this artists fine work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"why i think Donald Fagan is a genius.","review":"His genius lies in his ability to create music that makes me feel glad to be alive, however whenever i see his writings (such as in the gaucho album liners) or hear him talk (at the rock and roll hall of fame, or at a concert between songs) i get the feeling Fagan doesn't take life as seriously as his music sounds. I mean my first listen to his song Maxine, and the phrase \\"try to hang on\\" just made me melt. Fagen in concert is twice as strong. A night concert in Irvine, CA yr.2000 was absolutely magical for me. Every time i hear A steely dan tune or Fagen's voice brings me back to that night. Maybe we're being doublely fooled by Fagen's persona. Maybe he really does appreciate life and realize the magnificance in the human experience? I don't see how a person can create the music he does and have the attitude he does at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of the 1980s","review":"Nothing can touch the quality of this CD.

Remaster this with a higher output level! Nothing else needs changing at all. The production otherwise is superb. I don't know what happened on this one.

The employee there said, \\"If you want to hear how really GREAT a CD can sound, listen to this!\\" -- and put on The Nightfly. It was an incredible experience. Nearly 20 years later, I got a CD changer for my car, and what is in there? You guessed it, The Nightfly -- funny, jazzy, sarcastic, and surprisingly warm at times. On my list of \\"top 10 all-time albums.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"for limited tastes only","review":"I have to admit that I liked this LP when it first came out in '82, but I outgrew it. It just didn't \\"age\\" very well. There are still some things to like. New Frontier is the best song, and I enjoy the Lettermen-like vocal arrangements Fagan uses here and there. (Such harmonies are the same ones Brian Wilson grew up with; the ones that influenced his Beach Boys compositions) But Fagan's The Nightfly is like a wine cooler: thin and dated. It's okay as far is it goes (and that's not very far) but not satisfying for more sophisitcated tastes. If you must have beginner's jazz in your system, get Steely Dan's Aja instead. Better songs, tastier arrangements, better band leadership--it's simply a more rewarding collection of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fagan at his best!","review":"Any fan of Steely Dan would not be caught without Donald Fagan's first solo effort. This album is critically acclaimed for the many colorful arrangements including the title track, I.G.Y. and my favorite, Greenflower Street; which simmers to the brim with jazz reminiscent of the 50s era. Do yourself a favor and get this album FIRST! You cannot go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"When I started listening to the dvd-audio version for the first time it didn't seem that much better at first.

Too bad it's kind of a pain to switch my Toshiba player into the dvd-audio mode. But it's worth it. And the video of New Frontier as a bonus, that's so nice.Now I'm just waiting for those rare moments that I have the house to myself so I can pump up the volume and get totally immersed in the sound...When will they bring out all the Steely Dan CDs in DVD-Audio I wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blend of pop, r&b, and jazz elements","review":"I echo the sentiments of other reviewers, but would also add that Michael Brecker's solo on \\"Maxine\\" alone is worth getting this CD.

You cannot help but have emotions stir up as you listen to it - yes, it is that powerful. The story behind each song is almost a tear-jerker, but you are too busy enjoying the music.

I was instantly impressed because I had never heard music quite like this. Fagen has such a unique style that is unmistakenly identifiable in all his music and this album's music and lyrics are so captivating because of the mood that it creates....that of a time so long ago (the 1950's). From the time that I first heard this album until now, I have collected every Fagen/Dan piece of music that I could possibly get my hands on. This is a truly great album and I recommend it to anyone who loves great music, particulary Steely Dan Music.P.S.....I love Donald Fagen"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of top 5 albums of all time!","review":"The music on this album is Fagen at his peak (including SteelyDan).

I had thought my starter or alternator had gone bad but a tow truck with its booster was able to jump start me on one try.I am certain the tow truck had a more powerful booster but this unit was rated well but failed when I needed it to work. I have yet to check to see if the booster is faulty. The rest of the unit works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearing up some questions/critiques","review":"Unit appears to be solidly constructed. Maybe I lucked out and got an upgraded version, but there have been a couple of reviewers that said the the plastic clamps snapped. The unit I have (manufactured 11/06) has ALL METAL clamps, very much nicer than many regular standard jumper cables.This unit will hold a charge but needs to be maintained (recharged) at least every 60 days or so.NEVER charge via the cigarette lighter adapter in your vehicle longer than 3-4 hours. It may be left on AC charge indefinately. It is better to keep it fully charged, discharging this unit will result in shorted cells.All in all, a very small price to pay for peace of mind, at home and on the road. With a power inverter (less than $20.00) you can have silent power source for lights, cell phones, small tv's, laptops, flourescent lights, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, well made.","review":"I think this is actually a Vector jump starter, but either way it works very well. I have a riding lawnmower that for some reason will never crank on it's own, but if I run a dropcord and hook up a battery charger to it, it starts. Which is a pain.Now I just leave this jump starter in my storage shed with the mower and hook it up each time to start the mower. I've started the mower probably 6 times so far without needing to recharge the jump starter. I'll take it inside and plug it in to recharge it every month or so.Also has a work light for night time, decently bright.If you have weak hands you might have trouble squeezing the clamps, they're very solid and the springs are strong.Note that the Off/On switch is difficult to turn On, this is probably a safety feature to make sure you *really* want to turn on the juice to the clamps. Just turn it hard and it will click On.I've been very pleased with my last 3 or 4 Black and Decker products, good prices and good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!","review":"I bought this product in hopes of jump starting my lawn tractor as well as a vehicle (if the need came up). Well, the need did come up... three times.... and this product was NOT able to give me enough power to successfully jump start my Explorer. It made the lights come on, and the 'open door' bell sound, but that was it. Right out of the box, I charged it by following the directions precisely. I truly feel like I've wasted my money!! Worse, I didn't find out how bad it was until it was already out of warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time and effort","review":"I received this jump-starter as a gift and it worked well for about 6 months then wouldn't hold a charge, which is slightly critical for a cordless, rechargeable jump-starter. I contacted Black and Decker to see if my unit was still under warranty but got the run-around from them and finally gave up. From the sounds of it and based up my experience with it, if you buy one or receive it as a gift, just call the number on the back to see where you can dispose of it immediately and end the misery of owning it sooner and than later."},{"rating":"1","title":"jump starter","review":"my husband got one of these last christmas and love it, So he bought 2 of these at Christmas for his family, one worked and one did not.

There was no place to go and no number to talk to anyone. No wander it is cheaper they don't have to worry about returns.

An otherwise beautiful design, with a frustrating Achilles heel. AARRGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B&D VEC010BD Start It 300Amp Jump Starter","review":"Disappointed: I have owned one of these for the past 10 years. What I found in the newer version is that although it is now more expensive, the quality has been reduced drastically. The clamps are smaller & cheaper material and the remote power outlet has been removed. I used it for running things like: 12 Volt impact wrench, air pump and even a digital messagenger sign along with Jump starting my boat or antique autos. The 12 Volt products could plug into a cigarett lighter or the (removed) remote power outlet. Basically I took the battery out of this one and put it into my old Black & Decker Jump Starter, trashing the rest of this container, cables & clamps. Battery now works great in Old Unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked once then died","review":"I used this product once to jump start my car after charging it the required initial period.

Don't waste your money, buy something of higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHARGING WON'T HAPPEN","review":"THE FIRST TIME I USED IT, IT WAS EXCELLENT. THEN, AFTER ABOUT 2 MONTHS I ATTEMPTED TO CHARGE IT AGAIN. INSERTING THE SMALL CHARGER WIRE INTO THE SMALL HOLE AND PLUGGING THE CHARGING CORD INTO THE WALL SOCKET, THERE WAS SO RESPONSE. WIGGLING THE CORD AT THE UNIT PRODUCED THE RED CHARGING LIGHT BUT ONLY IF YOU HELD IT BY HAND JUST RIGHT. I PUT A SMALL WEIGHT ON TOP OF THE END TO KEEP IT CHARGING WITH THE RED LIGHT BUT THE FLASHING GREEN LIGHT INDICATING A FULL CHARGE NEVER CAME ON. VERY DISAPPOINTED....WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine but doesn't hold charge for long","review":"If you get this as an alternative to jump start cables, then do keep it plugged in as it won't hold peak charge for long. And it does need to be at or close to peak charge to jump start a car. It will power up other 12V accessories for quite a while, so no problems there.And yes, the variety of options on it (light, LEDs, etc) are nice and much more useful. Definitely better than the spare battery I used to have for such uses. The carry handle itself is a huge benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I had a similar item because I've always had a bad habit of leaving my lights on, and sometimes play the good Samaritan when I see someone who needs a jump. I forget the brand, but it lasted 5 years and was always ready when I needed it. I rarely had to re-charge the thing.When that one finally died, I purchased the Black & Decker Start It. I charged it up and a few months later when I needed it, the unit was was near dead and didn't have enough power to start my car. I foolishly purchased another for my wife's car because it was the only brand sold in that store. That one never accepts a full charge (the green light never comes on no matter how long it has been on the charger) and loses its charge just as quickly as the first one I bought.I find I have recharge both every month so they will be ready when I need them. If I forget, I'm out of luck.An emergency car starter that won't hold a charge is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I bought this unit because last winter my car battery failed and I needed a jump start. So I bought this unit and I've kept it charged and in my trunk. A cold snap last week rendered my car battery dead... I pulled this out and there wasn't enough power to get the car started. Very disappointing. I'm going to throw it away because it's useless - it doesn't work. Might work on a warm sunny day - but in a cold situation when most batteries fail and you really need it, it doesn't work. Don't waste your money. Instead replace your car battery every 2 years or so and you won't have any need for this or any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Jump Starter and More","review":"I just used this jump starter to start my pickup truck where the battery was dead as a door nail. The starter did exactly what it's supposed to do - start the motor quickly and easily.I purchased this unit primarily for jump starting my cars in case of an emergency, but have found another great use. I tailgate a lot for football games and this unit's power supply is perfect for running a boombox (which I do)for hours and hours. You need a power inverter (very inexpensive at Radio Shack)to make this work.The last time I used it for 4 straight hours, at my boomboxes highest volume, and it only used 1/3rd of the power supply.Now I can listen to the pregame radio broadcast or music while tailgating without taxing my car's battery, which went dead the last time I turned up the volume for all to hear before a game.I highly recommend this jump starter. It's a great value and is a great safety item to have if you have a family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked once and not any more","review":"I purchased this about 8 months ago and it worked once and would not hold a charge after that one use.

I've tried to jump about a dozen cars so far with this product and it has failed to start any of them. The unit, at 300 instant amps and 225 continuous amps, is just not enough power.

I've never written a bad review on anything and hoped I never would have to, but when backup gear is so undependable and downright useless,the word needs to get out.

He says \\"Okay, but hey - why don't we lighten it up a little for all the couples out there, (cheesy smile) you know, give it a kinda laid back New York jazz feel. Can you dig that?\\" This bilge is what he and his orchestra would come out with.Jazz is music to relax to.Vangelis is music to watch 'attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion' to.If you have a profound religious experience - complete with music - chances are that music will be by Vangelis, Thomas Newman or Mahler - NOT the New American Orchestra!

I don't know what time a lot of my programs come on, or what day of the week, I just watch them when I feel like watching them. I have a one year old daughter, and I would especially reccomend TiVo to new parents. Without the ability to pause, or just stop and come back to it later, a new parent can't expect to watch anything all the way through.Setup may be a bit complex, but once it's in place, it is simple to operate. My mother in law can figure it out when she comes to town. She can't figure out our X-10 remote control lights, or her own e-mail, but she can set TiVo to record her programs and figure out what she wants to watch.

This CD lives up to the promise of that performance. Coming from the strengths of his Beethoven and Rachmaninoff recordings, you may be unprepared for the readings Ashkenazy gives these pieces. The Arabeske is songful and intimate, filled with nuance and sentiment. Papillons offers salient contrasts between Schumann the poet and Schumann the virtuoso. Ashkenazy's fortissimos here in the big moments are thrilling. As for the Symphonic Etudes, they receive a beautifully thought out rendition. Ashkenazy includes the etudes that were excised by the composer but published by Brahms. From the first moments, when Ashkenazy subtly rolls into the piece, this is a performance of stature. The sound engineering throughout the CD is superb, offering the nuanced but full sound Ashkenazy produces in concert.

The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac album have more songs of their essence; but this is the . (continuation, have a phone call ) minimum part of their fantastic work. Yes.., please listen to Rhiannon, Albatross, Sara, Tell me lies, Love is- with Sarah McLaughlin, Gold dust woman, Don't stop, Sorcerer, Its only love, Everywhere, Go your own way, Mine ranking needs yes urgent, Songbird, Over my head (flours to this), Every day, Silver springs, Stand back, Unconditional Love, Kick it, If any ones fall- more flours to etc,etc. As any could see are some Stieve only, other day we talk about her, this list could be continue to."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it wasnt for Lindsey","review":"If not for Lindsey Buckingham this album would have been great. He openly admits songwriting is not a strong point for him. He has had only one exelent song since Rumors and thats Big Love. Stevie and Christens' songs were great especally Gypsy, Straight Back, and Thats Alright, Hold Me, and Love in Store. I heard Stevie say that Gypsy was going to go on her Wild Heart album luckly for Fleetwood Mac, she gave it to them. I think Lindsey Buckingham is unfortanately a has-been. I hate to say that but it true. Over all I would rank this a 2 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album. Completely AWFUL sound quality.","review":"I can't add much more to the reviews of the actual music on this album (which is superb), but I think all buyers should be aware of the completely sub-standard mastering that went into this CD release. How it made it past the quality control ears of the band, particularly Mr. Buckingham, is beyond me. My old cassette copy of this album sounds better than this original CD release. DO NOT BUY this CD version. Wait for the re-mastered release which, according to Wikipedia (which, of course, is always dead spot on), should be out sometime in 2011. This album's music deserved better treatment than this disgraceful product. Barely one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Mac Classic","review":"Most reviews don't rave about this album, but I will. You can't compare this to Rumours, as we are talking about a different decade. 1982 saw a different sound in music, and this album is representative of that type of commercial sounding music. Mirage though is still a classic album, and nearly every track is beautiful. LOVE IN STORE is the opening track and it has a great chorus, a good example of McVie's work. Buckingham's efforts on the album might be weak but they are still excellent as they are well crafted with strong choruses (eg. BOOK OF LOVE). Mirage is my most played Mac album after Rumours - that says something! HOLD ME is a classic, who could forgot the desert video for it? There's even a song on the album that reminds me of SONGBIRD - yep, listen to WISH YOU WERE HERE. Please dont expect another Rumours. Just bear in mind that was recorded in the 70's. This was recorded in the 80's. Sounds change!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic '80s pop!","review":"This album is clearly a pop effort, but what's wrong with that? It's a far more consistent and enjoyable album than its uneven follow-up \\"Tango in the night\\". \\"Gypsy\\", \\"Hold me\\", \\"Oh Diane\\", \\"Love in store\\",..., all these songs are polished pearls of '80s pop music. This album is delightful from the first to the last track, and there's not a bad song on it. I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who thinks this album is definetely underrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef ?","review":"Such a wonderful album (one of Fleetwood Mac's best in my opinion) and yet such a HORRIBLE recording. The label that allowed this out the door and onto retail shelves should be ashamed of themselves. This sounds just horrible. I wont play this album if I have people in my car with me because I didn't spend 2 grand on my sound system to have someone tell me my stereo blows. 4 stars for this great album...then subtract 2 for the recording quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Pop","review":"This record is very underrated. Not as commercial as the mega platinum Rumours but sometimes beauty is in a hidden gem. This is the disc which has Gypsy on it. Whereas, the aforementioned song is not bad by any means, I would have to rate it as the weakest number on here. Christine McVie and Lindsay Buckingham contribute most of the artistic gems on here such as Love In Store, Oh Diane, Eyes Of The World, and Wish You Were Here. Maybe not their best but certainly a winner to my ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this underrated Mac album.","review":"When Mirage first came out I thought it was OK, but not great. Listening to it now I have a new appreciation for it, probably because on this album Fleetwood Mac sounds more like a band playing together and less like musicians coming into the studio at different times, adding parts to each other's songs (a la \\"Tusk\\" or \\"Tango in the Night\\").Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie contribute great songs--especially Gypsy, Straight Back, Wish You Were Here, and Hold Me. Lindsey Buckingham's are a little weak, especially lyrically--Oh Diane and Empire State could have been left off. But overall it's a really nice offering of Mac tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool case","review":"I got this for my husband because he likes to collect watches and he really likes it. I will probably have to get another one when he gets more watches."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on stands, although these were not the cheapest either. I did however expect them to be better than what I received. The bases arrived damaged (or poorly constructed) in that the covering was missing at the rear corners. The channel for the wiring was impossible to remove according to the directions. I usually send back items like this but they went in a room where the damage was not visible and I really didn't want to deal with the whole return process."},{"rating":"1","title":"what were they thinking?","review":"I expected a lot from this Philips CD alarm clock, and was very disappointed. My #1 complaint is that you can't see the clock unless you are viewing it exactly at eye level. (at pillow level, the numbers disappear, and all you have is a bright glowing blue rectangle.) The second problem is that the whirring sound that the CD player makes during \\"play\\" is louder than the music volume, until the gentle wake volume gradually increases loud enough to drown out the mechanism. The third problem is the intensity of the blue backlit clock display. The dimmest setting is still \\"near blinding\\" at 6 am. I would not recommend this product to anyone that I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID","review":"I bought this clock a week ago and hate it. I need a clock that has a digital radio tuner and a cd player. The clock is impossible to see unless your lying in bed right next to it. The functions are so confusing. BUY A DIFFERENT ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many buttons spoil the broth","review":"The clock itself has loads of great features, unfortunately the big problem is the cluttered interface with its myriad of tiny buttons. It is far too easy to accidentally switch off your alarm by pressing the wrong button, especially in dim light. And setting the alarm even when you are pressing the right buttons is not foolproof either. Your money would be better spent on a simpler machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent aesthetics","review":"I thought that I had found the perfect clock radio: handsome, dual alarm that is easy to set both forwards and backwards, good sound with CD... My only complaint is the readability of the display. Despite boasting a super big blue backlight for easy reading, I find the LCD display often difficult to read. To be perfect, Philips should have stuck with a good old fashioned LED. Despite this shortcoming, the AJ396517 is arguably the best CD clock radio out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice radio, bad clock","review":"The radio is good, and I like the digital tuning and volume control, but I must add my agreement with those who complain about the clock face. It is too bright, and at the same time the numbers are completely invisible if you are looking at them from any angle below the level of the clock. Philips would do well to go back to the drawing board quickly on that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bright","review":"If you plan to place this Clock Radio within 50 feet of your body, don't buy it. It is too bright, even in the lowest setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Display TOO Bright","review":"I bought this CD Clock Radio because I was really impressed with the abundance of features. Unfortunately, the blue display was EXTREMELY bright, even on the dimmest setting. I couldn't get to sleep at night because it lit up the entire room. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good signal reception for those in odd places","review":"Yes, the display is problematic (but OK for me), but I bought this largely because it was the only radio that could get the FM stations I wanted to listen to (NPR and college stations at the end of the dial). Stations come from Philadelphia here (50 miles away from me), and this product was the only one to clearly get the stations in the store. If you get it for this reason, I did not extend the antenna -- just left it rolled up and the reception was awesome.The features are great and it is lovely to have much of my nightable back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee Mommy, thanks for the nightlight clock radio...","review":"All in all, I really wanted to like this unit, but unless you are prepared to have your bedroom illuminated by that darn back-lit LCD at night, this just isn't a keeper. The features are nice, but the LCD screens brightness and legibility factors (or lack thereof) unless you are looking at it straight-on, made me return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adventure, but a little too verbose","review":"Pretty excellent, full of lots of drama and incident. It's also got quite a lot of excess verbosity, too (maybe the success of Ross's \\"First Settlers\\" went to his head). There's a lot of, \\"I just told you about such-and-such and now I'm going to tell you about some-other-such\\", which is really irritating.It's still an amazing read by a guy who was really there. And the part where he's leading a huge, and somewhat unruly, party of men, women, children and horses and decides to try and force his way through a mountain pass that's 18 miles long and is covered with snow 7 feet deep for much of the way is nothing short of mind-boggling.I read the PDF of the first, 1855, edition, so I can't completely vouch for the edition given here. I'm a little surprised to see it's listed as only being 300 pages long when the edition I read was 575, not including the appendixes. Maybe this modern edition edits out some of the verbosity, or the print's just a lot smaller."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost soul","review":"The only thing that Mr. Albert has accomplished in writing this book is that early on in the book he confesses to be a Christian. So then why does he proceed to write a book that proves beyond any doubt that he hasn't the slighest clue as to how someone becomes a Christian. This book blasphemes God and glorifies Satan as does any new age book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Divine Remedy","review":"This book has finally said what everyone has wanted to say in the New Age movement but has been afraid to say it. I think it is a must read for everyone on the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"fodder","review":"I saw an add for this book in the Atlantic Monthly that caught my eye. I was a sucker and bought it.

It's a useful book to have but not the best available. In typical Peterson fashion the book shows illustrations of birds instead of photos. While some find this more useful for showing details all too often I've found that the drawings like little like the actualy birds.However this book does contain the bird's comman and scientific name for each species. In addition it has a physical description of coloration and markings, a description of the habitats where they are likely to be found, their geographic distribution, notes on their song and any similar species when applicable.I find that this is a nice addition to the Stoke's Field Guide which shows pictures instead drawings.Definitely a nice addition to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backyard Birder","review":"I am just an amateur, but this book has helped me identify many birds that frequent our area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Field Guide To Western Birds","review":"The book is excellent in most respect.

The complexity of the story rivals that of a P.D. James, but the setting is familiarly California. I learned a great deal about Judaism and the fascinating world of diamond brokerage, but more importantly about the many roles that religion plays in our lives. It is, indeed, a \\"sanctuary,\\" but can just as easily become a prison. Kellerman's characters are, as always, believeable and richly developed. I never tire of her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"I have read many of Faye Kellerman Decker books, this took me weeks to complete the book, it was a slow read and just never got to the point.

Cheesy synth sounds and droning female vocals make for a very very poor listen. This is a great example of the trend in many genres right now, the song refuses to progress. I keep waiting for something to happen, and every mix leaves me feeling the exact same- bored. I get the impression that sapphirecut was heavily influenced by big trance acts like those found on the platipus label. The frame for a good trance song is there, but it lacks the heart and the emotion that made the monumental trance acts, well, monumental. And as much as I *hate* to admit it, D. Tenaglias remixes were a real miss too...though I dont blame him for it, it's hard to take a song that was bad in the first place and make it phenominal."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars for this commercial dance cd","review":"I got this track from soulseeker.com after I heard about this women closing down this website. It's funny because she got a lot of PR from this, both good and bad, but it ended up selling a lot of cd's and making this \\"group\\" so popular.

This is the kind of technically inferior, cheesy tripe that gives electronic music a bad name. There is nothing original, or innovative on this entire cd - it is mediocre at best.

Cloudsplitter was a difficult book to read, not because of the subject or the length, but because I began to suspect Banks was paid by the word. Every time it appeared that something substantive would be remembered or described, the narrator contradicted himself or amended what he just said. I longed for something definite. I'll write the rest of this review in that style, or perhaps not really, for my forebears, if I may call them such, would have chided me in their particular way (their way being of course thought by them to be the only way) perhaps because of their churchly upbringing, although they weren't religious in the sense in which \\"religious\\" was used in that time and place, yet perhaps they WERE religious when compared to the modern lack of..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating story about one of our historic figures in the fight against slavery in the United States","review":"I knew nothing about the \\"John Brown\\" and the real story behind his role as an abolishinist. Based on the facts of his life, this is a beautifully written, honest book about man and his family as they prepare an assault on the Southern slave holders and their ill-conceived attack at Harpers Ferry. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the civil war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fooled for a minute","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but I was quickly disappointed. Reading it is something like seeing Jack Nicholson playing Mark Twain in a one-man show: never at any time do you believe that the man onstage is anyone other than Jack Nicholson. Likewise, as I read, I saw only Banks at work, never Owen Brown. Banks has taken an interesting premise and used it as a pretext for his own literary pretensions. When I was younger, I would have eaten this novel up, but today I have very little tolerance for novelists who have nothing better to write about than the color of the leaves and every nuance of their feelings--especially when presenting them as the reminiscences of a genuinely interesting historical character."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST HISTORICAL NOVELS OUT THERE","review":"Initially intimidated by the size of this book, I nevertheless became quickly engrossed in it's detailed characterizations of the famous and the unknown people involved in the abolition movement prior to the Civil War. Even more interesting is the father-son conflict that drives the novel to it's conclusion at Harper's Ferry. This book will have me checking out more stuff on John Brown. Banks' insight on the problems of race relations in this country are amazing. This is the kind of book that you can recommend to someone not just for the history. Although long, it's a compelling read and one not soon forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly realistic","review":"One of the most haunting aspects of this book is the realistic first person narration. Banks owen brown slowly drwas the reader in with his thoguhts which always seem real, it nevers feels forced. The otehr haunting aspect of the novel is the complex and slowly intoxicating father/son realtionship with is truly explored in a new and intresting away. Banks's Jon Brown is truly an enigma, what is he, crazy or overly rightoues ? you decide. This is surley one of the most powerful and important books in the 1990's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten history","review":"This is a work of fiction that reads like a memoir about the work of the abolitionist John Brown told from the perspective of his son Owen, now an old man who has moved to California, living as a recluse in the mountains. He dwells at length about the family dynamics with a powerful father who believes his purpose on earth is to lead all the slaves to freedom and to kill all slave owners and traders, to \\"bleed the South white.\\" We learn about the family's work with the Underground Railroad in upstate New York and the events which led to \\"bloody Kansas\\" and eventually Harpers Ferry and the death of John, his sons and accomplices. In retelling his past to a young biographer who has sought him out, Owen is very introspective, examining his thoughts and feelings about his father and how John Brown caused the family to be caught up in his messianic delusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"long book, but worth every word","review":"Russell Banks has given us in \\"Cloudsplitter\\" a grand novel on a grand scale, giving his readers a detailed and moving account of what it meant to be a radical abolitionist, a deeply religious person, the center of the family universe. John Brown comes across as a complex, multidimensional person, as does his son Owen, who defies any sort of stereotyping. What makes this book readable, despite its length, is the detail Banks gives to his characters and their philosophies and motivations. My only complaint is that the ending was very abrupt, as if Owen had stopped his narration in mid-thought. Perhaps that was an intentional device on Banks' part, given Owen's state of mind as he completes his voluminous letter to Miss Mayo. Still, it was a little jarring, and left me wanting maybe just another page or two to wrap up the seeming unfinished thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific tale about a tumultuous terrorist","review":"This was a fantastic page turner! Both the detailed historical construct and rich character development made this one of my top...20 reads of all time. The significance of the label of terrorism in our anxious post 9/11 \\"why do they hate us\\" culture makes this historical tale very contemporary. What would you do to fight an egregiously immoral genocide? John Brown took matters into his own hands, and, guided by an equally contemporary religous fanaticism, became more of a vigalante than terrorist. Great family dynamics too. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over The Top!! Over Long & Sometimes Overwrought","review":"Wonderful evocation of 19th century rural life. Brave attempt to write a fictional \\"reflective\\" biography of John Brown. Gives a reader an authentic feel for slavery as the all corrosive political/moral issue in pre-civil war America.Ultimately an almost Great American Novel undone by poor editing, literary trickery and a repetitively pathetic narrator.At 758 pages the novel is overlong for even such a mighty subject as John Brown. The narrator, Owen Brown is so artlessly drawn that after 50 pages he has nothing new to say and his occassional whinning soliloquies are more irrritating then revealing.It appears Mr. Banks'fame has intimidated his editor. Too bad. This near great book could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was \\"a great read\\": descriptive, analytical.","review":"I was amazed that such a reflective, descriptive quasi-historical and long novel turned out to be so readable. The book evokes nineteenth century pioneer life vividly and the portrait it paints of the sometimes-deluded John Brown is realistic and believable. The narrator, Owen Brown, got a little tiresome. The character seemed partly motivated by a grandiose idea of his own importance, and he had a tendency to overanalyze. But the moral questions he raised were often important when one considers the history of the US and, sometimes, of universal significance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is simply a stunning novel from banks","review":"I thought this was a brillant novel, that had an increadaible scope and brillantly writen charaters.

Compensating with 12Ga ext.cord + locally high 122VAC (to reduce heat and brush-wear). Tested spade on dry, hard-packed rocky adobe: buried spade in 2-3sec. However, had to push lightly to keep tool-shaft engaged with piston. Hope this annoyance goes away with wear. Bull-nose on concrete: also impressive. Fun, but no toy.

Make sure when you get the tool you purchase some extra carbon brushes (Hitachi part 99044). Don't bother buying extra chisels for this tool.

One aspect of police work this book falls a little short on is the extreme negative impact continuous exposure to horrific crime scenes can have on an officer's human spirit.

At most, it is precocious in its innocence. The characters, who are idealistic to a fault, are annoying at best, and never elicit any sympathy for their troubles.

The laser has issues with level tilt and orientation. Also, if the level is not stuck to the wall 100%, the laser will invariably move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Taste","review":"I bought this CD because of the intelligent eclecticism in the choice of tunes and a fatal addiction to the format of the pianoless quartet. At the time, Allan Chase was foriegn to me. Numerous listenings only made my love for this group grow. The knowing quality of the musicianship never dilutes the vitality of the improvising. Something old, something new. A great addition to the genre.

Chomsky, however misguided and torn from the real life in his idealism, is honest. Finkelstein and the likes distort the facts at will. Chomsky, like him or not, personifies one of the best Jewish (not only Jewish, of course) traits: compassion. Finkelstein, IMO, just hates Jewish community. This type of self-hating Jew is more common that we would wish, created by millennia of despisal.For balanced view, I suggest Shoher's Samson Blinded: A Machiavellian Perspective on the Middle East Conflict. Shoher is also very critical of Israel, but rationally and lovingly so."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book systematically debunks Case for Israel and similar works","review":"Dr. Finkelstein, the son of holocaust survivors and meticulous scholar on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict writes yet another systematic refutation of the myths about the conflict. Focusing on Dershowitz's book Case for Israel, he meticulously disects and deconstructs Dershowitz's argument one by one using mainstream human rights organizations, official records , and other primary scholarly sources. His debate with Dershowitz on Democracy Now show that his argument and documentation of the evidence thoroughly refutes Dershowitz (who have the time kept interupting Finkelstein, while Finkelstein was by and large respectful toward Dershowitz's time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finkelstein denied tenure","review":"This is a brilliant book. In a gross miscarriage of justice, DePaul University has denied its author tenure.As the Chronicle of Higher Education says:Mr. Finkelstein's case has excited widespread interest, in part because of the involvement of Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor of law at Harvard University. The two scholars have sparred repeatedly in public. Last fall, Mr. Dershowitz sent members of DePaul's law and political-science faculties what he described as \\"a dossier of Norman Finkelstein's most egregious academic sins, and especially his outright lies, misquotations, and distortions.\\" Earlier Deroswitz had threatened to sue the U.C. press, the academic press that published the book.UC press is one of the most prestigious university presses. Finkelstein's book was peer reviewed. His Department and Dean recommended he be awarded tenure.

Furthermore it is poorly written, to say the least it is barely legible, sentences are endless, quotes are everywhere, syntax is pretentious, it seems that the author wants to prove how cultivated and smart he is.

Nobody likes to remember that Jews have had mandatory expulsions from many countries in the world, and have been the target of waves of violence in EVERY time period. To say that the Jewish People use guilt and misuse the term Anti-semitism to get a better deal out of life - I say so what? How about slavery? Nations build themselves up on slavery, and you expect decsendants of those slaves to say 'no big deal'? The world has a short memory and easily forgots the things that are embarrasing.

I just saw him speak and saw him publically challenged by a \\"Jewish lawyer\\" who had sat through \\"many meetings with Arafat.\\" And he was great. The guy had the usual short-hand excuses for why the book should be dismissed: didn't mention enough of the massacres of Jews and he just slapped a bunch of left-wing reports together and called it a book.

It was also logically organized so it was easy to refind items. Finally, it included two fine hikes (Inspiration Point and a spur hike to some ruins) that we could not have possibly found without the book.My only complaint was the binding.

The book is replete with extensive quotes, which broke up the narative a bit too much, in my opinion. There were some significant grammatical typos, which were disconcerting. More and better detailed maps, particularly an overview map of the entire area would have been a big help to the general reader.

Now why does this character continue to shot himself in the foot (or in his case hand)? Seems like he just doesn't give two hoots. What makes the book work though, is Jernigan's wisecracking nature, basically condescending everything, as his life drops away by his own powers. This is brought on by the tight, descriptive naratives by David Gates, Jernigan's creator.Not that Jernigan is alone in his life of horror. There's a cast of characters that are barely functioning.

As the so-called New Wave petered out in the early 80s, the stripped down, angry, desparate, angst-ridden folk-punk of the Femmes cut through all those synthesizers like a red-hot knife.Writer/guitarist/vocalist Gordon Gano not only gave words to his sexual (and other) angst, but performed on record and in concert as though the emotions were gripping him at that very moment. The back-to-basics instrumentation, including an acoustic mariachi bass and a minimal snare drum set-up only accentuated Gano's presence.Their succeeding albums all contained moments of brilliance, but their debut was the one solid effort from top to bottom.

By the time I got around to playing it for the second time, I was singing along to the songs like they had been decade old classics. The Violent Feemes had struck gold on their first release. A band in 1983 that played mostly acoustic instuments like upright bass, xylaphone and trash can drums was quite rare, and to do so with more passion than any of the current hardcore punk bands was shocking. Gordon Gano filtered Holden Caulfield through Lou Reed with a touch of Jonathon Richman, to create teen angst classics for that time, and times to come. The Femmes would falter after the release of their second album Hallowed Ground and would perhaps be forgotten as mere footnotes if not for their first album. In some ways this became the Dark Side of the Moon for the eighties generation.

Whether you call it Punk, or Back to Basics, this album spells out why every parent somehow has a genetic hatred for their children's music. And rightly so!Brought forth in the first half of the 1980's, this album (am I still allowed to use that term?) was the anti-thesis to Disco, Progressive Rock, and supergroups like Journey and the like. How could you not like this album with credentials like that?If you were a teenager then, this album laid out everything you were angry about, and if you are young now, this album will show you that your aunts and uncles had access to some very serious music that expressed the agnst to which all teens can relate. Buying this won't make you a follower, but if you don't already know about it, you are way behind in what music is all about.Violent Femmes Forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sing along CD","review":"If you don't have this album, get it. NOW! \\"College\\" rock at it's best, this Femmes classic has the main stream alternative classic, Blister in the Sun, as well as the lesser radio-played but equally classic, Add it Up. The lyrics are emotional and angst-ridden, while the music is a funky garage sound with a twist. This band is my personal favorite band to see in concert, of all times. And they have been popping up in the darnest places, so if you think you've never heard a song by them, give this CD a spin. Just don't play it at any family gatherings, as it can be offensive to some (but my Grandma digs it, and she's 70, so not that bad, I guess)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD, From Beginning to End","review":"Most teens and young adults today are familiar with Blister in The Sun.

The simple arrangments are full of punkalicous goodness with a side of folk. The songs, Add It Up, Kiss Off and Blister in the Sun hold up just as well today as they did in the eighties. When everyone was doing big hair poser metal and crappy studio rap, the Femmes were singing songs about frustration that were true and more than a little ugly.

This is a very compelling story about this hapless politician, and Tom Hanks played this part very well. His comic background aids in his ability to appeal and be likeable (I can't believe he could play an truly unpleasant part unpleasantly--and I am not aiming to damn by faint praise here). Philip Seymour Hoffman's entrance was unsurpassing...His chemistry with other characters worked. Julia Roberts' performance was a trifle stilted, I found. She delivered some lines well, but didn't quite fade into this character. While the film has funny parts, it does not deliver a funny story. The challenges in Afghanistan are so very many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty dialog","review":"The dialog in the movie was the best part of the movie. Hoffman and Hanks traded quips so fast it took me a second to realize the coolness of the insults. They developed a respect for each other because they had a common goal of saving the lives of the Afghans. The Wilson meeting with the Pakistan president and president's advisors was hilarious. The sport of bull baiting came to mind. The movie addressed the real cost of diplomacy in terms of human lives. The slow bleed strategy of the current CIA operatives was costing lives. Charlie's goal was simple: he wanted to stop the Soviet helicopters from killing innocents.All the acting was excellent. Hanks, Hoffman, and Roberts turned in fine performances. Although the dialog sparkled more than the sexual heat between Hanks and Roberts. The story had a light touch considering the seriousness of the topic.

I actually paid significantly more for a Widescreen Version, but instead received a Full Screen DVD with a label from Jamesport General Store that said 'Widescreen.' It is not Widescreen, and it will cost more money to return the DVD and exchange it, than to simply keep the incorrect DVD.

Tom Hanks and the CIA agent especially are very convincing characters. Julia Roberts also plays her part well.

Every character I saw, from Hanks' Wilson, to Julia Roberts' Houston socialite, to the CIA operative played by Hoffman -- ludicrously over-acted.

As if everybody in 1980 D.C. used the F-word as their favorite adjective (or verb). It was ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 minutes are missing from this DVD","review":"Having seen this film in the theater, I was very disappointed to discover several scenes were cut from the DVD version, including one crucial one. The most crucial cut concerned the fact that President Reagan's approval was what released the Stinger missile to the Afghans.Also cut were scenes: Charlie Wilson was sick in the Hospital; his re-elction effort; testing an ineffective missile in Egypt; any more?

The Russians were asked by the Afghan government to help them stop the civl war. the Afghan government who was asking the Russians for help were another three years in power after the Russians left Afghanistan. After this, a real messy civil war started (no time for building schools), and then the Taliban took over. That's the true story, but we might just forget this with these kind of movies.

Too difficult to sit through.","review":"I rarely write negative reviews, but this one calls for it. I found this movie to be almost pornographic in nature, with its heavy emphasis on Charlie Wilson's involvement with women. Way too much is shown that is not needed for the story. While I think overall the story may have some merit, I don't think it is worth sitting through all the disgusting elements of the film. It basically just portrays some very shallow and crassy people.

Aaron, I'm eating crow.Sorkin's dialog can sometimes be called \\"snappy patter\\" but it is always smart as well as witty. Nichols is a master and has not lost his magic touch since he started directing in the 70's. Hanks has become that old dependable leading man who's paid his dues and actually learned from his early mistakes (Joe vs the Volcano? what WAS he thinking). Hoffman was born to play this role and should have received the Academy Award for this performance.The film told the story of an anti-hero who changed the world.

Of course it's now been adapted hollywood style etc but the overall story is true. And wilson's efforts did help to topple communist Russia in spite of the fact that he was a lousy congressman up until that point. This struggle turned the party boy around and made him a excellent cold warrior and this is a good story. Tom Hanks does a great job in this role and the film is both funny and interesting. And it's true enough to tell a important story. Of course the radicals took over afganistan AFTER the war because , aid stopped coming and there was no infrastructure.

Academy award nomination for Hoffman and five Golden Globe nominations. Washington, 1980. A bored American congressman, enthralled by the Afghan war, tries to obtain secret funds in order to buy modern arms for the Afghan guerrilla warfare. I was a little surprised by some of the reviewers here which describe CHARLIE WILSON'S as if the film was a documentary or an accurate account of what really happened in the 80's. IT IS NOT.

His sarcastic, cynical and wry CIA agent is the best part of the whole thing. The dialog is great and Julia Roberts has the \\"Texas Socialite\\" down pat.The crappy Texas accents make it a bit hard to understand the actors, particularly at the beginning of the movie, and I really could have done without the shot of Tom Hanks naked butt.Otherwise, the movie is funny and holds your interest throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best character was not Tom Hanks nor Julia Roberts","review":"Charlie Wilson's war is an enjoyable vehicle for making the point that someone can have a very flawed personal life, but still help humanity. I could tell Tom Hanks had a lot of fun playing the hard drinking, womanizing, Charlie Wilson. However, he didn't seem entirely comfortable in the role, which would have been more convincingly played by Michael Douglas or Jack Nicholson (although granted Nicholson's a bit too old for the role)--someone who is better at playing a womanizing jerk. And the camera man had a lot of fun with those gratuitous butt and cleavage shots. As far as the Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts characters are concerned, most of their best lines were in the trailer. The unsung hero of this movie is Phillip Seymour Hoffman (nominated for best supporting actor) playing a gruff, sarcastic, highly intelligent CIA agent. His character is hilarious, and IMO what really makes this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"The American Way; throw money at a problem but don't fix the root causing the problems....how did that work out for us now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy yourself with a great book!","review":"I found this book to be educational - deep and friendly.

A true story, covered up by the government, starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts!? How could that be bad!? Well, for a change, Tom Hanks isn't playing a likeable character. Charlie Wilson is portrayed as a sex addicted nut job, who follows his libido more than his brain. As for the film, it was just so confusing to me, they jump from scene to scene so quickly and introduce a ton of characters so fast, that by the time they got to Julia Roberts, I was already sick of the film. I didn't even get through the whole thing to be completely honest with you. It's an unbelievable cast and a pretty cool story, but I was not happy with the way the movie was done.

I also didn't realize it was written by Aaron Sorkin, who I really like. Tom Hanks plays a congressman in the early 80s who decides that the US isn't funding the Afghanistans enough in their fight against the Russians, so he single-handedly tries to increase their aid. The movie is almost written as a farce, except that (most) of the facts are true. It moves along quickly and is really quite funny. Philip Seymour Hoffman is his usual great self as a long-suffering CIA man, and Hanks plays a charming drunk and playboy. The Boston Globe didn't like, but I really don't know why - I thought it was a fun and entertaining movie, with some historical info that I didn't really know that much about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A roguish near-do-well","review":"Just in case I'm not the last person on the planet to have seen Charlie Wilson's War, I'm spreading the word, and that word is OH MY GAWD!

It has great snappy dialogue as only Aaron Sorkin can write, and superb performances by both Tom Hanks and P.S. Hoffman. It is at times hysterically funny even as the subject matter is so maddening as to make you want to scream. By the end of this movie the title character, a roguish near-do-well of a congressman (yes, I know that was redundant) was my new \\"I want to be just like him\\" hero. Rent this movie.

Hoffmann is arguably one of the best actors around at the moment, while the prospect of seeing Hanks and Roberts share some screen time, with Sorkin's writing thrown into the mix and Nichol's direction made the wait to see the movie worthwhile.And then i saw the film!! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.I generally find political movies quite boring. But having avidly watched The West Wing for years and thoroughly enjoying Mike Nichols previous political film 'Primary Colors', i was expecting great, witty things from this duo.Whilst there a couple of parts in the film i enjoyed, overall, i found myself looking at my watch wishing the film to finish.Overall, very disapointing and i would only recommend this to people who were having trouble sleeping.

The quality was quite poor (sound, picture, cinematography), plus I was hoping for some sort of narration to go along with it, but it was all comprised of low budget interviews.The tapes were very scattered and sporadic in their content and barely covered the topics they were supposed to and constantly went off topic. For example, the tape on Gotti barely scratched the surface concerning Gotti, and the next thing you know they are briefly talking about Japanese organized crime, like it was thrown in as an afterthought.Though there were a few interesting bits of information, there was nothing that my few mafia books didn't cover in more detail.

It touches on issues of race, sex, parenthood, and carrying on with life in the face of death. It's a terrific story that should have been collected in the year's best stories.

Story after story seems to be nothing but how bad life is and how there is nothing you can do to get around it. Reading this book is akin to watching French films all day then calling your mom and asking her \\"whats wrong?\\".

The disc entitled \\"That Old Feeling\\" is still the best compilation in my opinion but this session features some blues, swing standards and ballads with Zoot laying down some nice lines and as always, swinging hard. If you're a Zootster, don't fear adding this one to the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stooges must be turning over in their graves!","review":"Back in the eighties, there was an announcement of the production of a biographical movie on the lives of the Three Stooges. As a result, there was quite an extensive search for just the right persons to portray the comedic trio. Apparently, the search must have been fruitless because no movie was ever produced and released. Stoogemania must have been made in lieu of the one previously mentioned. What we have here is a dull, senseless comedy about a stooge \\"addict\\" who undergoes rehabilitation treatment at a fictitious clinic. There are many persons who physically resemble Moe, Larry, Curly, Shemp, and Joe at this place and it is quite possible they may have all been candidates for the movie roles. Overall, the acting is lousy and the script is really ridiculous and not that funny. Even the many clips from the Three Stooges shorts inserted in this film don't help it a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stooges Anonymous","review":"This is supposed to be a comedy, but it fails to deliver when it comes to laughs. The plot involves a stooge \\"addict\\" who goes through a rehabilitation program to help him kick the habit of watching reruns of old Three Stooges shorts. The clinic employs Pavlovian negative reinforcement whenever the patients (many of whom physically resemble the late comics) get the urge to watch their heroes on TV. The whole film is really senseless and uninteresting and not really funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I've read other books by Russell Banks that I enjoyed.

Most noteworthy are the cool jazz influences, Brazilian bossa-nova type styles, and Michael's breathy vocalizations add much flair to this album. The sensual elements in this particular CD are noteworthy and reflect the musical market at the time this was produced. Michael has presented himself well throughout all phases of this particular project. Tell Me All About It is one of the CD's best cuts. I would recommend this CD for both lay people and jazz professionals alike. Very nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous trip down memory lane","review":"My mom used to play this album all the time when I was a tot, but she lost her copy.

But now that I'm an adult, I hear what my mama heard: the sexiness, the romance, the sweet \\"mellowness\\" the words and the music create. Now, I know why my mama played it so much; she gave me appreciation for music that makes a woman melt and long for the feelings in the words.

Yes, it is more accessible and yes the sound is cleaned up but what Jesus Christ Bobby was is what actually had turned me on to the band. It was raw, it was different and I believed that it would lead towards a path of new music to come ala JCB. Halldor Laxness suffers heavily under the more mainstream sound and is less interesting than Minus's previous effort. I can just about stand the first track on this cd but that's about it. I'm sorry, whoever said \\"this is what punk music should sound like\\" should retake their music education. Halldor Laxness is far from punk and hope that punk will never sound like this.

Besides definitive editions of those two books, Longyear adds the concluding volume, The Last Enemy, plus a fascinating alien Bible called the Talman and some humorous essays(such as what happens when you discover you have to invent an alien language.) As a three volume history of war and peace these books are tremendous science fiction. The ending to the last book was an unparalleled piece of writing that I cannot forget. Longyear is sometimes humorous,sometimes serious,and he writes about his aliens anthropologically so that by the end you understand their culture as well as their philosophy. It is a complete story, and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"More timely than ever.","review":"The Enemy Papers is a compilation that includes three novels, Enemy Mine, The Tomorrow Testament and The Last Enemy, as well as The Talman, an alien Bible. Barry Longyear's trilogy of the war between humans and the alien Dracs was always a fantastic story, philosophically deep while entertaining to read, but today the story is even more timely. In this world of renewed terrorist activity and threat of war, a well-thought-out treatise of unrequited hate, fierce nationalism and the horrors of war reads like a world relations primer. The issues of how to establish and keep peace are dealt with honestly and with human (and alien) nature always considered. Nothing is easy, and nothing is straightforward. Longyear is a spectacular writer and this is one of his best. I guarantee that the ending to the last novel will knock your socks off, whether you are wearing socks or not. I promise. Read this book, it will engrave itself on your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but no stand outs","review":"Simon here gives us some very good lyrics, but nothing stand out. All of the songs seem to follow some generic pattern, that makes the CD seem like one long tedious song."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great pop albums","review":"I'm glad to read the other comments about \\"Hearts and Bones\\" posted here; I thought I and my piano teacher were the only two people in America who believe this album is Simon's best. \\"Rene and Georgette Magritte\\" alone should have earned this album a Grammy; following that masterpiece with \\"Johnny Ace\\" packs a huge emotional wallop that, in my mind, transcends the pop genre. This album exposes as myth the claim that an artist can't write about his own life and still keep wit, irony, and poetry in the mix. Simon does it all. (The album that, for me, comes closest to Hearts and Bones in successfully melding personal insight with great music is Springsteen's Tunnel of Love.) I envy any Simon fan (or music fan) who has yet to hear this album for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"alcohol abuse","review":"My wife and I feel this book should be read by any woman who is engaged to someone who drinks excessively, who is married to someone who drinks to much, or is being abused by her spouse.

I read the book. It is a great piece of writing. I believe the abuse with her father truly happened. However, having been a boarder at the convent in Gorham, during the 50's I had difficulty believing the cruelty of the nun in question. We were never abused, and we were never called by a number.

I can relate to it in so many ways. The writer keeps you wanting to read more. It is so amazing how people can look the other way especially your own family. We need to break the cycle of abuse. It seems like it goes down from generation to generation and it has to stop somewhere. I felt like I was right there in the book.

This is one of the very, again, very, few books I simply didn't want to finish. The social structure he describes for the Kronians is simply too laboured to be believable even in context. The story itself is buried under the mass of verbiage used to describe the social, historical, and scientific setting of Hogan's, er, uh story(?). It may be that a platoon of Reader's Digest Condensed Book editors could have made this tome readable, but then it would have been, at best, a novella or perhaps no more than a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This watch is a lemon - 2 failures and counting","review":"If you buy this watch, be sure to save your reciept, because it will fail, and you will need to return it.

At least 20 times a day, all of my data would be wiped out and the watch would reset to 12:00. Signal strength was always pretty good-- but the watch is completely unreliable in my opinion. I have read some message boards on this watch and this is a common problem. It is a defective design. COMP USA charged me 15% to return it and on top of that MSN would not refund the up front yearly MSNDirect charge (however, after a few days, a MSN supervisor called back to say that they would credit the money back). I have read that the SUUNTO watch should be much better because the antenna is in the watch, not the band. Much less susceptible to static charge. Bottom line= Fossil made bad watch, COMP USA has terrible return policy, and MSNDirect almost swindled my [$]-- but after some persistence, they made right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another One Bites the Dust","review":"Mine lasted six days before going dead.

Judging from the other postings, my experience was better than many.I find it amazing that MS and Fossil didn't delay this product until they got the bugs out. I guess these things build up momentum in the corporation and then no one dares pull the plug. MS will survive another flop, of course.

We are reminded that we are to serve others -- and the \\"mission field\\" should begin in the home! We should seek to put others before ourselves -- and that includes our siblings. Basically they go through Christian virtues and remind us how we should be applying them to our families, which as they point out, we frequently fail to do. Oftentimes we hold our siblings up to a higher standard than we do our friends or even ourselves. This is wrong, of course.

However, this US-DVD has been cut (the UK-DVD is quite a bit longer), so I give this butchered version 0 points and end up with 2. If you have a codefree player, get the UK-DVD.

I was so disappointed when I saw this on TV because Charles Dance and Diana Rigg are such wonderful actors, and they are wasted in this watered-down version of a great classic story. Even their vast talents combined couldn't make this watchable. The version done by the BBC in 1979 or 1980 was fabulous, with Jeremy Brett as Maxim de Winter but it has never been released on video or dvd. And the girl who plays the wife in the new version is actually the daughter of Joanna David, who played the same role in the BBC show.Pass on the 1997 version--it's soap opera dramatics and hysteria."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This movie can't be compared to the two past versions.

This for several reasons :- Maxim de Winter looks much older than he's supposed to be, and hence the age difference with the girl is striking.- His manners are very straighforward (for example, he stares at her at their first encounter)- Some lines have been added that modify the spirit of the movie (for example when Maxim says in the beginning \\"I don't know how to deal with you\\" or \\"This moment is not that great\\").- The girl is too pretty, does not look naive enough, wears too much makeup.I could not watch more than 20 minutes of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebecca","review":"Dear Sir or Madam,I cannot comment on this DVD, since I encountered a bad seller, and I did not receive the DVD.

This will always be a classic love story between a young woman and an older mysterious widower that changes and matures with tragedy and the revelation of secrets. As with the originial film, this movie is suspenseful, romantic, and tragic. This faithful adapation from the book expands on issues that were skimmed over in the orginial movie but should have been filmed in black and white. In the new adaptation, the feelings between Maxim and the new Mrs. de Winter are underscored with some blatant scenes where they are still laying in bed and with more dubtle touches, such as holding hands when they walk or when Maxin touches Mrs. de W's face while in conversation. However, Lawrence Olivier somehow portrayed a more tragic and angry Maxim than is seen in this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent don't buy","review":"Since the Hitchcock version is out of print,I bought this version.It lacks the sinister atmosphere,suspense,and foreboding of the book and Hitchcock version.Lacking these qualities, the movie is plodding and rather boring. While Diana Rigg is intriguing as Mrs. Danvers, the portrayal of the characters of Maxim and the second Mrs. DeWinter are unsatisfying.The two have no chemistry, and I care about neither. Ultimately,I read the reviews to judge if I should purchase the movie.I will pass this version on to a friend but will not keep it in my library.Wish I would have rented it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous!","review":"Hideous version of fabulous classic novel by Daphne DuMarier.

One planned re-make that I would definitely have paid to see was in the late sixties, when Liz Taylor and Richard Burton were going to star, with Mike Nichols (who directed them in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf) with Bette Davis set to play Mrs. Danvers.

In the past 16 years this album has comforted me through break ups, unrequited love, hardtimes, and hangovers. Exene's film noir gone bad persona, John Doe's everyman charisma, and Billy Zoom just being one of the coolest dudes alive gave X the best front line in the business. Every track is excellent, but pay extra attention to \\"In This House That I Call Home,\\" \\"Were Desperate,\\" \\"White Girl,\\" \\"When our Love Passed out on the Couch,\\" and \\"Year 1.\\" The remastered tracks are excellent, they are heads above the \\"Los Angeles/Wild Gift\\" CD that Slash put out years ago.

He's one of my favorite authors and you can definitely tell this is his debut novel. This book needed an editor. It was way too long and redundunt. Mr. Iles repeated himself several times describing characters or scenes. The middle section of the book jumped around to different characters without expanding their depth. The middle part was boring and hard to follow. I love his next books so maybe it was just a first time diaster or maybe it was the topic even though I have a strong history background. Just found this book not to have a point and when it was trying to make one then Mr. Iles did so in a monotonous manner. I wouldn't recommend this book but would recommend his others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banality, Hessian Style","review":"The author takes the conspiracy theory jag that the supposed Rudolf Hess imprisoned in Spandau for decades was actually an imposter who was finally silenced by British intelligence to keep him quiet in the fear that the Russians under Gorbachev would soon relent in their refusal to allow for his release and attempts to weave an imaginative tale of intrigue around it. The problem is that the plot is absurd; even if one takes seriously these possibilities, inane in their own right. Hess was a muddled man who couldn't have masterminded breakfast let alone international intrigue of momentous importance.Although the writing per se is competent throughout, even if the educated reader is willing to set aside the aforementioned grievous flaws with this novel's basic premises, the ending leaves one as flat as the Sahara. If one gravitates to this sort of work, then even Ludlum's most mediocre fare towers above this triteness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic...right on up until the end.","review":"This is one great historical thriller. It's got almost everything you could ask for. It brilliantly mixes WWII, the Cold War, and the plight of Israel into a fascinating page-turner. Sadly, it turns into a Scooby-Doo episode at the end. I half expected the antagonist to announce \\"and I would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids.\\" But the cartoon ending doesn't take away from the overall enjoyability of the book. It just keeps me from giving it 5 stars.If you like this book, read Double Standards: The Rudolf Hess Cover-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.....","review":"MY first Greg Iles book and certainly not my last.

Great genre opus for fans of WWII intrigue. Set aside a weekend for this one...even though it moves quickly and the pages turn themselves, it's a long one and you won't want to miss a chapter. Since they breeze by so quickly, you won't want to break it up into too many sittings and lose the continuity. Interesting and innovative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absorbing at first, but subplots and violence drag on.","review":"The book is very absorbing at first. However, a multitude of subplots, murders and tortures do not make the book any more suspenseful or exciting. Several minor plot mistakes are so obvious, they are annoying. The author obviously had never been to most of the foreign places he is discribing. The characters get conveninetly bashed on the head for a change of scene (they manage to survive quite a few bashes over the head with minimal brain damage). Some passages remind me of bad James Bond movies. As for the political and historic overtones, you just have to accept the author's views to really enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book and would have given it a 5 rating, but it was about 100 pages too long. The book gives great insight not only to WW II but it also gives insight into Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall. There were a few characters that were not necessary to the story and plot line, but Mr. Iles kept my attention throughout the overlong book. It was my 1st novel by Mr. Iles but I will definately try another."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Book for Adventure Lovers!","review":"Greg Iles has written many great novels; he is actually one of my few esteemed fiction novelists.This is one of his earlier books- a BIG book, robust adventure that could be a TV mini-series, as a \\"Raiders of Lost Ark\\" movie time-frame could not begin to cover all of these characters, their plots and subplots.Such a magnificent high adventure with heavy thought, lots of action and emotion all throughout these pages.This is his terrific writing and our fun reading at its best!Five Big Stars without a doubt!-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, fast paced, scorcher.","review":"Rudolph who? Who knows. The story is sooooooo fantastic that you will have a hard time distinguishing reality and fantasy in this amazing work of fiction. This is easily one of my favorite books of all time. Iles paints brilliant characters who move quickly in an intricately woven plot. How does the \\"evil spirit of Facism\\" continue 40 years after the war is over? This book is convincing in it's presentation of this idea (and many other subtle and not so subtle political ideologies) that will have you thinking and rethinking your views of the current geopolitical scheme of the world.

Pick up one of his other books, they are so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted and way long","review":"History has a strong appeal to me, and I can suspend credulity as well as the next guy, but this one was really over the top for me. Maybe I should never read an author's first book after reading a later one first. Mortal Fear, Greg's later book, was excellent, even if a bit too long and involved with too many sub-plots. I was happy for Spandau Phoenix to (finally) end. It is as if Greg puts in a lot of research effort and doesn't want any of it to go to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn this bird !","review":"Or maybe use it as a paperweight; gosh knows it's heavy enough.Let's see...if you can't figure out who the bad guy is by about page 50, you're either asleep or you just ain't tryin'.Hackneyed characters, implausible situations, convoluted plotting for its own sake...but hey, a couple interesting tidbits about Hess's aborted mission to England (or was ALL THAT made up, too?).The big plus for this book is that you can easily read it on an airplane flight. Any airplane flight. Like Chicago to Tokyo. Or maybe Chicago to Peoria. Just depends on how many pages you skip while reading. As I got \\"into\\" the story, I started skipping 3, then 5, then 8-10 pages at a time. Sometimes whole chapters. Never lost the \\"plot\\" (what?), never missed the \\"sex scenes\\" (huh?), might have missed some ridiculous blood and guts (plenty more ahead on page \\"X+5\\" - not to worry).Can't wait to skim his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a pleasant read","review":"greg iles is one of my favourite author but this book is such a downer..i tried reading it and fell asleep twice that in the end i gave up even before reaching page 100...if jeffrey archer was to write this story i'm sure he would;ve done a good job...the book was too long, it;s confusing and just plain boring..i was really dissapointed as i am a HUGE fan of his books especially blood memory and sleep no morewish it could've been better..really do"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Meets the Eye","review":"I listened to this as an audio book, and maybe my opinion is affected by the reader's really annoying habit of changing his voice for each of the characters, whcih included a woman with a too meek voice and dozens of Nazis screaming with German accents. However, I can't blame the reader for the book's overly complicated plot. I still don't know why the Lbiyans were attacking the house ???????? I like Greg Iles' books a lot, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic book without the pictures","review":"Have the reviews so far been written by the author himself? This is historically accurate and well researched? At the very least, Iles should have used an editor who knows something about the German language and German customs in general. To anyone who is familiar with these and also actually knows some history (not propaganda), this book is nothing but a juvenile attempt at imitating writers who do 'know what they write about' (Michener and Clancy are mentioned). The consistent errors (as opposed to typos) are obnoxious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated - Ignore The Hype","review":"I am surprised by all the 5 star reviews. I found the book not only to be ridiculously implausible, but poorly executed. The characters are cliched, cardboard cutouts with no nuances and the dialogue is bad b-movie stuff. The author jumps back and forth way too much. There's too much happening, and it's all so melodramatic and poorly executed I just wish it would stop. I just finished Iles' most recent work, \\"Blood Memory\\" and thought it was very good. I'd wager that the author, if he is honest, is now embarassed by Spandau Phoenix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Attention those of you who know the book by heart.When Rochester views Janes sketch of him and says \\"you have me completely\\" you will be profoundly moved and might even cry.When jane returns to the blinded Rochester and he says who's there and she replys \\"Pilot knows me\\" you will definitely break down."},{"rating":"1","title":"An anemic portrayal by William Hurt!","review":"A terrible performance by William Hurt! I don't like him as an actor & this only proves my point!! He has a WEAK English action & just isn't the quality of actor to attempt the part of Rochester!! Miss Gainsborough is worth watching, though, she is powerful & convincing as Jane. Anna Paquin is a wonderful younger Jane; it's a pitiful movie otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible film!","review":"This is the worst version I have ever seen of Jane Eyre as of yet. While none of the versions I have seen live up to the beauty of the novel, others have come much closer than this version. I thought the movie was simply dull and boring, lacking passion between the two main characters; passion that needs to be there in order to make the movie successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor version of a classic lovestory","review":"This Zeffirelli version of Jane Eyre is the worst one I've seen (and I've seen them all, especially if you've read and love the book)-- I had a hard time staying to the end of the film. Hurt is totally unsuitable as Rochester, and unbelievable with his stilted dialogue (not to mention american accent); he seems uncomfortable in this role. Charlotte Gainsbourgh as Jane is more creditable, though the chemistry between the two leads falls like cold suet. This film may appeal to those who have not read the book...however, for my money, the BBC production with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke is the best one of them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A list of errors for Jane Eyre 1996,trust me it realy is bad","review":"Well I have to to have a reason, or should I say reasons to hate this version, and her they are.Blanch Ingram was Blonde,Rochester was Blonde,Jane was Tooooo tall!The fire did not start after Jane left,Jane was supposed to meet Rochester at night,Jane did not go to Gateshead after she left Thornfield,and What happened to Diana Rivers, she was in the book?and, it was a bad movie, that had only 50 percent of the novel,And they are just making Charlotte Bronte look bad.I recomend, the Dalton/Clarke one. It was exactly like the book.I Wish I could give this movie 0 stars!and trust me, you won't enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A secluded Jane Eyre","review":"I've read the book and fell in love with it. I think that first of all the cover throws you off right away because it seems so epic and romantic. The people who did this movie abviously never read the book and understood it. The plot of the movie was so twisted and turned that it never gave the theme of Jane eyre at all. As for William Hurt, I dissaprove of his performance. His voice and his expressions are dull and drab. Though the acting itself deserves a 2. I do not recommend this movie at all. It's is a big waste of your money for you will be majorly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have been better if it weren't for Elle!","review":"This is a fine version of JANE EYRE, and I loved the soundtrack and the actors...most of them. Elle MacPherson must have had a connection somewhere to have scored the role of Blanche Ingram. She doesn't cut it as a blonde, and certainly not as a high-society gal of the 1830's. This is sometimes what happens when supermodels insist on acting. Charlotte G. as Jane was totally believable. She was plain and stoic enough to carry it off.The sequence of events in the beginning was very rushed. Within the space of a two days she fights with her cousins, is spirited away to Lowood School, foments a friendship with Helen Burns, and is with Helen on her deathbed. In the book, all that unfolds within several months, not just two days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, Bad Movie","review":"The movie was an attempt to tell the story in the book Jane Eyre, but it does not even come close to doing it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done","review":"The sets and costumes are really really great, but the highlight of this film is the truly wonderful acting on the part of William Hurt. He plays the elusive, eccentric country noble Mr. Rochester exactly the way he should be played. He's quietly passionate, sexy, and smoldering, while still exhibiting signs of being a real stuffy gentleman. Inwardly tormented, Rochester is perfect.Charlotte Gainsbourg takes on the challenging role of the title character, petit and plain Jane Eyre. Gainsbourg's unearthly prettiness adds immeasurably to her character, but she represses some of Jane Eyre's passion that we find in the book. The chemistry between Gainsbourg and Hurt is tense and shaky - exactly how it should be.Zeffirelli has created the best screen version of this book that I have ever seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Remember, The Shadows Are As Important As The Light\\"","review":"A somewhat slow but overall rewarding version of the Bronte classic , 'Jane Eyre.' Beautifully filmed as all Franco Zeffirelli films are, we are taken on a journey of contrasts as Zeffirelli explores the darker nature of human suffering, regret and memory as played out against the lush, natural beauty of the English countryside.William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg deliver wonderful, though rather subdued performances as the two star-crossed lovers and Anna Paquin is absolutely marvelous in her all too brief role as the young Jane Eyre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I was expecting great things from this film. The actors are terrific, and the novel has been my favorite since childhood. Wow - was I ever disappointed! This is a pathetic, mutilated version of one of the best novels of all time. If given the choice of staring at a wall or watching this film, I'd take the wall in a heartbeat. If you are even remotely a fan of Charlotte Bronte or her novel, do yourself a favor and rent the 1980's BBC version with Timothy Dalton, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay For The Most Part","review":"The actress who plays Jane is quite good, and is certainly PLAIN. The story is interesting or not, as you please. I can't quibble too strongly with this adaptation, except in one major detail.William Hurt's performance as Rochester is one of the weirdest, and worst, ever put on film. He plays the role as if Rochester was afflicted with narcolepsy, and is having an especially hard time staying awake. Hurt's characteristic mumbling and bizarre attempt at an English accent don't help matters much. I don't see what on earth possesses even that poor governess Jane Eyre to find him even at all attractive. Weren't there any hunky stableboys she could be dallying with?There's a far more effective version starring George C. Scott, who is similarly untraditional in his outlook on Rochester but manages through sheer intelligence and acting ability to make it work. Seek out that version for an entertaining and moving version of this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Well I am a fan of the book and I was really excited to see this so I went ahead and bought it. It got good reviews on rotten tomatoes and the cover just made it look good. Well, I was really disappointed. I tried so hard not to be critical, but it was BORING. They left all of the magic out of the movie. I could accept it not being very true to the book if only they had enhanced some of the scenes, but everything was just so bland. I should have rented it, and also the BBC version b/c that seems to be getting good ratings. The ending was in no way a good thing and I didn't feel any kind of true climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG AREA","review":"I PLACED A WRONG ORDER AND SO NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD I PURCHASED.

William Hurt is a horrible Rochester, having absolutely none of Rochester's dark and brooding manner, and course, none of his dark good looks. Charlotte Gainesburg was fair as Jane, she looked just how I picture her, and did alright as acting, but I still dislike this movie. ElleMacpherson was horrible as Blanche Ingram, looking absolutely nothing like the book described. Anna Paquin did well as the young Jane, and her acting was all there is to admire about this movie. The story was screwed up, leaving out important parts, and taking liberties with those that were not. In short, this movie is disgusting, Charlotte Bronte would be appalled. If you want to see a Jane Eyre movie, rent the Timothy Dalton version, that is far better, for it follows the story more closely, and the acting wasn't so horrible. I hate it when movie producers screw everything up!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the classic!","review":"I have seen 4 versions of Jane Eyre and am looking forward to see the 5th. This is the worst version I have ever seen. William Hurt as Mister Rochester? PUULEEASSSE, he sucks!!! Don't waste your time on this version...there are much better versions out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short to Do the Book Justice","review":"Although the movie was well done, because the movie was under 1 1/2 hours, it did not do the book justice at all. There wasn't enough time for character development between Jane and Mr. Rochester so when they said they loved each other, it just didn't seem believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money and a waste of our time!","review":"Whoever thought of taking a blonde Rochester, blonde blanche Ingram, and a tall Jane was simply out of their minds. and hence, I thought it was very awkward that the fire started right at the moment when Jane left. I think that they were just trying to save money! and the thing that really made it dodgy, was the fact that Jane went to Gateshead. The same, careless mistake was made in the 1944 version *which was, by all means better than this waste of money* probably everyone who likes this hasn't read the book, and thinks it's marvelous! but if you *like me* read the book, and loved it, you too will know that if it didn't have the name JANE EYRE printed on the cover, you wouldn't know what it is"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book, then see the movie","review":"I must admit my eyebrows went up when I saw the pairing for Franco Zeffirelli's \\"Jane Eyre\\". William Hurt certainly didn't seem a likely Rochester and Charlotte Gainsbourg was an unknown quality. But the pairing works, at least in this version.Zeffirelli emphasizes the dark aspect of Charlotte Bronte's story, an aspect too often neglected. Hurt is obviously a man living with painful thoughts and Gainsbourg has a quiet, strong presence. Zeffirelli might have used more voice-overs; they would have clued the audience in on what the characters were going through. As is is, unless one is familiar with the book, you may have to guess. Another flaw is the \\"rushed\\" ending; surely the director could have added a few more minutes to tie up all the loose ends and let the viewer enjoy the conclusion.Bottom line on this version is that you'll appreciate its virtues all the more if you've read the book. And why no soundtrack??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and lifeless from beginning to end..a dreary two hours.","review":"Unfortunately, my selection for a Saturday night movie at home turned out to be this version of JANE EYRE. The actors moved through their paces as if they were third rate beginners. There is no chemistry..no vitality..no power of emotion..nothing. For those of you who love the story of Jane Eyre, try the version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It is a beautiful piece of work, superbly portrayed by two gifted actors. This one should be used as a training film for young actors and directors when faced with the disaster of miscasting and poor performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"While the young actors in this version leave much to be desired, the adult actors are incredible. I have read the book, and seen several versions, and this is the best so far. The passion between this couple is extraordinary. This may not follow the book exactly, but the love story is so beautifully told that the plot is almost secondary. Its a wonderful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong actress for Jane","review":"I have seen several versions of this novel and this one has not done justice at all to the character of Jane Eyre by casting Charlotte Gainsbourg as the lead role. She looks too young (not 18 but 15), too depressed and not at all passionate as Jane should be. William Hurt is tolerable and although he is too mellow being Mr. Rochester, it seemed that he had tried hard to create some kind of chemistry between himself and Gainsbourg. I wonder if Charlotte Gainsbourg got this role because of her father being a famous composer. At the end of the movie, I almost felt sorry for Rochester being end up with such a depressed, cold, and dispirited girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG disappointment","review":"As a huge fan of the book, I had high hopes for this movie version. What I got instead was a pallid Jane Eyre who sounded like she was reading cue cards and a very unbelievable Rochester. William Hurt is a good actor, but what were they thinking putting a blond American in the role of Mr. Rochester? Didn't any of the casting directors read the book? For true devotees of the novel, the only movie version that would suffice is the BBC production with Timothy Dalton. He's the only Rochester that would've made Charlotte Bronte proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinning In Her Grave","review":"Charlotte Bronte would be spinning in her grave if she knew what her novel had become.While the casting of Charlotte Gainsbourgh, Joan Plowright and Elle McPherson is a major plus, William Hurt was a bad choice of casting, only George C Scott was a worse choice.This movie is very rushed, loosing many of the details and intricacies that makes Jane Eyre what it is. To increase the horror, there is little, if no chemistry between the two leads and William Hurt looks a decade older the mid 30's that Rochester should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, but not a faithful adaptation","review":"Zeffirelli's sweeping vistas and beautifully shot scenery lend to the feeling that you are watching a classic. Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jane is probably my favorite portrayal of the intelligent, witty, plain governess yet. William Hurt is passable as Mr. Rochester, however, the version starring Timothy Dalton has a much more convincing and considerable Mr. Rochester. In fact, the version starring Timothy Dalton, in passion, plot and character development, and faithfulness to the book far surpasses all the other versions available on DVD today. I believe it is impossible to cram all the amazing and beautiful dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester into a 2 hour film, however this version does try and nearly succeeds. Enjoyable, but not a faithful portrayal of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing \\"Jane Eyre\\"","review":"True to the Miramax tradition the only thing this version of Jane Eyre has in common with the book are the names of the caracters. The acting was wooden and uninspired, there was no chemistry between this Jane and Mr.Rochester and the story was changed so much, even Charlotte Brontee would not recognize it. The Ciaran Hinds/ Samantha Morton version was much better. Ciaran Hinds certainly has the \\"dark brooding\\" looks of the original Mr. Rochester, and when he asks Jane if she finds him handsome, she could be truthful when she said no. This version showed some of the passion and the agony that both feel. It is beond me to understand why directors spend millions to make a movie from a book, only to butcher the story beyond recognition. The classics have endured because of the ability authors like Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontee and Charles Dickens have to bring people to life. The William Hurt version has succeded to reduce the caracters to become onedimentional."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling movie despite its weak moments.","review":"If all of this movie lived up to its high points, it would have been great. Gainsbourg is wonderful when she's not speaking, but often when she opens her mouth the scenes fall flat. Hurt is less self-indulgent than usual, but is best here at portraying deep emotions with small gestures -- not at delivering dramatic dialogue, which often becomes melodramatic. The movie suffers from inconsistent chemistry that builds while Gainsbourg is listening and expressing her emotions wordlessly -- and then evaporates as soon as she opens her mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Representation","review":"I have read the book \\"Jane Eyre\\" multiple times, it is, in fact, my favorite book. At first, I thought that the movie had done a pretty good job of portraying the story, however, as it got further into it, they took several liberties that were absolutely ridiculous. They changed things that it was unnecessary to change, such as when and how Jane met St. John Rivers. If you love the book as I do, I would absolutely not suggest watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me.","review":"This version of Jane Eyre bored me. The acting was okay but i didn't feel any chemistry or love between Jane and Mr. Rochester. It seemed more like they were just saying the lines, but there was no emotion or feelings with them. Jane's face didn't show much emotion either, and this annoyed me after a while. The scenes at the school and beautiful scenery and costumes are good, but if you are going to watch a version of Jane Eyre currently available on dvd please watch the A & E version with Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre instead. That movie is 10 times better. I look forward to watching the Timothy Dalton version when it comes out in dvd too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing adaptation","review":"This is one of the most bitter dissapointments I have ever encountered. Though the female lead did a very good job, William Hurt is the worst Mr. Rochester that I have seen so far. The movie misses so many important points that the novel makes, it is really quite disturbing. The entire relationship between Jane Eyre and the Rivers family is completely missing. The scenery shots are very pretty, and the costumes are nice, but the content of the movie is very inferior compared to the BBC version with Timothy Dalton. If you are a true fan of Bronte's novel, please buy the BBC version (1983), it is the best adaptation out there so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre - 1996 - William Hurt","review":"Great story and great version.

William Hurt gives a rich and layered performance as Rochester, really digging deep into the character and making us realize what a tortured man he is. His rendition of Rochester is unequaled.On the other hand, Charlotte Gainsbourg has nothing going for her except her looks. (Which is undoubtedly why she was cast; she very much looks the role.) Her Jane is wimpy, simpering, and even a little dumb. In short, she is not the Jane Eyre of the novel.The rest of the cast is quite good, the cinematography is lovely, the costumes great, etc. But for me, Ms. Gainsbourg's performance severely detracts from the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"i am a big fan of Jane Eyre. this movie barely followed the book and didn't even seem like the events could and would possible happen. my advise is to not waste your time watching this movie. if you want to see i good Jane Erye movie watch the one with Timothy Dalton. that one is the best by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Eyre","review":"After watching the newest version on television, this one didn't measure up.

At times both actors appeared to be suffering from an advanced case of ennui, which in turn put ME to sleep while watching.As for their lack of romantic chemistry, suffice it to say that these two couldn't start an onscreen fire if she were gasoline and he a lighted match.All of Zefferelli's beautiful photography and sets can't disguise the fact that this project is the movie equivalent of a \\"lemon.\\"If you want to see the definitive visual version of \\"Jane Eyre\\", check out the BBC's excellent production starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, don't bother","review":"Nothing in the book implied that Jane was sickly looking.

Clearly a made for the movie theater version, it was, nonetheless, beautifully done, with fine acting and the re-working of the story, for it was a big re-working of the book, still provided the essence of the novel.

I thought it was a great romance and had wonderful scenery and acting. Then I read the book. I now cannot sit through this movie without feeling like I am being tortured. The movie had so many inaccuracies that it might as well have a different title. This is beyond dramatic license. People who, in the book, never even met each other were having conversations, family structures entirely changed, scenes that never happened added. For what purpose, I do not know. The book is so full of wonderful dialogue and emotion, the movie cannot live up to this. I am very disappointed and will never be able to watch this version again."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE Jane Eyre","review":"I love this movie! Charlotte Gainsborg does an exceptional job of portraying Jane Eyre!

This may be just my personal preference but if I am going to sit down to a movie I expect it to include most of the stuff in the book (the movie excluded the scene where Mr. Rochester calls for Jane and she hears and answers him even though they are hundreds of miles apart from each other, which is one of the best parts of the book)and their was absolutely no romance. I couldn't see Jane fall in love at all she just all of a sudden expresses her emotions to Mr. Rochester and he 's like \\"Wow, that is totally awesome. I was hoping you would say that. Let's get married in two weeks.\\" Go watch the Timothy Dalton version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I find this version of Jane Eyre utterly pitiful. Hurt, though a good actor, didn't quite impress as Rochester. In many moments, I didn't feel the passion/tension that define the character. Gainsbourg was ok, but she lacked the passion too, especially in the scene where she speaks all her feelings when she knows she has to leave Thornfield Hall. The couple lacked chemistry, and what is more frustrating are the liberties the producers took while filming. So much of the book has been left out, and worse, changed. The Rivers didn't know who was Jane Eyre when they first met. Futhermore, leaving no adequate description of the life changing encounter with the Rivers is just sinful.It's truly disappointing, especially when you realise it's a Zeffirelli movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"miserable","review":"This is the most wretched adaptation of Jane Eyre I've ever seen. It strips away any semblance of love between Jane and Rochester. Watching this version, it seems like they don't even like each other and its a big mystery as to hy they even would get married or Jane would come back to him.

This one is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The director could have read the book first!","review":"I regret to say that I do not feel there were many redeeming qualities to this version of Jane Eyer. In my opinion, it turned out to be a different story entirely. The lack of feeling and desire between Jane and Mr. Rochester irritated me greatly. After reading the book, this was such an unrewarding experience for me! I have found to love the book better than any I have ever read. As I realize that it would be difficult to portray this novel in a movie well...it sure could have tried harder! Where is the spirit, the drive, the passion?! Having left out some very valuable scenes and changing the ones that were used was a complete insult, I feel, to the author of the story. She would roll over in her grave 20 times over!The young Jane was perfect for the part and had the ability to do the novel justice. Too bad it all fell flat with the story changed as it was. Did they not read the book before they made a movie on it!?! Somebody read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Disappointment","review":"I had just finished the novel before watching this version of Jane Eyre and I was totally disappointed by the weak attempt to portray its depth in film. It was a thin, papery frame, really, of the events in the novel - it left out SO much and the characters were so terribly under developed. Jane, thoughout the novel, is so delicately molded into a fun, teasing, and brilliant young lady and Mr. Rochester into a passionately devoted man. In the movie, NONE of this took place - Mr. Rochester was too quiet and mean, and Jane was entirely too BORING! She had one tone and one way of acting - portraying absolutely NO DEPTH! Scenes that are supposed to develop their relationship were completely deleted, the ending was rushed, etc, etc. Overall, not good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good reed","review":"Mid-east blackwood uilleann chanters are decently tuned and they will play two octaves, but not with this reed.

He is always demanding of his reader (or audience), as he is of himself, confronting them, challenging them, to look deeply and truthfully into their own hearts and minds. It is typical of him to cast aside tradition in doing the esteemed Gifford lectures, and instead do what he feels is right. He is courageous in taking on the thinking of these three men, and speaking his mind openly, without even at glance toward political correctness. He engenders respect, if not agreement.The review \\"What nonsense is theology\\" is particularly poor, and should be dismissed out-of-hand. It is not a review of this book at all, but merely a diatribe about the reviewer's own pet peeves. It does NOT address the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what nonsense is theology!","review":"The entire enterprise of theology -- attempting to explain a God whom even religion notes is beyond understanding -- is by definition ridiculous and nonsense! What to say here? Simply this. The argument of Barth and Hauerwas against natural theology is simply a way of making irrational religion impervious to rational critique. If you start by saying that Christianity is not based on nature, then what is it based on? Barth/Hauerwas would say revelation. But revelation is simply the delusion of old Jews and Greeks, who had no more notion of what God was or might be than the man in the moon. Thus revelation is baloney and so is Hauerwas and even Barth, for all Barth's intellectual distinction. It is time to call a spade a spade: theology is nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"New look to classic soups","review":"We recently bought this book based on its design. A smart looking cookbook with no pictures? Definately. As we have been trying the receipes, we have been very impressed with the subtle flavors of the various dishes and less impressed with the design of the book. The fish soups, and in particular, the Carrot and Mussel soup, are wonderful. I have been less impressed with the \\"slender soup\\" section, but then of course, that may have something to do with the lack of fattening ingredients and better offerings in other vegetarian cookbooks for example. My one complaint with the cookbook is that I would have preferred an order to the soups based on main ingredients rather based on themes such as \\"festive\\" or \\"slender\\". The ingredients used are generally easy to find here in Seattle, and most of the receipes seem to be reasonably easy to prepare and economical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Soups ...

In this novel, the third of his I have read, he portrays an almost nightmare vision of the 'American Dream' gone horribly wrong. The casualness with which the characters lead their nihilistic lives is at times disturbing, at other times hilarious. The endless spiral of drugs, sex, suicide and parties still holds frightening relevance today, but what sets this out from other Bret Easton Ellis novels is the caring heart it has: despite the flaws of these spoilt-rich-kids, they all have one noble quest in their lives; the pursuit of love. Where the novel excels is how it poignantly describes the hopelessness of this eternal search, and how it shows the desperation the human spirit can sink to in it's pursuit of this unobtainable goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. Great story and great characters and in my opinion BEE's best novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decadent but Riveting","review":"The first time I read this book, I almost threw it away. Eventually I picked it back up again, finished it, and then proceeded to reread it over and over. While I find the characters morally reprehensible, Ellis has an undeniable flair for characterizing the absurd. These characters remind me of the cyphers who drifted through college drinking, smoking and screwing (but never studying or going to class). The mere fact that they graduated only proves that there exists a reality parallel to mine -- a reality that this book seems to document. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the book is how each character has a different perspective on the \\"truth\\". As a result, you're never quite sure what really happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved this book","review":"This book was so dark, but so interesting and fun to read. It is my favorite Bret Easton Ellis book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dug it!","review":"A dark and twisted look into the minds of the students at a liberal arts college in eighties New Hampshire. Fun and easy read. The way he switches perspectives from character to character made it hard to put down and made it more compelling. Did everything between Sean and Paul really happen or did Paul just fantasize/imagine everything? I found the conclusion to the Viktor and Lauren storyline hilarious in the way he vaguely even knew her and she was sitting there longing for him. I definitely would recommend this to anybody who enjoys a nice dark and nihilistic comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rules of Attraction","review":"Reading this book was just like watching the movie. In fact, it made me desperate to watch the movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bo-ring","review":"I found this book really dull. I couldn't finish it. B.E.E.'s style of \\"prose\\" allows for a complete lack of character development. And, plot? Well, there isn't one. If you're looking for an entertaining story about petulant, exclusive New England college kids, a MUCH better read is Donna Tartt's THE SECRET HISTORY. Please disregard the author's dedication to B.E.E."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Memorable","review":"Ellis seems to be distinguishing himself as something of a one-trick pony in terms both of compositional style and the themes of his novels. As I read the first two chapters I was reminded fleetingly of Huysman's \\"A Rebours\\", but this novel is much less interesting. I noted that one reviewer compared this work to episodes of \\"Melrose Place\\" but I find the comparison to be unfair to Aaron Spelling, whose characters are generally more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realistic View. Boring Subject Matter.","review":"The characters are homogenized. The subject matter is right on the mark in reference to reality... but who can take interest in these lost degenerates? The story of empty young adults has been told before but the setting of this book is special... True to life. Parents don't send your kids away to College! But you can see the same thing on MTV spring break. The style of prose is ridiculous... Ellis takes himself way too seriously. Good reference for parents and serious students considering campus life, but not something to remember as great lit. One of BEE's better efforts, but all of his novels are horrible, so that would make this book just a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember the experience of college? This book does.","review":"I read The Rules of Attraction while a junior in college, and it captured more than anything I've ever seen or read the FEELING of being in college. The requisite partying on any given night, the random hookups, the isolation even while surrounded by people, even the smallest details like the game of speed quarters. It was neat to know that in 1987 they were doing the same stuff we are now. I know Ellis's satire hypberbolizes some of the situations for maximum effect, but it's all in the name of capturing what it feels like to be in college and be confused and reckless and think you're smarter and more independent than you are. It was a snapshot of college in the 80s, and captures the experience now, and I think it will always connect with anyone who's been through college or just their early 20s. A wonderful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read it stoned","review":"i must have read this book thirteen times, the best moments being early in the morning with my only cigarette of the day. I know so well all the characters and the multiple allusions to events and people in other books of BEE that i get a strange feeling of being \\"at home\\" with this book.I think this is the best book by BEE by far, because there is truly a 80's legend feel to it.There is real communion of the author with the characters, something we could call understanding love, and which i find somewhat missing, except in brief flashes, in other BEE books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different type of novel","review":"Many people dislike this book and deride its lack of cohesion and unsympathetic characters. However, like most of Ellis' work, The Rules of Attraction uses snippets of characters' lives to tell the story of a community, or at least of a group. This book does not have the obsessiveness of American Psycho, and it is somewhat subtler, but it again uses the shallow desires and thoughts of it's characters to paint a picture of a group of college kids at a small liberal arts school, and it allows the reader a glimpse into parts of the mind not usually devoted to in novels. If you are a fan of Ellis, you will like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex, Drugs, Exploration","review":"Sex, Drugs and Exploration sum up The Rules of Attraction. Camden is a place that is the poster college for terrible things to happen in this book. As readers, we follow these cocaine addicted students into a whirwind of trials and tribulations, such as sexually transmitted diseases, fears of abortion, excessive drug use, bisexuality, and debts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellis the Modern Primitive","review":"Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll on the rocks with a twist of inevitable tragedy. The Rules of Attraction is Scott Fitzgerald in the early days -- on crack. No plot here, but plenty of viginettes of college life that climax into a big depression fest. Characters are believably young and savage, souless, seeking after the unattainable. The writing is raw, the details are too close to home. There are few who can portray the Human Beast the way Ellis can, down to the deficating, vomiting, copulating, and overdosing of the 1980's uppercrust college crowd. It's so real, you'll probably read it only once, and after all things considered say that a healthy dose of debauchery is the only way to understand the human condition. Of course it doesn't touch Less Than Zero or Glamorama in this respect, but it's good enough to write home about about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true glimpse at college life.","review":"Ellis usually writes about horrific things from out of nowhere to facilitate his reputation as a splattercore writer charading as one of the contemporary greats. But here Ellis captures a darkness that is indeed real and for this he must be given merit. His characters all have the same voice just as in any of his other novels. There is nothing to be learned from this novel although some may take it as a warning. Orwell warned of a Totalitarian future in 1984 and Ellis warns upper Middle class parents about sending their kids away to college."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mediocre effort","review":"I am no big fan of bratpack novels, but I have to say that I usually find B.E.E compelling. Sadly this was not the case with this attempt. There is too much focus on the more sordid aspects of College life and not enough plot to make it readable, and the narrative style is stuttering at best. I would recommend Glamorama or Less than Zero as better B.E.E efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"TREMENDOUS DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"After reading American Psycho, I was extremely excited about reading more of Ellis' work. I bought a copy of The Rules of Attraction and it was honestly no better than a teeny-bob issue of \\"Tiger Beat\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"this book isn't for everybody but I thought it was awesome. ROA does a great job of showing life from the point of view of everyone involved just like in real life.

Every single character is vapid and superficial to a nauseating degree. That wouldn't be so bad in itself, if I found it entertaining, but I really didn't and I don't know how I managed to finish it.On the other hand, Ellis is an excellent writer, I can't deny that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his others.","review":"I recommend Ellis's \\"Less Than Zero\\" over this one, hands-down. In my mind, they covered very similar subjects (college kids who drink and drug and sex too much), but LTZ was more convincingly-written.I did like \\"The Rules of Attraction\\"'s narrator-swapping (see: TRAINSPOTTING) and the fact that because you saw the same events from several points-of-view, you never exactly knew what was really going on.... but even that lost my interest after a while.In short: If you're interested in Ellis's books, you're probably going to read this anyway; if you're looking for a place to start, pick up \\"Less Than Zero\\" before you get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever written","review":"Sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, more sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. If that sounds cliche and repetitive, try reading Bret Easton Ellis' \\"The Rules of Attraction,\\" a so-called novel about none other than, you guessed it, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. There is no plot, character or meaning here. Just scene after near-identical scene of unsympathetic, nondescript rich kids getting high and screwing. You want stories that treat drugs, sex and college life with more than a modicum of imagination? Try Ellis' fellow Bennington alums Jonathan Lethem and Donna Tartt. And to think Sonny Mehta, president of Alfred A. Knopf, allegedly threatened self-immolation if his company couldn't get rights to Ellis' \\"American Psycho,\\" a mess similar to \\"Rules of Attraction\\" in its redundant depravity and faux alienation."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no rules","review":"Ellis gets less than zero in trying to re-create a hit book. \\"The Rules of Attraction\\" deals with college kids experimenting with sex, and drugs; seemed like a bad sequel to \\"Less Than Zero\\", yet not nearly as brilliant. You would be suprised that the characters attend college since the only things they focus on are drugs, sleeping with many people, and very rarely an actual relationship. There is no real story here when there is no focus on school; the story line seemed to disappear into the mist of reacurrences with experiments of sex and drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"Oh my god. After seeing the movie based on this book, I was immediately left with an unsettled, almost unsatisfied feeling. I viewed the movie two more times, and then fell in love with the plot. After numerous decisions not to pick up a copy of the book, I finally began to read it. The book sucks you in. It is one of the most fast paced books I have read and the writing style is extraordinary. Ellis' word choice is noticeably careful. The technique of literally switiching narrators spontaneously is quite entertaining. Also, the truth and honesty that flows throughout the novel is captivating. Set in the 80s, it vividly brings you to the time period, often with musical references, and social issues from the decade. This was one of those books that I didn't want to keep reading because I never wanted it to end. It left me feeling joyous, and thirsty for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"fierce people","review":"If you like Brett Easton Ellis or Jay McInerny-this is a perfect book for you.

There isn't a dull moment in the book in large part due to the story and Ellis' provocative style of writing. The characters are quite shallow and far from morally inclined, to the point where some will readers get sick to their stomaches. This is Ellis' intention though as the underlying message of his writing is a critique of the moral state of modern culture. Unfortunately, his themes tend to split his critics often due to misunderstanding. The book is amazing and important.

I am not a hunter, but for those who use magnum air rifles to hunt small game, this target would be very valuable in practicing for an actual hunt. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great target","review":"if this target cost $40.00 it would still be a good buy . i dont see how you can build these an -sale an / ship an not lose money, i think this is the best air gun target of this tip you can buy i bought 2 they were so good i bought 3 more so i can set one at 20 yards them / 25 / 30 /35 /40 yards this is a good setup ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for friend in wheelchair","review":"I have a friend in a wheelchair that loves air-soft and bb guns. He is always saying what a crack shot he is, so I got him this because the target area reduces. The extra long line to reset the target was a plus because he just has to pull it instead of wheeling up to it each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"beware of the bullets you use!","review":"This thing is well made, thick and sturdy metal, real solid and nice.

Only use lead pellets, trust me, and don't shoot at it with anything too strong either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"bought this for air pistol shooting, fun stuff, don't have to leave the rest AND with the adapters you really will hone your shooting skills. got 2 more reducers to go.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keen Aruba Disappointment","review":"I have owned the Keen Aruba sandals just under two years and the tread part of the sole is coming unattached from the body of the sandal. I contacted Keen customer service by phone and they were unresponsive to my concern that a $65 pair of sandals is falling a part in less that two years. While these sandals are very comfortable, the fact that they do not last makes me say save your money and buy a $20 pair of sandals from Target, Walmart, etc. and you will not be disappointed when they come a part after two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"All of the other ratings were made by Henry Hansen","review":"Hansen (I presume) went to all of his books, made 6 users and gave the top rating.

In taking away Stephie, Swann took away Nohar's soul. And why bring Maria back now? The plot was good, but I kept wishing Stephie was there with him. if you read the first three, skip this one. Even with the great plot, it'll leave a bad taste in your mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grity and nasty, but wonderful.","review":"This book is the fourth in a series, but you don't have to have read the others to enjoy this one. The books opens with a bang and ends with one. The twists and turns will keep you guessing, but the author does play fair and gives you all you need to figure out what is going on if you pay attention and read between the lines here and there. This is not a good book to read if you want a pick-me-up. This story is dark and does not paint a very cheerful picture of the world or humanity. I happen to love these sort of books, and Andrew Swann's in particular. As long as you know what your getting into I can't recommend a book much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"SuperFuzz","review":"What a great book! I totally enjoyed this from beginning to end. It had just the right amount of suspense, action and humor. As well as wonderful characters. S Andrew Swann truly has created the greatest fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures to be had anywhere. A great read, animal lovers, members of the Furry Community, sci-fi buffs, everyone should read this book and the rest of the series! Yes, start with Forests of the Night and work from there! Nohar, what a guy, my hero. *siiiigh* Ahem...uhh..err...READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Closure on a Series","review":"In this return of the character Nohar the Tiger/ Human hybrid ( Moreau), the author kept the paced going from very beginning. Nohar used his skills to overcome incredible odds, despite his growing physical detriments due to age. I liked the way the author focused on the evils and corruption that humans can do without the aid of alien manipulation, as was done in the previous 3 books.i would have liked a little more wind down at the end of the book, as there were many unresolved issues that would have been nice to tie up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I find this paper inferior to other parchment papers. I have used another brand (can't recall the name) that was much whiter in color. It was bombproof and never, ever leaked. This parchment paper leaks through very easily requiring a complete cleaning of the pans used. My previous experience with parchment allowed for very saucy dishes, cooked for an extended period of time with literally NO cleanup required of the pan. Not a very good paper in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"paramour, great musical group","review":"I bought this C.D for my daughter for Christmas, she has been playing in on our car's c.d. player.

It is one of her favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk revisited...","review":"Paramore has a sound that will remind you of the 80's punk scene... The guitars, full speed lyrics, humor and spike make you want to jump up and dance. There is no way to listen to this album and not move your body. They are young and somewhat raw and that is so appealing...they don't seem to be tainted by the mainstream media.I wish only the best for the band and I will remain a loyal fan. My 12 year old loves the band also....something we have in common. Great job Paramore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah...Paramore.","review":"I honestly can't say one bad thing about this album or about the band themselves. Paramore has been one of my top favorite bands. A year later of listening to Riot and I'm still not tired of the songs yet. Hayley has such a strong voice and this is definitely their best CD yet. Highly recommended. Favorites include: Let the Flames Begin, Misery Business, Crushcrushcrush, and When It Rains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"The cd is very good althogh is a bit raw because the band is still starting...overall is good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True punk!","review":"This album is real punk! Who needs that lame \\"Sex Pistols\\" band? We've got the best punk album ever, \\"Riot!\\", right here. Anyone who claims Paramoar is \\"emo\\" is obviously very ignorant, we have hardcore punk right here! Hayley Williams is one of the best singers ever, better than the manufactured Patti Smith, PJ Harvey or Nico crap. If you want to hear one of the best albums ever, you should check out \\"Riot!\\" right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say? It's great!","review":"Not only did the CD get here amazingly fast, but it was in perfect condition. It also helps that it is definitely my favorite album at the moment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paramore come back from the dead better and stronger!","review":"The very first review I read of the band Paramore quotes that the lead singer is going to be next Avril Lavgeine, If the magazine refers to the band becoming popular as Avril then I Concquer but in Terms of Lyrics and Music there is no doubt that Paramore surpasses Avril lavgine's Lyrics and Variety of Music available in the Album. Paramore's Album will keep on playing on your Record over and over and you'll love it even more the second time.The debut Song Misery Business is by far the best song on the Album along with Crushcrushcrush. You will not regret purchasing the Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Rock Pop","review":"I had the displeaure of seeing this \\"band\\" opening for No Doubt. When I heard them then I thought every song sounded the same, buried beneath the unfortunate mixing job their live sound engineer was barely accomplishing. I thought they may have some potential and I was right as evidenced by exactly two tracks on this album, crushcrushcrush and some other song I can't be bothered to learn the name of. Overall the studio album is depressingly similar to their live show, track after track of soul numbing sameness."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Pop Kids and Wannabe Rockers","review":"Paramore is all about Hayley Williams, and that shows pretty bad on Riot!, the band's second album. The music is as plain and generic as it gets, sounding like just about every other pop rock/emo band out there right now. Hayley is a decent singer, and the melodies, although nothing groundbreaking, are actually quite decent. Unfortunately fairly good melodies never have, and never will make up for poor lyrics. Williams tries to be witty but ends up sounding whiny and overly cynical (think Anberlin without the clever word plays).At the end of the day this is good music for teens who THINK that they're rockers (fans of the Academy Is, Cute Is What We Aim For, etc) but are actually good pop kids. Skip this if you listen to real music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I love Paramore and have so far enjoyed all of their albums! The only complaint I have is that not one of them other than the Twilight soundtrack has their song Decode on it and I love that song. Other than that great CD and listen to it and the others I have often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but very good.","review":"Paramore's sophomore album is definitely worth buying. It isn't as great as all my friends said it was, but I liked it a lot. It has a very fast feel, but the songs tend to blend together after a while, so it took a couple of listens for me to really like it. Some of my favorite songs are \\"Fences\\", \\"Misery Business\\", and \\"For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic.\\" They each have strong choruses, verses, EVERYTHING! And I love the lyrics. My least favorites were \\"When It Rains\\" and \\"Let The Flames Begin.\\" \\"When It Rains\\" was a slow song, which I love, but it just didn't stick well. And \\"Let The Flames Begin\\" is basically a crappy version of \\"For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic.\\" But I still sing along to every song, totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up!","review":"A great Cd. I listen to it often, it gets you pumped up and ready to go.I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Were Born For This","review":"This CD is crammed with ultra-catchy, fast-paced and angsty post-punk pop rock. The boys play tight and charismatic lead singer Hayley Williams sings them just right. Though the whole album is terrific fun, my favorite tracks include \\"For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic\\", \\"Hallelujah\\", \\"Misery Business\\" and \\"crushcrushcrush\\". Paramore slows the pace of the album once, right where it's needed for the listener to catch their breath with the excellent piano-led power ballad \\"We Are Broken\\". They end the disc singing 'we were born for this' and I couldn't agree more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as their first album","review":"First off let me just say that I've liked Paramore before they became mainstream and before MTV(the channel that never plays music)damaged them..some what.Paramore's first album is much better than Riot, but this isn't a bad album at all. Songs like: That's What You Get, When It Rains, Miracle, We Are Broken, and Born For This keep this album from being a bore.Paramore still has a great sound, they just need to go back to their roots and tone down on the Pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"She has a distinct voice but it's not very original music.

I love EVERY song on this CD. Hayley's voice is amazing and the whole band together is just phenomenal.Miracle is my favorite song on the CD but as I said above, every song is terrific.In this age of hip-hop, rap and \\"dance\\" music, this is the epitome of rock, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teetering between 3 and 4 stars...actually 3 1/2 stars if I could","review":"Besides for the strength of a couple of singles, the lyrics aren't all that outstanding. The hooks are good but on most songs, not all the innovative.The lead singer has great energy and an amazing voice. And on the bright side, if they learn how to adapt their sound into something that's truly original, there's a lot of room for this band to grow. There's a lot of upside for this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasantly surprised","review":"I wasn't expecting this CD to have many good songs on it because I only knew 1 song by Paramore and was almost wishing I hadn't ordered it. Once it arrived, I listened to the whole thing while at work and was pleasantly surprised. I like almost every song on the CD and it's what's in my CD player in my car regularly. I find the songs original, upbeat, and refreshing.

Can transmit to a large range of frequencies (not just a switch with two or three options) and runs off two AAA batteries. I have mine hidden behind my GPS with only one small wire (not an ugly cable to my cig. lighter), allowing me to output the GPS audio to my car speakers which is very convenient. My GPS has an MP3 player, so I can turn up my music as loud as I want, and the GPS will automatically pause my music to give me clear turn directions.

It may work great, or it may not - depending on your car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is a pretty good little tool. I've got a Sony MP3 player with a proprietary connector so I needed something that would work with a standard headphone jack.

The story is touching and a particulary poignant look at young men who were raised on patriotism and are headed off to war, a reality of which they know little.The cinematography and actors make you long for young love and being caught in the rain and in more serious moments you feel the pain and peril of a illegal abortion and how cold and hard it is to dig a grave in Spring.Elizabeth McGovern is hauntingly beautiful. Penn and Cage show the promise of talent we now consider legendary. On a telling note, Sean Penn's child shares the nickname of his character.In contrast to another reviewer, I too see this film differently now then I did when I was younger.

This one has some interesting old photos and pays homage to the weavers of the past, but the actual instructions on the weaving techniques are not nearly clear enough. Trying to weave a belt on a first try would be far too daunting.In comparison, the book FINGERWEAVING BASICS by Gerald Findley (ISBN NO. 1-929572-0805) has extremely clear diagrams beginning with the easiest pattern and moving through the more complicated ones. It's not as easy as it looks, so begin with a thick yarn or a good quality, heavy, cotton garden twine that doesn't unravel easily. Practice on some small pieces to get the hang of it. Then use acrylic or wool yarns, but avoid fluffy, soft or thin yarns when learning to do this craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look what I can do with my fingers","review":"HAHA (yes I had to title it that), If you are interested in maybe trying weaving then this book would be a great starting place for you.

His collaboration with Lee Perry in the early '70's set the tone for many roots acts in the mid to late 70's. Records like \\"Beat down Babylon,\\" \\"Place in Africa,\\" and \\"Pharaoh Hiding\\" are early indications of the political and religious stance Junior was taking despite the simplicity of the records produced by Lee Perry. Junior was a die hard supporter of the People's National Party and Michael Manley. The socialist party appealed to many rastafarians. Junior's simple yet effective reggae messages during the 70's is often overlooked. His ability to make crossover hits like the popular \\"fever\\" and \\"Festival (Da Da)\\" give him credibility on both sides of the reggae fence.

The DVD information presents it as a \\"coming of age\\" movie. Instead, we get a movie about homosexual rape and murder!It also is slow-paced, tedious, and completely falls apart (in any capacity to understand or follow it's arc) when the characters go to a haunted mansion, and the rape/murder takes the story in a very wrong direction.Other reviews seem to highlight story points from people that have read the original story.

Have a box of tissue nearby because it will rend your heart. Then you can appreciate the movie in all its beautiful setting. The cast is fantastic. I am so captivated by the gorgeous A list young actors who play the leads. They play the awkward boys experiencing their first love against a difficult environment believeably. The only improvement I would have made is to put in more of the intimate conversations between the two boys from the book & stick to the book's ending more closely.I have read the book 5x & watched this movie 3x.

First time, the block did not have an appropriate hole for the sharpener tool, second time the block was already broken when I opened the box.

There was still dried glue on both sides in some places and only on one side in other places. This means the failure was both the bond strength and the internal glue strength.

What is interesting is reading how Carter was perceived by the general public and how that compares to Obama in today's climate.

Alan Parker ably directs a fine cast, which includes Antonio Banderas as Ch��, Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron, and Madonna as Eva Peron. The acting and the voice work are very good, and Madonna surprises you with her talent.The music is equally wonderful, keeping the rock opera feel of the original stage show. Also, the new song \\"You Must Love Me,\\" written by Sir Andrew and Tim Rice, flows nicely with the original music and won a deserved Academy Award for Best Original Song.Costumes, acting, sets, visuals and music all combine to create a great movie experience. A note of caution to some, though: this is sung through with very little spoken dialoque. I remember seeing this in the theater and listening to some people complain about it and walk out of the movie. Stick with it, and you will definitely enjoy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two for Antonio, not, the you know what","review":"Boy was I ever disappointed with Evita. The songs are terrible (except for \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" and \\"You Must Love Me\\"), so overly worded, and they do nothing to advance what little story there is. I'm still dumbfounded as to what exactly Eva Peron did for her country. From what I could gather from Madonna's close to home performance, was sleep her way to the top. (I fail to understand why the people of Argentina didn't like the choice of Madonna as their favorite first lady...she seems to fit the role perfectly). The one pleasant surprise of the movie was how wonderful Antonio Banderas was. I never knew he could sing as good as he looks! Give him his own musical. Don't make him play second fiddle to the you know what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, tragic, yet flawed","review":"This wonderful production of the rock opera of the same name is truly a grat achievement for all involved. Madonna gives what is almost certainly the only film performance she'll be remembered kindly for, and Banderas makes a very compelling, slightly sinister, Che. Jonathan Pryce does a solid job as Juan Peron, though he does tend to talk through his songs as opposed to sing them. There is, however, one serious flaw I would like to warn prospective buyers/viewers of: the soundtrak was recorded separately from the film, and, while one cannot really fault director Alan Parker for the decision, one can blame him for its effect, which is to make the whol film look almost dubbed. It is usually quite obvious the characters are not singing, especially when their mouths are not moving! All in all, though, well worth wacthing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific musical","review":"Evita is the best contemporary historical musical out there. Madonna shines in this film, as does Antonio Bandaraz. Anyone who doesn't appreciate Evita, obviously doesn't know their history.My one complaint is that the DVD has NO extra features! There really is no point in purchasing the DVD over the VHS unless you want to be able to flip through the chapters or care about wide screen. I would have liked to see some director's commentary as well as an interview with Madonna. Some historical notes would have been nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go see the play","review":"While I'm not an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, I was looking forward to the release of this adaptation of one of his better works. Sadly it left me cold. In adapting the play for the big screen, the authors took the edge from the plot. Their biggest mistake was to make Eva a sympathetic character. Except for Banderas's performance (ever noticed he sounds kinda like Niel Diamond impersonating Ricky Ricardo) this movie is a nicely filmed waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two good songs aren't worth enduring two hours of noise.","review":"This was a truly dreadful musical. It shouldn't be surprising it was a flop. The one surprising thing I discovered was that Banderas can both act and sing. Or perhaps he wasn't acting, he was just being himself. In any event, he would do better to act as he did in this movie, rather than the usual cartoon like characters he plays. There was far too much of Madonna's off-key wailing for my liking. It's a pity my DVD doesn't have a button to filter her out. The musical might have been watchable if it had one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never rec'd it; can't review it.","review":"I never received this dvd so I cannot review it.

The film had high expectations and the first night it was released in theaters the place was packed. By the second half of the film more than half the audience was asleep. I was getting pretty bored myself. I think this is a lacklustre movie and a waste of money. The entire film is nothing but song and at the very end there is finally some dialogue. That was the dialogue that won Madonna an accolade. If you must see this film expect to yaaaaawn all the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bedtime Story\\" to Sleep Through","review":"Neither the lush musical score nor the top notch directing can save this motion picture from Madonna's lackluster performance. She looks the part however the moment she attempts to sing, I find myself longing for the days when strong voices were dubbed into the musical numbers. Where is Patti LuPone when we need her? If anything, this film exposes the limitations of Madonna's vocal range. A few hand gestures and several costume changes do not an actress make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, made poorly","review":"I enjoy the music from Evita very much, but the movie gets really boring aftet the first 1/2 hour.

I hope people will remember that. Also, in regard to this movie's suggestion that, and a certain fellow reviewer's calling it a \\"historical fact,\\": there is no evidence WHATSOEVER that Eva Peron was ever a prostitute. Just another example of one of the many myths, completely unfounded by the slightest bit of evidence, that have sprung up around this incredible woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"I am Madonna's biggest fan EVER, but in this movie, it's very easy to forget it's Madonna. She really got into the part, and she really was Evita. Awesome movie. If you didn't like it, you didn't pay attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie","review":"I can't understand why people have a problem with Madonna playing Eva Peron. I mean, Madonna and Evita have a lot in common, including ambition. Eva was somewhat promiscuous, and so is Madonna. The scene that comes to my mind is when Evita is throwing men out of her apartment, and inviting in more successful ones. Nobody, and I mean nobody, could have played it better.The most outstanding aspect of the movie is definately the music. Madonna is a wonderful singer, and seing that it's a musical, how could she have gone wrong? This movie is a must see for people who listen to Madonna's music. Not to mention the fact that Antonio Banderas steals the scenes with his good looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"I'm not the biggest fan of musicals. I generally find them kind of annoying and pointless. But, seeing as I had to watch this film for Spanish class, why not review it?I didn't like this movie. Nor do I like Madonna. She has this air about her that screams \\"I'm here and you're not\\", ignoring her star status. She doesn't connect with the woman she's portraying, Eva Peron. Antonio Banderas is in a interesting situation, playing varying characters with different perspectives, but that doesn't save \\"Evita\\". I found this to be a very boring film. I don't recommend it unless you're a diehard Madonna fan or a diehard fan of musicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got To Be Kidding!","review":"As a great fan of Andrew Lloyd Weber and his stage productions I had always wanted for Madonna to play Evita in a movie. I thought she had done great as Breathless Mahoney in Dick Tracy but I was saddened to discover that apparently Madonna can only perform in roles that are not too far a reach for her. I didn't think Evita would be too far of a reach for Madonna and I was sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna drags it down","review":"It's hard to take a film seriously when an obviously 37 year old actress is playing a fifteen year old in the opening scenes. Despite the vocal training, Madonna's voice is still incapable of carrying many of the songs. It's embarrassing to listen to her fail to hit the high notes. Even more sad considering everything was lipsynched."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it ain't broke, don't fix it","review":"It was with the cast album of Evita (NOT Superstar, which I've always considered just a collection of pop songs strung together) that I fell in love with Lloyd Webber. This movie (Hollywood can't keep its hands to itself) is embarrassingly bad IF you know the original. The actors look silly. Che's songs are divided up among other cast members. Lyrics are changed and deleted. Songs are rearranged and given to different characters from the show. I hated it. But. If you do not know the original, you might like it a lot. It has a story, and the music is just out of this world, no matter who sings it or with what desecrated lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evita, ok flows lousy","review":"The movie flows very lousy, I almost turend off the movie.

In my opinion Madonna did quite an excellent job playing Eva. Most of you have a problem with her because she is Madonna. I am not a fan of what she does outside this movie, but I will defend her performance in this movie. She was not off-key at all and I have never heard Elaine Paige or anyone else sing \\"Don't Cry for me Argintina\\" with such emotion and clearness. She was Eva standing up singing that song. \\"You must Love Me\\" was another beautiful song that I have never heard been done better. When I heard Elaine Paige wailing these two songs on PBS I had to shut it off, she wasn't bad and she is a good singer, but when it comes to Evita no one can top Madonna. This movie was unfotunately hammered by critics and got a bad wrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"i was verry disapointed to see this movie because i wanted to see the real movie and not a musical movie.i'm still looking for the real real movie but still can't find it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie Adaptation...","review":"...although perhaps not as great as the original stage version. But I supposed that is not a fair statement to make as they are two completely different mediums. Actually, the original concept album was best if we want to get picky about it.

Madonna won the Golden Globe for this movie, and it was deserved!There are so many beautiful scenes in this movie, so I cannot pick just one, but I recommend this movie to anyone that likes Madonna, is interested in South American history (keep in mind this is a musical though-but I think it gives a great portrayal of Eva Peron), or to any movie buff (or musical fan)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"I take responsibility for not realizing this DVD was in French, I wish there was a clearer area for me to see that it was not in English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money down the drain.

One of the most rediculous was Whitney Houston. Please.Madonna not only looked quite a bit like Eva Peron, but Madonna's performance in the film almost makes you believe it is Eva.Superbly photographed, the story is brisk and goes from point A to point B seamlessly. There are no lulls at all.

A peasant girl who used her charms and elegance as an aspiring entertainer and rises to become the wife of Argentina's most powerful politician is sequentially presented with song and dance that only a masterful musical producer such as Weber could create.I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning about the life of an important poltical figure of the twentieth century and being delightfully entertained at the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evita the film - underrated and and underappreciated","review":"Please read no further, if you are concerned about spoilers....Before royalty and quasi-royalty like Kate Middleton, Princess Diana, and Jackie Onassis, there was mid 20th century \\"superstar\\" Eva Peron. Though I am NOT a fan of Madonna, this film and Madonna's performance in it have been underrated and underappreciated (Antonio Banderas also does a fine job.). Be that said, it would have been wonderful if the film could have found a way to incorporate more background information on why the figure of Eva Peron is so controversial. It could too easily leave people with the impression that controversies are little deeper than mistakes of Eva's early years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evita","review":"It was very good, and I enjoyed it.

I suggest listening to \\"High Flying, Adored\\" especially. His voice is excellent in pitch and quality. Antonio is a terrific singer in addition to being smolderingly attractive and a fine actor. This movie is perfectly cast and a total jewel in all ways. Very underrated due, I think, to prejudice against Madonna.

She's hip, she's cool and looks very much like Eva Peron. Her voice is okay, however the voice of the original Broadway Eva, Patti Lupone is much better.Antonia Bandares gives an Oscar worthy performance as Che and even though the title \\"Pop Opera\\" is more for the original Mandy Patankin, and the term \\"Hispanic Opera\\" is more for Bandares.In all the film is very good.

Then you re-write it in an apparent effort to dilute the power of the original. Then you hire three stars who can't sing the material, so it has to be re-written yet again for their voices. And then you wonder why the film's success doesn't equal the original's. If you listen to the Patti LuPone New York soundtrack and then see the film... you'll know exactly what went wrong for the film version of EVITA: in a word, everything.

The Germs were smart, powerful and philosophical. Don't believe me? Just look at the lyrics. Darby obviously paid a lot attention to Bowie.

Don't fool yourself into thinking that Hynde is some sort of working-class hero. She's a literate American expat who hit the London puck scene in the late 70s with a vengeance, working odd jobs to get her rock & roll career off the ground. The earlier Pretenders albums, before bassist Pete Farndon and guitarist James Honeyman-Scott OD'ed, were raw and beautiful with songs evoking the drugging and whoring mayhem of the punk scene in which Hynde evidently indulged liberally. The stuff on \\"Crawl\\" is more reflective of Hynde's maturity, as she looks back on the heroin wreckage in her past and toward the future with her child. Great stuff. \\"Back on the Chain Gang,\\" \\"My City Was Gone\\" and \\"Time the Avenger\\" are priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 80s Album!","review":"I remember buying this on vinyl and keeping it on the turntable for a week.

There is a Brit-rock feel to these songs, even when evoking her home state in \\"My City Was Gone.\\" Fun to hear Martin Chambers on \\"Fast or Slow,\\" and Robbie McIntosh show off on his guitar on \\"Ramblin' Rob,\\" which didn't appear on the original album.

Thomas Horn and Donal Jones write with a nonreactionary, journalistic flair that is both informative and very personable as they walk with the reader from the shrines of ancient pagans to the alternative altars of the pagans of the New Age. The Gods That Walk Among Us is an excellent, provocative and, in many ways, unique expose' of New Age mysticism. Horn and Jones do not hesitate to warn the church of the all-too-often error of \\"emphasing experiences over doctrine,\\" because they [the Church] are not immuned or sheltered from the mysticism of the New Age. Indeed, because \\"The line between a true manifestation of God, and human orchestration, is often blurred,\\" many churches have come under the seductive spells of neo-pagan spirituality"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Intriguing Book","review":"I found the book to be very readable, then compelling and finally convincing. The intriguing survey of \\"How the plagues of Exodus illustrate(d) God's supremacy over and His attitudes toward Egyptian idolatry and paganism\\" offers a wealth of understanding and hope from which Christians can draw strength and wisdom when confronted with the wave of paganism sweeping our culture. I believe the book offers a timely message (caution, shield of protection), for the leadership of Churches enjoying great Revival; remembering \\"that there are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ....For Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.\\" 22 Cor 11:13, 14.

The only reason that this album bothered me is because it is out of place. Not hearing Dre or Snoop do these songs just doesn't go well and it feels like something is out of place.

In songs like \\"Johnny Hit And Run Paulene,\\" \\"Nausea,\\" and the title track, words and music came together like a nightmare-induced case of the cold sweats and effectively drove a stake through the bloated carcass of the city's country rock scene, which is a fancy way of saying \\"I like it.\\" Included are five bonus tracks which were not part of 1997's \\"Beyond And Back\\" compendium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstood","review":"The title is misleading, at least it was for me.

So I decided to get one. But I bought the Scrubbing Bubbles one instead because I had a coupon. What a mistake! The design of this thing is horrible. You need your hands to snap the brush in as securely as possible because of the way it pivots. That means your touching the cleaner, or changing your gloves afterward. Then, you can only gently wipe the bowl with it. If you try to scrub, the brush falls off when you get to a curved part of the bowl. I ended up using 4 brushes to clean two toilets last weekend, and the same this weekend. I also end up getting my hands wet with toilet water as I fish the fallen pads out of the toilet.

It shows just how narrow and closeminded he could be toward a new talent trying to make it, who didn't meet his criteria. Like he is one to judge talent.

When the marker first goes on the paper, the place where it was drawn with looks wet and slightly tinged with the color, then after about 2 seconds, the color fully develops.My 16-month-old daughter loves these and I can put her in her high chair with a marker and a piece of paper and make dinner with no problem.

I also agree with those who brought up the delay in colors being seen.... my grand-daughter will remark that the marker is \\"broken\\" and \\"does not work\\" because she has yet to put together her actions with the delayed response. This is more so when we color the pre-printed pages and she is trying to color the pictures. She loses interest fast and she loves to color.

The markers feel dried out when you put the marker to the paper and the color doesn't show up right away so it's almost impossible to color anything with them. The kids can scribble a bit but are so confused by the delay it doesn't even seem like the color is coming from the marker. And, even then, the color is very light, as if the marker is running out of ink already. Plus, the description says that it comes with a pouch for the markers but it doesn't. The markers come in disposable plastic wrap. This is the biggest waste of money. What a disgraceful product.

However, all hands do well and thoughtfully in their roles.

Mr. Craig shines in the role of a cop who is still in love with his colleague played by Rosie Rowell. (Miss Rowell also gives a compelling tight performance here.) He and the entire cast just give so much spark and excitement to this cat and mouse tale of murder in suburban England.

When I put it on with my girlfriend, it made the night seem almost dreamlike, especially Somersault. That song has all the makings of one of the best love songs ever. Especially the very last part of the song, round and round and round...fantastic! This is coming from a guy who LOVED Simple Things.

To say that Zero 7 ripped off Air would be like saying that every new musician is a rip-off. If another band comes out in the electronica genre are they ripping off the first artist to ever do it? If this was the case, then every musician in the last century can be accused of duplication. Maybe you should have really LISTENED to both of these artists before posting your lame review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing follow up to a masterpiece","review":"I've been looking forward to this release for over 2 years. Simple Things is one my favourite albums of all time, and I had been expecting Zero 7 to progress and build on that.So I'm sad to report that this album sounds like somebody trying to copy simple things, and doing it badly. No progress and no charm.It's so generic, so utterly devoid of life or passion that I actually took it back to the shop the same day I bought it. This may turn out to be the biggest let down of the year. In much the same way that norah jones has run out of ideas, so too have Zero 7.I can now only pretend it never happened.

Then you find that it's listenable but very superficial and after one or two listenings you feel cheated and it goes into your mass play for boring parties or \\"romantic nights.\\" There's a disconnect between the music and lyrics that bothers me a great deal. I believe that these guys tool around with music and get a good sound then add lyrics, I hate that style of writing.

This album is not \\"Simple Things\\", the artwork and title of this project clearly illustrate this fact. The great writers, artists, and actors/actresses would not have left their impact on society if they always wrote about the same plot, painted the same painting, and always portrayed the same character. I find \\"When It Falls\\" to be a superb album filled with the same ear candy and beauty the made \\"Simple Thimgs\\" and Zero 7 true geniuses. \\"Warm Sounds\\", \\"Passing By\\", \\"Morning Song\\", and \\"Home\\" are among my favorite tracks.

I listen to it over and over, and I especially love the instrumental ending that makes you think of dinner, a walk thru the park and then making out on the sofa after.

Maybe the standouts don't stand out as much as on Simple Things (nothing quite comes close to Destiny), but this album is much more consistant than the last. Most of all, it's definitely a grower.

I disagree with some of the other reviewers who insist that one should cut Zero 7 some slack for being a \\"young\\" group. Their first CD, \\"Simple Things\\", was great. And while I didn't rave about it, I still thought that most tracks on that CD were \\"listenable\\". Along with almost everyone else, I absolutely LOVED \\"Destiny\\". It was just a beautiful and haunting song. There is NO such track on \\"When It Falls\\". I can't remember one song I like on this CD. And it's not because I dislike the album--there's just nothing really remarkable or memorable about it. It's \\"nice\\" in the sense that nothing on it grates on your nerves; you can pop the CD in your player and have pleasant background music.

I do not necessarily need bands to constantly evolve (although it can be nice) but WIF feels like a blatant retread of ST, minus any edge or soul. The vocal songs are worse (except the smartly sung last track) and some of the chord transitions prove songwriting skills to be severely limited, in that the structures parallel those from before to a tee. Only a few instrumental tracks get to even stretch a bit production-wise, breaking a sterile grip from bland electro-pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...

When it Falls is almost as good. What is wrong with that. It's like scoring a 98% on a test and not happy because you did not get 100%...This is a great follow up and Zero 7 must be be congratulated for making a CD that is close to the first one. For those who say this CD did not go in a different direction and is too similiar......That is the whole point. If it's not broken don't fix it.....One last thing.

In reality, this record should have been titled \\"Simple Things Too\\". But look at it this way: this record is just as listenable and enjoyable as the previous one. Zero 7 is often compared to the French band AIR. Their follow-up to Moon Safari was completed different, and not in a good way.Zero 7 did play it safe here, but it's hard to find fault with it. Their music is like a comfortable pair of jeans; anytime you put it on it feels just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter The Chill-Zone","review":"I'm relatively new to certain styles of music; but I do experiment from time to time and check out new genres and bands. Zero 7 was recommended to me by a couple of people, so I picked up \\"When It Falls\\", and have been very pleased with the results.....Zero 7 play a very spacey, stylish and mood-altering form of ambient techno that is very alluring and relaxing. Paired with a variety of singers (who mostly croon in a breathless, low-key manner) this album features washes of sound and atmosphere accentuated with mellow guitar passages here and there, and is very textural in it's approach. It sounds a bit like Enya meets Moby. Excellent chill-out music when you need to relax and kick back after a long day at work. I'm interested in hearing more from this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your a fan of Zero7.....","review":"I put it in and I was hoping it sounded like the Zero7 I love, and it did.

This album is perfect to pop in while entertaining a small group of people, or just if you want to relax...and it's great in the car too. And the featured vocals are stellar across the board in this album. The vocal stylings of Sophie and Sia are so soothing and enrapturing. It's suprising that such a sophisticated combination of musical ideas and vocal talent can come together in an album and acutally gain substantial fame, because usually the famous records are reserved for highly marketable groups that appeal to the masses. I high recommend \\"Siren Songs\\" from Gretchen Lieberum - another great combination of seductive musical ideas and amazing vocal talent. And if you don't have \\"Simple Things\\" (Zero 7's first album,) it's also a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"take it for what it is...........","review":"and what it is, is a beautiful, atmospheric, tasteful piece of music. are the lyrics going to keep bob dylan awake at night? no, but this music is so seductive and the chord structures are so perfect, that i can't quit listening to it. this is definitely mood music, but how can you not find a mood for this stuff? don't take it so seriously and just lay back and drive and see how transendant some of these songs can be. one of the other nice things about this cd, is that all vocalists sing in a way that suits the music. no gymnastics here, even though a lesser singer could have wrecked these songs with celine-type flatulance. bottom line, enjoy and appreciate zero 7's ability to provide a warm layer of sound and write one helluva melody....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!

What punishment accomplishes, as anybody who has been through this will attest, is nothing. Nothing positive, that is.

Otherwise there wouldn't be so called \\"good kids \\" and bad kids....people and ADULTs especially dont even care to find out from us instead you have to read a book thats not even reality!

It gave my wife and I a starting point for trying to understand our first teenager's behavior. It's main point is that being a teenager today is different than when we were 14, and understanding where they are coming from can help us deal with behaviors that were totally unacceptable from us at 14.

So I bought two at 10.95 each and was all excited when they arrived (early, no less). I could not have been more disappointed when I lifted the mug out of the packaging. The design is still adorable, but - especially for more than $10 each - the mug itself is cheap and thin. I had two of these in college and hated them. There's no weight to it, and I know from experience that it becomes searing hot when a hot beverage is in it. Many of my other mugs are of quality material that protects your hand to at least some extent. I can't give one star because the design is as advertised and the delivery was quick. But I'm very disappointed in the material and because of that, I don't think I'll use them as much as I would have liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"To create a straight line this works as expected.

I then realized that the people that respond to the reviews are either very excited about the product or sorely disappointed. My review comes from a DIY'er in Atlanta that found the tool very helpful. It seemed to be level and plumb and didn't mare my drywall. I even dropped the unit on my hardwood floor and it still worked. It is made of cheap plastic and probably not a good choice for a professional but works very well for a DIY'er like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design. Poorly built.","review":"This level was a nice gift for a few moments, but soon failed. It is made of cheap plastic, more reminiscent of a $3 dollar toy than a $50 tool. It has a sliding plastic switch that allows you to turn the laser on, and select whether or not you want the laser to be fixed or auto-leveling. This switch is linked to some sort of electric connection and a mechanical linkage within the device - which jammed after the first use. Now the laser is stuck in the fixed, on, position. Useless to me now.I am returning it, and will not request another. I assume there are more reputable tool makers that make a similar device that is better designed and constructed.I would not recommend this product. Better to pay more and have something that will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well enough for scientific work","review":"I have used this for close to a year now.... It some of the problems I have read in the other reviews like the switch being a pain.... and the lines getting lighter..... But both were curable ...the switch ...cured by taking off the \\"decorative knob\\" and just using the original slide switch.... sometimes the marketing guys get TOO fancy.... and the changing of intensity was cured by just cleaning the contacts on the battery compartment.... We searched all over for a 90 degree intersect with one line extending both ways and it is virtually impossible to find in the pro area or DIY area.... many 90 intersect with one line meeting another at right angles but not a perpendicular on a line.

I tested mine by making a vertical level line on a wall. I then placed the unit on the wall using the self leveling mode. It was way out of plumb!!I had to rotate it at an angle to get it to match the plumbed line. The settings switch is a little dificult to maneuver also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it","review":"This thing bites. I used it to lay out stakes about 25 feet away. The light is very dim at this distance, even at night. Then, to double check, I picked up the unit, put it back down again, and repeated the measurements. They had moved 3 inches!! A third try was in between the first two. IOW, it does not self level. It's cheap, but a total waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works, but not reliable","review":"When the laser is operating at full intensity, the tool is very useful. More often, however, the laser dims dramatically and I have to tap the case several times to restore the proper brightness. The slightest vibration causes the laser to dim again, frustrating my attempts to use this tool.If I had it to do over again, I would gladly pay more for a higher quality laser tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful to me","review":"This thing has been sitting in my drawer for almost a year. After I tried using it the first time, I gave up because it was hard to mount or place on carpet, if needed. It was also too bulky to mount using the sticky tape. So after trying to mount it and stick to the wall for 10 min, I put it in the drawer. I was going to return it but forgot it was in the drawer.I have 3 other lasers and levelers that are more practical. They are much more effective without the self leveling gimmick/feature. The most handy laser leveling tool is my 24\\" level stick with a built in bubble and laser. That has saved me a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laser light keeps flickering and dimming","review":"The price is right, the features are useful, but one of the most important characteristics, the visability of the laser line I found poor. It sometimes dims, the horizontal lines don't line up exactly, and the laser lines put down are a bit wide -- compared to my $10 no-frills laser straight line. I have to smack my unit around to get the red lasers to brighten when it will inexplicably get dim all by themselves -- yes, I did take the plastic safety insert out of the laser.

Mine sucks to the point of being unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"I admit I didn't buy this on Amazon. This thing is ok if you need to level a curtain rod or that shelf that you ordered from Ikea. But if you drop it off the table or kick it accidentally don't be ssurprised if you hear little pieces of plastic bouncing around in the case and the laser is no longer self-leveling. I opened mine up to see what gives and discovered that it's no better constructed than some of my son's cheap toys.

I rewound 'Too Much' and listened to it 3 times before going to the next song. Tara Kemp reminds me a lot of Lisa Fischer. Both wowen are gorgeous, their singing is outstanding, they both released their albums in the same year, 1991, and neither of them made another album. To this day, I don't know what's become of either of them. At least Ms. Fischer ONLY put full-length songs on her record. No samples, and no epilogue or prologue. If Ms. Kemp had followed that example, I would definitely given 5 stars instead of 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great underrated R&B-pop diva","review":"Though limited for sheer vocal ability, Tara Kemp's mix of catchy hooks, great charisma, and pleasing appearance (she's actually quite attractive for someone whose looks weren't the most important aspect of her career) was a nice bit of ear and eye candy that this is unfortunately the only helping that we'll ever get to enjoy, since she seems to have dropped off the face of the earth shortly after it came out (unconfirmed sources indicate that she might have lived in Hawaii for a time). She hit both pop and R&B; paydirt with the downtempo but slightly funky \\"Hold You Tight,\\" a song that has since made its way onto many various artists compilations. Also good are the tender ballad \\"Too Much\\" and the house-style dancer \\"Monday Love.\\"Note: According to numerous sources of fair to good credibility, Tara was born in 1964, not 1970 as shown in Amazon's Tara Kemp Store bio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful voice but...","review":"This album is full of filler.

The prostitutes, commoners, thiefs, and hoodlums in these stories show us a new side of Italy. Not the beautiful, scenic place that we read about in travel articles, but a real Italy, one as real as the streets as New York without all the glamor of Park Avenue, Fifth Avenue, and the Statue of Liberty. Of course, the glamor is there, Moravia does not try to hide it, just as we couldn't hide or ignore Park Avenue, but he focuses on the way Italy really is, not to a tourist, but to a person that truly lives there. Those who love Moravia - who is considered one of the greatest writers of this century - should read this collection of stories.

Williams has a voice that takes a little getting used to (kind of a Yoko Ono/Shirley Temple hybrid), but it grows on you, and I ended up listening to the album non-stop.Much has been written about Victoria's battle with multiple sclerosis, which has gotten her a lot of press, but which I think unfortunately deflects attention from her artistry.

Our 8-year old played with this stuff at his art camp last summer and it was an instant success. Throughout the week, it was his absolutely most favorite thing to work with. We got him this bucket so that he could keep working with this at home and his creativity really showed through -- not only with the four basic colors but mixing them to make all the colors of the rainbow. He has now now worked through 3-4 buckets of this and his projects are consistently getting better, more interesting, and more complex as he learns to think ahead through the sculpting process.The stuff is clean, does not smell, cleans up easily, and works well with fingers and tools. It will retain its pliancy for a long time in the bucket --- which means that it does take a while to lose its softness and stiffen up into a final product. On the whole, we highly, highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a way to seal unused clay","review":"First let me say the colors and quality of clay are awesome and my son loved them! The issue I have is with the packaging each color comes in. Once you open them, they kind of rip open all the way, so I had to use a bunch of zip lock baggies for each handlful of clay that was left over after making a few animals with the clay. Would be great if each color was in a resealable bag since this clay does air dry and harden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift","review":"This was a disappoint for the little girl I bought it for.

After two weeks, though, the water pump in it failed and wouldn't send water to the onboard heater so the next cup could be prepared.

No more having 2 coffee makers on the kitchen counter. Within 4 weeks, the Keurig began spitting out its own quantity of brew. If I pressed the mug setting, it might give me a small cup and vice versa. After living with that for a couple weeks, we returned it and were sent another one at no charge. 3 weeks later, same thing. We returned that one, and again were sent another machine at no charge. This one so far is still dispensing the correct amount of coffee, but is making a terrible growling noise when it refills after dispensing.

It was fun for about a week. The clean-up is easy, it works fast, I really have fun using it. It is cool, no doubt. I just haven't had a really yummy cup of coffee yet. Every cup is weak and tasteless. And I like weak coffee! Dunkin Donuts is my favorite coffee for goodness sakes! My Krups made much better coffee. I think now that the novelty has worn off, I'll try the Tossimo. By the way, I tried Timothy's, Caribou (which had the most flavor), Donut shop, Glorias, Vermont, Tully's and Green Mountain. ALL TASTELESS pretty much. I am bummed because the concept is really cool. It also takes 2 K cups to make fill a regular size coffee mug. That's not really cost effective. The coffee wasn't that hot either. I had to nuke it after about 2 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Coffee","review":"I never leave reviews for products, but after I had a cup of coffee from the B60, I had to leave my first one.

We LOVED it! We talked four of our friends into buying it. Sadly, about 2 1/2 weeks ago, it stopped makinga full cup of coffee. Instead, it'd make about half of what it should have and send the rest of the water back into the reservoir. The machine has a one-year warranty; apparently that's all the time it is built to last for.

I can not get in to the machine to service it without risk of damaging it, so I had to replace it and wait until I have time to call the company.

It seems this is a common problem with the Keurig brewers as I have read all over the web this sort of thing is happening with all their machines.

This machine has a surprisingly small footprint. Since the water reservoir lid is removable (and the entire reservoir detaches from the side), it actually needs less overhead clearance than our companionCuisinartdrip machine.I've read other reviews mentioning issues with leaks, noise and plastic taste; we've been fortunate to encounter none of these.A large choice of roasts and a perfect cup ready in less than a minute.

I live in a city and hate the taste of the water so I filter all the water through a Britta filter and that doesn't even help. As much as I love the coffee and convenience I would not pay for another brewer. The only reason I still have one is because of the warranty but otherwise when this one dies and warranty is gone its over. $100 for a coffee maker that won't stay working isn't worth it and many people feel the same as me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I want to give 5 stars","review":"So I have wanted a Keurig for FOREVER!!

The Keurig customer help line told us to buy the Bold coffees and use a smaller setting to get a decent cup of brew. For the price of each K-cup, and what one would expect from such a pricey machine, I shouldn't have to use for than one K-cup for one cup of coffee. Too weak.

It provides a great-tasting, steaming hot cup of coffee or tea in about a minute and I love having the variety of pods to choose from every time I make a cup.

To be sure it was the Keurig at fault, not the GFCI, we moved the Keurig to another GFCI but it then began to trip the fault indication again.A tripped GFCI can indicate a condition that can cause electrical shock or fire, so we called Keurig. The service rep advised us to descale the device. That had already been done.

I called Keurig and they did not have the model I purchased but was willing to replace it with the B60 - well it worked - for about 2 months. I called again and they sent me a 3rd one. This one lasted almost a year before it started to do the same thing. I still use it today but about half the time it acts like it is starting to brew but will not brew - I open and close the device a 2nd time and it will then brew. Sometimes I only get 1/2 cup so I open / close again to get the use from the k-cup. You know for $150 this was a waste of my money.

This is a poorly designed brewer. The needle that punctures the foil on the K cups has three narrow channels through which the hot water is injected into the K cup. For some reason, one or more of these channels is constantly clogging, requiring frequent cleaning with a straightened paper clip. Last cleaning lasted for 8 cups. Their customer service is just about worthless, just repeating the mantra of clean the needle. It's a shame because when the machine works, it brews good coffee and there is a tremendous variety of coffees available.I've reached the point where I am going to use up my inventory of k cups and then junk this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much money for it to fail so easily","review":"My keurig started leaking water out of the bottom at about 6 months old and the unit itself would get very hot. (i would unplug it in order to get it to cool down). At 8 mons. it started dumping the water back into the resev. instead of brewing it through resulting in less than half a cup of horrible coffee. It took an e-mail and a couple of calls to customer service to get them to replace it. They spent a lot of time telling me I need to descale it more often, etc as if this would cause it to leak and overheat. A) I do descale, B) I use only filtered water in it and C) I bought it because I am the only coffee drinker in the house so it is not subject to extreme usage at all.Still waiting for it to arrive. I'll hang on to the new one but if it goes too, I am def. switching to another brand. These things are way to expensive to fall apart this quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase.","review":"This is not a cheap coffee maker but it's been a great value for me as I rarely go to coffee shops anymore. I love the huge variety of K-Cups available, though you do need to order online to find the obscure flavors and companies. I'm a fan of variety so I really enjoy being able to have a different flavor of coffee every day. The bonus is that you can use the special \\"My K-Cup\\" filter to enter in your own ground coffee, which is a good way to save money. The machine also looks great in my modern kitchen.One negative I haven't seen other reviewers mention is the timer. There is no separate weekday and weekend setting for the timer. So it's a pretty useless feature if you don't wake up at the same time every day. Nobody wants to hear the loud rumbling of the machine warming up at 7 am on a Sunday morning.Other than this minor issue, I'm very happy with the machine and would buy another one if this one ever breaks down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"My wife looked at me funny when I said \\"this Keurig is the one I want.\\" You see, we aren't coffee drinkers. I drink tea and mostly herbal at that. The feature I like is how fast I get a cup of brew! 3X faster than a microwave, 20x faster than the teapot. If I cut open a teabag and put it in the My cup filter, it is even faster than a hot water dispenser! I got the deal at C+stc+ and it came with 90 teas and coffee k-cups. I purchased a my-kap from my-kap.com so I could re-use the k-cups up to 20 times. The My K-Cup filter that came with the maker works quite well on loose tea. Guests gets their cup of coffee, fresh, I get my cup of tea fast and there is minimal mess. By the way, even if the thing is left \\"off\\", it takes less than two minutes to get ready.

BUT, I have bought three machines now in three years. None has lasted longer than 8 months. One day it just stops working properly. Yes, you can use the warranty if you are lucky to have it stop working in less than a year, but that is not always the case. The engineering is defective. A work in progress. Stay away, or buy something more expensive. Update: I did finally buy another one and same thing happened, it broke within 8 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE the coffee!

If you research the reviews you'll discover this is a pervasive problem for this unit. 1 star is being all too kind. Dr. G. Minnesota"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT","review":"The Keurig is a nice idea but the execution STINKS. After less than a year it began to make noises and to fill partial cups. I went on the web and found that I was just one of many customers with exactly the same problem- water flows back thru the overflow instead of into the cup. None of the the cleaning/descaling methods recommended in the Keurig literature did anything to fix the problem. i tried whapping it, turning it upside down over the sink and all of the other witchcraft solutions listed by others on the web but to no avail. The ultimate fix was to get a 4 cup FRENCH PRESS AND FORGET ABOUT IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING.FOLLOW UP 11/20/11In fairness I called Keurig and they provided a replacement unit at no cost even though I was beyond the warranty period. I will try to run white vinegar thru it every 6 weeks as they recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have been using this somewhat regularly for about 3 months now and have not had any problems with it so far.

I know it isn't \\"green\\" but the B60 has replaced the coffee maker in our house unless we are having guests, then we break out the Zourishi. I saw a couple reviews saying it wasn't durable but we use the crap out of ours (at least 5-6 K cups a day) and it is a trooper. If you are thinking which model to get this is one (see my review of the B130 as to why you should pass on that)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste like prastic","review":"My husband bought this home a week ago. I was the tester. The unit itself had a strong plastic odor that lingers still. The coffee I tried had a distinct plastic taste to it. My husband didnt seem to mind it but, I did.

He's impressed with the amount of coffee companies that have packaged their coffees to work with the Keurig maker and how good they all are. I also purchased the filter so he could go back to roasted and grinding if he chooses. I hope he doesn't because by using the Keurig K-Cups there is absolutely NO mess to ever clean up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Xmas gift ever!","review":"I purchased this for my husband for Xmas. We both have the bigger model at our workplaces. We love it. Yes it vibrates the counter a bit when it's refilling the pump...but who cares! We have a variety of k-cups, coffee, tea, and cocoa. They are all good. I brew a travel cup of coffee every morning for myself. Its so nice to be able to pop a kcup in, brew and go! I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine, Weak Coffee","review":"This machine is great. I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas. Go to Linens N Things--I got it for $75.00!!! The machine looks cool, seems durable, brews coffee amazingly fast, and requires virtually no clean up. I am a tea drinker and use teabags. So I also use the machine for instant piping hot water. My only complaint is the coffee. If you like really strong coffee, the K cups aren't gonna do it for ya. Even if we brew an Extra Bold cup in 6 oz of water, it still tastes watery to us. I'm thinking about trying out the reusable filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy and Dandy","review":"My daughters drink regular, we drink decaf coffee. Some like it strong, some like it weak so it's hard to please everyone and the Keurig will allow them to pick their brew and have an enjoyable cup of coffee.

My Keurig is only a month old and I brew 2 to 3 cups daily. After researching online I've found it to be a common issue and customers typically call Keurig customer support and get a new machine to replace the defective one. That will be my next step. I think the quality of the coffee is fine. The K-Cups are convenient, but expensive. I use an Ekobrew filter so I can use regular ground coffee and that works great. It's a shame to have replace a defective unit so soon. Fortunately my Bunn machine at work has been rock solid for over 3 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig B60","review":"Bought my Keurig in May of 2010 and loved it from day one untill it died in Sept of 2011... five months after the warrenty had run out. It seemed to have become clogged even though I had been diligent in performing monthly cleanings on it using vinigar. Last September I started getting nothing more than a trickle of coffee from it. Tried the suggested tips on the Keurig site with no results. I ran CLR through it as suggested online but got no better results than with the vinigar. I emailed Keurig and got no response. I did a limited dismantling following online instructions with no results. I don't know about anyone else but based on my personal experience, I've chosen not to take a chance on Keurig again. Won't even take advantage of the points I accumalated purchasing their coffee to get one half price. I'll take my chances on another brand. I've given it two star only because it was great while it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Addition to the Kitchen","review":"I must have been lucky, because I purchased one recently and I only paid $120 for it and it included 2 boxes of coffee pods (24 pods in each box). I like the look and the ease of using this item. I order my supplies from Green Mountain Coffee. They have a huge variety of coffee, tea and hot chocolate. I like that the coffee maker has 3 cup size settings, but there still could be another one that is larger. My hubby likes to use a HUGE travel mug, so he ends up brewing 2 pods, one at the 9.25 setting and one at the 5.25 setting to fill his mug. The middle size is perfect size for me when I brew tea. The only problem we have with it, is that it makes a ton of noise when filling the water. I have a corporate Keurig at work and that one makes no noise at all. If it wasn't noisy I would give 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke Quickly... and produced rancid drinks","review":"The machine worked great for a few months, but then the unit starting smelling and any drink we made tasted rancid. I tried to descale it hoping that would work. I cleaned it from top to bottom, but our drinks still tasted awful. We didn't use the machine that much, maybe every few weeks, so it's a problem that it broke down so quickly--especially given the price. I'm hopeful that it was just our machine. I haven't read the other reviews to see if this is a common problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope you don't want a full cup of coffee","review":"I am now on my second maker. I used the first one probably 30 times when I just got so tired of it spraying water and coffee all over the counter. So I went back to the store where it came from and they happily exchanged it. The next one is even worse. Sometimes it doesn't brew at all and then other time you might get a half inch of liquid out before it says that its done. I have a hard time believing so many people had a positive experience with this maker. Mine is going back, again, today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can they keep selling these?","review":"I loved it until it broke, after only 6 months use. It would only make about 1/3 cup, even when I selected large. I cleaned the coffee basket and descaled the machine, as per the instructions. That didn't help. I'm very dissappointed. I will not buy another Keurig. Too many bad reviews like mine. I'll try to find another brand of K-cup maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Maker Lasted 2 Months Then Died!","review":"I was really excited when I brought this coffee maker home. Loved using it.

This coffee maker gets a thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gourmet coffee as good as Starbucks","review":"Fast shipping, about 3 days. So very easy to use. Still experimenting with all of the different coffee flavors to find my favorite. Makes 3 different sized cups so you can adjust the strength to your personal taste. My suggestion (as I am doing) is to use Bottled water to minimize the buildup of any sediment that you get from regular tap water. Super convenient for cleanup, just toss the used pod & done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Consider","review":"Great when it works, which is about 6 weeks per unit. I was about to request my THIRD unit, when I decided I had had about enough of the Keurig brand name. The first one lasted about 6 weeks. The second replacement they sent last about the same. The unit will function if you unplug it from the wall after each cup. (If you need the exercise, this is the unit for you.)I like the K-cup idea and will look elsewhere for a unit that will last longer than a few weeks. Nothing with the name Keurig on it will ever find a place in my home again."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"The debate as to whether or not the k-cups are glorified and over-priced instant coffee will never end..Fresh-ground beans brewed in a press will always taste better than a k-cup... however, the k-cups are WAY better than instant coffee.The machine is well made with good attention to detail.The ultimate advantage is just convenience, so fast and simple.would be nice if the k-cups were cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working after less than a year","review":"Well, I was warned, but I still bought one anyway. Less than a year and it has gone blank. My plugs are good, machine makes good coffee as long as you don't use it longer than 10 months. I will be calling them tomorrow, but because I didn't send in my warranty card, they probably won't fix it. I will let you know. I need my coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd machine in three months","review":"I'm giving this product two stars only because I love the Keurig concept. I love the coffee, the convenience, and the variety of k-cups. Realistically though, the quality of the product makes it worthy of only one star. I was actually impressed to see some people getting 15 months out of the B-60. We have had to return our first two machines after a month of use each, and are now on our third.I can't completely say that I don't recommend this product, because I like it enough to keep replacing the duds. My advice is, keep the receipt and keep the box, it makes returns and exchanges much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"Keurig model B-60. I am very disappointed with this machine. I spent $150 for it, have owned it for 2 1/2 years with light use, about 4-5 cups per day and not used every day either. It started leaking after 1 year. I managed to control that for the next 1 1/2 year along with some minor issues like occasional erratic behaviors, small cups erratic menu readings etc.... It just stopped working yesterday, no lights or anything. I will not spend another dime on one of these machines and neither will any of my friends. At least 4 of my coworkers have similar issues. I am going to spread the word that these things are JUNK! For the amount of money we have spent on these and the expensive k-cups they should last for years! I am a very dissatisfied customer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly unreliable","review":"I bought my Keurig about 20 months ago. It worked fine for the first 10 months and then the problems started happening. Basically it won't work. I descaled it and left it unplugged and it worked fine for 3 more months. Then the problem reappeared and they are reoccurring with increased frequency. Today I think I have to read it its last rites. It's a pity, because I like the coffee and the convenience even though they come with a rather steep price. Now I am stuck with several boxes of K-cups and wondering whether to buy a new machine or not. I gave this product two stars for the quality of coffee and the convenience. The price and the frustrating unreliability of this pricey machine prevent me from awarding more stars. My advise: stay away from this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I had my machine 2.5 years and one day it simply wouldn't turn on. I took very good care of my Keurig - and I even \\"descaled\\" it, because it never stated I needed to and you have to. Not only did I waste $150 on this machine, I was stuck with about 40 KCups to find a home for. This machine is expensive, does not last long, the KCups are expensive AND bad for the environment and you have to use filtered water. This machine is a great idea at first for a single person - but the quality does not hold up. Plus this company is too new - they do not have great customers service nor do they stand behind their product. Certainly ot worth $150 in the long run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay attention to bad reviews","review":"I got my B60 2 years ago. I like the idea of one cup brewers and the ease of use with K-cups.But about 6 months ago, it stopped making full cups on a consistent basis. I tried cleaning, I tried the paper clip in the nozzle trick, I tried them all and it still does not work properly.Keurig only warrants their units for 30 days. This consistent problem shows up much later and purchasers are stuck with having to buy new coffee makers.For those of you who want a product that lasts, don't buy Keurig."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless kitchen equipment","review":"This is the most worthless piece of equipment that has ever entered my kitchen. We are on our 3rd one since Christmas 2011 when we recieved this as a gift by our children. It will only brew one size cup, dripples out so that the coffee is only lukewarm when it does finish brewing. I preheat my cup with water in the microwave and then brew. Both Keurigs had the same issues. If it hadn't been a gift, I would have demanded my money back for my children with the first problem and I will if this 3rd one fails. I'm sure that will get me about as far as I can throw my car! My advice-save yourself frustration and get a 2-4 cup regular coffee pot! Besides the coffee is much cheaper for those and you can make it as strong or weak as YOU prefer, not the Kcups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works","review":"This unit has been in service for about a year. It was cleaned regularly even though it never signaled to descale. About two months ago it started vibrating excessively. Then it refused to send the water through the k-cup, instead returning water to the holding tank. Now it actually manages to make a cup of coffe about every 1 out of 4 tries. The brand of k-cup doesn't matter. Performance is universally dismal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working in 3 weeks AND cancer-warning in their manual","review":"I hope this review helps others. I wished I had read the reviews here before my purchase. I too loved the convenience of the machine -- no question abt that. However, after daily use for 3 weeks the prime pump no longer works. When I opened the user manual to trouble shoot I was very surprised to see Keurig's Warning abt lead and chemicals causing cancer . Personally, this information should be posted on the box -- in my opinion.Anyway, I am returning my unit and I hope this review helps others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"Just like numerous others have said, mine worked for about 4 months, and then died -- even though I followed all instructions on maintenance and cleaning. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

Newer models dispence more liquid 8oz and 10oz thereby effecting the overall flavor of your coffee.Purchased one way back in the day, and decided to buy another and after having a bad cup of coffee inspected both models closely discovered the changes in the newer model. I like the 6oz option, maybe they should offer 3 volume choices in stead of 2. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"The Keurig was great while it lasted. I purchased 2 Keurigs and they both only lasted about 15 months. I bought the second one thinking that it was just bad luck with the first one. It seems that wasn't true. My second Keurig lasted only a short while also. Anyone who has posted a positive review for this product either has had their Keurig less than a year or they work for Keurig. This was a horrible product and the company isn't willing to stand behind their product. I think that should tell you something right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"we asked for a coffee maker for Christmas. we got this one. at first we were so excited because it's so fancy and they also gave us a big box of trial coffees. well those ran out - and they were ok, but in order to make a strong cup of coffee, we had to use 2 k-cups in one cup, which makes buying those much more expensive. and it still wasn't that strong (Even with the boldest blend) so we bought the solo-fill cup so that we could buy whatever coffee we wanted and put it in there. works great - highly recommend buying the solo fill - but it still doesn't make a very strong cup of coffee. it's also a pain in the butt to empty and wash the solo-fill out after every use. kind of defeats the point of the quick simple single cup machine. but buying all those k-cups is just too expensive. all in all...i wish we just had a regular old coffee pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy customer...waste of money","review":"My husband purchased this Keurig as a Christmas gift for me in December 2010. In September 2012 my Keurig stopped pulling water through, the LCD display kept flashing, then it quit working altogether. I called Keurig and was told \\"your machine is not repairable, I can sell you another one for a discounted price\\" Then he proceeded to give me a list of available Keurigs for discounted prices and said \\"so which one would you like to purchase?\\" My response \\"NONE!\\" How ridiculous is it that my husband spent $150 on this maker and in less than 2 years its done. We have been married for 16 years, got a $20 coffeepot that is still working to this day. I guess making a good, long lasting quality product is not a priority on Keurigs list of things to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great WHEN it works!","review":"I am on my 3rd Keurig coffee maker in 3 years.

Absolutely love the \\"system\\". We have a total of 8 machines between home, cabin, and office. When the oldest machine went out after 6 years, we purchase another B60 from amazon. The unit just didn't work right. Keurigs customer support was terrible. We are talking about coffee. My wife is not fun without coffee. Being a Prime Member, I ordered another machine to replace the defective one. Either we would figure out how to get the customer service or we would just scrap in.The second unit is worse than the first. Now I have two defective machines.

I contacted Keurig customer service and they told me my problem was 'spontaneous brewing' and could not be fixed. They offered to replace my unit for $97. The machine was just pouring out cold water upon being turned on, unable to brew and shutting itself off. I have no idea what caused this as I always took care of the machine and didn't use it very often, so there's no way I wore it out. The Keurig at my office needed replaced a few months ago. From my digging around, it seems two years is about as long as these machines will last. They produce okay quality coffee when they are working, but if you buy one, don't expect it to last that long. Patents have started to expire for Keurig so I hope a greater selection of single serve machines will enter the market. Maybe we should wait for those and not give Keurig anymore money for such a low quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No it came far from meeting our expectation.","review":"Sadly, our 149 B60 stopped working after (gasp~!) 2 brief weeks!

Also, I had purchased the refillable cup, doesn't seem to matter what kind of coffee I put in there or how much the grains never get soaked and the coffee is always weak. Overall with the K-cups it makes a good cup of coffee. My husband drinks several cups a day now, verses his one. However the cups are kind of expensive, even on Amazon. Oh, one more thing is the cup size, they are not quite right, I don't know if the more expensive one is better but like the travel mug size only fills one of our average size mugs.

All 3 of us have had the same water pump problem. It seems to be something I am only now finding a lot of other people are having too. Once this starts it never goes away and it is too expensive to fix. If you don't use bottled water the company won't warranty it.They want to blame it on a corrosion build up from the water. The cleaning process you have to do with vinegar every couple of months is ridiculous. If you are wanting convenience go to your local drive thru.

How can you afford to pay $150 and extra money for pods when the coffee isn't any good? Even the bold flavors! It's NOT a roast issue! You should be able to get a medium roasted coffee that's not the color of tea (even on the smallest size setting)- it reminds me of coffee from Denny's.

We bought another one. that one made it about a year and a half before the same thing happened. If you like the ease and convenience of single cup brewing you had better have a back up coffee maker. We are now using our $30 Mr Coffee. It has always worked. Be warned that these Keurig machines are for the most part a $150 disposable coffee maker. We will not buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Coffee But NOISY Machine...Get The B70 Instead for $30 More...","review":"The coffee is great from a Keurig machine...I love the coffee. I have a B70 which I love. I recently purchased a B60 for my office and was very disappointed by the loud noise it makes when it sucks the water into the reservoir which is after every cup you brew. The footprint or size of the actual machine isn't much smaller if any at all for the B60 from the B70. In fact, the B70 looks shorter to me on the top. For about $30 more, I would recommend getting the 70 instead. You will get a little more water holding ability in ounces, get 5 brew sizes but most importantly, you will get a real quiet machine....oh, did I mention I LOVE the coffees that this machine brews...and, no clean up which is the best part !"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I recently purchased the B60 and just love it!

I am very happy with my purchase, my husband loves it equally. There seems to be a whole Keurig Kcup world out there we didn't know about. Amazon has really prices for the coffee. If you need kcups right away, Bed bath and beyond and Kohls has a limited amount of choices for sale. This is truly my best purchase this year and it save $ and paper cups (if you use the a travel coffee mug)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Keurig","review":"My husband bought this for me for Christmas last year. When I opened it I thought oh great, another useless appliance to take up counter space. I couldn't have been more wrong! I have used it every day since I got it. My daughters have them too, and they love them. I just use it for coffee, but my son makes hot chocolate with it. There are dozens of drinks available-even hot apple cider! The cost of using k cups works out to about 50 cents a cup-cheaper than McDonalds. Now I am looking into reusable cups to make it even cheaper.

However, it frequently starts making only partial cups or no cups. I'm on my second now in a year.Keurig claims that the problem is \\"scaling\\" - deposits inside the brewer caused by hard water. They recommend that you \\"descale\\" it by running lots of vinegar through it as if you were brewing coffee with vinegar. That seems to work, but only for a day or two, if that long. Then the problems resume.The brewer is poorly designed. One shouldn't have to be descaling it, and the descaling, when done, ought to last longer than a few days.I'm going to try calling Keurig again tomorrow, but will probably go back to the old faithful coffee pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable Coffee and Coffemaker","review":"I bought this so that I could brew my own coffee varieties.

I received it for Christmas 2010 & in May 2011, it started only brewing a partial cup & water gets pumped back into the resevoir instead of into the coffee cup. We use filtered water only, so I don't know why it would have anything to do with scaling. I emailed Keurig approx. a month ago to their customer service dept & have not gotten a response. I'm sure they're inundated with emails about this problem. Do not buy this product unless you like replacing your coffee maker every six months.

The coffee was very good, fast, easy, no mess exactly what we wanted. Then one day it started making a weird noise when it was pumping water to heat it up. That noise lasted about 2 months until all of the sudden it only produced about 3/4 of an inch of coffee at a time. The machine still turns on, functions normally, just won't make more than that 3/4 inch of coffee.I don't think it's a coincidence that everyone has problems around the same time period.Buyer Beware you are probably going to need to buy a new one every year and a half!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Keurig and Amazon","review":"I have wanted a good cup of coffee for a long time, and this has given me exactly what I was looking for.

However, there seems to be NO WAY to drain the water that's inside the machine, so I wonder what the store will think of that. The coffee tastes like plastic, even after running countless cups of plain water and coffee (you can re-use the k-cup, just put aluminum foil over it.. I also used the My K-Cup \\"fill with your own coffee\\" thing). I used ONE of the included coffees and the coffee was WEAK!

After just 4 months it kept on giving me half cups. I descale and do everything that they say and it goes back to short-cupping me a day later. it got to the point that it never gave me a full cup. Keurig is going to replace the unit but I've wasted so many K cups on it. I wish I never wasted the money on the coffee pot then over $150 on coffee for the past 6 months. In the end the traditional coffee pot is still better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was Disappointed but now Happy","review":"We had this Coffee Brewing System for about 4 1/2 months. Two days ago it decided to longer make the proper size cups. The large mug size cup is only 6 ounces now and the small cup is only 4 ounces now. I used to drink two large cups every morning. Using this Unit is too expensive at $0.48 for a 6 ounce cup.

I am Happy with the Unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and can't get parts","review":"This products is pretty good, but the pump for the water is very noisy.

After over an hour on the phone with Keurig they sent me the replacement part to fix the machine. Two weeks later I received said replacement part. It proceeded to successfully brew two whole cups of coffee before experiencing the same issue.

I've used this 3-4 times per week with only bottled water. I've descaled it several times during the year and still haven't had any luck. This one failed two weeks after the warranty period ended.Taking into consideration the failure of these after the warranty period, I believe Keurig has designed them to last just long enough to get past the 12-month warranty. I wish there was a higher quality version. The upgraded and commercial models just seem to be fancier versions with the same unreliable guts.It's a great idea and convienent when it works, but they just can't seem to make them last very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this used.","review":"It was broken when I got it and wouldn't work.

I just threw it in the trash because it is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send it back to China","review":"Disappointing is the first word....after all the 4 and 5 start reviews we read? I have to admit, we were suckered into this purchase. The good reviews must be written by Keurig employees or people who like EVERYTHING!It's a pretty unit, and then you use it. The parts are cheaply made. The unit sucked water from the reservoir and heated it up inside. We put our Kcup filter screen in the holder and locked it in. The \\"hot\\" water went through the Kcup and started going straight through the grounds and into the coffee cup, bypassing most of the grounds.The water started coming out around the intended center dispenser and leaked around the sides of the unit, completely missing the cup. It created a mess and had me looking for my receipt. If I didn't want my money back, I would sledge hammer this worthless coffee maker into a million pieces and send it back to the Chinese.Did I mention..DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Coffee Maker but be warned... Keurig will limit Coffee Availability...","review":"I bought the B60 a year ago and absolutely love the convenience and variety of K-cups. Up until very recently I would have wholeheartedly recommended any of the Keurig K-cup brewers.But... I've just been informed that Keurig will cut their K-cup internet retailer significantly (including Amazon as far as I can tell) in 2007. So the great prices, selection and service one gets from a variety of e-tailers will be no more. So if one wants any coffees beyond just the basic selection at the local Target, one has to pay the exorbitant ~$0.56/K-cup. It's simply too much... particularly when one has a choice in single serve coffee (pods, Tassimo)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastics and weak coffee","review":"I was greatly disappointed that this coffee maker is made of cheap plastics. At least the brewing parts that contact hot water and latches inside should have been made with strong metals. Instead, it's all cheap looking plastics. Just take a look. I don't know when it is going to break. I don't think that it will last more than a year. It is definitely not the quality of coffemaker that costs $150.I was also very disappointed that the coffee that this machine makes is way too weak. If you are a Starbucks coffee drinker, you will never like this. If you drink a weak coffee from a drip coffee machine, maybe you will like it. I just don't understand that this coffee machine is rated so high in here. Something is very wrong..."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak costly coffee","review":"I am a coffee nut. I see all these glowing reviews and wonder, have you ever had good coffee? This thing makes one expensive and small, weak cup of not very good coffee. And what about the little time bomb it leaves behind to decompose for the next 1,000 years in a land fill? Cuisinart makes a nice small one cup brewer which actually makes decent coffee at 1/2 the price. Buy local, buy good coffee and find out how good fresh coffee can be. This is a bogus toy for lazy people."},{"rating":"1","title":"With such serious relability posts, I decided to buy another brand","review":"After reviewing many of the customer reviews, I noticed that the rating are mostly either 5 star or 1 star.The 1 star relates to reliability. The Keurig K-cup systems seem to have a serious reliability issue that Keurig does not appear to be addressing. I have always believed Keurig to be a top quality brand company but apparently this has changed. I have decided not to buy Keurig any longer. I feel if one product line has serious quality issues, then there is an overall serious company quality issue. SO buyers, beware, if you buy the Keurig and it fails, you have been advised.As related to the B60 series, (and other B seriies), the following seem true.The product makes great coffee, when it works.This product is extremely convenent, when it works.This product is attractive, but a waste of space when it quites working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killing the environment with plastic!","review":"Don't buy this even if you think it's convient how hard is it to make coffee in the morning the old fashioned way ? Besides you waste sooo much plastic manufacturing those little K-cups that are NOT bio degradable and sit around filling our land fills while you got 5 extra minutes out of your morning to pick your nose or something not important. Don't buy stuff like this that just feed our landfills and someone else's pocket book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Coffee","review":"Don't waste your money on a pod coffee maker.This model and others (commercial office machine) makes weak coffee.I stop using mine and gave it away.You might try another system but I went back to my electric drip coffee maker.Have the same system at work and still don't like the weak coffee.The plastic pods are bad for the environment and expensive to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE","review":"I am not picky about my coffee. But these coffee taste nothing like coffee at all. You know the kind of goodfeeling you get after you drink a cup of coffee. I tried all kinds of flavor that this brand sells, none of them taste like real coffee. It is very noisy and all the coffee that you must buy are way too expensive. At one point the machine got so noisy I called customer service, needles to say they told me that it is normal and ignore my request for a replacement or service. Since the coffee was so expensive, at one point I used some coupon code to buy their coffee, but they erased my order without letting me know and it is all because they did not like it that I was using a 20% off coupon. The site took the coupon, but quietly took the order out without telling me.I guess some(if not most) of the good review from Amazon was written by people who works at the Keurig.Don't believe them, I wish I believed the negative reviews before I purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED","review":"I bought this after seeing one at my daughter's house.Since she swore by it, I bought one.I have to say - the coffee indeed tastes great.When you want an above average tasting coffee, it is for you.However, I really don't think my B60 is worth the going price.About half that would seem more appropriate. Just my opinionfor what it is worth. Furthermore, mine does not seem to makea constently-sized cup of coffee. During each session, the second cup most always is not as full as the first one, despite the fact that I choose the same size for both. It is off by a good 30%, requiring me to run it again to get a full cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRIMINALS!!!","review":"One word to describe Keurig company......CRIMINALS!!!! I've purchased 2 brewers and it was great for the 1st year but after 2 years they are both broken. Both brewers were not abused. I only make 1 cup of joes a day. So I called their company and they say the can't do anything about it because they only have a 1 year warranty. The man on the phone said that best they can do is offer me another machine for 100 bucks. Seriously....I am not spending another $100 for your crappy machines since I spent over $300 on 2 machines. If you are looking for a brewer, don't bother with this company. They make low quality brewers that break after a few years. You are better off spending 30 bucks on a coffee maker that breaks after a few years THAN $150 for a Keurig brewer that don't last long and is made with cheap CRAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Don't buy unless you have good patience to deal with customer service one a year. I have had 3 machines in 3 years! It is very clear that the engineering of this product needs to be improved. The company is great about sending out another one, but they have no process in place to recycle the broken machines therefore they all go into the garbage dump. We all need to be more conscious about what we are throwing away and if I have thrown away 3 in 3 years, I can't imagine how many thousands of these machines are in our land fills."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all comes down to the coffee...","review":"I really wanted to love this machine- it brews coffee SO fast- fast enough to make serving multiple cups no issue, the water temp is perfect, there are so many flavors I was excited about.But the coffee was WEAK. How can you afford to pay $150 and extra money for pods when the coffee isn't any good? Even the bold flavors! It's NOT a roast issue! You should be able to get a medium roasted coffee that's not the color of tea (even on the smallest size setting)- it reminds me of coffee from Denny's. And I'm really not a coffee snob either- my favorite brand is folgers. But this doesn't even come close to an avg. cup of folgers!I'm sad and confused! Is it just meeee?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be ZERO stars","review":"I have had two of these coffee makers and each one has stopped working before even having it for six months.

Just in the last month or so (after owning it for one year) the coffee has been extremely weak, almost to the point of not bothering to use the unit. We've called Keurig and they told us to clean it. We did, but still weak coffee. They've yet to get back to us. We loved it up until recently, but are about to switch to something else. When the unit worked well, the coffee was a bit on the weak side, but good. Lately, however, it's been way too weak for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool","review":"Other than the fact that it makes Barbi-sized cups of coffee, this is a slick machine. To fill a regular mug, you have to select the travel mug option. The small brew option makes about enough coffee for a shot glass. To fill a travel mug or large mug, you have to run the K-Cup twice. Not a big deal, but something you should know before buying.Overall, this is a well-made piece of equipment that brews good, if not expensive, coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor taste and amount of effort makes it not worth the money","review":"We didn't think this product was worth the money. We used it for 2 weeks and tried many different types of k-cups.1) The coffee tasted bland and all the hot chocolate was weak.2) When we drink coffee we drink 4-8 cups.You still have to manually load water in the coffee maker so there it is no \\"easier\\" than a drip coffee maker.3) The k-cups aren't recycleable so that seems bad.All in all, we think drip coffee tastes better and is less expensive.If the k-cups tasted better then we would not have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"loud, vibrates, foul taste","review":"Received the B60 as a gift from a family member for Christmas. They have an older Keurig that I use when I visit.Main reason I give it a 1 is the foul taste of the water. It is like the heater is imparting a burnt plastic smell. I am glad I did not buy this for myself.Other irritants are the loud sound the pump makes getting water from the reservoir and vibrating the counter. I taped down the steel plate the cup sits on to stop it from making noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing scam!","review":"What they don't tell you about this one cup coffee make is that one cup is about all you get. Let's create a product that will die exactly when the warranty expires. I'm absolutely convinced that the Keurig coffee maker is programmed to stop after a certain amount of cups (i.e. 1,000 cups). I have owned a number of coffee makers and usually there is a warning that it is about to go. There was no warning with this brilliant device. One day it is working fine and the next day nothing. I have no doubt the manufacturer is hoping that you will get caught with a huge box of K-cups so that you will have no option but to buy another Keurig coffee maker. This product is despicable.Maybe this would not be so bad if you didn't pay for or five timesas much as a normal coffee maker which makes it a ridiculous product. If you have a big box of K-cups cut your losses - the coffee is better than instant but not better than drip. Buyers beware of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed will not buy another.","review":"I purchased this Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System in May 2010. It functioned as expected for the first 12 months. (Only used on weekends about 5 cups per week). After about twelve months of use (using only filtered or bottled water)and following the manufacturer's cleaning maintenance suggestions it started to malfunction. At first it started to regurgitate the water back into the resevoir and would shut itself off or not come on at all. The display would dim and the set-up menu would appear and freeze up. After following the trouble shooting guide and on-line trouble shooting suggestions it's performance did not improve. Needless to say after reviewing many of the negitive comments (which sound a lot like mine) it is obvious, that to this company it is better business to build and promote an inferior product than to invest in research and development to create a longer lived product. So in a nutshell...they want your money not your satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After the brewer was out-of-warranty, the ring that holds the nozzle in place cracked and fell out.

Buyer beware... stay away from this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig review/ March, 2011","review":"Pros: This coffee maker makes great tasting coffee, compared to brewing the same exact coffee in a traditional coffee maker.Cons: The cups are very expensive. You are much better off putting your own coffee in the optional Keurig filter, but it takes more time and only results in 1 cup at a time.The unit only lasted just over a year. I only used filtered water, to avoid hard water build up. Like so many other people, the machine started to make noises and put out smaller cups of coffee. I descaled the machine with vinegar, as suggested, even though I should not have had to. Shortly afterwards, the machine would not take up any water at all and it died.There was a lot of money invested in a machine that dies so quickly. It can't even be taken apart to clean thoroughly. They need to make the parts more user friendly to troubleshoot on your own. I wish that I could find an alternative machine that puts out the same flavor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware ours lasted 8 months before packing up!","review":"Initially we were very pleased with this coffee maker. Easy to use, looks good etc. After 7 months we started to have intermittent problems with the water pump. It would suddenly seem unable to send water through the k cups and out into the cup. Sometimes it worked and other times it didn't. Eventually it seemed to stop all together. I cleaned it thoroughly and descaled the machine but still it would not work. We thought that was it and that we had been landed with a dud unit. I did a bit of research and found that this issue crops up again and again in customer reviews. We were very disappointed especially when we could not locate our receipt! (we did not purchase this unit from Amazon). I left the unit a couple of days them decided to try it one more time before I threw it out and hey presto it worked!

We called cust svc and found out it's called \\"spontaneous brewing\\" which tells us it happens often enough that they have a name for it!Talk about embarrassing! We normally don't spend that much, but it was something she really wanted and would never spend the money on herself.Keurig is supposed to be sending her a new one. We'll see what happens with that one. I would have returned it, but I was in a different state with no BJ's nearby.The sad part is, my husband and I were going to buy one. Not now!

Otherwise, it simply doesn't produce a good brew, makes too little of it, is an expensive initial purchase, and is expensive to use.It's awesome to spend 5 seconds setting it, and walk away -- and voila! Coffee! I can see this appealing to many many people -- who don't really care about the quality of the product they drink -- who just want a caffeine fix and end up loading it up with milk and sugar anyways -- who see it as a savings over $3 cup at Starbucks. Can't fault ya there.Not for me, though I can see the appeal. I'm in the boat that would rather spare a full 3 minutes using my Aeropress, or classic drip maker, and brew up a delicious cup I actually enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a hot cup of coffee in the morning!","review":"yes, it is a single-serve cup of coffee, various flavors including tea, nice programming and cool LCD display, BUT if you are looking for a hot cup of coffee in the morning to wake you up, this is not the machine for it. First time I used I thought well maybe if I turn the temperature up, but it was at its maximum. The coffee is warm, like a starbucks coffee after you let it sit for 30 min or so or if they don't like you, but definitely not hot. I was surprised that that was a problem with a coffee maker that sells for over a $100, especially that Mr.Coffee doesn't have that defect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the other 1's","review":"Started failing after a week or so.

Has to heat up, have water replaced, etc. so the only thing you save time on is measuring your grounds into a filter (I use a reusable filter in my coffee pot but I digress). This is a big problem because the coffee from this machine is so WEAK and WATERY I have to drink 3 cups just to equal 1 cup from a regular machine. If you like strong coffee, or enjoy the taste of coffee, avoid this machine at all costs. If you want coffee that comes in tons of flavors other than coffee and is also weak and watery this is for you. The stupid cups are ridiculously ridiculously over priced for the stupidly small amount of coffee you get in them, can't be recycled, and the reusable one saves me NO time over my old coffee maker that made coffee to my liking!The Keurig is for you if you hate coffee and like to waste plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, does not last long","review":"The Keurig approach to coffee is great. Each cup tastes fresh and it's ready in about a minute. But the quality of the coffee maker is terrible. Mine didn't even last 18 months. And when I called Keurig for assistance they simply said \\"sorry\\", \\"out of warranty\\", and \\"we would like to sell you a replacement at a slight discount (not free)\\". I am sorry, but I can't afford to keep replacing a $150+ coffee maker every 16 months. The coffee by itself is rather expensive. It's ironic that I had to go back to my \\"cheap\\" drip coffee maker which cost me about $15 10 years ago just so I can have a morning coffee. I would not recommend this product. I will not be replacing my Keurig with a Keurig. If you *must* buy one I recommend buying the cheapest Keurig model you can find. Don't overpay for this cheap quality brewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Out Great But....","review":"But it goes down hill fast. We bought this specific unit from Sam's Club Dec 19, 2011. Four months later it's struggling to brew. My husband and I both agree the K-cups brew extremely strong, unpalatable coffee and tea. We actually use 16oz travel mugs and use one K-cup to brew two 8oz cups into our travel mugs and I still find it too strong. I've begun to poke two holes into the bottom of the K-cup to make it easier brew because even though we're brewing two 8oz cups, were only getting about 10-12oz of liquid out of it when it used to fill our travel mugs. It still heats up the water fast, but the pump that pushes the water through the K-cups seems to be failing. I estimate that at this rate of failure our Keurig will be dead in two more months. Between the cost of the machine and K-cups I might well have used Ten Dollar bills as coffee filters in my old Mr. Coffee.I regret my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee with your eyes closed.","review":"I gave this to my son who raves about it. He loves the ease of preparation and keeps the coffee maker in his bedroom. Buy the extra part that allows you to use your own coffee and you don't have to depend on the retail supply. Cool machine, very neat and easy! (You can also get the k cups for tea and hot chocolate as well.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful option for people who don't drink lots of coffee","review":"The Keurig coffeemaker is a wonderful option for people who don't drink gallons of coffee, and just want one cup now and then, or for entertaining. In that case, each guest can have a different flavor of coffee, tea, or cocoa. Its also safer and quicker than heating up a cup of hot water in the microwave or on the stove. The system is very neat as well, with no grounds to pick up and dispose of-- just remove the used k cup and you are done. The coffees and teas taste quite good, too. There are lots of different k cup options from many different coffee and tea makers available as well. The only downside, and this is minor, is that the coffeemaker's internal pump makes quite a racket as it recharges from the water reservoir after brewing a cup. It takes you by surprise at first, but anybody whose ever dealt with an espresso machine won't be fazed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall good quality, but not for long","review":"We bought this brewer back in August 2006 and it worked pretty good till recently. I noticed that it would ignore your choice of the cup size, and always make middle size. Turned out that cause of the problem is the middle button. It would not pop up after you push it. I think it's due to the fact that it's made of a cheap plastic. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it now, and it's very disappointing that it happened after only five month of use. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST PERFECT","review":"I get great coffee. What ever you do, get coffee K-cups that are dated for freshness (Van Houtte) or use your own fresh ground coffee with the \\"My K-cup\\" adapter.Everything works great, with two minor gripes:The amount of water dispensed in the cup deminishes as the reservoir empties and coffee splashes around when using a short cup (6 oz.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this machine!!","review":"I have to say, I thought that my sister was crazy for getting this for me for Christmas.

Itwas easier to go to D & D. But when I set up my Keurig, I was elated!!! It was so easy to use and it made the BEST coffee I have ever had. I prefer the Green Mountain Nantuket Blend.

Weve had the b60 for a year now, and we still get excited about the morning coffee. (throughout the day coffee since we got the Keurig) If the .38 cent/cuponly saved us from cleaning the old coffee maker partsevery day, it would be well worth it, but since we always have about 10 flavors to choose from, and the taste is better than any drip machine could produce, the Keurig is a no brainer. i think its just a matterof time before everyone else realizes whats going on in the world of single cup coffee, before these machines will be on every counter in the land, and we'll be buying our k cups at the local supermarket ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use the troubleshooting recommendations to fix problems","review":"I've had my coffee maker for 2 1/2 years.

The second machine also began short cupping soon after I received it. Again, customer service came through and replaced the machine. Had my third machine for 7 months and it is short cupping again, even after I spent the extra $18 dollars for a filter, use only bottled water (their recommendation) and de-scale.

The K-cups are nice but we leave them mostly for guests. (Register the machine on-line and you can purchase 4 boxes of K-cups for the price of 2.)

Then I took the water tank and washed it really well inside with soap and water. The next cup of plain water that I brewed did not smell like plastic.

Not a big issue, it's just annoying to have to do the toothpick and toothbrush trick when I'm in a rush to get to work. I am on a town water system, so I don't think it is the quality of the water. Other than that one minor issue, I like that you can set the Keurig to turn on at a certain time, adjust the water temperature, and even just run hot water out of it for making bag tea or hot chocolate (let's be honest, k-cup hot cocoa is so watered down it is essentially just brown water, even when you use the smallest cup setting ;) ) The cup size setting is crucial too!

This time it would brew a partial cup, and to get it to stop buzzing I would shake it or tip it to one side and thump it down gently on the counter and it would stop buzzing. We always use filtered bottled water to try and avoid scale build-up. Now today it refuses to work - it buzzes and sounds like its heating water but wont brew - zero / no water will flow at all.

Found it messy when trying to add coffee to insert available with product instead of using K-Cup and also more involved if you are in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Keurig!","review":"I debated quite a while before deciding to spend the money on the keurig coffee maker. So glad I endulged! I love it. I have hot coffee anytime I want it and don't waste \\"old\\" coffee. Each cup of coffee is about 48 to 50 cents. Ihaven't tried the filter that allows using your own coffee yet, but I will! Typically I make a small cup then a medium cup from the same K Cup...this fills my mug just right and it's not too strong/bitter. Love it!! I've tried several of the different coffees and have enjoyed them all. They only thing I haven't liked is the hot chocolate but that is the brand not the keurig."},{"rating":"1","title":"keurig #5 and counting","review":"I'm an early adapter of technology, so purchased one of Keurig's first k-cup coffee makers several years ago. Had to replace it during the first year, no problem with Keurig doing that. Had to replace maker #2 the following year. More hassle this time from Keurig. Have since bought 2 additional, different Keurig models over the past couple years! While we love the coffee it makes, the flexibility, the economy, etc., having to replace our latest B60 in about one year is pushing me to the limit.... Is this Keurig's version of planned obsolescence?Once you're over the honeymoon, be prepared for a nasty relationship-- people without their caffeine aren't pleasant to be around... Several of my friends & family members I turned on to Keurig brewers are experiencing the same lack of durability issues. Very frustrated to be replacing a coffeemaker that's typically used to make 1 cup of coffee/day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really disappointed in this product. I received the B60 special edition Keurig as a gift, as I had wanted one for over a year. After a few days of testing, I am going to return this. The coffee was weak and the hot chocolate was terrible. I bought a reusable filter and after researching hear they crack and break. Not only that, the servicing size options barely gave me a sip of coffee out of my travel mug. I really wanted to like this coffee maker, but am not impressed at alli love Starbucks and the coffee from this was not good at all. I was very disappointed. My french press makes amazing coffee, and they cost between $20-$40. I would recommend a french press to anyone that loves good coffee. I grind my own beans and I think I will stick with this method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this for my husband last year for Christmas. It worked great for about 6 months and then it started acting up. When we try to start it we have to unplug it and re raise the lid sometimes several times to get it to brew. Tried to make cocoa yesterday with a k cup and it took me 45 minutes and 2 thrown out 1/2 cups of cocoa to get it done. I'm terribly disappointed as this was a pretty expensive \\"coffee pot\\" to be having these kind of problems.....oh and I did all the cleaning tips, etc....didn't help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!","review":"This is my first Keurig, and I'm so glad I received it! It's easy to use, quick to brew, and the perfect size for my coffee nook in my kitchen. I haven't set up a timer yet, it's so quick to brew that I really don't need to! Again, it's a new product, and I've only been using it for a couple of weeks, but let's hope it always works as wonderfully :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System","review":"Love it! There is nothing more to say about this coffee maker other than that. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was awesome for 3 weeks. Now it is a paperweight.","review":"Got this for xmas and loved using it for a little over 2 weeks. It was easy, made great coffee, and I generally had no complaints.Midway through week 3 it started behaving erratically. It would make one cup of coffee then shut down and refuse to make a second cup. Unplugging it and fiddling with the controls would usually convince it to function again.Now it will only make one cup a day. I don't know what the waiting period is between cups but it is definitely too long. I ran out of coffee packs so it's sitting on the counter unplugged while I try to sort this out with Keurig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it while it worked!","review":"I loved this coffee maker until it stopped working after 10 days. I have been waiting over 2 days for a technician to call me back after I've called customer service twice. They are \\"experiencing a high number of calls\\" currently which makes me very suspicious. I think I'll get my money back (there's a 30-day guarantee) and look for something more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny Taste","review":"I love the idea of this machine. I followed the instructions and ran thru a few cups of plain water to start, but there was a funny metallic taste to my cup of coffee. So I ran thru water and vinegar (per Keurig). Still funny metallic taste. Guess it has to go back. Too bad, because it would have been awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Machine....","review":"Overall I'm pleased with this machine. It has a number of features that have a practical use and not just gee whiz junk that you set once and never change. Its EASY to setup and operate and works well. Its very convienient to make 1 cup of coffee with no muss or fuss but don't throw out the 12 cup coffeemaker for when company's over. I also like being able to have a cup of hot water instantly for tea etc. The K-cups are somewhat expensive but if you don't mind paying a few cents more for speed, convienience, and a good, consistant cup of coffee then this machine is for you. Enjoy....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig Customer Service is the BEST!!!","review":"Love their customer service! Had a unit that failed with the \\"Not Ready\\" problem, and they REALLY took care of me. I would recommend them to everyone. Other companies/corporations should model themselves after Keurig. Our satisfaction is evidently, very important to them. Can't say enough good about them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working properly within two months and more disappointed with Keurig's customer service","review":"This is my second Keurig. The first one was highly dependable so I purchased another for our vacation home. Within a couple of months it stopped functioning. After e-mailing them with the issue, I was told to call which I did. I was told that it was a water issue and descaling was necessary. This is did, the problem became worse. So, I called again. They told me to follow more steps to try to fix. I already spent more than a couple of hours dealing with the issue. It was obvious that I had a lemon for it stopped functioning after a couple of months. It took me three e-mails and phone calls for them to finally agree to send me another. I have to return the unit and no return postage was offered. Now I have to spend more time and more effort for this lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product breaks after 3 weeks of usage","review":"I am on my 3rd Keurig. The first 2 died after 3 weeks of normal usage and now this one has just died. I will never purchase another Keurig product. These used to be made with good quality. It's a shame because it is a nice product until it dies.Clearly the company has reduced the quality to increase their margins and guess what - now they are junk. Fix your product Keurig!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some work, some don't","review":"I purchased the B60 as a 2009 Christmas gift for my wife. It worked for about two weeks before, after brewing a cup, the pump motor would run constantly without pulling in any water from the reservoir. It would then just shut off completely and we would have to unplug it for hours before it would work properly again. Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement and the same thing is now happening to the new unit. Although we really like the concept, we are now sending the second unit back for a refund. Keurig should obviously address this issue as it appears to be a common complaint. However, I know people who have had one of these things for months without issue. I guess you take a chance on getting a clunker or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This is my 3rd maching covered under warrenty and I use mine daily. After just about a year it either won't prime, or will stop working when descaling and I used distilled water in it. I am going back to my old coffee pot and Dunkin Donuts or starbucks coffee, works for me and is alot easier than replacing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System","review":"I like the concept, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. When these things work, they're great. Unfortunately, I've purchased several of these for myself as well as for gifts. In almost every case, the units develop problems within months. They leak, they no longer heat water, they refuse to power up.I am a horrible consumer. What I mean is that I almost never return anything - no matter how bad it is. But I came close with these. I even purchased a more expensive model. Didn't matter - same problems. I have one leaking on my countertop now.If you Google these, you will find many folks complaining and even a few that offer videos for the more common problems. I just want the things to work. My $25 Mr. Coffee is over a dozen years old and it works all the time, every time.Like I said, love the concept. But I would suggest you shop around for either a newer model or choose something else entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine stopped working too!","review":"This was a great machine until it stopped working. First it had flashing lights and leaked. I cleaned it well and that stopped. Then two weeks later it just stopped doing anything at all. No response. It worked well for approximately one year. After all the problems I've read about from other reviews and the environmental issue, I will be buying a Bunn pod machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating for their customer service","review":"I had two B60's go bad within a year and expressed frustration in an earlier post. But I called Keurig today and explained the situation to them. They are sending me a new one and said I should have it within a week. Further, they classified the other one as unfixable and told me to discard it. I had visions of having to send the dead one in and then waiting weeks for a replacement, so I'm pleased with their response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to sturdy","review":"I can't deny it really does make a great cup of coffee when it works, the best.But every single one I've bought (3 in 5 years) I've had to get replaced, Keurig has been very good about replacing them, but come on, every single one.The replacements work about the same so when you start doing the math, don't wince.I'm looking for a replacement brand and would love to hear a recommendation, I still plan to drink k-cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have yet to find someone that DOESN'T love a Keurig!","review":"I have had my Keurig B70 for over a year and I can't imagine being without it.

I bought this one for my Mother and she now says that uses it everyday and loves having a variety of coffee and teas both for herself and for when she has guests (\\"Speaking of guests\\" she said on the phone after she received her B60, \\"So when are YOU going to visit me Mr. Big Spender?\\") Ahhh... mothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, yes, delicious, no","review":"I bought the Kuerig in Sept of 2008. I loved the easability of it, but found it very very noisy. I tried at least 50 different types of coffee and none of them knocked my socks off. I guess if you are not a serious coffee drinker then it would suffice. Also, the coffee is not very hot. I then tried sampling coffee from the new Dolce Gusto and I am sorry Kuerig, but you can't hold a candle. The Dolce makes drinks that rival any coffee house. It runs on 15 bars of pressure which aerates the coffee and foams the milk for cappuccino. You can make a cappuccino or a latte, from thought to cup in under two minutes. And it is so quiet, my husband doesn't need to turn the TV up everytime I want a cup of coffee"},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell for it...","review":"Ok It looks great. What an idea! The problem is you CANNOT get a good strong cup of coffee in one try. I bought the 3 cup size model. The largest size does NOT fill a mug. Plus the coffee was weak. I admit I am a starbucks fan and like it strong (bold). I ended up making 2 small sized cups of coffee to fill half a mug and get it barely strong enough. Even then the coffee looked weird. I bought the attachment to put my starbucks in and it still wasn't great. My husband would make 2 large cups to almost fill his go cup.That gets expensive- 4 k cups a day if you only have 1 mug of coffee per adult.I must say it did produce a HOT cup of coffee but... it wasn't worth it so it went back to Target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just make sure you get the right coffee","review":"this is a great machine - easy to use; no mess; easy to fill the water reservoir. The one disadvantage with the K cups is you can't control brew strength. I was disappointed in the weak coffee it seemed to brew (even on the smallest cup setting) until a friend told me to make sure to buy \\"extra bold\\" K cups to ensure the kind of coffee I'm used to drinking. That seemed to do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"I have had two of these coffee makers and both have failed. The first one lasted maybe three years and the second one lasted one year. They are certainly not worth the expensive purchase price.

I am back to using a regular coffee maker and the coffee tastes just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I've been very dissappointed with this product since the beginning. It constantly has issues priming and working properly. It only works properly about 20% of the time. Otherwise I have to turn it off/on and see if it primes properly to fill the cup. This product seems a little premature for the market - there are definately still some technical issues to be fixed.

I will keep you posted on what their remedy is to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it within a few days!!!,","review":"Okay, I received this one cup coffee maker recently and after a few days of use, I returned it. The coffee was so weak and watered down, I was so frustrated. I tried bold and extra bold, different coffee makers, using the smallest amount of coffee option, and it was if I was drinking brown water and when I added the cream, i was hardly able to taste the slightest bit of coffee. I even used two k cups for one cup of coffee and it was still very mild and watered down. I have never been so dissapointed with KeurigB60. I am a Starbucks lady and will continue with my gold level membership and enjoy my frequent free cups of delicious coffee. Nice concept, but alot of work to be done. These companies that measure coffee for the k cups need to revamp their systems, it can't measure up to the coffee houses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible company and Horrible machines","review":"I don;t understand where the people that love their Keurig machines bought them from ?

After about 90 days, the Keurig began to fail to pump water from the reservoir into the water-heating tank. The pump would run and run and run and then the whole thing would shut itself off. It was sporadic at first, maybe once a week, then it was every day, then it was every time we tried to use it, until it wouldn't work at all. So we stopped using it. I don't feel all that badly because I was already regretting how wasteful the whole K-system was when it did work. The pods are expensive but not outrageously so unless it bothers you to tear through $.40 worth of plastic wrapper that goes directly to landfill, to brew $.15 worth of coffee grounds, for each cup of coffee. The world is a better place if we just don't use this thing, so we don't.

My parents have a Keurig B31 and I love the coffee it makes and from the beginning it has never left a plastic taste in the coffee. I'm very disappointed with the B60 and will be returning it. Hopefully there aren't detrimental health affects from the plastic in these machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Costumer Service","review":"After four months my Keurig didn't work anymore.

Called their Customer Support people and the lady had me use a paper clip to clean out the pin in the K-cup tray and the pin in the head of the machine. This works for a additional cup but then it stops passing water again. After reading all the other reviews it seems that this is a recurring problem.

I should add that I use only spring water,have cleaned the two \\"needles\\" that puncture the K-cups and have even cleaned it with vinegar as recommended.For those who are considering buying this product,do a Google search on it and you will see countless numbers of people who have had the problem I am having and ones much worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanatastic coffee for about 2-yrs","review":"There seems to be some kind of flaw designed into the machine. It is absolutley reliable for about two years. Then suddenly it will stop making medium cups of coffee. You will think it is because you need to descale it. It will work well for about two weeks and then it was start to go off on its own. For about two weeks later you will find yourself pushing buttons just to get a cup of coffee. It will be hit and miss. And then suddenly the coffee maker will not turn on at all. This is a repeated complaint I have heard again and again. I would recommend buying this coffee maker simply because it is reliable even after the one-year warranty expires. In fact I just purchased another one. But I would recommend when you purchase it that you also buy the square trade 3-year warranty for $16.99. After two years believe me you are going to need it.-Mark"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee","review":"I have seen this coffee maker in use before and decided using individual coffees was too expensive for me.

I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted A Year","review":"Even with regular cleaning (descaling), our keurig is zonking out on us. It's worth the extra money to invest in a newer version, as they have water purifiers built into them. Unless you run distilled water through this one with every use AND white vinegar atleast once every 2 weeks, it won't last long. That is just too much maintainance for an appliance in my opinion.The issues we have been having are that it shuts off after warming up, grows louder and louder but shuts off, and when it DOES finally work, the \\"tall\\" cup option is about 1/3cup worth. It takes FOREVER for a cut of joe. Other days there are no issues.

It's not the best thing for all people though. If you drink coffee all day, you may not want this as per cup cost is around 60 to 70 cents. That can add up quickly for heavy coffee drinkers. For me it's perfect. I drink one or two cups a day. I love it because I don't have to make coffee early in the morning, I can just brew my single cup on the way out the door. The machine is very quiet and efficient. The variety of k-cups is excellent and the coffee comes out tasting great every time.

This happens even witha full tank of water.You can't just turn it off and back on again, you have to turn it off, unplug it, plug it back in, turn it onand hope that it works. I have on occasion had to do this several times before it will operate like it'ssupposed to do! I have owned this B60 model for about four months and i'm about ready to throw it in the trash!In my opinion it's not worth the money or the time wasted in \\"FRUSTRATION\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this coffee maker!!","review":"this is by far the best coffee maker! I never used to make coffee at home because I would end up dumping most of the pot in the sink and hated cleaning the filter and pot... with the keurig there is no waste, no mess and no clean up - just perfect coffee... I actually have one at home and at work on my desk now!! (and I threw out my fancy starbucks coffee maker for home, since I dont need it anymore)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Keurig","review":"My husband wanted to give me this coffee maker for Christmas. I had seen it at Costco the week before he started looking for it. When I contacted Costco they were out and the stock was delayed in delivery. I checked with Amazon.com and there was the Keurig at the same price and with free shipping. My gift came within 2 days and we have used it every day since Christmas. The machine is so simple and its design is compatible with my kitchen...looks great sitting on the cabinet. My husband uses it as much as I do...it only takes a couple of minutes once you turn it on for it to reach the \\"ready\\" stage. Then to brew each cup of coffee probably takes maybe 30 seconds. The great thing about the Keurig is that everyone in our family drinks a different type of coffee..my husband and my mother prefer the dark, strong roast while I prefer the medium roast. This way, I am not making a pot of coffee which I always had to pour out at least half! Great invention!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffee Maker!","review":"I love this coffee maker! It is so fast and easy to use. There is also a huge variety of k-cups to choose from. I have noticed you get more k-cups and cheaper prices if you buy them from Amazon. Yeah this coffee maker is more expensive then a drip coffee maker but you will save in the long run by not throwing out coffee, plus you will always have a hot fresh cup of coffee! I wish this model had a water filter built in but I use the Pur faucet water filter and that works great, alot cheaper then using bottled water and you get the same results. Go ahead and get one, you will be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product","review":"Very pleased with it, I only wish the travel size brew mode provided a few more ounces of coffee. I highly recommend it to any serious coffee or tea drinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee at your fingertips (and never ON them!)","review":"This is, hands down, the easiest, most reliable, and cleanest appliance in my kitchen. I cannot believe I hesitated as long as I did to buy this machine. This coffemaker will produce a cup of coffee in less than thirty seconds, has three choices depending on what size cup you're up for, and is absolutely mess-free. I absolutely love it.Some things to consider though: it IS noisy when it brews, which I wasn't expecting. Also, the cup sizes could be a little bigger. What's featured in this picture could never happen--no cup size produces an amount of coffee that would fill that cup. Also, the coffee can get expensive, and since it's so easy to use, you'll probably find you go through coffee a lot faster than you otherwise would!Still, I'd recommend the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig 860","review":"I bought this coffee maker for my wife as a Christmas gift. She is the only one in the family who drinks coffee regularly. She loves the new Keurig! She is able to make herself a single cup of coffee in the morning, very quickly. She says the coffeee quality is top notch. She trying many different flavors of coffee and she says that each cup is very good.Also, this is an attractive appliance on our countertop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for two weeks, then broke","review":"My wife and I loved our Keurig when we first bought it. Sadly, our adoration only lasted about two weeks. After that it would only work sporadically and would take up to ten minutes to actually produce a cup of coffee. The convenience of the Keurig is awesome, but the quality just isn't there. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"brew station","review":"It's okay. Expensive but convenient to use. It does require some planning on where to plug in as it uses a considerable amount of energy in a short time and if one is using another appliance, the circuit can trip. I am a little concerned that the plastic containers left after each cup can not be reused. I used to compost the used coffee grounds but have not been able to do so with the new system. It does not make a good, man-size cup of coffee with its one measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money ....","review":"Thank God I did not pay what they say was full price for this product ($299.00). There is nothing special about this product. I bought it because being a widower now I don't need a full pot of coffee and the idea of gettng one cup seemed perfect for me - no waste. Well if I can get to work that would be a great concept. It is either constantly going into \\"prime\\" mode or it wont' pull water through and at times the noise it makes sounds like it going to blow up. So I have a bunch of K-cups to use - all Starbucks and I will keep on trying to get it to work once in awhile and when the K-cups are gone the coffee make will be gone also. I have to keep it unplugged and water out of the water well to dry everytime before I can get another cup ... so I am getting maybe 3 cups a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I've read all the reviews and can't say enough about this coffee maker. One thing I didn't see mentioned was how quickly it works. We can make 10 different cups of coffee in less time than it takes to brew a single pot in our old coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes pathetic coffee","review":"Had a strong plastic 'fake' taste to everything it brewed. It took about 50 large cups of water-flushes and 3 vinegar rinses to finally make it start brewing 'acceptable' tasting coffee. Then after all that, it does what it is supposed to, which is brew an underwhelming cup of coffee at 50 cents per disposable coffee cartridge.Medium is about maximum size you should brew, large is just water.After 48 k-cups plus the samplers, I have sold it to my coworker who wanted it for his desk for 1/3rd the price. Good riddance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost COMPLETELY amazing!","review":"We love this coffee/espresso one-cup master! The only thing that sucks is that much of machine is made from wack plastic - the kind that leaches crap into your water. We make sure that we don't let water sit in the plastic water reservoir - empty it out each time.Also, EVIL are the producers of the plastic one-time-use deals that you can buy in ridiculous bulk. Instead, BUY YOUR OWN BEANS (we get ours at Trader Joe's), grind em and get a reusable gold filter at Bed Bath and Beyond or Walmart, to name two retailers. You can prob get one here on Amazon as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about a year","review":"Worked fine for a year, and then, just like everyone else, stops brewing full cups. Cleaned needles, descaled(has always been used with distilled water) and it dumps water back into the reservoir. Conveniently out of warranty this thing takes a crap. My $30 mr coffee lasted far longer than this thing. What a waste of money. Do NOT pay the high price of convenience. That or buy a different unit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Keurig!","review":"To be honest, I was on the fence about buying a Keurig. I had heard a lot of good things, but I wasn't sure the coffee would be quite as good as what I am used to. I am so glad that I went for it! I am having so much fun with this machine! Not only does the coffee taste great, but every morning I look forward to choosing a different flavor of coffee. I have also used it to make hot chocolate and tea and everything tastes just as good. It was incredibly easy to set up and the whole process of making coffee takes about 20 seconds! My Keurig is my favorite new appliance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Appliance!","review":"The Keurig is an incredible addition to my kitchen!This model allows you to choose the size of your cup, with 3 choices. We bought the B40 model for my parents and it only has 2 cup settings.There is a nice big water reservoir so you can make several cups before re-filling. And the refilling is super easy.It keeps a cup of water hot so it makes your cup of coffee in seconds.There are K-cups available in every flavor of coffee you can imagine. So that's really nice if you enjoy a different flavor than the rest of your family.I do recommend purchasing the 'reusable filter basket' as the K-cups are pretty expensive (you always have to pay for convenience!) With the reusable basket, you can use your own coffee and it helps with the price per cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again","review":"I bought this model in June 2012. Have used it 2 or 3 times a day since that time. Previous reviews have voiced my exact sentiments.PROS: It works, coffee is hot and tastes good.CONS: Water not the cleanest; \\"Prime\\" error enough to think about throwing it away (although disconnecting plug from outlet resolves the error but it shouldn't have to come down to this).As for it labeled as expensive? Come on. If it's too expensive for you then don't buy it.Final thoughts: I still have it and will continue to use it. But I will not buy another Keurig coffee maker again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you'd never tried.... save yourself the expensive addiction","review":"We bought this machine 15 months ago as a present and were delighted when it was regifted back to us!! We have been addicted - spending $50 every two weeks on Keurig coffee from Amazon. This morning the machine literally just died. We were hoping it might \\"wake up\\"...but nothing yet.

I decided to buy one after experiencing Keurig at a salon. I thought it was such a great way to enjoy a quick cup of coffee that I began hunting for one. A couple of people mentioned that the machine was noisy but I can tell you this is certainly quieter than my espresso maker. The Keurig B60 is going to get quite the workout at work . . . if it ever makes it to the office!Update July 2012: This brewer is still going strong.

Excuse me, but if I'm buying another $100 machine from you, you aren't really replacing anything are you? I'M replacing it at my very own expense. $100 is hardly a discounted price for a machine that will at most last me just under a year. I mean, really? That's what you have to offer me? You're solution is for me to simply buy another one? No thanks. I'll stick to my true blue coffee pot which costs less to buy and costs less to use. Keurig is scam.

Inside tank can not be drained.","review":"After lots of reading reviews and getting opinions from friends & family,I purchased the B-60 Special Edition. I have a new kitchen and my Cuisinart Grind & Brew (which brews great coffee) is too tall for the counter. I will start out by saying that I only make coffee a few times a month, so I thought the Single Serve would be convenient. All went well until I realized that there is an inside tank that can not be emptied. Even though you can purge the water if you have not used it for a while, the inside tank will always remain filled. That means the water will sit there and I have significant concerns abour bacteria, mold, and mildew. I called Keurig and they said that the only models that can be drained are the Office Pro or the B-155. There are no home models that have this feature. Unfortunately, I will be returning it.

Keurig doesn't make replacement parts for what's causing this problem, but they'll sell us another Keurig coffee maker for a discounted price of $100. How generous of them!

I only gave it 4 stars because I have not personally tried any of them, but talking with my brother he said it makes a good cup of coffee, that it is very fast, looks good and as a bonus it can do tea and hot chocolate.

They said noise is because I have it on a hard surface (Silestone); I need to get a large mouse pad to put under it; the noise is normal. I explained that my friends' machines are not noisy. They said this is the way the machine should sound and that's that.. I had no other choice but to return it to where I had purchased it.

You can buy the reusable cups and fill them yourself (which I did) and then you can enjoy a cup of brown water with coffee grounds floating in it. This product is a rip off!

The second unit was to replace the first when it stopped working after 6 months. The second replacement unit has now broken after 5 months. Please don't wast your money with this machine. The first indicator that something is going wrong is the prolonged pump activity as the machine struggles to fill up the internal water heater tank. The dispensing levels become shorter and shorter as the heater tank inadequately fills. I only use filtered water and carry out the maintenance as instructed within the original operating instructions. I have used the machine daily and only make between 2 to 6 cups of coffee and tea during the day for my family and I.There is defiantly a fault on this design and I will not recommend or buying another of these units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keurig B60 is not the pot for me","review":"We received a Keurig B60 for Christmas (2011).

The next morning we were served the first cup of coffee with no problem and then the next it was the same old thing. Prime the pump, doesn't work, clean the needle worked one time and them dead again. I am not sold on the whole thing at all. I have tried the variety pack of coffee and have not found one that is any better than may Folgers. I can have coffee for about $13 or 46 oz. in regular pot and $40 for 26 oz. in Keurig.

We bought an attachment so we can use or own flavors, and that just made a mess. CLEANING IS A NIGHTMARE. We ran water through the system 10 times and STILL had grounds pouring into our cups.

Considering the cost of the unit and the number of cups of coffee I've gotten out of it, I figure we paid over $4 a cup for the coffee it has made. I'm in the market now for a new coffee maker, but it sure won't be a Keurig. Until then I'll buy my coffee at Starbucks - it's cheaper than using this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also the Water Pump Issue","review":"I also bought the Keurig Special Edition and for the first two months it worked great! But like so many others who have written reviews the water pumping system on my Keurig has failed. It tries to pump the water from the reservoir into the heating chamber but after 30 seconds or so with no water being drawn up the \\"Prime\\" light appears. To get a cup of coffee you then have to unplug or remove the water cylinder and replace. Then it works fine....for the one cup....at least for now. For a machine that costs this much it should be better quality. Just another sad commentary on the quality of the Keurig!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great while it was working","review":"I have had it happen twice now...It works great for the first few months. Then I go out of town and don't use it for a couple of weeks and the thing stops dispensing water completely.I've tried descaling, I use filtered water etc. etc. The only solution is to replace it. So I'm on my 2nd replacement from Keurig (replaced about 6 mos. ago) and I the same thing that happened again. Now I ended up with a shelf full of K-Cups that I can't use.Keurig has some reliability issues to work out.. try sorting the reviews to see the newest ones first."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive one year use","review":"Looks like this coffee maker should be called the one year wonder....Our Keurig was a gift to us purchased through Amazon. True to the reports of many others, ours lasted 13 months..Only one of us was drinking coffee, with episodic use by visitors. Not a good value, and I would not recommend giving it as a wedding gift ! I liked the convenience, and once I found the coffee I liked, it was great...What I do not like is that with light use, maybe a few times a day for one cup/user each time, it lasted only 13 months...That is $11/month plus the cost of the Kcups. There is a better way to use your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after six months","review":"Just like many others have noted, this machine was great while it lasted. I got this around Christmas and about half a year later, it broke. I didn't even use the machine every day so it's not like I put the machine through a lot. One day, I decided to make coffee, hit the brew button and it made a funny noise and nothing came out. The water pump had simply given out. Luckily I was able to return the machine to the store where I bought it. If Keurig is able to improve the reliability of their products, then I would consider buying it again. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee isn't the strongest, but...","review":"...that's not always a bad thing. I used to make my coffee too strong, and that much caffeine isn't good for anyone. Some claim the coffee is weak, but after drinking it for a few weeks, I prefer it to the sludge I used to make. Also, because of the novelty of it, I find I'm using it more often and not stopping at Starbucks as often. The only downsides are that I can't use the used grounds for landscaping anymore and the reusable filter is hard to clean by hand (cleans great in the dishwasher, but I only have a full load every few days).On a side note, I purchased this for $129.99, and it came with 90 K-cups, not just 18, and the reusable filter. Great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MODEL!","review":"Bought this model via a home shopping channel (forgive me Amazon...)and have had it 2 short months with problems since I received it. I'm so happy Amazon has taken action to note it as a \\"buyers beware\\". (For this, I will remember to purchase here instead of straying!) I encountered water reservoir issues, spontaneous shut-offs, leakage(despite it NOT brewing!) and now since it has decided to work, it only brews 1/4 of the cup size that's chosen! I will be returning this model today (thank goodness for extended holiday returns!) and hope I have better luck with another model since I really love the concept and the machine when it works properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"good brewer, expensive coffee","review":"I bought the B60 for my wife for christmas. We have been using it daily and have really enjoyed the coffee. I happened to buy it at Sam's and it came with 72 various k cups. My wife drinks decaf and the cups are very expensive. I have been doing some research on the reusable cup item offered by keurig but much of the feedback is negative. Seems there is some design issue. Also, someone at a site called www.my-kap.com has come up with some way to reuse the cups. At this point I am still going though the cups which came with the machine so not sure how I will deal with the very high coffee cost associated with the cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt last","review":"I owned two of these coffee makers in the space of 6 months both stopped working. One after 2 months one after 4 months,both stopped amking full cups of coffee and one then stopped even putting out water at all. I used only filtered water so it wasnt a scaling problem like customer service likes to say. It is a nice idea but for the price it is made very poorly. My Mr. coffee lasted 7 years and it cost 20.00. I would not buy this coffee maker again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I've never been a coffee drinker until now. I purchased this for guests and found that I loved the flavored coffees.

But overall, a great machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, great coffee and best of all, AIR TIGHT :)","review":"The k-cups that Keurig uses are air tight, so if you don't use them for a bit, they don't go bad. Real coffee lovers like to grind their coffee right before they brew it for the best tasting coffee, and Keurig's k-cups are the next best option. Seriously, this feature of the k-cups, along with the greater height of the opening (look at the small openings of its competitors, and this one has a nice opening that fits travel tumblers just fine. Great product, would buy it again in a heartbeat!(Plus, if you order four k-cup boxes at the same time, you get free shipping, so the air tight containers come in handy, because you can order a bunch of months in advance and never run out! Plus, k-cups are showing up at Total Beverage and other outlets b/c they're so popular, so they're even easier to get when you need some fast.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best purchases I ever made!","review":"I LOVE this coffee maker! I was a bit worried when I first decided to give it a try because a few of the reviews said that the coffee is weak when brewed at the large cup setting and I do like a nice, big mug of strong, bold coffee. However, I found this not to be the case. I always make sure to use the extra bold, dark roast k-cups and have never had a problem with weak coffee. I comes out flavorful and never bitter with no clean-up or fuss. It's also great for having company over because I can make \\"custom orders.\\" I have a friend who only likes vanilla coffee, sisters who only drink decaf and cousins who only drink tea and I can accomodate them all with one machine.

But it is very expensive per cup as compared to brewing your own with a typical brewer.A box of 20 cups cost $10! A 2 lb bag of gourmet grounded coffee cost $10 but you can make atleast 200 cups with 2 lbs.It is easy to use and gives the lazy minimalist person an instant shot of coffee.If you're a true coffee purist then stay away, the taste of the coffee is not close to a fresh ground.If they can lower the price of a box of 20 to $3, then this system would be a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not make strong coffee.","review":"I bought it for the office at work.

We always use bottled water in the brewers and make on average two brews per day. They charge a lot for the brewers but their quality is questionable and there is no service path for the brewers, they are considered disposable units.In all three cases, the pumps would not push water through the K-cup. I was able to get the B70 to function again by using compressed air and forcing the air through the plumbing. I never saw a de-scale notice from the brewer.

I won't bother with a detailed review about the expense and quality of K cups, other than to say if you decide to buy a Keurig get the \\"my K-cup\\" so you can use your own coffee.

So I have to \\"rebrew\\" to try to get a full cup. Then it will be stuck on a certain cup size and won't allow a selection. Other times it brews fine. But that message never goes away.

I timed mine at 90 seconds from off to ready and then like 38 seconds for a cup of coffee which is faster than I could boil water on my stove. I didn't think it was noisy and it's acutally quieter than my old Krups. I would say overall I'm pretty satisfied and I like being able to choose my coffee by the cup. Oh, using bottle water easily improves the taste of your cup and (I hope) will give me longer times between descaling. I'll be buying a box of Coffee People k-cups next month to try them out.

The rainbow fish goes to an octopus who tells him to give his scales away to make friends. The little blue fish returns, rainbow fish complies with his wishes, and friends are made with a simple exchange of scales for friendship.I believe that the rainbow fish represents a young Lenin whereas the wise old octopus represents Marx (tentacles = beard)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Socialist Fish","review":"That's what my husband calls this book. It's not so much a message of \\"sharing\\" as of giving in to peer pressure. The fish is pressured into giving up what makes him special or the other fish won't be his friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to buy friends","review":"This bath book is a very abridged version. The story is basically boiled down to a message that if you want friends you have to give them your stuff. The rainbow fish has a lot of glittery scales that make him beautiful. Another fish swims up to him and asks him for one of his scales. Rainbow fish refuses and the fish swims away. Rainbow fish is lonely and asks an octupus why he has no friends. The octupus suggests that he give away his scales. After rainbow fish does that he has lots of friends.I think this book has a terrible message. It is about how to buy friends, not sharing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialist Fish Buys Shallow Friends By Giving Himself Away","review":"Many thanks to all the reviewers who found this book's message disturbing. My daughter received this book as a gift and, I am ashamed to admit, I didn't read it before handing it to her in the bath. Fortunately, she can't read yet (one year old tomorrow). Recently, I was looking for bath books for my friend's Baby Shower, and I saw your reviews of The Rainbow Fish. I was horrified and ran to read the book. I promptly threw it away (no, I didn't give it to Goodwill, I don't want poor people reading bad ideas either).I thank you all so much for your candid, insightful reviews. They were terrific. Freedom of speech---just one more reason to love this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is about SHARING -- NOTHING ELSE!","review":"Forget all the negatives you've read about this book -- it is priceless. This is a wonderful book about sharing. Rainbow fish has lots of pretty scales, but when a little blue fish asks for one, he says, \\"never!\\" As a result, all the other fish start not liking him. It's not a matter of being \\"socialist\\" or any other garbage. If a kid has a whole box of crayons and won't share any, then he won't be liked much! If you have a whole box of cookies and won't share any, then you won't be liked much, either. Period.Once rainbow fish visits the wise octopus, who advises him to share his scales, the rainbow fish \\"ligthens up\\". He shares his scales, one by one, and the other fish realize he isn't greedy afterall.Before you run to rip this book from your infant/toddler's hands, just take a minute to talk about sharing, what it is and isn't. This is a wonderful book and well worth \\"sharing\\" with your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sends the wrong message","review":"Sure the book is colorful, has wonderful illustrations, and your child will probably enjoy it, but it sends the wrong message about sharing. Some have said that it is because they had to condense the book to just a few pages, but even if you read the full version, it's basically the same: give away a part of yourself to get some friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't share your body, friends will swim away?","review":"This book is great for the water and has beautiful art, but it has a disturbing message. The deeper meaning that I want to keep away from my child's subconscious is that he must give away body parts to make friends. Even if one takes the shiny scales as a metaphor for money or toys, any friend that stays for what he gets is an opportunist in my opinion. I will teach my child to share and to make sacrifices for his friends when they are in need but not with this book. When my child learns to read, I will remove this book from the bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool time travel","review":"This set is very cool..first it is about time travel..second the characters and stories pull you in and third the time machine is freaking awesome!Why more people don't buy this collection is a mystery to me...I really got into it..i could watch more...Dr Who fans should check this series out..i believe they would like it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Brit series","review":"Very well done for its time.

It has very little professional qualities and comes off as someone's vacation home video. Most scenes are shot from a moving car window.

The premise sounded interesting; alas, it plays out poorly. Holmes is so far out of character in most of these that it's not even funny. Yes, these stories are supposed to be other characters' views of him, but they could have at least retained some spirit of Doyle's original. Instead many writers take Holmes' character and run with it. For instance, the story involving Irene Adler's relationship with Holmes is not only unoriginal but ridiculous. I hope that there will be a new collection of pastiches, one that vastly outweighs this one in the quality department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Some stories are just awful and some too speculative.Some deviates too much from the original Cannon characterization.Overall too shallow and not a very thought provoking views on some Cannon characters.

One often wonders just what others thought of Holmes when Mrs. Hudson is always described as \\"long-suffering\\" and Lestrade and Co. as \\"The best of a bad lot.\\" Then there was Watson's wives, who surely must have been the world's most understanding women. And Irene \\"The Woman\\" Adler-Norton: Did she really consider Holmes \\"The Man\\" or just another \\"fool man\\"? Great stuff, guys and gals! Four Sherlock stars!

The client base with which I work are mainly adults who are experiencing an acute psychiatric episode. It allows for a large variance in the abilities of clients and invites the practitioner to modify techniques and methods to best suit the group he/she is working with.

My only critism is that perhaps it lacks detail in explaining the theory behind some of the more complex groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solutions are not good","review":"The author states in the introduction that one of the challenges of the puzzles is that they have to be solved in the exact number of moves given.

And then you go back to that same vacation spot, and the magic is gone, and it's not the same the 2nd time around, and it's not nearly as much fun as the 1st time you went. That's what this album, the follow-up, Ferry's second solo LP, is like. Thematically, ANOTHER TIME... is the same a THESE FOOLISH THINGS, but for whatever reason; song selection, inspired performances (or lack thereof) or execution, it's not nearly as fun, or as good, as its masterwork predecessor.

The sound on this \\"Stereo\\" VHS is even worse in the DVD age, however in light of other concert videos from the time such as the Talking Heads film Stop Making Sense (released just two years after), I think this tape would of sounded mediocre even back in 1982. A few laughs as Daltrey gets his microphone cord tangled up in Townshend's guitar lead after one of his patented mic twirls. Also the dated 80's video effects are also good a laugh.Maybe a remixed DVD would bring the star rating up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a book instead","review":"I was truly schocked when I received this DVD. I have made more professional looking DVD's myself for personal use. There should be a notice on this product that indicates its amateur nature - from the sound, video (which had many still pictures - and many scenes and pics repeated numerous times through out the 30 minutes) to the content. Very disappointing. If you are looking to learn something about Cuba please buy a good book, or search for another video title. I watched this with my 3 children and parents who are all travelling to Cuba and we got nothing out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powell's first album","review":"This is Powell's first album under his own leadership, done for the Roost label in the fall of 1955. Powell's tenor sound is warm and very appealing, while his approach is robust. COUNT FLEET is an up-tempo swinger, with good solos by sidemen Jimmy Nottingham (tp), Bob Alexander (tb) and Tony Aless (p), who also arranged a number of the tunes. Powell is the only soloist on most of the tracks; SWINGVILLE, OHIO is another one that gives the sidemen a solo taste. Not an album designed to break down any walls or chart new courses, but its basic, direct mainstream jazz delivery is first class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neo-revisionism","review":"Ben-Yehuda builds a weak case of Neo-revisionism.

The author repeatedly points to differences in the initial description of certain archaeological finds, and later descriptions of those same relics.

And that will get on furniture. The concept is great if they can fix that problem. Generic markers are a lot easier to get out. The pouch was a nice idea but the papers or book falls out because the top and bottom are not enclosed.

For the enlightenment of the three people who don't know the story, Waters paid court to Allie Earp, pumping her for information. Allie had a bone to pick with Wyatt Earp and Waters ran with it. This collection of distortion and outright lies is the result. Waters no doubt gleaned the balance of his (mis)information from the Tombstone Nugget's pages or, most likely out of his own prejudices. Do bear in mind that the book was written during the height of the revisionist movement in the history of the \\"old west\\", and hatchet jobs on the notables of the time were common. The Earps were certainly not a bunch of altar boys, but they were definitely not the murdering pimps Waters makes them out to be. Maybe he was hired by the descendants of the McLowreys, some of whom still hold a grudge.This book would make good fire starter.Dennis Hanisch"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"This is one of the greatest CD's in my collection.I turn to it again and again.

Each song enthrawled in entwined melodies and harmonies that make the album seem broad and extremely diversed. The music toys with the soul. Each word of each song whisps the heart into an everlasting chase for pure gratification and dives the heart into utter compassion. The well known artist, Jewel, is featured in this amazing soundtrack with a very rare and beautiful melody called \\"Emily\\". This sold me on the entire album and made me a more avid listener to the magnificent poet/writer and singer Jewel. I recomend this album to anyone begging for something out of the ordinary.

I know other people who don't like his style. The production values are fantastic - very rich complex textured sounds in all tracks. The negative to me is that I'm not crazy about most of the songs although many are classics. \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" is probably my top favorite - starts with a spacey almost Jimi Hendrix like guitar feedback sequence and then fades into a compelling dancey beat. I prefer his stuff with Roxy Music. \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\", \\"More than This\\", \\"Take a Chance with Me\\" are probably my top favorites... This is different material. Classics done with his different voice and rich production values."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good tracks but mostly formulaic and lacking hooks","review":"As big a Peter Cetera fan as I am, this is one album I easily live without. Tracks 1,2,3, and 5 are passable but don't compare favorably to World Falling Down, One More Story, or Solitude/Solitaire. The rest of the album all blends together, lacks any memorable hooks, and is at times unlistenable. It may not be entirely Peter's fault; the production here is consistently uninspired. There are so many wonderful albums in the world. Don't succumb to completism!

The manufacturer instructions said to remove the lacquer coating by using a paint stripper. My initial reaction was \\"why would I put toxic paint stripper on something that I will eat out of, even if it is only on the outside?\\". Nevertheless, I did, thinking that the lacquer is also toxic/flammable and needs to be removed. I bought paint stripper (the exact brand recommended by the mfc), and applied it to the tea kettle (while using gloves and goggles), and then meticulously wiped off any excess. I even ran it though the dishwasher twice. Then when I finally boiled water in the kettle, my kitchen filled with noxious fumes--from the paint stripper that was impossible to entirely remove. What are they thinking, making a tea kettle that needs this much preparation to use? I threw it out.

It's an amateur recording made at the September 13, 1969 Toronto Rock 'n' Roll Revival held at the football stadium of the University of Toronto.Why does it sound so bad? For one thing, the concert promoter (Detroit's \\"Uncle\\" Russ Gibb) was a cheapskate, and provided only the minimum P.A. system, and this did not include stage monitors (which is why you often see photos of singers of that day singing with one finger in an ear so they could hear themselves).My guess is that, \\"Ain't That Just Like A Woman?\\" and \\"Goin' to the River,\\" the two songs obviously not sung by Alice Cooper are by '50s rebel Gene Vincent, who the Alice Cooper Band, formerly known as The Spiders, often backed up.

The book also tells about the lives of her dancers, students, close friends, and lovers.

Protected from the storm by another mysterious stranger, Bren Donovan, Dana wonders what--if any--connection there is between Bren and Caryn and how to stop her neighbor from taking what's rightfully hers.Worth develops Caryn's character fairly well, but there are too many cult cliches in the novel. Bren (Brendan) Donovan is almost too perfect to be true, but the plot anchors him in reality. Dana's brother Stevie behaves like the Dustin Hoffman \\"Rain Man\\" character throughout most of the novel, and this seems a bit inconsistent with what I've read from psychology books regarding the nature of Asberger's syndrome.It's trite, but it's a decent day's read."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than it should be","review":"Think california 60s pop channeled via Jesus and Mary Chain, but Swedish.

Fortunately this album provided a unique blend of heavy guitars, heavily integrated keyboards (but not in a crappy 80's synthesiser way) and strong vocals. The lyrics are a bit cliche, but it adds comedy value to songs such as 'too much is never enough' and a little sentiment with strong ballards such as 'never said it was gonna be easy'. The bands sound resembles that of firehouse and white Lion, with plenty of fast guitar solo's, screaming vocals and catchy melodies. Check out the bands later project with open skyz which was the only two albums they ever did unfortunately.

Too bad; I like the magnets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty...but...","review":"I gotta say that this torpedo level is a nice size, has a lot of features and looks great. However, one critical component is lacking...they filled the vials with too much liquid making the bubble so small it's nearly impossible to get an accurate measurement. I picked up a 9\\" Swanson torpedo at the same time (just in case) and it's a much easier-to-read level, just like my Stabilas. The Checkpoint is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Torpedo","review":"This is the perfect torpedo level for someone who wears a tool pouch. It is a nice compact size and is very well made. The magnets are very powerful. I sometimes find my other tools sticking to it! (only minor drawback, no big deal really). I would buy it again and I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Torpedo level I have ever used!!","review":"This is the best torpedo level I have ever used. I am an electrical contractor and use torpedo levels 10+ times a day, this level never falls off. The magnets are very strong, sticks to conduit and all thread rod, and will not accidentally fall off. It is solid aluminum so the if you do drop it while standing on a ladder or lift it will not break like the other plastic torpedo levels. I have purchased several of these for other workers or family members, and they all love using it. I see it as a time (and aggrivation) saver. The last on I bought was from Amazon and at $14 dollars definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A torpedo for professional electricians","review":"Check point beats them all. the 30 and 90 degree bubbles are excellent.

The magnets hold tight and never falls from the conduit or strut its placed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Level that's not level = Useless!","review":"The one thing you expect a level to do is read level. Not the one I got. Checked this level against several other levels I own and it is greater than 1 degree off. Another gripe is that the bubbles are to small and allow to much wiggle room between the marks. I noticed the one in the picture has bigger bubbles so maybe I just got one from a bad batch. Sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually deserves a \\"0\\"","review":"Do not buy this level. It is not accurate. When the bubble is centered in the horizontal position it is actually not level. I returned the first one I received and got a replacement. The second was just as bad as the first. To make matters even worse, the bubble is small and the lines are far apart so the bubble doesn't touch the lines. That makes it very hard to tell if the bubble is in the center. I placed it on top of a large contractor's level just to be sure, and the bubble was way off center on this one when the contractor's level bubble was centered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious pearls from the past","review":"Francis Dunnery and friends were musical geniuses.

The flashers are poorly designed and will break if touched a few times. They plug into the Fastrack crossing, but if they're bumped during play or removed and replaced a few times for storage, they break where the post meets the plug. I'm handy, and wasn't able to repair them. The wires inside the posts are very thin and can't be soldered at the break. Couldn't find replacement posts.

Beach Boys fans may be better served if this was not labelled as a Beach Boys album and if the Beach Boys had nothing to do with this. The country artists are not the problem on this CD but the Beach Boys are. Most of the group's 90s CDs are painful to listen to and this one is no exception.

I hope I'm hallucinating.Nope.The Beach Boys (that is to say, Brian Wilson) created incomparable pop music at their peak...Let's just say that this is very much NOT their peak.What kind of depraved fear of originality would yield an album composed entirely of covers? And not just covers, but covers of unbeatable pop masterpieces? This is why no one repects the Beach Boys, folks. They're making a JOKE of themselves.Is this supposed to be a tribute album? Come on, tribute albums are pathetic, and it's pointless to do a tribute to songs that couldn't be improved on by anyone except maybe (BIG maybe) God. Please. Please. Please, if anyone can hear me out their, don't fall into this trap!

I was sorry that I bought it. It is not like the other four books authored by Jean Shepherd. It was written after the movie and is just a cheap way to generate more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Story - the movie","review":"Wonderful story of Christmas, set in Cleveland,OH, in about the 1950's, presented in narration form by an adult remembering his childhood experiences surrounding a particular Christmas season. The story is based on a composite of various short stories by story teller and author Jean Shepard, who also acts as the narrator of the movie.His voice and narration adds a special almost personal dimension to the movie. This movie, appealing to children and adults alike, with its unparalleled humor and touch of nostalgia, has become, during the past several years, a classic equal almost to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". We have watched \\"A Christmas Story\\" whenever it was featured on TV, and, when we discovered Amazon featured it in its Blue-ray collection, it was a MUST-buy. I am delighted with the added almost 3D sharpness in the blue-ray version. This movie is worth being in everyone's video collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Chair","review":"This is the first product review of my life, because of what happened to us. I had the same problems as in other reviews - three back-breaking returns to the store due to 1. broken handles that caused pinching, 2. broken frame on right near recliner button, 3. stained seat and bracket confusion. The most dangerous thing happened after we brought our newborn home. If the seat is in the reclined position (which it often is) and you try to get out by scooting forward since it is a large chair. The whole chair is off balance and tips forward onto the person. My wife (150 lbs.) was only mildly injured when the chair fell on her, and luckily she had handed off our baby. I was so suprised that I repeated the accident easily several times by simply scooting forward. In conclusion, bad materials, bad craftsmanship, bad quality control, bad design, but a really comfortable chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy but POOR manufacturing","review":"We tried to buy this chair - twice - and had to return both items to the store due to manufacturing defects. The first chair was crooked, with a large gap between the seat and frame. The second made an annoying clunking noise on every forward glide. Upon close examination of the second chair, we found several cracks in the wood at fastening points. We also felt that the screws used to fasten the back to the frame were not sufficiently strong to guarantee safety. Instead of trying a third time, we purchased a Dutailier for $40 less and are thrilled with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, comfortable glider & ottoman","review":"We ordered this to arrive when our baby was born. Tried every chair in the store & this one blew the others away comfort wise! We did not experience the squeaking that others mentioned. It has been perfect since day 1. My baby girl & I have spent a lot of time in this-so comfy-you can even sleep in it. It's large enough that my husband is also very comfy in it. Nice enough to have in another room in the house when the baby gets older. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"My wife and I bought this expensive piece of junk after the first one failed after 3 months. Shame on me for choosing the the shermag again, this one makes more noise than the first. The other reviews mention a \\"bump\\" but ours squeaks and creaks just like the first one. I will not invest in this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth money","review":"Shermag is having problems with a bolt that attaches the back of the chair.

Comfortable, but I don't think it's safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This product looked beautiful and had great reviews when I was in desperate need of a special place to keep my cats ashes. I bought it with expedited shipping and received it 2 days after I'd already gotten my cat's ashes back. The entire base was cracked in half which I had to glue back together, and the sockets for the screws were completely chipped apart. the screws wouldn't go back into them and I had to glue the entire piece closed. It says it holds 3 x 5 photos so I had some made of my cat, and they were much to large and I ended up having to cut part of them off. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product. Had it arrived on time, and in good condition I would give it 5 stars, because it is a beautiful piece, but sadly I wouldn't ever purchase another again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"this was a great find, i had been looking for some time. my boyfriends mother lost her bischon and wanted some kind urn. this has everything she wanted, she can put photos and the ashes in. it was large enough to accomidate a few other items inside as well. all around great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry teakettle","review":"I am so angry at this copper teakettle. It took an act of congress to get the crud off the outside of the pot in order to use it. The handle did not come off as stated, so the handle and the wooden top are different colors.

After three rounds, I still could not remove all the lacquer - which must be removed for safe use - but the stainless steel was showing through in large patches. The feeble copper finish isn't as strong as the lacquer that covers it. Frustrating waste of time & had to return it in the end.In short: I give it two stars because it would be awful cute as decor. But it's certainly not cookware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"I love the look and functionaltiy of this teakettle.

This month the red check light went on which I assumed was to replace the filter. Filter replacement was very easy. Amazon sells the filters for $25 for a two pack which is a really good deal. I noticed nose stuffiness and allergy symptoms reduced within a month after I owned the product. It quickly removes smoke and other bad smells. I enjoy the 3 settings although I mostly use the medium and high settings. Some people are picky about noise but the medium setting is just a quiet hum and of course the high setting is a little louder but I find it useful for blocking out outside noise anyway. Overall, I think this is a good product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy AND SEXIST","review":"Unbelievable.......this book is geared toward teaching teenage girls how to attract males, with not much mention of teaching males manners or how to attract females. Teenagers in general need to be encouraged to get a good education and build functional, friendly, relationships, not how to preen and touch intimately. I found it extremely simple and the CHEESY sayings in boxes are just ridiculous (When you are in a place with a guy who seems interested and interesting, you should start the eye dance of flirting!) Now there's some profound advice. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"Please do NOT be fooled by the good ratings this book received, as I was. If you were going on the title of the book, as well as the positive reviews this book received, you'd naturally expect something clever and helpful. This is not the case. I was very disappointed to find that the book is pretty useless. It is portrayed in a childlike manner, filled with poor quality sketches instead of photographs or decent drawings. The font used is huge, and there are a few typos too. Most irritating, however, is the tone the author uses \\"Don't be afraid to ask for help from the big strong boys\\" or how about \\"You can still be strong without being tough\\"... and the ever dominating theme of the book seems to be summed up in \\"Males like females who signal, but the signal can't be too enouraging or the girl will appear cheap.\\" Believe me, you want to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suggestion: look elsewhere","review":"After reading the other reviews, I feel as though I must've read a completely different book because I didn't find this book to have many helpful suggestions at all. Honestly, it reads as though it's been taken from some fluffy teen magazine or a scene out of \\"Clueless.\\" Some of the tips were truly cringe-inducing.

Don't take my word for it. Just do a google search on \\"raymond mcgraime half hollow\\" and you'll find a couple of the many students he's mentored to become westinghouse and intel international science and engineering fair finalists over the years. I just had to speak up because he's by far one of the best teachers I've ever had, and although his book may sound sexist at times, he is assuredly not sexist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Synopsis","review":"When purchasing this book I was under the impression that it was for both men and women. The back cover line \\"The secrets of body language will have you staring in his dreams!\\" pretty much sums that up. As for providing a good basis for figuring out what women are thinking... It pretty much covers how women can get our interest, but not how we are to read or act on the signals. Or even what the signals mean. Additionally, this book is focused on a \\"young adult\\" audiance to whom college age guys are older men. Get the point? If I had had the chance to look at this book before buying I never would have wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just for TEENAGE GIRLS","review":"Don't be mislead by the high reviews.

There was a flirting section in this book that was the best ever. I used to be scared of flirting and now I marvel at how EASY it truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine","review":"I really found the excerpts to be asinine and insulting to females. Being an independant attractive female(by male standards) I found the advice given in this book to attract males ridiculous! Why pretend to play games and be attracted to a person? This does not set up an environment of mutual self respect and honest communication. What are you then supposed to do for the rest of your life? Continue to play out these ridiculous scenario's to keep this person attracted to you? These were techniques we talked about amongst girls at age 16. And even then they didn't work. No disrepect to the author because I'm sure there's some valid research for this drivel but personally I think this book is demeaning to women and should be removed from your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enron???????????","review":"Well these authors should hide right now given that Enron, one of their prize companies, is selling below a dollar. You could say that I have the benefit of hindsight but if the authors had only looked up the hundreds of millions in stock sales by the company executives (yes, it's public info)during the course of their investigation, they might have questioned the motives of the Enron principals. Very poor research and a \\"puff piece\\" of a book. But they probably will generate incremental sales -- as a collectors item like the Dow 30000 masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shorts","review":"Very comfortable shorts with style and high Speedo quality.

With a 10X magnifying glass he was able to tell the bubble was close to the middle with a standard bubble level, but was far from accurate. It appears that the company has change the design of this level since some of these reviews have been written. There is no apparent way to attach it to anything. If you're looking for a torpedo level, this would be it. If you need a longer level, you could probably tape it to the top of another level or buy a longer one. It appears to be a quality, well-built level with many features and it is easy to use. The sound feature is loud and clear and works well for the visually impaired or anyone who has the need to level something without watching it. We would recommend this to anyone. Thanks again Amazon for coming through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grades 5-8 deserve better","review":"I read this book in advance copy quite awhile ago and was surprised to find that it was actually published, considering how thoroughly wretched it is. Each character is as flat as a cardboard cutout from a comic shop fantasy display, and the dialogue is muddled at best. The plot seems to be some kind of take on \\"The Pied Piper\\" padded out with completely pointless action scenes that do nothing to either advance the plot or breathe some life into the protagonists. There is the occasional glint of genuine humor (I can only think of one right now) but these moments are generally buried under what feels to be the trappings of a confused D&D; game inexplicably turned into a book.If you're in the age group this book is marketed at, take my advice: read Terry Brooks, David Eddings, or Kristen Britain and then work your way into more challenging material. Heck, even that Eragon book is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A genuine catastrophe","review":"This book strikes me as a combination of RL Stein, without the original plot, JK Rowlings, without the descriptive imagery, and JRR Tolkein, without the grand theme. The non-ending is so out of character with the rest of the book it will leave the reader wondering why anyone would buy the sequel. If there were a zero on the scale, I would give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Placed on the Shelf of a 2nd Hand Store","review":"What is so unique or creative about a second hand store; hand held cameras; really stilted line-by-line acting; and a story about poor interrelationships? Well, nothing so you can put this movie on the shelf with similar cast off stuff. The most important indicator of the invested quality of this production is that despite a prominent role of a person with a disability the producers failed to put subtitles for the hard of hearing or English limited. I guess special needs is something that helps to sell movies but too costly to add to production expenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"as most of the other reviews have noted this is a sadly neglected classic...of a piece with the somber lyrics of the Cure and the Smiths this album nevertheless transcended much of the layered guitar pretensiousness of that era. It is one of those rare works that one can turn to again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haphazard work.","review":"I've adored this band since their first release. And this release does have it's moments. All in all, however, much of it sounds like they were writing while the tapes rolled and it sounds unrehearsed. Especially the vocals. If it were marketed as a live recording or rare basement recordings, I could let it slide but as a major release, the craftsmanship is haphazard. And without the bonus CD that originally came with it, there's not a lot for me to recommend. I do give it two stars for a couple of reasons. First, if you can find a copy with the bonus CD, that's where the best material was. Second, I still feel these guys were hugely underrated and one of the more important bands of the time so, if you're a fan, I'd still recommend rounding out your collection with it. If you don't have any Chameleons, buy \\"Script of the Bridge\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going against the tide ...","review":"I bought this CD several years ago for one song - Swamp Thing - which is always a risk. I love the song but the album is not all that great. It seems self-involved, almost pretentious. All I can think of is a bunch of art school students dressed in black thinking that they are going to change the face of music and this is what they came up with.The songs are not too distinct from one another, the lofty and over-dramatic vocals fail to impress. Makes me think of a \\"new wave\\" Jethro Tull or Marillion.For me this was a pretty unimpressive disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Bombast","review":"\\"Strange Times\\" is an album which sometimes showcases beautiful guitar work, but is otherwise ruined by horrific melodramatic tendencies. A real standout on the album is the haunting (emotion tempered with subtlety, for once) \\"Tears\\", the frequently mentioned \\"Swamp Thing\\" is merely a showcase of simplistic power chord hooks. The major culprit here is singer/bassist Burgess who is guilty of melodramatic grandstanding both in delivery and lyrics. Worth checking out, if you can get a cheap used version. Otherwise your money (and time) is best spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but required!","review":"I beg to differ with most other reviewers as I don't think this is the Chameleon's best album (their first two are better) but this one does contain their best tune, \\"Time\\", a fabulous rocker. Also, don't put too much into the lyrics; this one didn't \\"change my life\\" or do something dramatic to me.

I saw them both togeather in their new band, Redemption in Summer of 2007 with Dream-Theater during their Systematic Chaos tour. Now I have just plugged 3 bands and I recommend them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars!","review":"Got no pie, no replies to my email, nothing. Amazon refunded my money.

It includes information on the 32 chief types of British monoplanes in service with the RAF at the time.

A great piece of history to own, as well as an excellent guide for warbird and airshow enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Story of 1910 Colorado","review":"Little Britches is back in Man of the Family. Now as a young boy, he's the man in the house and works with his mother and older sister to find ways to survive. They're off the ranch and living in town. In the process they find incredible ways to make a living. Entrepreneurship at its best.This book is filled with the importance of community, neighbors, and standing on your own. Little Britches makes sacrifices in order to accept his role as the man in the family. Grace, the eldest daughter, also shoulders a lot of responsibility. Together they try to take as much of the load off their mother as possible. The author has a way of writing scenes so vividly that you are transported into the middle and feel every emotion.This book can be read on its own. But for those who have read Little Britches, you will love seeing so many characters return. These books make me think of Little House on the Prairie, only for boys. But everyone can enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Biography Series","review":"This is a great true story for ages 6-105. A little bit of cowboy language but going to the park is far worse.

It was the first book of Mr. Pike I had ever read. Christopher Pike is, and probably always will be, my fave. author, becuase of his uncanny ability to know what people want and deliver. I'm approaching ... but I still look for more Spooksville titles along with the Matt Reilly and Tom Clancy I read today. It's a great series for youngsters because it doesn't treat them like fools who run to their mommies at the first sign of trouble expecting them to be believed. The charcters, young as they are, take matters into their own ahnds and rely on each other rather than adults. .... In conclusion,read every Spooksville you can find because the stories are sensational and the characters are BELIEVABLE. Also, stop at nothing to read anything with Christopher Pike's name on it, especially The Last Vampire Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooksville","review":"I think that the most important thing that the author wants the reader to know is not to take your pride too seriously and keep a grip on reality, I think that because Adam did not believe in the things and did not keep an open mind no matter how crazy it might of been got him into a lot of trouble and mishap.Christopher Pike wants the reader to know this is to prevent being a situation like that.

This guy's music was different, and fascinating to me, then and now almost 20 years later.As the years have passed and Ferry has deleved into very old standards, Bob Dylan tunes, etc., I still wish he'd stick with the kind of songs he made here and with albums just prior to this, like \\"Boys and Girls.\\"These are original, haunting ballads with a beat, if that makes any sense. They are still unique to me, and great stuff. You cannot go wrong with this CD, or the above-mentioned \\"Boys and Girls.\\" It is Bryan Ferry at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferry good.","review":"Bryan Ferry might be an aquired taste, but there's no doubt he's made some classic tunes, especially with Roxy Music. Of his solo work I've come to like this the best. \\"Boys And Girls\\" is also excellent, and has a few hits of it's own. I find this album as a whole to be very good, but I'll admit it's \\"Limbo\\" and \\"Kiss And Tell\\" that make it so damn great. Few songs are as catchy and emotionally pleasing, to me anyway. Come to think of it, I'm shocked he hasn't had a proper solo collection out yet. Still, this is one of the first albums to get of his, if not the first.

Even though it had a silly ending, it scared the pants off me. But this, was just stupid. I didn't mind the characters, they all did a decent job. The acting, the directing, the scenery and the cinematography are all okay. It's the story that is weak and full of holes. They tried to turn Rest Stop 2 into a ghost story. Too bad it really doesn't work. There are just too damn many holes and things that make absolutely no sense. I didn't hate it, but it was frustrating to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel!","review":"While the first Rest Stop movie was still watchable and had some scary and moving scenes, this sequel is almost entirely disappointing at every turn. The suspense and dramatic occurances of the first film are simply missing in this rather boring sequel, and the acting isen't better than last time, perhaps even worse.To make matters worse this one feels contrived and rather unnatural in its make up; the torture scene at the end seemed far too mandatory and routine for my taste, and it came across as a way to keep the horror fans in line, who needless to say, probably comprise about at least 80% of the potential audience of this movie.Therefore, not worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"I was excited to watch this movie after enjoying the first Rest Stop.

Just stay out of the restrooms and bury your dead with their eyes.Just a funny thing i noticed... the scene when tom climbs down a ladder the camera reveals a corpse beside him, notice the corpse's hands are hanging from a chain.

Yes, a few of the retellings are serious, but most of them are attempts at poking fun at the conventions of fairy tales. I like these sorts of stories when they are well done, but most of these stories seem to be groaners rather than side-splitters; farces whose main purpose seems to be dragging every single fairy tale cliche into every single story. I mean, seriously, does a detective story about Rumpelstiltskin, which was just getting interesting, really need Hansel and Gretel barging into the plot? Many of the stories are like this. Just throw the ten or so most famous fairy tales into a blender and see what comes out, and top it off with a forced wittiness. If you're looking for cheesy fairy tale humor, check this out.

Her music is just fantastic, in the morning I awake, put on the coffee,get out the inspirational books, ( Eckart Tolle, Course in Miracles etc) light the candles and incense put on Kirtana and my meditation begins.

I really enjoyed it and didn't feel like the religious agenda was the primary goal of the book. Great story and great lessons to be learned (regardless of what god you believe in)The second book was WAY different.

You will not put it down. And it will effect your life for a loong time after. It tugs at every emotion you have, and sticks with you. I cried at the end for every reason it is possible to cry.

Together, not physically, these people, no matter where they are, can stop violence from occurring. Nicely-crafted characters collaborate in a highly suspenseful plot to override the evil that is slowly enveloping society.. A thought-provoking, futuristic novel of the horrible fate of human kind and the perilous quest to end it. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the Ark","review":"This book is an above adverage book because it is really good, especially at the beginning and almost at the end. The ending is weird because it goes from present to eight years later. It doesn't really tell their lives to that point. I think the author should have gone more in depth in what went on in their lives after leaving the \\"group home.\\" Other than that the book was really good. If you liked the movie \\"The Breakfast Club\\", you'll like this book you'll like this book just as well because if is kind of the same plot in a scene becasue they both tell thier stories about their lives, families and don't really know eachother that well until the end of Saturday School where they know eachother more and become for the most of them become friends. That's kind of the case here, except that the children in the book have more complex issues. As time goes on, they get to know one another and become friends. So agian I strongly suggest this book.

The part about everyone feeling his spirit among TAryn, Miranda and Doug when they get on top of the mountain. The way they meet each other is weird and far fetched. That is the only part of the book I didn't like. If you like the movie called \\"The Breakfast Club\\", you'll like this book it's kind of the same plot. The differences are the book it's about four children ranging in all different ages, except Miranda and Doug. They are pretty close together. Their issues are worse then in The Breakfast Club because in that movie, they have hard times with family, maybe the exception of John Bender becasue he has been abused at home, like Eligah. Don't get me wrong. It is bad, most kids have troubles with their parents. I strongly recommend this book to anyone.

There are squat sequences to tone your butt and legs, and all The Firm tapes are good arm workouts. This is an excellent DVD for strenuous workout.

I was hoping this would be relaxing and sensual for my partner and me, but it ended up being stressful because we were just trying to keep up with the moves.

It's was their debut single release called \\"Untill Your Love Comes Back Around.\\" It's one of my favorite power ballad of all time. Brad's voice soars on that song like no other song on that album. I have emailed the keyboardist and wondered why that song never became big?

But Tony Banks has always written unconventional and distinctive pop songs with quirky rhythm tracks and harmonic progressions that stand out so noticably. At the same time, he layers his sounds and rhythms so effectively to create a more subtle effect in the structure of the work. Sophisticated modulations and odd time signatures are hardly grating on the ear. Mr. Banks successfully manages to carve out little gems that are far superior to any song that gets airplay today, and I find that his shorter, more direct songs can be far more emotional than his larger epics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony is my Hero","review":"As a long standing Genesis fan, I was always a synthesizer junkie. As Genesis morphed into a successful pop band under the direction of Collins, I missed the elegant keyboard work of Banks. Then, I started to explore the individual works of Tony Banks. Although A Curious Feeling is excellent, Still is his best work. It also helps that Tony is not the lead singer on this album. Surprisingly, this is pop music which is very catchy but never anything you will hear on mainstream radio. This is in part because of the length of his tunes, which the average teeny bopper will not be able to sit through. \\"Red Day on Blue Street\\" and \\"Another Murder of a Day\\" are alone worth the purchase but the album is good from the first song to the very last note of the CD.This is an excellent introduction to Tony's solo work but not worthy of a 5 star rating (saved for the likes of Zeppelin II, for example, or \\"DUKE\\" for that matter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually really good @}->---","review":"After hearing Do It To It a few months back, I thought these guys might be a one hit wonder, but you know what?

The entire music scheme is completely computer-generated. 3) When I first heard \\"Do It To It\\" on the radio, I thought that it was a Rihanna song. I mean, the voices are completely identical. This shows that their really nothing different from any other R&B singer or group \\"on the market\\" today. I mean, I can sing better than they do. And I'm only 14 years old.

The downside is the cost. They are pretty pricey for an item like this at $15 each. Also, I don't like the fact that the vendor Jazebra charges w-a-a-y too much for shipping and handling.

Her mate, Max Ernst, now the subject of a major retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, chose well.

The problem is, it has a hard time rewinding the last 5-10 feet. I've tried tensioning the mechanism but to no avail. The last 5-10 feet, depending, engage the stop mechanism, so you have to keep pulling it out, feeding it back in (like a seatbelt that engages and is hard to retract). For $300, that's not acceptable. I've had it in my shop for over a month. It was properly installed and was mounted right beside a Coxreels hose reel, which works great. Fortunately, Amazon has a great return policy, so I'm sending it back and just ordered a Coxreels cord reel. It's $100 more, but with the time I've wasted trying to feed the Reelcrap back in, I'll be satisfied in the long run. I emailed Reelcraft about the issue but didn't hear back.

We spent approximately 12 weeks doing one chapter a week. The women began commenting week after week that this book simply transformed their marriages. One reason for the success of the book is it helps women to gain a biblical perspective on their role as \\"Help Mate\\" to their husband.

Elyse is an amazing writer that is to the point without being harsh or hypocritical.

If you see a twisted character and assume that they are the villain you will most likely find out you're wrong towards the end of the film. Miyazaki doesn't follow any formulas when making his films. There doesn't have to be a love story. There doesn't have to be a good guy or bad guy. But in all his films there is this imaginative journey you're taken on and you become swept up in these worlds Miyazaki has created for you.

My daughter was so taken with it she is planning on being Nausicaa for Halloween (she was Miyazaki's Princess Mononke last year). As is typical you are pulled into the story at once and you never want to get out. We have viewed it at least a half a dozen times or more since we got it and we are not tired of it one bit. You can see in these characters the germs that will be the the two main characters in Castle in the Sky, which was his next project. If you liked Spirited Away or any others by Miyazaki you will find this one just as satisfying. If you have never seen a Miyazaki movie and are wanting to see one this is fantastic, though Spirited Away or Castle in the Sky (if you have a little girl, start with Kiki's Delivery Service) might be slightly better for a first one.

This movie, along with other titles by miyazaki, never fail to humble my agressions. The unrelenting heart that Hayao Miyazaki portrays here is a spectacle to behold, reminding us all of the compassion we are capable of.

After all, the earth would be so much better off if we humans weren't around mucking it up.I am quite sure that the self loathing creator and the self loathing lovers of this film had no issue with using the DVD player to view this film, which by the way is powered by electricity which was made possible by burning eeeeevil fossil fuels.

I hate saying this, because I love this kind of movie (Howl's Moving Castle lifted my spirit, I've seen it more times that I can count; The Cat Returns is beautiful; Spirited Away is awesome, etc...), but I really did NOT like this one. I didn't care about the lead character, and felt I never got to know her at all. She was dull and had no discernable heroic qualities. I found none of the other characters even memorable. The animation itself was gorgeous, however.I wish I could share in the apparant joy that everyone else here has for this one, I really do, but I have to be honest and quite frankly this movie was totally boring and made absolutely no sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nausicaa of the valley of the Wind","review":"I purchased this for my kids - they really like these movies from producer Hayao Miyazaki.

Despite it's dubbing back then, which was not very good, I grew up with it and loved it.Then I got the graphic novels, and found out how much was cut from this movie.I got this movie locally. And it was redubbed wonderfully. Never did I know Patrick Stewart (Picard on STTNG) Would turn out to be the perfect Lord Yupa, as apposed to the original voice.I discovered at least 30 minutes had been cut from this movie in the dubbing of Warriors of the Wind. Which left more gaps than many would have realized.Disney also went back to the original Japanese names. Which I loved. They kept the same score as you would hear from the older version. I loved the one line they kept from the old dubbing. \\"That's Lord Yupa! Kill him and you'll be famous!\\" ^_^If you want the complete version, get this movie. You won't be disappointed. I sure wasn't! ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD version is horrible.","review":"This film is my favorite anime of all time! But this DVD version, released by Disney, is absolutely horrible. The picture and audio are flat and obviously were not digitally remastered. The original release looks and sounds better than this version. It looks like they copied the old video (aged 20 years), quickly dubbed in English parts, slapped it in a new package, and then charged double for it.Except for Patrick Stewarts part, the acting on the English voiceovers are dreadful as well. The butchered US version released in the 80's is better then this version.

Still prettier than DVD though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nausicaa","review":"Nausicaa is not one of my favorite Studio Ghibli movies. There is just something about it that doesn't have the spark and wonder of some of the other films. That said, it is still worth watching. The english dub is rather well done and enjoyable. It might not stand next to Totoro for me, but I still think it is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb movie, great DVD","review":"As other reviewers have said, this is Miyazaki's best, and one ofthe best movies of all time, in any genre.The new Disney DVD release is good. The visuals are wonderful --great color, very crisp, very clean. The transfer does justice toMiyazaki's sweeping, highly detailed visual style.The English dub is also quite good. It's quite faithful to theoriginal dialog, with only a few cringe-inducing moments. Thevoice acting is sometimes rather flat, though, lacking theemotional intensity that it deserves.The audio is quite good, though the sound effects sometimes getpushed farther down in the mix than they should.Overall, the English translation, voice acting, and audio mix issignificantly better than that of the \\"Castle in the Sky\\" DVD.Not quite as good as the original Japanese audio track, but verylistenable.The DVD extras are pretty skimpy, but then with a movie this good,who needs extras?Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Just a superb movie all around.

The manga is brilliant, violent, and complex- I highly recommend it. The movie, on the other hand... is not so great. They tried to cram four long graphic novels into one two-hour movie, and it really shows. The story is awkwardly compressed, and frankly a bit of a wreck. Despite the nice animation, I didn't enjoy it very much at all.Mind you, I have no problem with book-to-film translations in general- I thought Lord of the Rings was wonderfully done. This movie just isn't very well written or translated to the screen, though. Frankly, Nausicaa would have worked much better as a one-season tv series.So in short...Film: 4/10Manga: 9/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST ANIMES I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"Personally, I've only seen the Japanise version for I own an import, but this is defentilly my favorite ghibli film.

(Please read my review)","review":"The reason that I indicated \\"please read my review\\" is that generally customers disregard 1 star review. But I couldn't give something more in order to make it convincible. In fact if I had the opportunity I would have given 0 starts...The film is EXXXTTTTREEEEEEMMMLLLYYYYY DULL AND SLOW! It is a type of film that will make you ask yourself \\"so whatt??\\" in the end. In fact you start to ask this to yourself even in the middle of the film.Just a note to bear in mind: If you come across with the trailer of the movie by chance, you need to know that it doesn't reflect the actual synopsis of the film. It reflects as if this movie is a creepy horror film. It is not. It would be in the drama category I think. I saw the trailer in the DVD of Half Light, which is a product of the same movie company. BTW, Half Light altough not perfect, was far much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"River Mystery","review":"Go into this expecting something like a \\"Midsomer Murder\\" and you won't be disappointed. This is not a fast paced in your face shootem up as perhaps some people need a fix for action. However, it is a good movie that although occasionally convaluted still delivers a good story. Good acting, sets, and music make this a worthy rental and I even intend to buy it as I think it is very rewatchable. Burns does a fine job and the rest the cast are more than competant. The camera work is excellent and the director does a great job of making us feel haunted. Many will in fact feel deja vu as one reviewer mentioned. Perhaps from your university days, perhaps from somewhere else. Fans of mysteries should enjoy it. Especially those that enjoy the \\"Stone Cold\\" style and not just \\"Die Hard\\". Most Hollywood Videos carry this so rent it and I think you will agree it is worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and empty","review":"This is a moive that simply does not deliver on any level. I agree with the reveiwer who lamented the waste of Ed Burns's talents; otherwise, the movie is dreadfully predictable, stonily acted and unsatisfying. It's a shame, in a way, because a better film seems to be hiding behind this narrow execution. The actress playing Carlin is simply too old for her role, and her character, who seems so pivotal, is given short shrift (perhaps she ended up on the cutting room floor). The scenes between Burns's character, Grey, and his father are just too much psychobabble for words, and the stunted \\"romance\\" between Grey and the Lit teacher (a wooden performance at best) is lacking in sparks. No wonder I never herad of this film when it was released (or not, as one reviewer here indicates). Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I've never been one to put much stock in the critical reviews of most movies, since too many times I've read terrible reviews, only to see a movie and thoroughly enjoy it; however, in the case of \\"The River King\\", the overwhelmingly negative reviews I read prior to viewing were certainly justified. To be short and to the point, this movie absolutely sucks. The storytelling is horrid and there's no way the book can be any worse. The acting throughout the movie is pretty subpar and the director does a horrid job at tying everything together. The ending was very anticlimactic and certainly unsatisfying. I'd go into greater depth, but this movie was just so bad that I can't even find the words to describe it. If I had to point out any bright spots, it would be the cinematography, which at times was pretty striking. In closing, save your money and don't see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I found that The River King, one of my favorite Alice Hoffman books, had been made into a movie. Honestly, I did not have my hopes up though. It just came out in 2005 & I'd heard nothing about it. I bought it anyway. Big mistake! It was terrible. The basic plot follows the book, but that's the only recognizable element of the extraordinary novel. Hoffman's writing is elegant & descriptive. The natural world intrudes on the man-made one. There are legends of the past that come to play on current events. None of this was included. More than once, I felt that simple voice-over could have helped to enhance the film and include all of the internal activites. And I'm not generally a fan of voice overs. I generally like Ed Burns, but he was miscast in this role. In fact, all of the major roles were miscast. If you're as curious as I was and are a fan of Hoffman, rent the movie before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ishtar in the Northeast (Nova Scotia)","review":"This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made.

I just listened to it again and I have to agree with the previous poster's sentiment: YUCK. Almost all of these versions of Jim's songs just do not work at all. The only two I even halfway liked are the Rapid Roy by Mark Collie and I'll Have to Say I Love You by Lane Brody. I hope one day someone does a really good Jim Croce cover album, because the songs themselves are unbeatable. In short: good idea, bad execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I suppose that it's because I have Jim Croce's own version of these songs ingrained in my head so deeply -- most of the covers are fairly sticky sweet, the exception being the cover of \\"One Less Set of Footsteps\\", which I think rocks no matter who is singing it. I would suggest that Jim Croce fans get the original greatest hits album -- this one misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not think that it is a good buy","review":"This tribute album was released in 1997, and it features some of the stars of Nashville performing hits of the great Jim Croce (1943-73). Now, as you might expect with an album like this, it's a bit of a mixed-bag. For example, I think that Charlie Daniels did a great job with Box #10, as did Mark Collie with Rapid Roy. However, on the down side, I really did not like some of the artists' versions of the songs.I liked less than 50% of the songs, so overall I do not think that it is a good buy. By all means, buy the MP3 versions of the songs you like, but I really don't think you'll want the entire album."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!!!","review":"I think my summary can be best stated in 1 word--\\"YUCK!\\"Don't waste your money on this cd.

Dobson continues his father's tradition of spreading fraudulent, hate-mongering lies under the guise of Christian doctrine. He has never left the protective womb of his little bible-bubble in Colorado Springs, choosing instead to squander his narrow, young life riding his daddy's shoulders all the way to iconic cult status. He understands nothing about the real world, and is deathly afraid of everything that falls outside of his anachronistic worldview. He hates homosexuals, non-Americans of any kind, and women who posess anything even remotely resembling critical mental faculties.

It is clear, common-sense, practical and makes a priority of empowering parents to raise their kids in a way which will help them become responsible adults. It is not just theory but deals with the daily issues with which parents struggle, and gives concrete examples for dealing with them. It is also very enjoyable reading as Dr. Rosemond has a great sense of humor. Don't be overwhelmed with the size of the book.

ThIs book is easy to read, and is definitely more of a reference book, rather than a page to page read, with plenty of scenarios that we can all relate to.

After having my first child last year, I decided I did not want her to be like the disobedient, disrespectful, self-centered children that arrive in my classroom every year. I had read Dr. Rosemond's column in my local newspaper and I knew this man is one of the few family psychologists out there who understands the RIGHT way to raise a child. He emphasizes a common sense approach to child rearing, with the marriage being the center of attention in the family, NOT the child. He also explains how detrimental television and video games are to a child's development, as well as practical advice on how to deal with certain situations that arise with children, such as tantrums. Don't just read the book, STUDY it. If more people raised their children using Dr. Rosemond's approach, we would ALL benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so thinly veiled Evangelical Fundamentalism","review":"What is so sad for me is that John Rosemond has many excellent interventions for children yet he view's self-esteem as demonic and nefarious.

Also, my son likes being cold and wet. He doesn't care if he's cold and wet from peeing all over himself. Am I supposed to just get pee all over the house until he ONE day decides this is uncomfortable??

This book offers nothing new to those of us who've followed his advice for years. One wonders why he doesn't go in a new direction, write on another area of family/child-raising. Same old/same/old, over and over.

If you are John Furhman, this book will help you a lot. If not, it's hard to say.It is hard to compare this book to others out there on management and business.

It also has the ends of 2 nails sticking up inside in the bottom. Very unhappy with this purchase. I realize stuff can get damaged during shipping but this was a box inside a bigger box with padding.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those preachy people who says bad things about this series. The first four books were great, and parts of this one i.e. the beginning were fairly good too. There's just different levels of unrealistic you can take. Rich spoiled teens full of drama on the Upper East Side: Good Unrealistic.

The only real problem I could ocme up with while reading it was that the series was getting a bit redundant. Sure new \\"juicy\\" issues were cropping up (Jenny in her diva-mode, Blair losing her virginity) but nothing's real changed. Nate's stoned, there's always that air of sexual tension between Serena and Nate (but now it develops in to much more then air). It's just getting a bit repetitive.

The lamp is so heavy that the attachment won't hold it up. The attachment stays attached to the table, but the lamp just hangs down and won't stay in the position in which it has been adjusted, because the round lamp and magnifier portion is too heavy. I had to move it around so much to keep it in position that the screws in the arm eventually popped out and the rendered the lamp useless.

It's wonderfully played, and has 23 tracks for a total of 72:45 minutes of melodic, serene music.The famous Adagio in G minor, so often heard in films, etc., is here given a lovely rendition. Played a little faster than most other versions, with the individual instruments (especially the harpsichord) being heard clearly. It's not as lush and smooth as some recordings, but crisper, and to my ears, absolutely delightful.It's hard to pick favorites among the other selections...each piece is a baroque beauty that flows well from one track to the next. I'm sure this CD will please most people who like 18th century music.The recordings were done in 1970, '74, and '81, the sound is very good, and it's a great addition to my \\"quiet time\\" CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Treasure","review":"I love Bach and Vivaldi.

So pick this up, read and enjoy. I look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whopping good read","review":"I'm not quite certain why, but I keep seeing shades of Robert Parker in Rosenfelt's books. Perhaps because Andy is quick with a quip and Rosenfelt writes very good dialogue. Perhaps because Andy loves his dog and thinks it's the most perfect dog in the universe, even though it's not quite as annoying as Spencer's Pearl the Wonder Dog. Perhaps because Andy has a serious love interest to whom he's not married, although, happily, Laura doesn't have any of Susan's annoying characteristics. But Rosenfelt is no imitation and definitely stands on his own. He has created some great characters and yet isn't afraid to kill off important characters. He knows how to balance humor and tension. The tone of the book is light, but it contains a whopping good, unpredictable mystery. I've really been enjoying this series and am really looking forward to continuing with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I had read such praise for this book, including much of what's written here.

VERY pleased with this seller! Book arrived quickly and in perfect condition! A pleasure to do business with you! Thanks so much!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every minute!","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed every book of the Foreigner series. I had no idea what C.J. planned to follow in the storyline -- I just hoped she would. Now that I know, I'm amazed. Her characters continue to grow in depth and charm. Her view of station life and how it may affect those living in that environment is particularly relevant as we start one above this world. I highly recommend this series to non-sf readers as well as sf readers. As usual, I found myself laughing out loud between moments of awe. Thanks, C.J. Keep 'em coming! And I'll keep my candy tray filled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascination...of the morbid kind","review":"I read \\"Foreigner\\" when it first appeared, I suppose six years ago. It was reasonably good for this long-time science fiction fan. Since then, however, I have grown less and less enamoured of this \\"universe,\\" though I keep reading it.Because, some sort of masochistic curiosity compels me to keep reading it. Not in the hope that it will FINALLY reach some sort of plot resolution, but that (after some sixteen-hundred pages) a discernible plot will even begin.The first book in the series was OK. Then it turned into a \\"trilogy.\\" Now we have a sequel to the trilogy, with no end in sight. Does any author in scifi ever tell a complete story in one book anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book good series","review":"Having read all of the books set in the Atevi universe I do believe that this was my favorite.The story line has been consistent throughout the books and Cherryh's writing style is impeccable.The Atevi are unique in that they are truly alien and beyond instinctual understanding. Bren tells us time and time again that they are not human and we should not put human motives behind thier actions but Bren and the reader always want to.Thier actions and motivations are alien to us and any reader would do well to keep this in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Designing a database : get this book!","review":"Easy to read and communicates years of db theory in practical, easy-to-digest chapters.This is not a how-to reference for database applications. And because it isn't written for any particular software, that makes it an invaluable design reference. SQL, Access, Oracle, whatever-- this book focuses on solid, proven design and not on the latest, coolest, widget.If you are considering a database, for whatever platform, for whatever project, be sure to grab this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antiquated but Useful","review":"Interesting book in understanding humor in an intellectual manner. Quite antiquated, but nevertheless useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of HOPE for today!","review":"With first hand knowledge from the main character, author Maxwell shows the story of Mr. Wong, a committed Christian who resolves to stand firm for his beliefs. An easy reading true story about Mr. \`Glorious Country Wong', a tough guy, gun sniper, policeman, and polygamist. Maxwell takes you into Mr. Wong's world and his 1958 arrest in communist china, and as the story pulls you through the pages of intrigue and suspense, you relive Mr. Wong's 20 years of imprisonment and eventual triumph. The Man Who Could not be Killed, tells the story of religious persecution, and perhaps an allegory of what is going on today. A must read story of hope for today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith,Hope, and Courage","review":"The Man Who Couldn't Be Killed was a well written book. The author Stanley Maxwell talks about Mr. Wongs faith and courage in the communist China and his belif in the Seventh-day-Adventist church and his love for Jesus. I would recommend this book for those who want to see how fighting in what they believe in can encourage others."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE KNEW IN WHOM HE HAD BELIEVED","review":"Many thoughts ran through my mind as I read this book. This was book was truly remarkable to me. I'm still in awe of Mr. Wong's courage. This guy really knew in whom he believed and he stood firm for his beliefs, something that many of us don't do as much. I think this book was very important because one day we are going to be faced with persecution and we need to straighten our relationship with God. I must say that I'm actually glad that the author spent his time gathering all the necessary information to write this book. Although we have many examples in the Bible of people that suffered for the cause of Jesus, we also need recent experiences like the one of Mr. Wong. One thing that I did not like about this book was that the author omitted some things that I think were relevant in this novel. However, I still found this book very important and very essential for us Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and \\"writer friendly\\" resource","review":"The Romance Writer's Handbook: How To Write Romantic Fiction & Get It Published by novelist, journalist, and www.Romance-Central.com webmaster Rebecca Vinyard is a quick-study course to crafting romance fiction for the markets and readers of today.

Awesome fight scenes! Martial Arts master(who is that guy?) comes out of hiding to team up with Ti Lung and fight against corruption within the Chinese government.
