Stinky stuff is so fun for kids either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, cute book!","review":"Love the way this book is written. It is a really great read aloud book and very funny! The pictures are very kid friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Lovers of the Stink!","review":"... \\"I Stink\\" by Kate and Jim McMullan is the book for you. This is a really fun book that follows a trash truck as he makes his rounds. The artwork is really unique and the trash truck is pretty funny. You also get a chance to run down the alphabet by naming some of the yucky stuff in the trash truck. It's a unique and funky book, but kids really enjoy it. I thought the artwork was particularly unique and well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"I liked the pictures, I liked the way the author puts in the 'alphabet of trash' and I liked the subject matter. It's great to teach kids to appreciate the hard work that the department of sanitation does.However, I REALLY disliked the attitude of the trash truck. The 'Did I wake you?? Too bad.' or the 'Outta my way!' My son is at an age where he definitely picks up and remember lines from books. I hear him repeating lines he's heard in books that we've read to him. The authors could have made the trash truck just as stinky and hard-working, but more likeable. No reason why he has to be so rude and inconsiderate.Also, the writing seemed too choppy. We read tons of children's books at our house, and this one is tough to read at times.I would have given it 3 stars if my son liked it more, but even he doesn't seem to gravitate to it as much as some of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This book leaves a lot to be desired. The story is poorly written, has very little substance and the sentences are very choppy. The author skips around and leaves a lot to be desired with what little story line there is. I thought the book would be great for my little boys - who love big trucks! But it doesn't really capture their attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most awful book children's book I've ever read","review":"My son is 5 and loves cars, trucks, trains, tractors, you name it. He brought this book home from the library at school. This is definitely the most god-awful children's book I've ever read ~ and we read a lot. It's horribly written, does not flow well, and the illustration is dark and rather scary. I would never recommend this book to anyone. Honestly I'm shocked to find that this book has been so highly rated, because I truly fail to see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"This garbage truck is RUDE!","review":"This has to be one of the worst board books ever. The garbage truck is so rude, here is a line from the book, \\"Did I wake you? Too bad!\\" This type of behavior and attitude is not something I want to teach my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book STINKS!","review":"This book really rubs me the wrong way. The main issues are that the garbage truck is very rude and arrogant, and that it is glorifying trash. I think we should be showing our children examples of people treating each other with respect, and similarly treating the environment with respect. We should be talking about reducing or eliminating waste, recycling, etc. rather than eating trash. In reality the trash is going to a landfill. This linear system is not sustainable."},{"rating":"2","title":"unparalleled depiction of garbage and where it goes","review":"This is a non preachy entertaining yet educational book that explains what goes into the garbage and where the garbage goes. De-stigmatizes trash collection. Makes us think about our consumption of goods and keeping a city clean. Our toddler loves yelling, \\"I stink!\\" I don't think there's any competitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"No educational value","review":"Do not buy this book if you are teaching your child about composting and recycling or he/she will be very confused.Many of the things that go into this garbage truck go somewhere else in our house: apple cores, banana peels, egg shells, orange peels, rotten radishes, watermelon rinds, yams and jam jars to name a few ...I understand the authors were looking for items from A - Z but with a bit more effort I think they could have found other examples.The other confusing thing is that the garbage truck takes all the trash to the river to dump it on a barge and we are not told where it goes from there.Maybe this is how it's done in New York but still - let kids know where the trash really ends up and don't leave us with an image of trash on a barge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stink!","review":"The pictures in this book are reasonably good, but the text is lacking - and often times confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video was awful.","review":"My room mate played this for her four year old son, and I was appalled at the attitude of the truck. It had a very \\"if I'm bothering you, TOUGH! Get over it!\\" attitude. This is NOT the kind of lesson I want imparted to my children. The character is too direct, and needs to develop some manners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to see more from these authors!!!!","review":"This book is my sons FAVORITE!

Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Stink!","review":"This is a great book. I enjoyed reading it myself. It was a great story that taught a lesson that children can understand. The illustrations are great and colorful and it is written with a sense of humor. I'm sending it to my nephew who loves garbage trucks and garbage men and I can't wait for him to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"disgustingly splendid","review":"I was sceptical at first and bit grossed out by this book...that is until my then 2 year old began memorizing this book. It was an every night must read and he loved every gross minute of it. It's a fun book, with some gross trash, but lots of fun - especially for little boys who love stinky stuff! Got it as a gift, now buy it as a gift for others :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Stink--the Story of a City Garbage Truck","review":"Pre-schoolers love this nitty-gritty story of a big-city garbage truck and the work he does for us all night long while we sleep. The trash our truck collects forms a very grungy and hilarious alphabet--apple cores, banana peels, all the way down to ziti with zucchini shown in an old plastic bag. In between can be found dirty diapers, puppy poo and stinky sneakers. Brightly colored child-friendly illustrations predominate, and the well-chosen words make children laugh out loud: when the truck shows what life would be like without him, we see a mountain of trash with the words, \\"It's trash-o-rama, baby!\\" I have read this book to many pre-school boys, all of whom adored it. I can't speak for girls, but I suspect it might present a welcome break from all those princesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want our copy?","review":"I got this book for our 19-month-old, who is obsessed with trucks of any kind. And he loved it. Loved it! But 3 days after I had gotten it for him, I had to \\"disappear\\" it. The book is so rude. I mean, I get that the truck is a garbage truck, and it's rough-and-tumble, but it has so much attitude that I think is hard to explain to a kid who's learning manners. It's all, get out of my way, and Did I wake you? Too bad! I think there's no reason to introduce such rudeness to your children just to get some truck love. If you're trying to instill manners in your child, do yourself a favor and skip this book. Try any of the Amazing Machines books about trucks, My Truck is Stuck! or the millions of others. Then you won't have to try to break your child of bad habits that s/he learns from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 1/2 stars? You're kidding me!","review":"I wish I had read more of the reviews before I purchased. What a waste of money. This book tries to be clever but basically tells our kids that everything is garbage and that all the trash goes bye-bye out to sea. Really?? Is that the image we want our children growing up with?I thought I would teach my daughter that all jobs, even the gross stinky ones, are helpful to society... not through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritatating Narrative Voice","review":"This one does nothing for me. Children emulate the narrative voices they hear in books. Who wants their child speaking like this? Stupid book, stupid subject, poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I really don't care for this book at all. I don't like the sarcastic tone and the way that it reads. It's not interesting to my son at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing collection o films mostly forgotten - and for good reason","review":"I have a pretty eclectic taste in films and am very prepared to make allowances - but I can see why this collection of 50 movies was so cheap.

However I received another product from this company in it's place.

Much better than the product I received in it's place"},{"rating":"1","title":"No improvement","review":"Looking at other reviews, this seems like really great shampoo if you want to get rid of dry scalp and dandruff, but After 5 weeks of use, there is no improvement and the condition actually seems a little worse.

I will go ahead and order the conditioner and provide an update in the future of my results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Shampoo!","review":"The KeraCare Dry & Itchy line of products works for me.

I'm talking about the DVDs.Why no chapter stops and \\"play all\\" feature? Why? I'm not asking for hours of extras, just 2 very simple options.You can't skip through anything because there are no chapter stops. How hard could it be to include chapter stops? The episodes are already divided up for commerical breaks. Everytime you want to watch another episode you have to go back to the main menu (the only menu) and sit through (or fast forward) through the theme song and credits again. That's stupid. You have to go back to the menu because...There is no \\"play all\\" feature. Why? Can someone tell me why? How hard could it be to include that?Refer to the MASH DVDs to see how it's done.

I very much like the bright compact presentation of the set - makes it easier to store! The booklet is great but some printed background information on the series similar to that included with the Dick Van Dyke Show releases would have been appreciated.

Sure, madness or stupidity have his peculiar greatness, but we can't cheat ourselves Dustin Hoffmann knows it very well and also what's real life, in his case, really unstable and sordid, but perhaps as all of us, he has these rare property capable of elevate and dignify one life at least for one time even in spite of manipulated tv and news.

It does a pretty good job of explaining the origins of adventure racing, but lacks the bigger, more global reach of today's races. This book is informative, but is still lacking. Like \\"The Toughest Race on Earth\\", this book also lacks in explaining the true training and lifestyle of today's racers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginally useful information","review":"I would recommend a different book. So far, the best one I have read is actually the e-book, \\"How to Buy A Good Business at a Great Price\\".This book lays out basic information for you, but I did not learn anything new.The main premise in this book, is that you need to get the seller financing to pay for 1/3 to 2/3 of the business, then you can finance the balance using business assets as collatoral.Great concept, but nothing new. The second half of this book is forms copied directly from the Internet, mostly SBA 7(a) loan document requirements.

This volume in particular is my personal favorite. None of the songs dissapointed me, very few do on these sets. In particular my favorites were: The Outcasts- Nothing But Love (great British sounding garage song), The Intruders- Temporary Insanity (angry and chaotic Texas garage), The Trees- The Only Life For Me (fuzztone psych), George Washington and the Cherry Pickers- Backshelf of Your Mind (more psych) Really obscure stuff that you won't find anywhere else.

The first and last tracks are standouts (\\"please\\" and \\"everything is ok\\") but they are weak up the middle. Don't spend a bunch on the CD, but it's worth it at a low price.

I had to make myself finish it. There were way too many unnecessary conversations and characters. I'm glad the people are concerned about their spiritual state, but I got extremely bogged down with all the sub characters' Bible studies,thoughts,etc. Is this book about the town people or Reece and Conner? The main couple in the book hardly had any story time for them. Characters who weren't even particular friends/relatives with the main couple had way too much page time. Also, more could have been said about Reece and Conner's personalities. I didn't think they even had a chance to get to know one another very well.

Poor pacing.","review":"I watched this film because of the many glowing reviews of it which you can find here. Micheal Caine does a fine job portraying the relentless Jack Carter. He is very steely and cool, and brutal, and manipulative. Unfortunately, the film takes a very long time to get mildly interesting, and none of the characters are very likeable. I found it hard to believe Jack Carter's motive. Why would a man like him even care about his own brother?The film evokes one or two gasps, but no cheers. It is a seedy and ugly cloud, with no silver lining.Edgy as this film is, it would have been more interesting to me if Carter had gotten away with it. But then the film might have caused a moral outrage. So, instead, the screenwriters have Carter make a stupid fatal mistake. Sigh.Great as Caine is, he can't save this picture from the distasteful and unromantic world it _slowly_ portrays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"Bought the DVD with high hopes after reading so many positive reviews....boy, was that a mistake. Quite a few viewers gave this movie high marks - Why? It wasn't the plot, the acting, the star studded cast, grandiose scenes or special effects....because this movie has little of that. What this movie has is gratuitous nude scenes, a very difficult story line to follow and is just plain hard on the eyes.

This is 1 of his best performances. A drawback here is I wish there was more of the wonderful gritty music score done during the opening credits. It would've been needed thruout GET CARTER. Still, a powerful violent mob flick. I wonder what the 2000 remake will be like since Sylvester Stallone will be Carter and Michael Caine who played Carter in the '71 version has a small role here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beloved Author","review":"Author, Ies Spetter, was the beloved Leader of the Riverdale Ethical Society (NYC) and founder of the Riverdale Mental Health Clinic.

Kamentsky's writing is balanced while remaining honest and self-revealing. For anyone who deals with cults, cult-like groups, and invasive religious missioniaries \\"saving\\" Jewish souls, this quick read is well-worth seeking out in a used copy or at a library and then sharing with parents, teenagers, clergy, and friends. Ultimately, her story is an inspiring one of her family's love and the finding of a faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good expose of the Messianic/J4J Cult","review":"As a Jewish person active in Zionism and Anti Missionary efforts, I quite enjoyed this book. The author is a former cult member/victim of Mity Mo (Moshie Mosen) and his J4J cult. Although she does not go into the detail I would have favoured, she does a good job exposing the lies, brainwashing techniques and other efforts they use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Personal story","review":"I have read excerpts from this book on the net. It is surprising to me that anyone would get involved in such an idiotic cult, but I think it takes a certain kind of person to be so deprived personally as to join any sort of cult.Her story would only be interesting to anyone who has been approached by a cult, and having volunteered at an Outreach Center for people who were involved in such religious cults, I can tell you it does go on and damages a lot of people. Some come out in need of psychiatric treatment, because of the threats of their future trip into hell. Like any cult, they are indoctrinated, watched, their schedules made up for them. No rest, decisions made for them, no independence from dawn till dusk. If they are there for a while, they get paid to be leaders. These cults are not religious, they are businesses. No question about it.There is, on the Internet many more stories about such events at a website called Ex-Jews for Jesus. Very interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused mishmosh","review":"This book is a travesty. None of Ellen Kamentsky's claims are remotely proven in this book.

The rhymes are not the most lyrical but JayDee, T3, and Baatin knows how to keep the vibe going with their harmonous, sing-songy soulful hooks, and their braggadocious rhymes, matching the beats.

Labeled as the future \\"A Tribe Called Quest\\", it's not hard to tell that they were influenced by Tribe, but they are not trying to be Tribe. And that is a good thing.

I was delightfully surprised to discover that unlike many writers in the murder, mayhem and mystery genre, McGarrity didn't slipslide at all into the murky depths of horrifying psychotic evil, gratuitous garbage-language,-sex,-blood,-gore and cruelty, and wallow there for several hundred pages.He wrote a book about a psychotic killer, yes, but he didn't allow his writing to sink to the level of the killer. It's a very good book with breadth and depth even with a \\"less-is-more\\" control over the verbiage, which I like and respect. His story line and characters are engaging. The mystery is compellingly presented.

Not everyone dies, but there is a lot of death. Within barely 100 pages, there were already three human deaths and two dead animals. By the end of the book, there were so many deaths past and present that I was immune to it. That's not really a good thing. The book dragged quite a bit. I frequently put it down and really felt no need to get back to it. The narrative seemed disjointed; there was just too much going on. The climax was very anti-climatic. It seemed more like an afterthought to the story. There was a lot of buildup, but not much pay-off. I do like the characters of Kevin Kerney and his wife Sara. There is good character development throughout the series. I have liked the Kevin Kearney series in the past and wanted to like this one, but this just was not as good as the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, terrible ending","review":"I have read and enjoyed many books by this author.

There are tantalizing strains of social and emotional conflict begging to be developed! Excessive use of force by police who are dealing with violent mentally disturbed persons, with all sides well meaning and trying to do their best, is one. Complex relationships between married law enforcement agents, father/son law enforcement agents, is another.The plot is fascinating and complex.And then? An ending which pulls the rug out from under you and makes you wonder if this was just a half finished book rushed into production.

It is my personal favorite, not because it so so outstanding technically, but because it strikes a chord. He, waiting through a thunder and lightening storm on the observation deck, watching every elevator door open, she, looking up, then the squeal of tires, you know she's been hit, but it's left to your imagination-aah, that's what good story telling is all about. I have been on many cruises and it never fails that when I hear the ship's horn blow, I think of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr with Little Grandma, and how she looked pained every time she heard it, knowing it would soon be time for her dear Nickolo to leave.

In that story the characters talked about the An Affair To Remember and the tragic meeting at the Empire State Building and the love affair that almost never happened. Of course, those who know Sleepless In Seattle realise that a lot of its story comes straight out of An Affair To Remember! Although I like both stories, An Affair to Remember has more depth than Sleepless. The sophistication of Cary Grant with the devil-may-care attitude makes a lot of the movie and the twist with the love of a woman who never turns up for their date, months after they have met. It is a good story!The disc itself is great too. The picture quality on Blu-Ray is very good and majority is very sharp. The extras on Blu-Ray include Cary Grant's life along with interviews of people who knew him, lived with him or were friends. Overall a very good disc and one to bring out for a romantic night with a partner.

Did they really fall in love on the ship? Could have fooled me. Some \\"love affair\\" to \\"remember\\". I think I'd have forgotten it the second I left the ship.

I love romantic comedies and am a big Cary Grant fan, but I have to give this one star. Take a close look at the acting - and listen to the dialog of the characters. The scenes with the grandmother and with the children singing are especially toe-curling, even for a sentimental person like me. Ugh. I'll now give my DVD away to some deserving romatic soul. I am glad I finally have seen this classic film - since it's a film that so many love. I do like the song, which was nominated for an Oscar - it didn't win, but it's still a good song.

I watched it ~because~ I was in the mood for a sentimental, romantic film. And I mean old-fashioned, 1950s, simple and sentimental.This movie is a dog. Deborah Kerr is a dog! There is no magic. And then, 2/3 or the way through it turns to bathos. I turned if off while Deborah was leading her music class. Obviously, the star-crossed lovers had a reunion upcoming, but I did not care to see it.This film makes me think that maybe the cultural rebels of the 60s had a point...a notion that I do not readily concede."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no! Not the St. Cliche Singing Cherubs!!!","review":"What an incredible waste this films turns out to be.

When the six months are over, Nick waits for Terry to show up, but a tragic misfortune occurs and she is unable to make it. Nick, not knowing what happened to Terry, assumes she changed her mind about them being together.

I was told it was a \\"tearjerker\\" and that it would reduce me to marshmallow status. Bleh. While I enjoyed the first half (on the ship), I found the attempted sentimentality to be a bit much. And those warbling kids? Ugh. What trite garbage. The ending seemed forced and, in my opinion, leaves you hanging (does she walk again, or not? does he stay with her or not?). The entire scene with the grandmother... what was the point of THAT? Just a tacked-on excuse for overindulgence in quasi-sentimentality. Boring. I was very very disappointed in this movie... especially considering how much hype it gets (a lot, considering the fact that it's over 40 years old).

And most of our favorite romance films are older than this one! The movie was ok, but it was too drawn out. And that scene at the grandma's house? Too long and too corny!

It's hard to believe this made #5 on the AFI-Passions listing -- one might argue that any movie that hints of a romance should have made it, too, as a result.The two musical interludes featuring a singing Terry (Deborah Kerr) and kids were really unnecessary -- did she still think that she was Anna from 'The King And I?'This movie's achievement is that it is the ancestor of contemporary schmaltzy fare such as 'Sleepless In Seattle' and 'Serendipity.'

The first part is pretty good, but as soon as they hop off the boat in NY it goes bizarro. For the life of me, I can't understand why she would keep from finding him after the accident. If she really loved him, how could she stay away? Through that whole last part of this movie I kept asking my wife to explain it. If it pride it was pretty stupid. Oh, and let's not forget the singing! What were they thinking?? I don't get it! All those annoying singing segments.For me, even if you take out the singing and the crazy last part, there is still something missing. It's just a weak story that is saved only by the greatness of Cary Grant.I read it is a classic, but not for me.

The main character Annie is not your typical erotica heroine in search of a good time with a big dick or two.

Add some unforgetable second characters, Brad (an ex-prostitute), Tom (Annie's ex-lover), and Angelika (a co-worker and drag queen) to Annie's strange mixture of fantasy and reality and you've got all the makings of a first-rate novel.I've read 10 other Black Lace books and this is definitely the cream of the cream, though I enjoyed the other works as well, especially Emma Holly's.

The sex scenes are not especially steamy, and there are too few, also - the author's attempt at turning her erotica into a work of literature was lost in the process. The author is obviously a well read woman, but - couldn't naturally make her characters appear to be so (as I believe she had attempted to do).

She was magical. I started reading about her, I now own 50 biographies on her, she became my movie obsession. I am now missing only one movie of hers which has never come out in vhs or dvd...that is the Torrent. I have seen it once on TCM and next time it airs I will tape it. The one concern that I have with this dvd is, it will only play on a dvd player, not a dvd recorder. So I have to play it on my computer and not on my big screen tv.

Otherwise, avoid it at all costs. The original Tommy was a masterpiece of simplicity. Besides some horn overdubs, it was basicially the Who and nothing else. Here, Pete Townshend throws in cheesy synthesizers and absolutley ruins the music. It doesn't help that there are people on here who have no business singing Who songs (the aformentioned Reed and Margret, plus Jack Nicholson). There are a few good moments, however. Eric Clapton's \\"Eyesight To The Blind\\" is in some ways superior to the Who's version, \\"Sparks\\" is pretty good, and the new version of \\"I'm Free\\" rocks.

The illustrations, ranging from line drawings to wonderfully Psychedelic Sixties from artists such as Beatle John Lennon to Peter Max add a touch of whimsical charm to the written lyrics. The songs are not arranged in alphabetical order or chronological order, which gives the entire book a free-formless and free-flowing feel.I was highly displeased that Harrison and Starkey tunes were not included; rather, this book should have been more aptly titled \\"Illustrated Lyrics of Lennon & McCartney.\\" There is just no excuse for omitting masterpieces such as \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" to name three.As much as I enjoyed the book, the omission of Harrison and Starkey and the seemingly random placement of song lyrics has cost this otherwise excellent book one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nudity inside","review":"I ordered the book for my teen aged son who has been a Beatles fan for years (I got him hooked!)

How can such a great song writer be such a terrible poet? It didnt make sense to me because I equate both those processes to be one and the same. I found her skill at writing these poems minimal, most of her content childish and amateurish. They lacked not only alot of emotional depth, but maturity.Granted Ashanti is no Maya Angelou, but she's not an elementary school kid either, that is, it is the level her work can be compared to. I felt like I was reading the work of a fourth grader, if it wasnt for the content.I love Ashanti, but I dont love this work.

Yeah, Ashanti remembers a bunch of ludicrious high school crap, but she seems to have learned only one lesson, which could have easily been brought across in one sentence: \\"Damn, I had a lot of boyfriends!\\"In addition to the inane anecdotes, there are her horrendous \\"lyrics,\\" characterized by her marked inability to rhyme.

Then it goes into an analysis of the relationship that inspired this love she seemed to be made to feel. Little poems on teen loves is nice to read if you are the person who wrote them and want to go down memory lane (and laugh), but it is not worth publishing in a book.

Perhaps I could find it in her \\"phenomenal\\" writing skills. Yet, just like her songs, her poems lack sophistication and depth. They are always about the same old topic: \\"ups and downs of love.\\" She might as well put her song lyrics (from her debut album) in the book and called it poetry. The grammar and the structure of the stanzas seem to reflect \\"elementary school\\" level poetry. Despite my negative comments, I must give her credit though for having the courage to publish her poetry. All she needs is a bit more inspiration and maturity in order to become the true artist she was meant to be. She has wonderful potential, unfortunately, its being channeled in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was complete garbage.","review":"This book was the worst thing I have ever read in my life.

This is the kind of movie that makes you wish that more prisoners could have escaped and even more could have gotten home.Based on the true story of the mass escape of 76 POW's from Stalag Luft III in March of 1941. Using bare hands and homemade tools, the prisoners built tunnels, made passports, and achieved something almost unimaginable...right under the nose of German guards...they design and executed one of the most daring escapes of WWII.This movie had so many big named stars working together to re-create this historical moment. Even while writing this, I can hear the baseball hitting the wall as Capt. Virgil Hilts, Steve McQueen, sits out his time in the 'cooler'. Filled with pathos, humor and joy, this is a movie experience not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superstar Steve Mcqueen in \\"The Great Escape!\\"","review":"Captain Virgil \\"The Cooler King\\" Hilts With 17 escape attempts, 1 full escape, and the only escapee not massacred, is by far the the best POW escapee in existance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad DVD Mastering","review":"Do NOT buy this movie. It says 'Widescreen', but it is not anamorphic. This means that it shows very badly on my 16:9 screen, there's not only black bars on the top & bottom, but also on the left & right. In fact, there's more black on the screen than movie. Very bad and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT based on the true story.","review":"Impossible to rate, as it is a very entertaining movie, but is NOT based on the book. It is a hollywood hype of a true story, reduced to a pathetic star vehicle for a hot actor (of the time) on a motorcycle... There was no 'cooler king' in the book, no motorcycle, and it was largely a commonwealth do.... Very few yanks involved in it. A sad and dishonest treatment of an utterly incredible story.If you want an entertaining movie, this is a good one. If you want the true story, buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a Remake...","review":"The movie has too many modern day problems...back in the early film-making days they could get away with alot of situations in war movies that are far removed from what we know to be true. Its a Hogans Heroes approach to comedy and light-hearted nature in a WW-II POW camp...far from realistic. The politics inside the camp play out on an unbelievable level.Steve McQueen's early days are captured, and his gritty performance is a notable standout among a star studded cast.Want a POW movie...get \\"Bridge On The River Kwai\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo dull","review":"Almost three hours is way too long to watch a bunch of guys did dirt out of a tunnel and wander around a prison yard to the tune of incessant patriotic music. I tried my best, but I just could not get through this movie. My great escape was to turn it off, put it back in it's case and give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"lovable ww2 adventure","review":"Plenty of famous actors, I liked Bronson in this one. McQueen drew a laugh with his macho act and baseball glove.Biggest problem in this film was that it had the balls to say it actually happened in real life. This preposterous claim is made right at the title as the film starts. Other than that, grab a six-pack and settle in for three hrs of crazy stuff, almost like an extended sitcom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Old Movie","review":"So many great actors in this flick. This is a must see. The story is engaging and the acting superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get better","review":"I see there are some who criticize the historical accuracy and the fact that there are some comic moments in the film. Of course some of them are the kind of people who take the other side of an argument just because they think that makes them appear more intelligent (it doesn't) Even POWs found humor at times. Helped them stay sane. Who cares if the escapees were really all British or the characters are composites of there really wasn't a motorcycle rider. This is a story about man's indomitable spirit--that there are always some people who will not go quietly into the night. The movie may take liberties with the book but it captures the essence of that literary work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good transfer picture","review":"I bought this DVD for my widescreen tv and was expecting it to be a decent picture and it was the first DVD I had to return because the picture was absolutly horrible. It was as good as any VHS tape I've seen and I wouldn't suggest those who have bigger screen tv's to get this DVD untill MGM decides to transfer it right.Even with a proscan DVD player it had terrible contrast lines and wasn't even imroved when trying to adjust. The \\"very long\\" letterbox format on this one makes the black bars on the top and bottom over power the entire screen. Believe me, there are many DVD Trtansfers in letterbox that are done capturing the entire 2:35:1 letterbox format correctly and MGM should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a horrible transfer of a great classic movie.I will awaite untill they re-do this one and suggest those with big tv's to pass on this one even if you feel you must have it in your collection.

Only McQueen could give such an easy presence on the screne. His performance as a typical American is worth all the other excellent performances in this film combined. There is not an actor today that conveys the respect and admiration that he is able to through his characters. As far as the movie is concerned, it was not memorable. Don't get me wrong, the plot, story, and acting are all great. As a WWII movie goes this is excellent. However, others have been done better (Dirty Dozen, Private Ryan). It is McQueen's and everyone elses performances that make the film worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quality is great because the movie is great.","review":"I wish the geeks would stop droning about digital transfers and 5.1 audio. This generation is bereft of character and these kind of reviews underscore it. I first watched this movie as a kid in the early '70s on a color TV with a bad tube that made everything green and gave everyone a shadow and if that was as good as the quality of the DVD was I'd still watch it! Who cares about the technological aspects of this character driven movie about human suffering and self sacrifice for the greater good of mankind when threatened by a freedom robbing tyrant? This is a story about a group of men working against an enemy that was threatening to enslave the world and they were willing to do whatever it took to thwart and confound that enemy with a cunning never before seen and at great loss of life. This movie is not about anamorphic digital transfers or those who care about such things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this: Complete Score Available","review":"This is a very truncated version of the soundtrack, essentially the original 1963 record album.

Brits, Yanks, and Poles are portrayed. The ingenuity of these men is remarkable, but you have to figure they're all fliers, many were engineers and professionals in fields ranging from photography to tailoring. Given enough time they were able to construct amazing tunnels with barely anything.A great World War 2 film, shot in 1960s Germany. Intriguing characters, great storyline, and unbelievable feats of bravery, brains, and bravado. Highly suggested if you're looking for an intelligent action-drama.-- JJ Timmins"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve McQueen's Best Film!","review":"Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and other actors did an excellent job acting in \\"The Great Escape\\". The movie is based on a true story about several hundred Allied POWs planning a mass escape from a German concentration camp. The DVD has an adequate picture and sound quality. There's only one extra on this DVD and that is the 24-minute documentary. I suggest you see \\"The Great Escape\\" right away, if you have not seen it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If there were six stars available....","review":"...this would be one of the very few movies to receive them.

'The Great Escape' is a interesting film that has an excellent cast. It is well paced for a film almost three hours long and when it gets going it's worth the wait! Sure there are a few minor bumps in this prison war movie, but it is still very engrossing today.It won't take long before you realize this is where they got the idea for 'Hogan's Heroes'. Any film with McQueen, Garner, Bronson and Coburn in it has to be pretty good..... right? I have the older special edition which looks pretty good, but the extras are trailers and a 24 minute documentary. If you're a fan of this film it's probably worth the upgrade to the new 2 discs edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite Classic","review":"This movie stands the test of time. While it did not get much respect when it came out for some reason, according to critics. Most of Steve McQueen's movies don't stand the test, at least in my mind. This movie stands out in my mind in a long list of World War II movies. Then you have to consider the All Star cast in this movie; it can't be beat. The cast includes: James Coburn, Charles Bronson, James Garner, Steve McQueen, and a lot of famous British actors. It is truly a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"US POWs IN WWII CLASSIC!!!","review":"Steve McQueen shines in this excellent story of AlliedPOWs in a German WWII camp.

This was one of my family's favorites, though I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with really young children - safest thing is to watch it yourself first and decide if it's appropriate viewing for the ages and stages in your own family.It's the story of a maximum security prisoner of war camp. Allied prisoners are pulled from camps all over the place into \\"one basket. And [they] intend to watch that basket very carefully.\\" The prisoners scheme, dig, bribe, and blackmail all for one spectacular escape. You'll come to know a handful of the prisoners very well, which only makes it hurt worse when they face the consequences of being recaptured.

I never new a Steve McQueen movie could be so overrated until I saw this. I had never seen the movie until last week, and boy was I dissapointed. All these years of hearing and reading all the hype, for nothing. I admit I was convinced it was good even before I saw it, again, I was wrong. It is not that thrilling or suspensfull. I know it was based on the true story, and I admire the real POWs for everything they endured, but this movie does them a disservice by trying to make it funny at times. Not admirable. Don't waste your money, just rent it if you want to see it. Forgetable after its over and done with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jingo","review":"This flick is like a prequel to \\"Hogan's Heroes.\\" The Allied POWs are plucky, cocky and handsome.

Now, 34 years later, this movie still moves me in ways I can not explain. I have seen some of the reviews on here about what list it should be on or how dare compare it to some of the great war movies. Well for me this movie is so great because of the characters, the will to not be defeated, and the committment made on behalf of a lot of people. The details may be a little off but everytime I have seen this movie (up to viewing number 40 I suspect) I come away with a sense of being there with those brave men and pulling for them each time to make it out.

Anyhow this is one of Georges Delerue's most sought-after scores and perhaps represents him at his musical peak.

Eric Flint managed suck any life the new characters had out of them while at the same time destroying the essences of the old favorites, Raj and Center.While this may bear the caption (book 8) of the series it truly doesn't belong.

The book takes a stab at portraying the fall of the Roman Empire. But instead of Rome, the scene is the distant planet of Hafardine, and instead of Caesar and Brutus, the cast include Verice Demansk, a lunky bloke with a flair for the officious, and his network of friends, family and foul-smelling enemies. I don't mean to belittle the plot. My main problem with this book is that it's sci-fi by committee. The characters are introduced and forgotten as quickly as last year's reality show. And the stilted language of our heroes - by the gods! - is enough to give anyone a punishing headache. Perhaps \\"The Tyrant\\" would have been less tyrannical had the book been about 200 pages shorter.

He is a sensitive and intuned personality. To know him is to love him and appreciate his insightful preaching, his wonderful (albeit corny) sense of humor and his gift for seeing a sermon in everything! Maximizing Your Edge is simply a culmination of where Pastor Watson has come from and what he's learned on the journey to where he's headed. I thank God that I've been privileged to watch him travel the road for the past 16 years. Pastor, its all good, and I'm sitting on anticipation boulevard for the books to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Blessing ( A Tool We All Can Use)","review":"This work of art is truly a gift of God.

I simply CAN'T remember anything about this wretched book other than its remarkable level of wretchedness. To some -- and you know who you are -- it may seem as if I am engaged in some kind of vendetta against this book and Thackeray in general.

I Read it out of order not realizing it was a series, but now will order the rest of the books. Not a fantasy book - there is no magic which makes it more believable than other books on the same subject. The early books of the series are entertaining and provide an explanation how all the things in the Arthur legend came about. This book starts out at least one generation before Arthur is born. Just because Arthur is not around though doesn't take anything away from this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book","review":"I'm afraid that I will have to go against the other reviewers of this novel and say that I wasn't greatly impressed. I found it pretty slow moving with weak and unconvincing characters and it was a definite struggle to finish. It would have to rate as just about the least interesting \\"Arthur\\" story that I have ever read.I was also irritated by the historical inaccuracies. Some examples: the battle of Adrianople took place in 378AD and not 376AD, the macedonian phalanx was an infantry formation, not a cavalry one, the Roman short sword was a gladius, not a gladium.Having said all this, I will probably read at least one more of this series but this is no longer a high priority."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke","review":"Nice idea but the story, characters, and how they interact are unbelieveably ridiculous.

How can The Colony hide? There must be well over 3000 people, apparently better armed than anyone else in the district, and yet they are so sneaky no on realizes that they are there. On top of this the writing comes from the \\"one damn thing after another school\\"; there is no organic plot flow, but only happenstance strung together hamfistedly, with occaisional perverse sex scenes to spice matters up. The man must still be writing more because, even after two books, he has yet to introduce Arthur. I fear the page when the king appears..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb historical take on the Arthurian legend","review":"This is volume two of a series that puts the legend of King Arthur into an historical perspective. There are other books or groups of books that have attempted this, most notably Mary Stewart's Merlin Chronicles - but Stewart never painted her picture with as big a brush as Jack Whyte does, and (so far at least) Whyte has done it without a hint of magic or any other type of fantasy.This is not intended as a slap at Stewart; I think her series is fantastic. It's just that I never thought it was possible to tell the story of Arthur and Merlin from a \\"human\\" point of view, until now. Whyte has proved that it's possible. So far I've only read the first two books in the series (\\"The Skystone\\" and this one), and if the rest of Whyte's novels are as superbly intelligent and well-written as these two I believe that Mary Stewart has some serious competition on her hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Whyte Is The Master","review":"Mr. Whyte is the master in writing about the medival world...he is informative while writing page turning historical fiction.

I've passed all the books on to my grandson. I wish there were more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The Singing Sword is a valiant but misinformed attempt to place the Arthurian legend within the transitional period as the Roman Empire withdraws from northern and western Europe. One of the biggest disappointments is the essential premise of the book: \\"we need a sword for use from horse back.\\" The protagonist spends an entire volume \\"inventing\\" something the Roman cavalry alae had been using for centuries. Just as the Roman infantry had adopted the short gladius or \\"spanish\\" sword during the conquest of Spain. The \\"spatha\\" or long sword, adopted from the Gauls, had been adopted as a standard cavalry weapon by Rome long before. So the protagonist had but to ask his Celt friends for a sword to model his upon.

Although it is great to have a history of our sport, the author continually qualifies any positive aspects of Bob Hoffman with \\"He did it for his ego alone.\\" There are enough inaccuracies that I am sure of that I have to question the accuracy of the entire text.

John Fair has thoroughly researched the Hoffman era and exposed the good and bad side of many of the personalities. For anyone who was active in weightlifting during this period, there are numerous familiar names and anecdotes.

That's besides the point. I do agree with an eariler review that some of the new music, used I assume, to avoid hefty payments to the copyright holders of the original music, isn't as good as the music originally used in the online series. As for the animation, sound quality, etc., it is still all up to snuff and the extras bring a valueable insight into the creation of the series (the awesome \\"Dead on Arrival\\" trailer, especially). All in all, this product is well worth its weight in gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authors do not know the computer industry","review":"The authors are PH.D. economists, but obviously do not know how the computer industry works. I've been in the industry over 40 years and had to deal with the IBM and Microsoft monopolies. Much of the text deals with dead issues like Beta vs. VCR and QWERTY vs. Dvorak keyboards. If you are interested in these topics, the material is complete.The rest of the book is a defense of Microsoft and tells us that Microsoft is a success because of the quality of their software.

I was expecting to find something perhaps childish and a little corny, but to my surprise, it's very funny--in fact, it holds up very well and is quite entertaining for everyone, not just the kids. Actually Ed can be quite frisky. The comedy is great for all the family, but I have to admit the show is always at it's best when Mr Ed is in the scene. It loses something when there is too much human interaction and Ed is out of the picture. Mr Ed was truly one of a kind and that voice fit him perfectly.

This is a wonderful survey of the great comic book heroes by a writer who clearly knows and loves these characters. The superheroes become parables for exploring themes in Christian faith and life. For instance, Superman is a savior figure sent from above; the Hulk is a frightful picture of sin gone amok; and Spider-Man offers a model for using our gifts to make a better world. Every page of this book offers a new insight; espcially good are the chapters on Capt. America and Green Arrow.Buy this book for any comic book reader on your list, Christian or not. They'll love the writing and the gorgeous artwork. And for any Sunday School teacher, youth pastor or Youth Group leader, this book is a must for connecting with teens and young adults.

If you need a superhero, you certainly can find one in the comics, and you certainly can find virtue and vice there, but implying that 'finding what's holy' takes some sleuthing because it is hidden is just wrong. Implying that it is hidden suggests that the you are going to need the writer's interpretation, when in fact it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what is going on in a comic strip, and the author's perspective is pretty skewed.For example, the author claims that more and more school sports events are being deliberately scheduled on Sundays in order to break up Christian families and their worship schedules. Does the author not know that other faiths worship on Saturdays and that there are only two days in a weekend? Think 'Lebensraum', and the rest is history.Anyone who is as shamelessly self-centered as this does not deserve a soapbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed hero","review":"This is not what I expected. I actually threw the book in the trash. I was looking for a book that would be able to use for children especially little boys to help develop good heroes. This book is intended for adults but I wasn't impressed there either. I read some and not how I would present the subject. I think I get what the author was trying to say.

With a solid group of misican to support him, and a lot of well known songs,they let you know rock and roll, is really Ronnie Wood. As a whole with this recording, they keep each other tight and on key. they're letting the music flow, all while having a good time. Having given creation to \\"it's only Rock and roll\\", Silicone Grown plus others,you can tell his soul is in all of them. Here it becomes clear he is one of only a few, really execptionally talented musicians of our time. Never being the front man on vocals,his gravel voice on this set brings a real feeling to the stage. When he's on lead vocals or backing Bernard you know he's into the music, and when he's on fire, he's on fire! I've been to a number of his shows, with the Faces, the stones, his gun slinger tour with BO Didley and slide on this tour, he still show he's real and he can rock. If your a Faces or stones fan this set of music should be in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hup\\" by The Wonder Stuff","review":"Well written songs delivered with attitude laced vocals make this a winning effort from The Wonder Stuff. Ranging from quasi-funk workouts to classic Brit Pop, \\"Hup\\" makes for enjoyable listening. Full and varied production touches like added banjo and violin help to round out the sound.Brit Pop fans should find this worth their time. The best songs on \\"Hup\\" (\\"Radio [...]\\", \\"Don't Let Me Down Gently\\" and \\"Cartoon Boyfriend\\")would nicely fit on a compilation disc between The Soft Boys and Oasis. Good company, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous!","review":"This stuff is fabulous. I'm Chinese and have used this brand for years.

They had it priced at $999 which seems to be some sort of price fix since, no matter where I look, including Amazon, the price is the same. At that price this furniture is absolutely in the realm of the ridiculous. Adding further insult injury is the fact that you have to actually put this stuff together yourself. At half the price I would probably have given this 4 stars since it seems to be designed well. The rear panels, for example, can easily be removed for access to your video or audio equipment. Some of the materials, especially the perforated steal inserts, seem somewhat cheap. The rest of the materials that make up the stand are just OK.If you are looking to buy an item like this in this price range I suggest you look at a fine furniture store that discounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undescovered Gem!!","review":"Alas just as my vinyl LP has worn a hole I discover a full version of one the best, underappreciated and frankly endiscovered gems of the British Invasion version 2.0!!

We got them for her when she was around 12-mo old and she's almost 2-yrs old and still loves them.Two cons (if you can even call them that!):1. They are thin enough to slide under our refrigerator and stove2. The box has a thin plastic (useless) top...but really they are magnets and are stored on the fridge (not in a box)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to give a toddler something to do in the kitchen","review":"My 19 month old liked these magnets right away. They are very nice quality and easy for small hands to grab and stick on the fridge. I have appreciated having a kitchen activity to keep a toddler occupied for a while as I'm making dinner.

The animal illustrations are really nice. However, I was expecting magnets made of wood. The core is wood, but the face is paper, which comes off. Disappointing. Also, the wooden box they come in has no lid, so is pretty useless for storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Chewers!!","review":"I was very excited about buying these. My son loves magnets and I thought this would be a great way to teach him about animals. They are great looking BUT I wish they were more heavy duty. They are essentially a magnetic backing with a layer of wood in the middle. On top of that is a paper picture and a thin laminated plastic layer on top. Not good for kids who like to put things in their mouths. In a matter of moments without much effort at all he had chewed off the turtles face. Now I find myself trying to keep them away from him which no fun for him or me :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy paper pictures","review":"First, our 15 month old daughter has enjoyed playing with these for the day she's had them.

The magnet covers the entire animal, so no concern with it not sticking to the fridge. Also, the pictures are more realistic instead of cartoonish. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because a few of the animals are small, and we were concerned they may be a choking hazard for our 1 year old. Also, the magnets are wood with the animal picture glued to the front. If your child likes to put everything in their mouth(like ours does), or if these get wet (dropped in the dog's water bowl), then it will mess up the picture of the animal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality item and Fun for the kids!!","review":"I was surprised to see the nice quality of this item.

After speaking with a specialist, about some suggestions to help with our daughters speech, she said magnets were a huge help! Well, if she wasn't right on the money!!! We point to the animals and say what they are and what sounds they make....for the first time ever she said, \\"Meow\\"!!!, after asking her, \\"what does the kitty say?\\" Yes, we also meet with a speech therapist once a week...and maybe this is more information that some folks need, but for those of you whose child is on the spectrum, this has been a really positive reinforcement, doesn't cost a lot, and watching your child smile and clap because things are starting to make sense, is worth every penny!!!

The book is not well written. It is actually a tougher read than the original. It lacks pace. It is historically unsound (see first review by teenage student of history). But there are moments when an atmosphere is created which, on reflection, is stolen from the original. I had to force myself to read it as part of a list of books I wish to cover. I think the writer knew nothing of Thailand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but lies and fabrications and extremely upsetting to the Thais","review":"Thais have been outraged by the lies of Anne Leonowens for decades, since her 'books' were published and the first movie 'The King and I' came out.Leonowens stories were nothing but that, 'stories'. She barely met the King of Siam, as a woman of her stature (a lowly governess) would never have been allowed the access to the King she says she was given. King Mongkut was a highly-educated monarch, who knew more about foreign policy and diplomacy than most people in this era. In fact, Anna Leonowens was no more influential with King Mongkut than I am with Queen Elizabeth. She was just a good fiction writer.That Thais are not featured in the movies (in the latest one, the main actor is Chinese) says a lot about the validity of the information, and that both movies are banned in Thailand, where Thais revere King Mongkut and King Chulalongkorn.Worthless reading if you want to actually learn something about the history of Thailand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure fantasy mascarading as history","review":"To call King Mongkut a bloodthirsty tyrant much less a barbarian not only slanders his memory but downright belittles his legacy. As if only Christian western culture has a monopoly on virtue, the book only pictures the king as a lusty womanizer. Never mind the fact that he could have been king at a much earlier age, he chose instead to become a buddhist monk to live a life of poverty and celibacy for more 20 years where he witnessed first hand the suffering of his people and became familiar with western ways. Would our own president or even Gandhi have his restraint we would have elevated them to sainthood instead of being maligned and slandered as Ms Langdon and to much greater extent Mrs. Leonowens had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return, don't return just STAY!","review":"I'm Brasilian, so I'll try!

I finally gave up on the idea of a conveniently delivered item and purchased the same item from Ace Hardware. Reasonably attractive and easy to install, you save money on the extra stuff you need (wax ring, bolts, etc.) that come with this package.The performance of the 1.6 gallon flush is disappointing. The toilet fails to clear itself, even under reasonable demand, about 50% of the time. Keep a plunger handy.If I had it to do over again, I'd recommend researching toilets first and ordering one that is reported to flush effectively. Also, do that and then check Craig's List for your area. Toilets are fairly often offered there for free or for good prices. A little more trouble, but you may well save yourself some money.As for ordering it here, I can't recommend that. True, roads are bumpy where I live, but the packaging was insufficient.

Within 20 pages one of the characters (in present-day Texas) is talking about the \\"barbaric Indians\\" \\"In our wisdom, we exterminated them\\" (verbatim quote). I got over halfway through it and every chapter was just another description of another generation's holocaust of Indians. First it talks about how the Spaniards came (Texas originally being part of Mexico) and killed some Indians. Then it describes families moving from Germany killing Indians. Then it describes families from Scotland, making a pit-stop in Ireland (Scots-Irish Americans) and coming to Texas to kill Indians. Then it talks about families from Illinois and Kentucky moving south... to kill Indians. 500 pages in but only halfway done, I'd had enough of this garbage.

It does get a bit tedious at times, but the book is very good and it's worth persevering with it. I don't know what our reader from Denmark was thinking, but the book is certainly not dreadful. I found the history of this state totally fascinating, and it felt like I was there when Texas was just coming into being I felt like one of those intrepid settlers that were responsible for making Texas a state. I would like to visit this state sometime because it has a great history. The story was good and the characters strong. I especially liked the story about the Alamo.

Their opinions are certainly valid, and I wouldn't quibble with them, but I thought \\"Texas\\" was Michener's best fiction (\\"Iberia\\" is his best book) that I've ever read.The history of the state was fascinating and well-balanced. The characters were more likable than in most of his books (except maybe \\"Chesapeake\\"). The book certainly is long even by Michenerian standards, but it never became tedious in the way \\"Alaska\\" did.I think anyone who reads this book will be delighted by the magnificent effort Michener must have put into writing this. It's fun; it's fascinating; it's beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nausea","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I can't believe that the author of \\"Centennial\\" and \\"Tales of the South Pacific\\" could put his name on such dreck.The problem lies in its unremitting bias, manifesting itself as intellectual contortions in the cause of presenting everything Texas in its best possible light.

It was informative and educational without being dull or preachy, and made me genuinely interested in the characters - both the historical and the fictional ones. Also made me a bit homesick.... all in all incredibly entertaining!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Another strong multi-generational effort by Michener, capturing the essence of Texas through the eyes of the people who settled it. The very best part of the book traced the life of Otto McNab, the central character, as the events and the nature of his home shaped his thoughts, feelings and his life. This is Michener at his best. I thought the book got a bit boring towards the end, a little drawn out and dry as it entered the modern era, which is why I rate it 8 and not 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! I Learned So Much About Our State","review":"Michener has a great way to recount history in story-like prose. I learned a lot about Texas; what a neat story about how this state came to be. Michener tells it like he thought it was; the good and the bad. This book should be mandatory reading throughout high schools in Texas.The book is long and a bit slow to read.

However, check the dimensions---- it's about the size of my hand! It's not suitable as a coffee-table book sort of gift, which was the original purpose of my purchase. Unfortunately the small size detracts from the stunning beauty of the pictures. To maximize the size of the pictures, the images bleed to the edges of the pages--- giving them no visual frame. In a larger book this could be striking but in such a small book it's distracting. It's just too small to do the pictures justice.

About 250 photos are included, and usaully, one photo will cover too pages.But I have a complaint. Most photos are not the original. The editor cut the edges, and only show the \\"main\\" part of the photo in this book. This causes two problems. First, I believe that when the photographer took the photo, he/she has special purpose for framing. Different photographer has different style. But now, the style of all photos look consistent!!!

The violence aside, I think he intended it as an amusing piece of fluff in the adventure genre, and that is certainly is.He has presented a colourful, overblown group of characters with little complexity, playing out an unlikely sequence of events in an exotic setting, well described.

First off the acting, writing, and action are all top notch. It is just as good as the film it is based on \\" The Seven Samurai\\" by Akira Kurasawa. Yul Bryner and Steve Mcqueen are the stars along with a super lineup including Charles Bronson and James Coburn. The music is fantastic, it propells the film to even higher heights. Not only is this a great western but it also has touches of human emotions(especially by Bronson)that tug at your heartstrings and don't let go.

They say that his character's name is Chico, but I prefer to call him the \\"Stupid Kid.\\" He is the only damper on an otherwise perfect movie.

The new (2001) documentary is very good. It runs about 30 to 45 minutes with interviews with Eli Wallach, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Horst Buchholz, the producer and the asst. director. Very interesting insights into the competition between Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and Buchholz are given. A commentary track featuring Coburn, Wallach, the producer and asst. director is included this gives even more insight into the people involved in the film however some of the comments are repeated from the documentary. The only downside to the DVD is that the picture hasn't been restored but it is adequate. The sound was a bit muted especially during dialogue. I had to have the sound turned way up. The soundtrack seemed to be fine. Overall this is a great value for the extras included."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Last Great Westerns","review":"Before the advent of the Spaghetti Western and the few good films that followed came The Magnificent Seven. The Wild Bunch, The Long Riders and several others owe their creative souls to this movie. I like Yul Brenner, if you have seen Westworld, well this is where Mr. Brenner began the character he later used in that film. Charles Bronson , Steve McQueen, Eli Wallach, what a cast! And the heroic notion of helping a village of peasants fight tyranny....what more can you ask for!? The special features, well maybe not like in some more modern videos, but it is nice to hear Eli, and James Coburn and the directors and producers wax nostalgic about said movie...I admire their acting capabilities and their knowledge of film in general, so I enjoyed this a lot. If you are a lover of the Western genre, then by all means you have to have this for your collection! And the music too. What a score!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, great music, great fun!!!","review":"A classic story that is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. The cast is incredible (except of course Horst Buchholz). Good usage of humor combined with a straight forward dialogue, kept the cornball factor to a minimum. The plot also explores the end of the era of the gunfighter and the modernization of the old west. And who could forget one of the greatest motion picture scores of all time. Elmer Bernstein's score is instantly recognizable and makes the soul soar every time we hear it!

My comments concern the DVD, it's nicely presented, with an interesting documentary and feature commentary, certainly a bargain given the incredibly low price tag.The 5.1 sound remix is excellent, but I have to say that the very obvious grain and print damage on the movie itself knocked my assessment of the DVD down from a 5 star rating to 4 stars. I realise that the movie is over 40 years old but some of the print damage in very noticeable, and given modern cleaning techniques I think it is difficult to believe that at least some effort could have been made to clean things up a bit. Having said that this DVD is still greatly superior to any VHS copy I've seen and well worth the money despite its flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, poor copy","review":"This movie has taken on a life of it's own in the years since it's release. It and \\"7 Samuari\\" are nearly manditory viewing for anyone interested in mid 20th century cinema. Given all that, AND that this is a \\"Special Edition\\", you'd think that MGM would of taken some care in picking a cleaner master to create the DVD from. I can understand the trailers being a little rough, but the main feature is grainy, with dust specs, emulsion flakes/pinholes... Not unwatchable by any means, just annoying that a movie that is this important couldn't have gotten a good going over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked beauty","review":"Seldom mentioned in discussions of \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" is the appearance of the stunning Mexican actress Rosenda Montero, the romantic interest of the character Chico.

Every one of Hollywood's actors, from Yul Brynner down to Horst, was impeccably dressed, with not a spot of dirt on their clothes, even though James Coburn spent most of his time lying in the dirt. The Mexicans must have been recruited from LA, because all of them spoke perfect English. And their clothes were spotlessly white!

I don't know where some of the 5-star ratings come from here. Perhaps my impression of this unglorious Hollywood fake is due to the fact that as a young-un in the 50's I managed to see \\"Seven Samurai\\" before seing this dreadful, dumbed-down Hollywood remake based on the original Japanese masterpiece. Or perhaps it's because I cannot -- repeat, cannot -- accept Yul Brenner as a cowboy. Or maybe it's just the soundtrack that turned me off, which sounds even worse in its digital reincarnation. The photography is a far cry from the original Oriental monochrome shot with Nikon lenses, and the actors and characters just don't have the stature of the original Samurai's. If you've never seen Seven Samurai, you might like this Technicolor forgery. But do yourself a favor and get the original Japanese version on DVD or even VHS.

As a western, this might be one of the best I've seen. Yul Brynner's presence on screen is commanding. I can see why he was later chosen for the sci-fi film, \\"Westworld\\". His supporting cast is just as outstanding. It reads like a who's who list (McQueen, Colburn, Bronson) of action films. With a powerful cast, a entertaining villan (Eli Wallach), an intriguing storyline and a beautiful Elmer Bernstein soundtrack (It makes me want to have a Marlboro cigarette, afterwards.), everything comes together.

I figure, with tongue only partially in cheek, it must subconsciously represent the American historical view of himself: Heroically riding with both guns blazing to the rescue of poor, repressed and freedom-loving people. How else could anyone overlook, on top of all the cliches in this movie, one of the silliest, dumbest sequences in the history of movie-making: The scene where Bruce (oops, James)Coburn draws from his belt, then drives his trusty knife into the fence post as he collapses, shot dead.

I shuffled each set of decks 3 times to ensure they were mixed up. This only took a matter of seconds.Sometimes some of the unshuffled cards would fall over the side (it would have been nice to have something there to prevent that) and some of the shuffled cards ended up on their side.I have no idea how durable it is.

She is homeschooled, and listened to it on her own every day (over & over) with no nagging from me. Because of the use of songs, I feel that a child who enjoys singing will gain more from this program than a child who doesn't. (most children's language programs I've found use a lot of singing) The reviewer who disapproved of the use of witches etc. in the book may not understand that the text is very *German*... I found after living in Germany that Germans have their own ideas about what is appropriate for children. (I see no point in learning a language which has been disjointed from its culture.) My daughter was 8/9 yrs of age when she used this program (cassette version) and nothing was offensive or inappropriate. All in all, a wonderful start to your child's study of German! 5 stars for being fun, easy to use, and educational.

The tea ceremony is an important part of it, e.g. the author relates the deep impressions made by tea sets on the participants (because they have hundreds of years of age and their ancestors drank already out of them).Some reactions of the main characters seemed to me exaggerated and they cried nearly on every occasion.Only for the aficionados of the Japanese novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Tone","review":"Outstanding performances of songs about or associated with New Orleans, played by cornetist Bob Barnard, pianist John Sheridan, and drummer Don Vickery. Mr. Barnard's cornet sounds clear and strong on the uptempo numbers while hinting at a softer honey-like tone on the slower ones. It's a beautiful fully matured sound that always captivates. John Sheridan stretches out and displays his mastery of the stride and swing idioms with a relaxed delivery that is unbeatable. The lesser known Don Vickery is just as fluent as his playing partners, whether he's on sticks or brushes.It's a splendid set of tunes played with eloquence and just a touch of melancholy that will stay with you long after the performance is over. Especially lingering is the tone of Bob's cornet. Beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuitable as a Textbook","review":"This book appears to be an excellent *reference* in terms of extremely detailed aspects of parallel computing architectures.However, as a textbook, it falls far short. The information presented in the text is an extremely difficult read (from a format perspective). The sample problems presented in the body of the text bear little or no relationship to the exercise at the end of each chapter. This makes it difficult or impossible to relate the exercises back to the information presented in the chapter. Since there is no answer key, you're left guessing if you've correctly answered them.I find it baffling that anyone would use this text in a college classroom since it makes little or no effort to actually *teach* the material it presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst possible book","review":"The book repeats lots of things.

Having that said, this DVD is too slow for me. She does the moves so slowly that I play it in double speed.I think this is an excellent video for newbs and people who prefer super slow training. The instructor is really good, and I understand it's better to go too slow than two fast! This is why I gave it 4 Stars.(If anyone is familiar, there is a series called Shimmy on FitTV. This is my preferred speed. It is 1-2-3-4 then 1234, whereas this video is more like 1---2---3---4 and it throws me off)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tutorial","review":"This is an excellent reference DVD for beginners. The instructions are simple and clear. Jenna then practices each move slowly a couple of times and then quickly a couple of times. This is not a good dvd for drilling the moves. Once you get the gist of the moves you will need to stop the dvd and practice to your own music. But if instruction is all you need then this is a good dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for uncoordinated beginners","review":"The other reviews have covered many of the wonderful things about this DVD - 2 1/2 hours of instruction, separate clips on arms, hips, etc, practice sessions with voice & music or music alone, the instructor faces a mirror so you can see her front and back while she's teaching a movement. All that is great. What I love about this DVD is that I am uncoordinated, and she breaks the steps down so that I can focus on just one thing - not worrying about arm movements while trying to do hip movements. Also, in doing just a few sections, I feel much more aligned (a little like after doing yoga). Definitely was worth the investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of inspiration and valuable instruction.","review":"I bought this DVD for my sister in law, who had zero experience in oriental dance.She thought the instruction was very clear and concise. Jenna explains everything she does very clear before showing it. My sister in law can't get the movements at once, so she has to stop and rewind the DVD, but we all know that bellydancing is not so easy as absolute beginners think it is. The filming and explanations are clear enough though for her to understand.I give Jenna a big plus that she talks about the risks for the spine and how important it is to use the right muscles.Another big plus for Jenna is her very sweet voice. (I had to sell a DVD of a Russian teacher because I hated her voice)So yes, not to hard, but also not to easy for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente DVD para intermedios","review":"Soy bellydancer nivel intermedio y este DVD me gusto mucho porque es una guia rapida de los pasos basicos y varias combinaciones con los mismos. La instructura es clara y facil de entender. Te enseña postura inicial, manos, brazos, hombros, torax, cadera, como caminar, luego lo combina todo y hay coreografia con movimientos de cada grupo (hombros, torax, cadera, etc...), al final hay una coreografia con todos los grupos juntos. Yo recomiendo que lo compren si tienen antes algunos conocimientos de bellydance, para las principiantes puede ser de utilidad si toman cada movimiento y lo practican muchas horas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too mechanical","review":"Belly Dancing is supposed to be very fluid. Although this is a basic instructional video, it could use some improvement. For starter's the instructor's physique doesn't demonstrate the movements with definition or fluidity. She stands in front of a mirror panel with her back to you through most of the tedious 2.5 hours of instruction. The camera doesn't offer views from different angles or even close-ups. It could use a group type setting for the very moderate 25 min \\"work out\\". The instructor's verbal delivery is sometimes disjointed and lacks luster. I've plugged it in once and am not very motivated to use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of Bang for the Buck","review":"This is an excellent DVD for a beginning belly dance student. Jenna's instructions are very clear, and the camera work and her position in a mirrored room so you can see her from two angles is very helpful. There is a lot of content on here, so it's definitely a good value. Chapters are broken down by isolations, arms, circles, etc. and those movements are taught without music. You can stop the DVD to keep practicing a move if she moves on before you're ready. But there's also a practice section where you can drill the moves w/ music and you can make the choice to have her instructions or only music. She's a very good teacher, and I'm using this to practice the basic moves in between my live classes. (My teacher says it's very important not to jump ahead to more fancy moves until the basics are drilled into your muscle memory, so I think this is a very useful practice tool.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun fun fun","review":"Being uncoordinated as I am, I have found this to be a relatively easy dance video to follow.

That's all this DVD is. I was thinking it would have a routine or the moves would build on each other, but no such luck. All you get is shown individual moves. I did the workout once when I first got it and haven't used it since. I thought it was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Gem of A Western","review":"The concept of this book is interesting, a high bred woman wrongly accused of murder is on the run and ends up kidnapped by a band of criminals, led by one of my favorite heroes ever, Macaulay Cain. He is phenomenal. My favorite part of the book is during Cristabel's captivity when Cain is her abductor. The relationship they formed was actually quite lovely considering the crazy circumstances. Once back in the 'real world' things get even more tumultuous and I absolutely LOVED how Cain was obsessed with Cristabel and would do ANYTHING to find her and get to the truth of who she was and what she was running from. He is just an all around good man, but he's no push over. I wish Cristabel would have trusted Cain sooner than she did and I wish the villain was punished a bit more for all his wrongs, but overall the book is a 5 star read for me and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic western romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit 2010 Toyota Tundra","review":"Slipped right off the filter.

Very funny and way true. I have observed my bombshell friends for years and can attest to the veracity of these observations. Let me assure the reader from Wyoming that the very first bombshell I ever new was a red-headed radical feminist with a stunning figure who wore short skirts, mules and makeup and could blow a legislator out of the water with one wink.

Each chapter details a unique characteristic of 'bombshellism'. From what a bombshell wears, reads, or listens to; to what she loves (animals), her tantrums, and even how her astrological sign affects her. What this book lacks in length, it makes up for with great sketches and name-dropping.

It seems to me that even the most deep-down, genuine bombshell (in other words, someone whose true persona fits the general \\"type\\" as opposed to someone who's studied the description and is \\"acting\\" accordingly)would have a tough time being taken seriously in real life, even if she was an easy person to like or love...and sometimes, no doubt, be maddened by! On the other hand, maybe she's the type of person who inspires other people to take care of her.Still, it was a fun book to read, with its breezy, tongue-in-cheek style. I think it must have been a fun book to write, too. And even for us non-bombshells, it gives a nice reminder to kick back sometimes and just enjoy life and our femininity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I found this book to be very enjoyable, and it gave me a lot of ideas on how to make me feel more glamorous in my everyday life (who would have thought that taking the strap off of your purse would make a difference?)

For instance, my major centered on English literature, and I wasn't too keen on taking her advice on my library! Pick and choose what will make YOU feel like a bombshell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect guide for any aspiring bombshell","review":"Are you incapable of walking in flats? Do you cry over nature shows? Do you actually wear satin babydoll pajamas without a male companion nearby? Then you just might be a bombshell.This delightful, funny, beautifully illustrated little book tells you just how to be an old-school bombshell (a la Brigitte Bardot, Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth and Elizabeth Taylor). Learn how to do your makeup, what perfume to use, what music to listen to (Sinatra, darling!), what to wear for any occasion and just what sort of bag you should be carrying. There's even a cute little quiz in the back to test your bombshell quotient.Warning: This book is unashamedly old-fashioned. If you have problems with using your sex appeal to get what you want, don't go here. Ditto if you don't like animals, if you hate skirts and if you hated the movie \\"Swingers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I Found My Inner Bombshell","review":"After going blonde recently, some co-workers dubbed me \\"the Blonde Bombshell\\", so I decided to find out what that means exactly. Well, this book showed me the stuff it takes to be a real bombshell! I began renting the old movies it makes reference to and tuning up my inner bombshell, as well as dressing the part. My boss is beginning to wonder why I no longer wear pantyhose,( but if you read the book, you'll know!) I highly recommend it for all women who have a bit of a bombshell inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know these women but never had a decent name for them.","review":"Okay, I'm jealous. I'll never be a bombshell, but at least I now smell like one. After glancing at the perfume chapter in the bookstore, I realized what fragrance was haunting me from my childhood. I immediately went out to buy it. At that point, the book was worth the money. This was a really fun read. For those women, unlike me, who aspire to be a bombshell, this book can be used as a manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the illustrations","review":"Okay, I'll come right to the point. The best thing about Bombshell is the illustrations by Rueben Toledo. He's fantastic and the Toledo girls are cuter than cute. As for the book, read it but don't take it seriously. If you try to live like this you'll end up broke or dead. Actually, as I read I couldn't help but check off in my mind how the bombshell's the book holds as ideals ended up: Marilyn-- dead in rented room, Dorothy Dandridge--- dead on the bathroom floor, Rita Hayworth--- a lifetime of misery, Ava Gardner--- a really horrible, selfish woman, Jayne Mansfield-- dead on the road and at a low point in her career where Hollywood was laughing at her, not with her, Jean Harlow-- a victim of a nightmare marriage that may have led to her death at 26--- I didn't want to relate to any of this at all!Fashion wise, if you dress like a bombshell, expect to be called into HR or fired. It's just not a practical book. Cute but useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, if you can stand the noise.","review":"I was given one of these about a year ago, I tried it briefly and it's been collecting dust in my closet ever since. It does chill wine. In fact, it does it pretty well. Unfortunately, it also has inside it a loud fan which is always on. Picture a quiet evening for two, a candlelight dinner and this gizmo sitting nearby that looks like a miniature nuclear power plant cooling tower and sounds like a hair dryer and you can see the problem with this thing. It's just too darn noisy! Also rather ugly, imo. A more pleasant solution would be to keep the wine in one of those wrap-around gel packs for chilling wine that you keep in the freezer until needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fit at a fantastic price!","review":"This is my second time ordering jeans through Amazon. My first order was also Lee Jeans (bootcut flares) and I loved them, although I ordered the wrong length. That didn't matter: they look great with high heels. LOLThis time, with the Missy Mid-Rise Bootcut Jeans, I ordered the right length. They are FANTASTIC! The fit is perfect, with no gap at the waist and no annoying pull over the thighs. The pockets are perfectly situated and just slightly tilted, which improves the \\"rear view\\" -- an added but much needed bonus in my book.I particularly like the way the \\"hand-sanding\\" gives the jeans a well-worn look on arrival. The hems look just slightly frayed, as does one seam over the coin pocket, and the sanding on the legs is very slimming.I love these jeans, and I *NEVER* thought I'd say that about jeans after I turned 18 (lo those many years ago)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee mid rise bootcut jeans","review":"These are my new favorite jeans.

I bought another color of sprinkles from a different company, paid the same price and got 16 ounces. The seller did not specify in the description how many ounces was included in the price. I took the risk because I needed the sprinkles and couldn't find them. I will know next time to ask the question before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I found this release very disappointing.Like the other reviewers, I found the sound quality awful, but my biggest disappointment was the exclusion of Marilyn's vocal rendition of the song \\"Some Like It Hot\\" that was released on a EP {extended play) when the movie first came out. Not only is it very rare {it turns up on some compilation Marilyn CD's}, but its also fun, and definately would have made this already short CD more complete and appealing. This movie soundtrack deserves better.{Added note: MGM did a superb job of their release of the soundtrack to \\"The Misfits\\", finding never before released music from the movie in their vaults and beautifully restoring it to an unbelievable sound quality. Surely they could do the same with \\"Some Like It Hot\\".??}"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite soundtracks","review":"This is an excellent soundtrack album if you love the movie (like I do!) It contains Marilyn Monroe's three musical numbers, incidental background music, and even some dialogue from the film itself. Some people have complained about the sound quality-the sound is in stereo, but it is defintely not wide-range (you can barely hear that there are two channels of sound). Other than this, the quality was pretty good. Remember that this music was recorded for use on the soundtrack of a movie, so they were not going through extra effort to make it sound better to the home listener. I am not sure whether or not the final film was mixed in stereo or not. Perhaps if someone knows for sure, they could mention it in their review (thanks!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for same sex or non-traditional couples.","review":"The authors have a heteronormative outlook and do not address same-gendered couples. Moreover, the chapter on questions related to gender uses stereotypes of men and women. For example, \\"He needs an attractive spouse\\" is listed as a gender-based need experienced by men. As for women: \\"She needs financial support\\". If these sorts of gender roles appeal to you, then the book will reinforce your views; but for non-traditional couples and pro-feminists, I recommend avoiding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for all couples, but especially newlyweds","review":"I bought this book (and many more) trying to save my marriage of 15 years. Along with Dr. Eggeriches' Love and Respect and Dobson's Love Must Be Tough, this book was among the best I've read from a practical standpoint. It offers sound advice on a wide range of marital issues and while it is geared toward newlyweds, I still took away several gems that I will put into practice daily. Drs. Parrott's books should be on every couple's must-read list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and Personal","review":"This gritty account of the Battle of the Bulge doesn't pretend to tell a comprehensive story. You feel the cold, the fear, the anxiety of the attackers and rescuers alike, the cold, the deprivations of the prisoners, the confusion, the endless jockeying for power between the American and British high command and, again, the cold. But it's the personal stories of the young grunts that make the book a page turner. Even if you already know the details of this campaign, you won't want to put the book down until you finish.The author cuts through a slice of war that is personal and compelling, and he offers several insights that may be new to many readers. My only criticism: the military maps are atrocious for the untrained public. A few good, clear maps to orient all the activity going on would have been a great help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is by far the worst book I've read on this battle.

So bad that it is the first book in my 60 years that I could not finish. Weintraub takes a scatter gun approach to telling his story - nothing is ever connected to anything else. Even worse is his smarmy use of the \\"cliff hanger\\" approach. Soldier \\"A\\" gets into a jam and instantly off we go to some other focal point of the battle. You finally return to soldier \\"A\\" many pages later - with the reader having forgotten how he got there in the first place and beyond the point of caring. And, wow, I didn't know Ernest Hemmingway played such an \\"important\\" role in the Battle of the Bulge. And probably neither did anyone else. Certainly no role rating eight pages of mention in a 180 page book. But good luck trying to find and meaningful mention of the Malmedy massacre. Skip this book.

Ivans voice is well rounded and is showcased in the prominent fashion it should be.My only word of caution is this: If you are getting this just for the Safety Dance remix - don't. It's an instrumental that leaves much to be desired. And is in all honesty, the sore spot on a rather lovely collection of music.Also...

Up until this point they churned out nothing but gold, but this, along with the almost-as-bad Sideways, were just god awful. MWH is an electropop band... this \\"album\\" has nothing resembling that... The single Hey Men was a really bad choice in the sense that it's their worst song of all time... next to 21st Century Safety Dance (which isn't really a song, but 5 minutes of fake techno and children laughing... pointless? YUP!)... It's pretty bad when their ABBA cover is one of the higher points, since most everything else is completely forgetable! Even hardcore MWH fans hate songs like Underneath The Rainbow and Eloise and I (and it's \\"intro\\" which is yet another low point on the album).

He was an agent of the Queen, cleaning up a mess that disturbed the Royal Family and therefore society. Outlining a profound and intense panorama of what it was like to live in London in the 8oies of last century, Moore shows us reasons why The Ripper was never apprehended. And so he details his vision of the 80ies as the beginning or at least a forecast of our century. If you read only this book this year, it will not be wasted. If you think comics are for kids and dyslectics - think again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Ripper and so much more!","review":"Alan Moore, simply put, is a master story teller.

The movie was true to everything I had previously read about Edie without injecting opinions or leading the viewer into an over-sentimental spin on the story. Great casting, very good script."},{"rating":"2","title":"I waited a long time for this film","review":"Ever since I read Jean Stein's fascinating biography \\"Edie\\" some 15 years ago, I've been waiting and hoping for somebody to take on this subject. And while this film does have one major disappointment (the inability to credit the Bob Dylan character as actually being Bob Dylan) Sienna Miller's performance is downright scary in it's authenticity. She completely channels Edie Sedgewick in her appearance, her voice, her spirit - it is very apparent that Ms. Miller did her homework and aced the final. In capturing that era of decadence and emotional squalor this film seems eerily precise, and it draws a very unflattering (but I think accurate) portrait of the Factory scene and Andy Warhol's role as a benign but sadistic manipulator of some very damaged people. Like it's subject, this film is sometimes hard to handle, but it has a lot to say about the nature of money, power and fame, and why having all three isn't all it's cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edie Deserves Better","review":"First off, Sienna Miller gives it a college try but she's too old for the part. For most of the arc of the story in this film, Edie's supposed to be 19-25. No way is Sienna believable as an ingenue at this point. She's got her accent down but lacks the luminosity and charm of the singular Mz. Sedgwick. Instead, she comes off as annoying.Granted, to recreate Edie and the era in which she reigned would be an extremely tall order for any film maker. Unfortunately, their efforts fall far short here.Siouxie, Brooklyn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Edie's story, without the burden of facts and complexity","review":"Short and sweet, because others have said it perfectly already, this film's grasp on Edie's story is as shallow and misguided as the average first grade student's understanding of the American Civil War. If you are hungry for Edie, turn to Jean Stein'sEdie: American Girlor David Weisman'sEdie: Girl on Fire- both great books.Taken as simple entertainment, this film is bland. Taken as a biographical film, it's downright offensive in its utter disregard for fact - made all the more baffling when you consider that the TRUE STORY IS SO MUCH MORE COMPELLING AND DRAMATIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful-","review":"Awful - awful piece about nutcase (and I mean nutcase) rich girl hanging out with the king of whack - jobs- Andy Warhol.

Yaawwwnnn."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!","review":"Even if you know nothing about the real Edie Sedgwick, this film is a hokey, cornball embarrassment that is difficult to decide whether the writing or directing is worse. If you DO know anything about the real girl or the world she lived in, you'll know this film had NOTHING to do with the real Edie, Andy, their relationship, her relationship with anyone, or anything truthful whatsoever! Where Miller does her Cockney best to play the time bomb Edie, nearly everyone else in the cast has no idea what they're doing.To wrap it up, they forgot the little scar on her nose which was crucial to her look and character having almost died in the accident which caused it, she never had an affair with Bob Dylan, and she did NOT get raped in Beauty number 2!

It was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"in all fairness,unfair to Edie Sedgwick","review":"This film is a poor portrait of the genuine article.It seems very fake . Sienna Miller is lacking the sparkling and perfectly symmetrical beauty of Edie Sedgwick, bearing no resemblance except the make-up and hairdo, mimicking Edie Sedgwick very unflatteringly.I'm waiting fro Warhol's \\"Kitchen\\" and \\"beauty\\" starring the real Edie Sedgwick.I highly discourage the purchase of this bland film, lacking in all respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Acted, Poorly Executed Film","review":"Factory Girl is a poorly executed, poorly acted film about poor little rich girl Edie Sedgwick. The socialite/drug addict who starred in Warhol films and made a celebrity splash is portrayed by Sienna Miller, who simply does not do justice to the tragic socialite. Factory Girl is a biographical film and as such is obligated to adhere to some semblance of \\"what was\\" or \\"how it happened\\". In this film, it does neither.Edie Sedgwick's rise to celebrity was due to her charism and waiflike charm that drew people to her. Miller acted as if she used Liza Minelli as her role model! The film viewer is left confused as to why anyone would want Edie Sedgwick in their life--she is portrayed as shallow, boring,and without an ounce of sexuality, despite the R rating for nudity.Overall, the film doesn't add up. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"Sienna Miller's portrayal of 60's icon Edie Sedgwick is an embarrassment. She portrays Edie as an empty-headed twit and her affected accent is ridiculous and cloying. While Edie Sedgwick without a doubt had deep emotional problems, she was also incredibly intelligent, well-educated and articulate. To portray her as a naive dip who does nothing but search for love is over-simplication at it's worst. The real Edie was much more complex than that. The film is highly-fictionalized as well, which only adds to it's annoyance factor. Reveiwers who praise the film and/or Miller's performance have no concept of Sedgwick, Warhol or The Factory. This film is a complete and utter waste of time. Additionally, the \\"real\\" Edie documentary (also included on this DVD) is nothing but an extended version of the end credits of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor little rich girl. A thin movie.","review":"I'm not sure Edie Sedgwick ever was well known beyond the confines of the New York underground art scene. If someone is truly a celebrity you really don't have to do your homework. It was said she was Andy Worhol's muse. More like his pigeon. She would do anything to be in his scene & was sucessful in that, becoming for a time, the \\"It\\" girl. She financed his Factory movie studio & collection of syncophants & oddball neurotics. She was rich & when she was broke & addicted, Warhol simply discarded her. She was breathtakingly beautiful as is Sienna Miller the actress who portrayed her. But that is a rather common commodity. If Edie had talent as an actress, we'll never know. Apparently she was the inspiration for the Warhol quote: \\"In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes.\\" So she was. In the end she died like too many of the young, beautiful & stupid, by an overdose of heroin. So sad. Not very original, but dead nontheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not NTSC format","review":"I purchased this set recently and the movies are not compatible with my NTSC dvd player (most American DVD players).

Being a physicist, I am well aware of how difficult it is to explain even the simplest concepts of quantum mechanics.

The problem was, the analogies were just too imprecise and seemed to muddle things up. I got incredibly bored with the book as things were never explained properly. The best part of the book is the little blurbs and notes at the end which actually explain what is going on. The actual content of the book just seems to confuse rather than explain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whimsical but confusing","review":"I bought Alice in Quantumland for my bright soon-to-be 12-year-old daughter. She's very interested in quantum physics, but I'm afraid this book will be daunting for her.The writing style is generally good -- smart but accessible and witty. My main complaint is that all of the complicated points are explained purely through words, in fact, through long blocks of text.Even most adult-oriented books on quantum physics that I've seen in the past come with plenty of diagrams to explain concepts like interference, uncertainty, etc. This book features some amusing (and well-drawn) illustrations of the characters, but the absence of explanatory diagrams is a major weakness.The concepts explained here are paradoxical and difficult. The narrative helps make them a little easier to understand, but the lack of visual aids keeps this book from being truly great.Suggestion to the author and publisher: Add some simple diagrams of quantum phenomena in the next edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no!","review":"I don't really even want to take the time to bother saying why; it wasn't worth it! I wholly appreciate what Robert Gilmore is trying to do (make quantum physics more palatable for novice readers), but his analogies aren't clear and he puts too much effort into trying to be the Reverend Mister Dodgson. For a much less insipid book, try Fred Alan Wolf's \\"Taking the Quantum Leap\\"; or for a more comprehensive history of things, look into George Gamow's \\"The Great Physicists from Galileo to Einstein\\" (originally published under a different title, but I see it's here at amazon.com). Gamow's book is dated (early '60s), but surprisingly relevant and well-written. It's amazing NOT to see constant references to Feynman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To busy to go through a physics textbook?","review":"This book is an excellent guide for understanding the quantum theories that abound.

It strikes a nice balance between being too weak and overpowering.What I don't like is the lack of any kind of sensation when I put it on. No burning, no cooling, no relief. It just feels like I'm rubbing on a scented lotion. It also leaves an oily residue on your skin.Really it's just preference. I can see how other people prefer this product, but not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will leave your face oily","review":"I have used countless different facial moisturizers and aftershave balms. This is easily the worst. While it has a good scent, it does not fully absorb into your skin. It will leave an oily film on your skin making it look and feel greasy. Just terrible given the price point. If you are in the market for a good post-shave moisturizer, for high end product both Anthony for Men and Jack Black make great products. I even like Olay's Regenerist. If you only want to spend $5, use Every Man Jack's post-shave moisturizer. I cannot stress enough how bad this product is. It is a HUGE step down from the quality of the shaving cream. Nobody wants a greasy/oily face, especially when the product is $30-$40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great After Shave","review":"I really lke Sandalwood pre shave oil and this After Shave is a pretty good compliment. The only reason it did not get a 5 star is that I like \\"Acqua Di Parma\\" products more and When I give a 5 star it is because there is no other procuct better from my point of view. This product however is much cheaper than the \\"Acqua Di Parma\\" products so if you are looking for an After Shave and you like Sandalwood this product is pretty close the best there is and comes at a more reasonable price.One thing that makes this after shave nice is that it sqirts out so you dont have to worry about getting to much on your hand before you apply it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reformulation is bad","review":"This product was reformulated sometime in the last six months.

I usually dread shaving each morning, but I tell myself if I finish shaving, I can use this stuff. I'm a huge fan of lemon essential oil. That leads me to the only problem I have with this aftershave, the smell doesn't linger long enough! Probably lasts about 10 minutes... maybe 20. Which is a shame because when you put it on, it's a blissful moment. Citrus smells are supposed to give your brain a euphoric kick and this sure does for me. BLAH BLAH, it smells good. Okay, how about the actual after shave element? Sets in quicker than any other after shave I've tried and soothes irritation and red bumps immediately. I often have this burning feeling with many after shaves before the relief eventually comes, not with this at all. The impact really is immediate and I will say, you only have to use the smallest of dabs to cover your entire beard zone so even with the high price, it will last a pretty long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels great after a shave","review":"I shaved with cheap shaving cream or gel with no pre-shave oil or after shave balm for 35 years.

I truthfully was not very excited about it; but I liked so much I bought the whole line of products before I left and they feel great on my face. I really like the after-shave balm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells good and the wife approves.","review":"I will say that I am new to the wet shave product line, but I ran across this and started reading the reviews and even went to their website for more information. I think this is a very good product for the price. The pump head is a bit on the small side but nothing that is a problem. The product smells good and the wife also likes it. It is not over powering and is a good compliment to the lavender soap, pre shave oil that I also purchased.

I have read numerous articles about the book and heard this author on the radio. She apporaches the subject from a compassionate journalistic point of view, and does not pretend to presnt herself in any other way. A very honest read, and I HIGHLY recommend the book, especailly to those who would like a helpful and comforting overview of the topic from various practitioners of mystical arts. As the author recently said on a radio interview, this book is not meant to be a directory, and those who are not portrayed in the book and who are making rather a fuss about it, need to look at their own basic philoshoy of \\"things happen for a reason.\\" Thus, if a certain psychic happened to be excluded, well...guess what...there was probably a reason for that.

He had had a similar indoor-tent type toy (not Thomas), but it had broken. Charlie is a big fan of Thomas the Tank, so that played a part, but he played with little else the whole weekend. The toy unfolded rapidly (made Daddy jump) and went together easily. It is large enough for the little guy and his daddy to be in at the same time (Daddy carefully). Once Daddy and Grandpa read the directions, the thing folded easily and neatly back into the shopping-bag size carrier. Mom said it was a much better toy than the old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of fun, until the wind blows!","review":"This is a wonderful imagination toy that can be enjoyed by a wide range of ages. We bought if for our 2 year old neighbor and it has become a neighborhood favorite. All the kids like to play and hide in it. And is accomadates quite a bit and is very realistic to Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel. It is extremly durable and easy to set up, take down, and folds into a very compact flat package when not in use. The only downside is that it really could use some kind of anchors because as soon as a light wind blows or one of the kids kicks it, it goes down."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old loves it","review":"We got this for our 2 year old for Christmas.

The characters are well planned and leave the reader wanting more. It is well worth the read and gears you up for an outstanding adventure. The characters are heroic and tragic without being steeped in misery like some other fantasy characters like Thomas Covenant or Tanis of Dragonlance fame. The book gives the reader enough information without giving all the answers and lays a excellent grounwork for a second and third book. The only drawback was the lack of information and the unfortunate loss of one of the main characters (read to find out which one) and is a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has not been received","review":"Not sure what you want me to do about a book that I have not received.

First off, the extreme sex of the Fallen Angel chapter in book 3 is gone, replaced by what makes the series work, pulse pounding excitment, and amazing characters. Also, I have to say, the art and style are amazing,detailed, and beautiful and gruesome at the same time. It's still at four stars, mainly because of my attitude towards the main character, Shuya (I think thats his name). He still feels to much like a bleeding Romeo hero, although he does get better in this volume, by realizing his flaws. And his \\"heroic\\" (stupid) actions are not treated as something great. But still, he bugs me, so that brings my rating down one star... more like half a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judgmental and rigid","review":"I'm sorry to rate this book so low, because the author understands basic astrological mechanisms, but possibly not all that deeply. The author has a very stubborn, all-or-nothing approach to every planetary interaction which seems to show a lack of appreciation for how multivalent these symbols are. The author's tone and approach are so insensitive, unpleasant and arrogant that it really turned off this reader. With experience with clients and charts, the astrologer may find that relationships are more complicated than the author credits, and it is not the place of the astrologer to judge them, but rather to explain them."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to have your SPIRITUAL EYES OPENED !","review":"I had got this book awhile ago and I had never Read it until DC had this major Blizzard of feb 03.

However, I soon got the feeling that the author was trying to make himself appear to the reader as some kind of chosen one. There are a lot of scriptural references to support the author's story. I just felt that the author's purpose quickly turned into fulfilling a personal mission to be seen as someone more important than the rest of us --- setting himself apart and putting himself into the category of a prophet.

It's outstanding. Louie Armstrong's apperance in the movie is an added bonus. Newman and Poitier are Ram and Eddie, two musicians living in Paris. They meet two pretty visitors from America- Lillian and Connie, played by Joanne Woodward and Diahann Carroll. Both of the couples immediately begin a whirlwind romance. This is a sophisticated film, shot in beautiful, Paris, in the early '60s. I only wish two things- 1) Poitier and Newman would have worked together again, and 2) they would have teamed Newman with Diahann Carroll, and Poitier with Joanne Woodward instead. However, audiences were most definitely not ready for such drama then...unfortunately. It's still a good movie; very classy, with realistic issues throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD please","review":"I wish to add my voice to the chorus calling for Paris Blues to be released on DVD.

I purchased her biography and also this CD, as I'd only heard 'Mon Homme' and 'Je Cherche un Millionaire'.What an interesting voice! Certainly not either attractive or accomplished in a traditional way, but full of character and personality. I read in her biography that her greatest enemy on stage was the microphone, and I believe it. Like other music hall greats, she began her career before the electric microphone, when performers had to project with sheer lung power. Her songs are fun and naughty, rather like Mae West's later work. She never exposed her breasts as did Josephine Baker, but had priceless legs that she displayed into her 70's.Anyway, there is variability in these recordings as one expects pre WW-II, but no matter.

The more I used it, however, the more it didn't smell right, look right. It almost seemed as if it had been water damaged and then dried out.

It is a very strong clamp and you can get a lot of leverage with the turn screw handles. They have ridges and are a good size to fit your hand. The clamps can exert a lot of pressure and do not deflect or ride up on your project. The finger release works great once you figure out that you don't have to pull it all the way up; just a little movement releases the clamp. I would recommend these clamps without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the nicest ML figure ever!!!","review":"I'll keep things short.

Kind of a strange fishy odor/taste, maybe from the spirulina? It's not a huge issue, but I always have to have orange juice or grapefruit juice to kill it. The pulp in these helps you ignore any lumps of powder in there too. It's not easy to mix.I recovered MUCH faster from a cold than my loved ones after taking this religiously.

Fatigue, diarhea, nausea, all the symptoms that told me I had consumed something with gluten. I finally tracked down the only possible culprit, which is this product.

Its my breakfast drink every morning. Since starting this in May, my hair is fuller (less daily hair loss) and my husband too (he says). The flax keeps you regular, so if you have trouble with this, definitely add ground flax seeds to your drink...you'll be so glad you did! I feel so much better, in general.

After reading reviews about how horrible this one was to drink, I was surprised to find it pleasantly ordinary. I mixed up a big cup of green drink with brewer's yeast on my very first try, and it wasn't the most horrible flavor I'd ever experienced. (The worst, incidentally, was when I mixed acai juice with my green drink/brewer's yeast mixture. I hate acai berry.) So my point is, don't assume that this drink will taste bad just because others find it foul. If you're used to the flavors of health foods, you may have had worse in the past. It only takes a few seconds to glug it down, and then you feel better all day. My body loves this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect food","review":"Really good stuff.

I tried regular bottled, organic apple juice and NOPE. Finally, I tried mixing it in with unsweetened almond milk. After being close to gagging every time I drank this stuff, I finally gave up. I consider myself pretty tolerable of \\"gross\\" foods, especially when it comes to better health. But this stuff is just nasty! On another note, Garden of Life makes an antioxidant berry mix and this one isn't bad at all.

I mix mine with a tall glass of orange juice (get the kind that is not made from concentrate) and then I stir it up really well, plug my nose, and chug it. Easiest way to get it down and I can barely taste it. Does wonders for skin and hair and I think it is also helping me with weight loss. You should try this product. Don't be scared away by the taste. Just get creative and find the way that works for you.

There is also a nice chainsaw scene right thru the chest that last for a few seconds and blood everywhere. To back up, pretty simple plot. College buddies headed to vacation beach house and get literally \\"mutilated\\" by some unknown pyscho lurking in the garage. The Mutilator is one of my top 10 slashers of all time.

Although each of their 15 or so studio records has a flavor all its own,\\"Fighting\\" is a provacative blend of passion, integrity, musicianship, and frivolity. This fact is especially apparent when taking into account the album's release date (1975). While other bands were carrying on about \\"rocking and rolling all nite\\" or how fast their cars sped down the highway (I won't mention whom), Phillip Lynott was baring his soul with poetic verse and lyric. A truly sublime aura of groundbreaking harmony guitar pervaded the mix, making Lynott's lyrics all the more urgent and memorable.

The advanced abilities of the configuration panel are impressive - various wireless security modalities, filtering, timed access, etc. The strength of the internal antennae appears fine for one or two room access; however, with purchasing the HGA7S you can boost it for an entire normal sized home. I use it also with the Linksys Range Booster and love the coverage overall. My only complaint is one echoed here - the technical support is horrible and often moronic - this appears to be the only flaw in my entire Linksys experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This antenna-less model just doesn't transmit adequately.

The main beef with this is that this is a 1.0 product (1st firmware release came with it). The 2nd firmware revision did not fix the problem with the static DHCP that I was having.

Sale execs know that the only way to move this item off the shelf is to entice buyers w/ a special.

It does not ask for Service name in pppoe configuration and if your ISP requires it, you r screwed. The only option is to replace router with a different one from Netgear or Dlink. All other routers ask for Service name except Linksys. When I contacted technical support, they told me that the only option is to buy a new router from a different company or tell my ISP to change their configuration so that there is no need to enter service name field.

I liked the small footprint this router made and I thought it was time to upgrade from my siemens 802.11b router.Big mistake. The range of this router is so poor that you will need to buy an antenna to even make it to the other other side of a 2 bedroom apartment. Why this didn't come with an antenna to begin with is beyond me.Stick with a router that comes with 2 antennas.

Unfortunately, the update failed somewhere along the line (it appeared to be complete, but never came back to life) and now it's a brick. There are numerous posts on Linksys' forums and other places around the 'net from people having the exact same problem. I've tried all solutions posted to Linksys' knowledge base and those suggested in forums with no solution. Ultimately there is no solution and if you're beyond warranty, you're stuck.

Not so. The box itself is attractive and fits neatly on a desk, but the wireless signal is weak and the response of the unit somewhat slow.The first unit I bought began to fail intermittently after about a year. I bought another to replace it and it bricked immediately upon installing a firmware upgrade (which I was hoping might solve the performance problems with the earlier unit).

The installation software is not compatible with Apple (despite claims to the contrary on this website) and while the customer support people are willing to help, they offer the disclaimer that they do not support Apple systems. Installation was long and tedious, the range is extremely limited (even in a tiny New York apartment the signal fades if I take my laptop two rooms away) and the router seems to require frequent, time-consuming restarting. The whole process has been a pain and has made me reconsider having a wireless network. I cannot recommend this product for use with any Apple computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked OK until I tried to upgrade the firmware","review":"This wireless router worked OK at start.

I upgraded from an older linksys in attempts to increase the range a little. It did, but not by much. You can expect a little increase to the effective range and a touch faster connectivity but beyond that it's the same old. I don't think it warrented the hefty price tag attached to it and the adapter devices, but that's what I get for buying something new on the market. I guess the only major difference between it and my older linksys is the cisco label smack dab on the front of it. Is there anything that company won't buy???"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID","review":"This router is a piece of garbage. The wireless range seems good but for some reason its very slooooooooooooow. But what's far worse is the buggy firmware.

Two caveats:1. Even with a booster antenna the range is somewhat limited, so the wireless radio signal is not all that strong.2. The subnet mask settings are limited to a predefined drop-down set, so you can't specify custom subnets. This shortcoming can be a problem if you're trying to bridge two networks say 192.168.0.x and 192.168.1.x.

His one desire is to see the ocean, and he escapes reform school and gets his wish at movie's end.The camera work is excellent and seems to be everywhere - high overhead, close up, always on the move like the boy. There are many humorous scenes, especially in the school in Paris: Truffaut knows the minds of 12-year olds perfectly. There are some great ironic scenes, too: the \\"warden's\\" children being locked in a cage when the reform school boys have free use of the yard.

Jean Pierre Leaud is briliantly cast in the role of the main character. He's one of the big screen's best and unlikeliest heroes. You can't help but adore him and relate to him as you watch this movie. You also feel sorry for the young lad - he's trying hard to fit in and grow up normal, with his strange step-father who's more concerned with his Michelen guide and his MILF of a mother, with her tight sweaters and affairs, it's no wonder this boy turned out as he does.The DVD is a fine transfer, with a wonderful commentary soundtrack as well.I highly recommend this lovable film to viewers of all ages.

Most people say the film is depressing and sad but I found it to be kind of uplifting, and the ending is perfect. Other reviews already explained the plot so I wont go into it, but the film was shot great and the music adds a nice classic smooth jazz feel to it. The cinematography in this film was some of the best ive ever seen, its hard to believe it was made so long ago. The transfer by Criterion was very well done, and there was almost no debris.

His dad had to sit down and help him put it together because there's only one way to make it all work right so you have to follow directions. It's not great for just being creative with like the basic set. So after you spend all that time setting it up, you crank the handle a few times and watch the monkeys go around and that's it. The kids lose interest pretty fast and then you either have to find a place to leave it out, or just put it away.

The characters are drawn fairly well; at any rate, they're better than the pompous angels and demons who pop up every now and again to provide sonorous intonations on the action. The author has created a universe where everything is as it should be if party-line evangelicalism were true; everyone who disagrees with the Christians either caves in to its obvious superiority or becomes a demon puppet. For its few dubious strengths, the book in the end reads like a lengthy gospel tract clumsily stitched together with iffy action sequences. As Christian fiction, it's all right. As fiction, it's way below average."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a good story in there somewhere","review":"There is a good story in there somewhere, if Anderson didn't stop to preach about God, Jesus and giving yourself to the lord, every 5 pages.What he has done is turn a decent premise into a bible thumping sermon that ultimately bores the reader.Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Virginia Herpetology Bible","review":"I have owned my copy since 5th grade and took Dr.Pauleys herpetology class in the fall of 2010.

Unfortunately, the book appears to be badly in need of both editing and rewriting. The characters are wooden and ill-developed. To describe the dialog as stilted would be an insult to stilts everywhere. There are long periods between battle sequences and, said sequences really being the raison d'etre for the entire novel, it's very hard to care about the one dimensional characters whose misadventures and witless spoutings make up the bulk of the novel.There are books that you buy and put on your bookshelf to read and reread over the years.

All the elements are there, but a lack of historical research keeps this work from being truly great. That being said, the Alternate Reality genre will always welcome a great first effort novel like 1901. I have been a fan of this genre since I read a barbershop copy of the Man in the High Castle almost 30 years ago, and at times it was almost impossible to find any projects in this category. Mr. Conroy is certainly no Harry Turtledove, but he has put together a good read and managed to tap into a previously unexplored hiccup in American history, namely our turn-of-the-20th-century stumbling onto the world stage of politics and diplomacy. I would like to see more from Mr. Conroy, possible a second novel set in his \\"1901 universe\\".

Conroy sketches his characters with obvious delight (his portraits of Teddy Roosevelt and ex-rebel James Longstreet are memorable). Since Conroy sometimes gives us background on a historical character, and sometimes does not, a knowledge of history wouldn't hurt in reading this novel. Still, the plot does tend to drag in the middle, though it perks up a bit towards the end with the major battle scene (in of all places. Connecticut).In the model of Turtledove's \\"The Guns of the South\\", though not as good.

It is possible that it might work on very small olives, but the big green Italian kind I buy in large tins are almost impossible to insert into the pitter in the first place, and then the plunger goes off center just enough to jam the stone.

I spin the first record constantly but this one is a piece of junk. One can only hope they abandon the cheesy vocals and equally cheesy beats and melodies (my week beats your year). I feel like these guys are just trying to be funny and make fun of music. I can say there are about 2 minutes of this disc that I like, but by in large this is a HUGE letdown from the debut record and I'll be selling mine for cheap.

It boggles the mind to comprehend the forces that brought young men to America from a primarily maritime economy and succesfully transplanted them in the high deserts of Idaho and Nevada as sheepherders. How a network of friends and relatives immigrating over four generations were able to bring their culture's music, dance, games, gastronomy and traditions, adapt them to new circumstances and see the pride exhibited by their children and grandchildren is truly inspiring. The evolution of immigrant Basques into Basque-Americans is a worthy study for any anthropologist, linguist or sociologist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"This is the grandest CD I have bought in a long time.

Some say the later seasons - those after the third or fourth aren't as good as the beginning, and they are probably right. However, even when Stargate is bad, it's better than everything else on television.If you like action shows, Stargate is for you.If you like sci-fi shows, Stargate is most definitely for you.Unlike most science fiction of the past twenty years, Stargate is not about the science fiction - the gadgets, the technology, the warp engines - it's main focus is a good story.

I returned this unit and replaced it with APC's Smart-UPS 1500 and have never had another issue. Bottom line: APC's Selector needs an overhaul.

I care not a wick for the story, I simply could not tear my eyes off of Brett's stricken and woebegone face. He looked so tired, so utterly tired of the role he has played for a decade. It was indeed cruel to have him come back into this role at that point in his life. He is so talented, so brilliant in his works of the past. I cannot stress that enough.

Most importantly she finds those you truly think are happy always hide something inside. This is how it is with Adam and when no one but Hattie starts to realize this something major may happen that Hattie doesn't know about until it happens.I feel bad for Adam because no one can comprehend how he feels and what its like. When Hattie starts to understand a little she can feel some of his pain. I believe Hattie appreciates the summer she spent with her uncle Adam.

Adam made Hattie appreciate and love the world far more than she ever did before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Book!","review":"A Corner of the Universe by Ann M. Martin is a great book. This book would be great for people that like a mystery and a descriptive book. I think this book has a great theme which is not to judge a book by its cover.

When she finds out she has a uncle named Adam, that is going to come and stay with her nana and papa, she was very surprised. They live close, so she could meet him, and hang out, but what she dose not know is he is different. As I was reading the book, I felt sad that some people called Adam names because that made him really depressed.I think this book had a doable length in pages. There are 189 pages in this book and I felt that was a great length to read. Not too long not too short. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read.

They pass through some difficult times together but Hattie learns that she can lift corners of the universe .This book takes place in the time of the 1940 to 1950.

It's called A Corner of the Universe. Hope you like it!There was a girl named Hattie Owen, who had no brothers or sisters. She was an only child. But one day her parents told her she had an uncle that she never knew about. But there was one problem. He was mentally ill. Also that he was coming to stay with her grandparents, who live down the street from Hattie and her parents. When Adam got to her grandparents house they came over to visit him. Hattie really liked her uncle but she felt more like a babysitter that a niece. Hattie spent all her time playing and having fun with Adam. But one day something happened that changed Hattie's whole family's life. But I won't tell you what happened because you have to read the story first. I really recommend this book to anyone that likes sad but funny stories.Written by: Chelsea Mckaskill"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann is AMAZING!","review":"I read this book for a project we had to do in reading class.

Struggling with similar issues of mood swings, rejection by peers, etc.(what young girl doesn't?) she really identified with the autistic boy, Adam, who later commits suicide. The story, while dealing positively about the relationship between an 11 year old girl and her autistic uncle, has an inappropriate resolution for a book for children and young adults. Adam commits suicide by hanging, and the 11 year old, Hattie, felt responsible. On page 178, Hattie reflects \\"I...realize that Adam's decision to take his life was not made easily. It took a certain kind of courage. Just not the kind of courage I choose.\\" With the rising rates of autism, mental health issues in youth, and suicide in youth, I don't consider suicide a \\"certain kind of courage.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Town Tragedy","review":"I really enjoyed the book A Corner of the Universe.

In the parade she sees a girl wink to her, and Hattie doesn't know why she did. The next day when Hattie went to the carnival she met her new friend Leila. Later on in the book, something you never think would happen, takes place. It has to do with Hattie, Leila, and Adam. Read this book, and you will find out.

If so, then you must read the book A Corner of the Universe by: Ann M. Martin.This book is about a girl, Hattie, who is now about to meet her Uncle Adam who is mentally disabled. Hattie's uncle is coming to Millerton because his \\"special school\\" is closing down. At first Hattie is kind of worried to meet her uncle, but then she realizes they have a lot in common. A problem in the story is that Adam was called names by two girls, Nancy and Janet, so Hattie tells them to shut up and surprisingly they do.I give this book 8 out of 10 stars because you can feel the way the characters do and the story is so descriptive you can't put it down. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes descriptive stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corner of the Universe","review":"...\\"Corner of the Universe,\\" is an excellent book for teens. This story really shows how you can find great things in the most unexpected places. Hattie is a normal 12-year-old girl from a small town.

Adam falls in love with one of the boarders at Hattie's family's boarding house. He can do something unexpected at all times so the reader must be ready for anything with this book.

(I'm shipping mine back). The book is very weak. Not only are there few pages, but the type is probably 20pt, and there is much white space. Further, there is no substance as these are only answers to questions that were likely sent to a support desk. (An example from pg 34: \\"how is the ABAP Authority-check used?\\".

The dimensions are the same between the C and S. I also layed it out next to the manufacturer's strap. It too was the same length. It was a fraction wider. But that was due to the fatter/cushiony edges. That is why I feel this is much better than a man'f strap. It is softer and more comfortable. I have not been on any day long excursions since buyng this, but have used it for short periods.I did take the silver rings off that connect it to the camera. They can scratch the paint. I tied it to the camera in the traditional method by threading the strap on. And I love the quick connects.

Instead, right off, he quits the church and goes free-lance, a la Ghost Whisperer. (The show quickly descends into \\"Hollywood scary movie tripe\\" as its bread and butter.)

The audio commentaries are interesting, and well worth a listen. There are lot's of deleted scenes, which are always fun to see. This series was amazingly written, with thought provoking stories. The characters are likeable, but flawed human beings, as so many of us are. You are very quickly drawn into their world. The on screen intensity of the actors is amazing. It is definetly a series that you can watch again and again, and with each viewing find something that you missed before. This is one series that you really don't want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC not Fox","review":"I don't disagree with much of what has been said, but I did want to qualify something.

Even when ABC was desperate, they still did not have much patience for this style of programming.

During an investigation of a boy named Tommy, Paul is involved in a horrific train accident and he sees the message 'GOD IS NOWHERE' written in his own blood. He returned to report his findings and the church denies ever sending him to investigate Tommy. This causes Paul to take a break from the church.

This film comes across like an anachronism. Neither of the 2 male leads, Werner or Serre was very believable. Jeanne Moreau comes off a bit better, perhaps because she's beautiful, but this whole film is just mediocre storytelling. Werner's narration didn't seem to fit well somehow and the baggage attached to this film by the affection for certain cultural attitudes of the 60's is pretty irrelevant now."},{"rating":"1","title":"the philosophical heart of this movie...","review":"is merde. this movie is merde. you will pray for demons to eat your eyeballs and erase your memory with pain in the hope that you will forget this, the most truly unforgettable of movies. unforgettable because it is terrible. so terrible that you might consider killing yourself, it is really that bad. i'm writing this for one purpose only: not to sound cool, not to elicit laughter, not for anything other than the simple fact that i hope to save you from the time you will waste if you happen to think 'oh cool, a french film by truffaut' and watch this movie. if you do watch it, you will remember my warning clearly while you are on your deathbed because of all the wasted time that you will have accrued in your lifetime watching this will be the time that you would want back most of all. if you consider watching this because you can't believe that this could be this bad, you're wrong and stupid and should eat glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Bore","review":"Five minutes in to this movie, I knew that Jeanne Moreau was going to destroy both of the title characters. Then, about six hours later, she finally did it. Why this movie has such a great reputation completely escapes me. It just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Very boring, and very precious, in that annoying French New Wave film kind of way, which means that a bad script and bad performances are the hallmark of quality. A surprising botch from the usually great Truffaut. To see Truffaut's best work, see The 400 Blows, or The Last Metro.

I was given this as a child in the early 1960s, and even my 10-year-old mind couldn't miss the deeply authoritarian Nazi flavoured undertones which permeated the book. The author appeared to worship the ground Werner von Braun walked on, adding a rather obsequious touch to his version of post WWII rocket science. But the real howlers involve the science. For example, Schroeder insisted that rockets would take off horizontally from water, so as to derive maximum benefit from the rotational velocity of the Earth. Didn't anyone ever tell him about the difference between radial and tangential velocity? And he blithely dismissed special relativity with the observation that if two spacecraft travel in opposite directions at near light speed their velocity of separation must be nearly twice the speed of light - so that faster-than-light travel is obviously possible.

Listening to Altman describe his pissed off dad is worth the price of the album alone.There are a few \\"F\\" bombs sprinkled throughout, but the material is top shelf and certainly a timeless piece of work which sounds as fresh today as it did 18 years ago!!!

It is also a love story: he married his girlfriend and they had two children during the course of the trip. It is also a testament to the kindness and humanity of the vast majority of the people he encountered as he walked, when it seemed that the poorest people were the most generous.He was on his own, no sag wagon following close behind. He had only one sponsor, a boot manufacturer. He was lucky to survive the hardships of illness, hunger, thirst, and occasional encounters with criminals and crazy people.The book is extremely well written and is consistently interesting.

I love whites, especially in summer, but have been scared of wearing them since I'm a bit on the clumsy side. But with Tide to Go, I risk wearing whites, and guess what, I don't regret it. The types of stains (read fresh stains) it has helped me with so far include:coffee stains (have to use it a bit more so that it doesn't spread)pizza sauce stains (don't ask me how)soda stains (specifically cola)oily food stainsThe reason why I've given it 4 stars is because sometimes, especially if it's an oily food stain, rubbing over and over doesn't necessarily remove it, only makes it lighter. Thus, not 100% on those kinds of stains. But overall, it's the best one available in the market so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is TERRIBLE!","review":"I tried this product the other day while at a bar. I tried to remove a stain that resulted from me spilling a little Kung Pao on my shirt that I had a Thai/Chinese restaurant. The stain remover was given to me from a lady that I had met at the bar, and as I tried to use it, I noticed that the tube was really hard and nothing came out as I squeezed it. I tried to loosen the stuff inside the tube with a toothpick, but very little came out. The stuff that did come out wasn't effective at removing my stain (maybe because not enough of the stain remover was applied), but it did manage to remove some of the color in my shirt (that might have been due to the bleach-smelling substance that was in the spot remover). Eventually, I used a spot remover that I had at home and the stain was washed out.

He's great ot listen to on the radio on Sunday mornings. And as I was reading this book, I observed that often, he takes a relatively simple idea and presents it with such flourish and zeal that it edns up seeming more profound than it really is. While this is certainly not a bad thing, and the church needs more people who can make basic truths and ideas more appealing to study and revisit, the price is paid in that this book is not as compelling an apologetic against atheism as it could have been.He didn't set out to make a technical refutation of atheism; rather, in this book, he's addressing what is, for many, at the heart of their embrace of it. It's very good in that context, but it doesn't have the same 'bite' that Geisler, Behe, etc. do.

After a while the North was able to escape with the victory after the town comes to togther to help the family.The reason I'm reading this book is because it has been picked for me for a group book by Mrs. Shea my english teacher.My favorite part is the whole thing because it is the first book I have read with so many emotions. It makes you want to cry, laugh, smile, and frown. The family's problems and jokes never end. Once one does another one starts all over again. This made me feel like i was watching a TV show.

Across Five Aprils is a historical novel that takes place during the Civil War. The Creighton family, which the story revolves around, has members of the family that are fighting on opposing sides. Even though this may have seemed like and interesting character conflict, it wasn't, ad the characters also became impossible to relate to.

However, I am not a child that can't understand books. I have read many great works which I know that many adults have never even dared touch (ex. The Catcher in the Rye, The Grapes of Wrath, Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Three Musketeers, The Red Badge of Courage, The adventures of Huckleberry Finn, etc.).

But when Jethro's teacher brings the news that the country is at war, Jethro's world comes crashing down around him. Too young to fight, he watches as almost everyone he cares about leaves to join the Union army--everyone except his favorite brother, Bill, who runs away to join the Confederates. Jethro waits, desperate for news and struggling to manage the farm with just his mother and sister, through the five long springs of the American Civil War.Across Five Aprils is a powerful story about a boy becoming a man during the most difficult of times. The novel doesn't give the reader any easy answers about the problems of slavery or the horrors of war and the detailed accounts of real historical events make the novel fascinatingly believable. It was a Newbery Honor Book in 1965."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect historical fiction Civil War novel","review":"Across Five Aprils perfectly potrays what life was like during Civil War times in a lively and action packed novel.

Oh. Jeth, it's horrible to be so young. Why does there have to be a war to take Shad away from me before I'm of an age that Pa thinks thinks is old enough fer marryin'?\\" Several accounts of the book were true which was good. I did not like how Jethro who was at the age of nine in the beginning was shown as so mature and to me was percepted as a boy of a man's age. At the early parts of the book I recieved an opinion of Lincoln from the book and reasons were not explained for this opinion being formed.

It is based around a colicky 10-year-old boy named Jethro who lives on a potato farm on southern Illinois during the Civil War. Throughout the book, he whines about how horrible war is and how he wishes his brothers would come home from it. The combination of his constant complaints, his occupation of potato planting, and the fact that the \\"big adventure\\" is a four hour trip to the town of Newton, make this book about as exciting as watching grass grow.Do not get me wrong, the book has some redeeming qualities. It provides historical information in the form of letters from the brothers at war, and from Jetho's one-room schoolhouse education. The other positive things about the book have, for the moment, escaped me. Nonetheless, they were surpassed by the book's slow movement and the author's poor writing, lack of originality, and conformity with the \\"war is bad\\" theme in all its political correctness. Thus, my recommendation is to no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALY PREDICTABLE","review":"This books is so boring. It is not original at all. Every book is like it so don't read this book.

I f you want civil war action don't read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lacked in plot!","review":"I think this book majorly lacked in plot and moved very slowly.

Not a great choice. In some parts of this it is very detailed (mostly at the beginning) but on important things like death and love its very limited.

I spent a lot on this book with a weird format and less than 100 pages, and since I have done that, I have struggled to keep my hands on it.In an organisation that is trying had to follow the ITIL framework, most of my colleagues are familiar with the principles, and applying them in practice. This book presents a simple way for those people to see real results quickly, and clarified things in a simple way for non ITIL trained people.It's expensive, and the paper back was really bad quality, but I would still recommend the book (and yes, I have bought a couple of new versions for the library)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very practical but short","review":"The book was shorter than I expected, it was actually a pocket book.

I would rate this a must buy as it provides a short and sweet set of ideas that will help you get started even in the most challenged of IT operational sites. This book is easily 5-stars, but the Kindle version had so many typos that it became difficult to read at points. On a limited size Kindle page, there would often be 2-3 clearly misspelled words. Amazon or whoever is taking the hard copy books and creating these Kindle books should get its act together.

The crepe is way too thin, almost to the point of being tasteless.

The floorboards relieve a lot of pressure from my foot/ankle which was causing me pain on longer rides. I would give this product 5 stars but there are two minor problems I ran into. First, the powder coat on these were a little thick. While trying to install them I had a hard time getting the screws to fit into the threads. This was most apparent trying to get the screw for the shifter into place. Second, mine get a slight vibration in them once I start going around 65mph and higher. It can cause slight discomfort if you maintain this speed and get the vibration for a long enough time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I read this years ago.

While it's never 100% accurate, it is filled with insights into your own sign and the sign of others that is just too useful. Reading it again at the age of 40 I was even MORE impressed. I highly recommend this book, for it's usefulness, humor, and entertainment. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A coffee table classic","review":"This book may be the best there is at bringing the sun signs to life. Linda does an entertaining segment on the sign in general, and then breaks it down into men, women, children, bosses, and employees. She illustrates her chapters with quotes from Alice In Wonderland. I can't think of a better way to get started learning about the signs of the zodiac than reading this enjoyable, light book from cover to cover. Don't think of it as a Bible of astrology. Don't poke for areas of disagreement. Just absorb the big picture.There is no pure example of a sign. When you were born, the Sun, Moon, and planets in our solar system weren't all in the same sign. We are combinations of signs.

How would anyone know your day just cuz of your sign?However, I was convinced that astrology is for the most part, accurate. Of course--not entirely. I'm sure not every Pisces is creative, not every Virgo is a loner, and not every Capricorn is conservative.Astrology is just a basic generalization that hits most of the targets of a person's personality, according to their sign. I'm an Aquarian, and I can assure you I am not unemotional. Not every trait of your sign has to be true.This is a good book, and like the other reviews say, don't treat it as the FINAL word. It's not. It's just a fairly accurate reference. That's all. Don't take it too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Classic!","review":"I read this book years ago and loved it. I made it part of my own personal collection this time. The book is still great. For those who believe that the sun and stars have a message for them, check out this book. It has very in depth information. Even for those of us who really don't fully embrace this thing called Astrology, the book is still intriguing and enlightening.

During this \\"middle period\\" Thin Lizzy were HOT! They had a string of fantastic albums and several hit singles. This is one of them. Notice Brian Robertson is missing from the cover picture? Apparently they decided it was time for him to go before they released this album - presumably related to his fight-injured hand. Shame -- I think we all regret that decision. The sound of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham created a special harmony guitar sound that powerful and melodic...High-lights include the excellent hit pop-rock single Dancing in the Moonlight, the desperate Dear Lord and Southbound [a tribute to the 2002 stock market perhaps?! ;)].

This show was unique in that it had been set up for half hall seating due to poor advanced ticket sales. Strong sales of Journey's commercial breakthrough \\"Evolution\\" album promted a big rush of walk up ticket sales & delay of the show so as to move the stage to full house capacity.

There is none of the marvelous psychological/philosophical insight of later Steinbeck. The characters are uninteresting, the plot is without intrigue or interest. The best I can say about Cup of Gold, is it is at least free of the immature political ideology of some Steinbeck novels (the lesser ones in my view). However, I take cheer from Cup of Gold, and recommend it to all of my friends who are struggling with first novels.

I like to know the truth and I will search out both sides of the argument to find that truth. In this work you only get the Gellar view and nothing else. Any work that covers such a contested area and does not present fair balanced arguments and evidence is worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this Book","review":"This is about Peyton and Linc... Linc is also friends with Peyton's (Gay) brother Flex... of course both Peyton and Linc are unaware of this, which leads to a whole bunch of misunderstandings which makes you laugh out loud! This was an enjoyable read, filled with just enough passion between Peyton and Linc and some nosey sisters. Just one more thing to add, I recommend all books by this author and Niobia Bryant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"I think 'hate' is a very strong word for what I felt about this book, but it comes close. First of all, the description on the back of the book is very misleading. It isn't an E. Lynn Harris style, bisexual love triangle. That wasn't my real beef with the book, though. The ending is what truly made this book a terrible read for me. There's a lot of deceit and lies flying throughout this story, and by the end, the deceivers seem to be the ones placing all the blame on the deceived.There is very scant romance interspersed, and not a lot of steamy loves scenes to hang your hat on either. True, die-hard romance fans won't enjoy this book. Usually, Adrianne Byrd makes love stories come to life, but I must disagree with the other reviewers who liked this book and say it was a swing and a miss for Miss Byrd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply delightful!","review":"Adrianne Bryd tells a wonderful story of love, family, and the sometimes humorous ties that bond. This story is full of hilarious situations that will have the reader cheering for their favorite character. All the characters are genuine and give you a real sense of what the story is really about. I definitely recommends this novel for a great read, anytime, any season. Ms. Byrd has outdone herself with this awesome story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed......","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I am a Byrd fan but the book did not flow well and the ending was not complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"luv it!","review":"This is a lovely book. I always luv this author. It was sexy, funny, and drama all rolled into into one. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, funny, romantic story","review":"I was initially hesitant to purchase this box because of the hint of homosexuality in the descriprion...but, I love A. Byrd's books and the previous books about the Adams sisters..and had been introduced to Flex in prior stories. I'm sooo glad I purchased this book!!!! It is romantic and funny and a joy to read! It also focused on the importance of honesty, trust, and effective communication. This is a delightful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound, witty advice for the willing","review":"Mr. Dahr's brief, readable collection of his own thoughts and selected quotes from various well-known thinkers and artists provides sound advice and insightful observations. The Examined Life is not an instruction manual for those looking for easy answers; instead it helps get like-minded readers pointed in the right direction. A useful book both for readers who are already thinking while living and people who have yet to give self-awareness a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical","review":"I don't use these words lightly.

I know it's the cheapest. But. If you're only after one, buy either the OLC (the 1984 double CD) or the new London cast (1992 single CD). This CD is amusing (in it's dreadfulness) for the dedicated fan like yours truly, but it is very bad.

I bought these for my boyfriend, a movie zealot. At first he was overjoyed, but then a fellow movie collector alerted him to the digitally remastered region zero trilogy available FOR THE SAME PRICE!. He said to look around the internet & you will find it easily from reputable dealers. His words, \\"The video transfer on this edition is very poor, the subtitles are craptastic. Watchable, but just\\".\\"As for the movies themselves, classic John Woo, outstanding action flicks!!! Hard boiled is my ultimate favorite, but it is closely followed by these two. (Never seen #3).

It is sturdy, but hard to use; you have to rock it back and forth to get thru the apple. Was rather disappointed, it should work better. Made in China, so no instructions, either. I've used plastic ones that worked better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"What can I say? It slices apples. It is pretty sturdy (approximately 100 apples and counting). It is relatively easy to clean and stands up to the dishwasher. The slices are a good size for snacking. As others have mentioned, the central core is a bit on the small side which leads to an occasional seed and/or piece of core in one or two slices. These are easily removed with teeth, fingers, or a knife, and it does mean you don't waste very much of the apple.Perfect? No. But, I haven't seen a perfect apple slicer for sale yet and this one is quite good. I even bought my dad one for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"We received this last year for Christmas and it broke this week. I never quite liked the handling of it or how hard it was to push it down on the apple. Often times it would cut crooked and cut into the core. I am not happy with this product as it didn't last a year and it is manufactured in China. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this to replace the $6 plastic one we'd bought at Ralph's (Kroger) a couple of years previously - one of the handles broke. I figured this would be better, being of all metal construction - I was right and wrong. Nothing happened to the handles, but the cutters themselves gave out. We bought this on 25APR09. In June, one of the cutter pieces came loose (the spot weld that held it to the corer came undone), but it still worked. Yesterday (20SEP09), that whole piece (two cutters), popped out, making this a ten-slicer instead of a twelve. The $6 one lasted longer - end of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceptive","review":"Looks nice, but it takes too much strength and effort to cut through the apple and then at the end of it all, it doesn't even cut the whole way through, so you have to manually pick them out.

I like the size of the slices. The unit doesn't peel and the center cut is a tad too small. I have to finish the coring to get the frequent seed hard part out. Otherwise, I am glad I bought it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made","review":"It worked fine for about 25 apples, then the blades broke away from the ring. Based on the other reviews, I may have received a defective sample, but I can't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD DESIGN","review":"I purchase the Leifheit apple slicer/corer expecting that would give me perfectly cut slices for my apple pies. Unfortunately it didn't work out that way. Although it looks and feels like a heavy duty item, it was a total disappointment when I used it. The blades are not sharp enough and they do not cut all the way through. I am a pretty strong woman I think and I really have to put all my strength to push this apple corer through the apple. After succeeding that task the slices are still attached and you have to pick them out one by one which makes it very time consuming. I think using my paring knife I can core and slice an apple way faster. It is ashame because it looks well made but it really has a design flaw. The blades needed to be sharper and longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple Slicer","review":"Didn't work on solid apples like granney smith.

You have been warned.Thankyou once againMike Herberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful to me...","review":"This book was a disappointment. Based on other reviews, I thought it would be the happy middle between a \\"nuts-and-bolts\\" type of book and a textbook with a lot of theoretical discussion. This book was neither, and weak in almost all respects.The book read somewhat like an undergraduate term paper, with overuse of \\"witty\\" commentary. Based on the large font size, large figures, lots of white space, and way too much extraneous commentary, this book is really much \\"thinner\\" than its 300+ pages suggest - not a good value.In short, there is not much meat here. I would advise looking elsewhere - compromises are often bad choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside Relational Databases","review":"This is for beginners and has little substancebeyond the obvious.

I was a convert after reading the first 4 paragraphs.The exceedingly-simple (\\"yet-so-few-others-do-it\\") chapter breakout of Tables, Forms, Queries and Reports. Each chapter is its own \\"little-world\\" untouched with non-related ideas. The authors tie them together later. Extremely well executed.Excellent and I mean *excellent* typography and layout.

It should especially be seen by parents, pastors and teachers.

It raised alot of good issues and concerns in the LGBT Christian community. Not only were the thoughts and sentiments expressed most everything that a gay Christian such as myself has asked or wondered about, it also came with instructional information and ways to incorporate it into a classroom/Sunday school setting, which is exacting what our church plans on doing.Where \\"For the Bible Tells Me So\\" touchs on theology and scriptural doctrine, \\"Through My Eyes\\" touches on the human aspect. Putting faces of good Christian teens & young adults, going past the debates and realizing their struggle with what people have been told by mass religion their whole life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading....But Not Enough to Save You?","review":"If you buy this book, I strongly suggest a companion volume THE IMMORTALIST MANIFESTO by Elixxir. It goes beyond what R. Michael Perry has done in this book. Instead of putting most of our eggs into the Cryonics (i.e. freezing) basket, THE IMMORTALIST MANFIESTO, in stirring minimalist prose, provides a most compelling vision of the coming Immortalist Society, and how it will arrive. And it argues that the anti-aging life-extension breakthroughs are not likely to come in time for most of us, especially baby boomers, unless there is an Immortalist Movement powerful enough to make such breakthroughs happen soon.Why read this book? It just might save your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Ladies?????","review":"Please read all of the other 2 or 1 star reviews to get a real summary of the book.

The author obviously has had several bad relationships and has failed at each one. At one point she defended her own views by saying that making plans, scheduling and planning events without considering the man's opinion at all was not being controlling but \\"creating\\" and \\"caring\\". The author seems to be a control fiend with a superiority complex. I especially enjoied how she went on a long rant about how men don't know where the clitoris is or how to use it and went into great detail about how (she likes) to have it stimulated.While this book did have a few good points to consider, the rest of it was just male bashing and a huge rant that would be better suited on a livejournal or myspace blog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating read","review":"The book read like a collection of COSMO articles on insecure, needy, emotionally fragile women. I find it difficult to believe women are like what was presented in the book, and if they are, would you really want others, including men, to know about it?Maybe there was some substance, but the writing style ruined \\"the message\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Women Want Men To Know","review":"Well, the front cover says this is the ultimate book about love, sex and relationships for you and the man you love. That's a big statement. So, what did I think of this book?Insightful is the word that comes to mind concerning this. Many times men and women don't communicate their feelings very clearly to one another and I think this book breaks some of those barriers down. It definitely explains how each member thinks concerning many various issues including myths, communication and techniques for being the perfect lover.Personally, I wish this book had been around a few years back. I would encourage men and women alike who want a greater understanding of the opposite sex to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Of all the landscape books I ordered in 2004 this was the the biggest disappointment. I got the impression the author tries to convince me about his personal definition about what landscape photography is, with examples of images I wouldn't take a second look at.If you're interested in beauty of nature and not in an abstract thesis about the definition and value of art look for books from Art Wolfe or Jack Dykinga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle edition review","review":"This is a good group of interviews and conversations done with Al Pacino. It isn't a biography, although it has bigraphical information. What it does is give the reader a small glimpse of a man who normally stays well hidden. If you like Al Pacino it is a good read, and gives insight into the behind the curtain reasons for some of his \\"quirks\\". The Kindle editon is formatted without problems. The only complaint is the pictures are small, but that is a kindle limitation. The words carry the book. So this isn't an issue for me. I have looked for the print edition and it was out a few days, sold out in book stores, and I haven't seen it since. It may be available on Amazon, I was checking when I found this edition. And didn't continue to look, the pictures aren't that important to me - I know what Pacino looks like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoooahh!!","review":"was reading this book in the bookstore, thought of ordering it thru Amazon and nevver received it.

Martin's thesis is that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is not about santification(what he calls the normal work of the HS) but to uphold the name of Jesus and give a supernatural desire to know him, to love him, and to spread his name. Lloyed-Jones knew this book would be controversial, but his exegesis along with his history of the early church since Pentecost makes a powerful case. Overall, i recommend this book to any seminary student who wants to add to his knowledge of the person and work of God the Holy Spirit. We really do have a supernatural faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa, Nelly!

I seriously reccommend buying this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing variety !!","review":"I bought this CD after hearing \\"Like a Bird\\" and I couldn't get the song out of my head !! The thing I really like about the CD is the variety of styles it contains. Its truly a colorful, feminine, declaration of... 'This is me, trying to live my life !' Her lyrics vary from cut-&-dry to romanticly poetic, and her accompaniment is touched by every side of the spectrum.There's everything from classical string arrangements, to metallic guitar rifs, with turn-table scratching, bouncing techno synthesizer, and her cultural, acoustic guitar in- between. Her voice, though very nasal at times, is often balanced by her own lower, more soulful back-up. She often attaches a 40's jazz style vibrato to the notes she carries to smooth out her meowing. I think the CD is a delightful, tossed salad of sound, that will take you for a whirl."},{"rating":"2","title":"endlessly enjoyable","review":"a lovely album that reveals a broad range of musical influences and mastery, an infectious youthful idealism and totally delectable grooves.This voice is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly Furtado .... You Gotta Give It Up!","review":"Nelly Furtado has hardly any talent in the singing department. However, I loved this CD. The hits \\"Turn Off The Lights\\" and \\"I'm Like A Bird\\" have great beats and nice lyrics. Nelly's voice is a bit too harsh for some of the songs but thats OK because the songs are great and make up for it all.Overall: This CD is not \\"in\\" right now. I haven't heard of Nelly Furtado lately but I'm glad in a sense because this CD is the best of Nelly. The rest is probably going to suck. So if you see this CD you should buy it, unless you know, you hate Nelly Furtado. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"i agree with you","review":"I totally agree with the first review, but I have a few comments. The first instrument in \\"Baby Girl\\" is not a guitar, but a \\"berimbau\\" which is an old Brazilian instrument (this song actually has someone screaming something in Brazilian Portuguese). The song \\"Legend\\" is her dream come true of making an English-sung Bossa Nova. \\"Baby Girl\\" and \\"I will make u cry\\" are probably my favourites too, specially because of the Portuguese words in the latter. But I love \\"I'm like a bird\\" too. Such a bitter song. Does anyone listen and like to the Portuguese-sung songs like \\"Scared of You\\" or \\"Onde Estás?\\". I think the latter one is just SO beautiful. It is the only song in the album that is really about love, something we must honour her for, because most pop \\"artists\\" write most of their songs about love, because it's the easiest and most mechanical theme to write about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new and nothing fresh","review":"There is nothing new - style, beat, lyrics, look or obscenities.

What An Album","review":"I wasn't sure at first if buying this album would be a good thing or a bad thing. It has had many good reviews and much musical hype, but I didn't know if my spending [money] would be actually worth it. Now that I've bought it, I can actually say that it was. I give this CD a 4.5. It is funky, fresh, and at the same type truthful and real music. What I mean by that is \\"Whoa Nelly\\" is not the commercialized pop one would hear on the radio and get sick of. These lyrics are some of the best I've heard in quite a while. They should be easy to relate to for just about anyone. The CD is filled with great beats that will have you dancing, slow and fast.

Anyway, this cd has great music on it, with the hit songs like \\"I'm Like a Bird\\" \\"Turn Off the Lights\\" and \\".... On the Radio.\\" All of the songs have catchy phrases and sections in them that you just want to sing over and over again, because of how wonderful they are. Furtado mixes pop with a whole heap of Latin American music styles, and creates her own style of music that is unmistaskable. Then to top it all off Furtado has a powerful voice that she uses to express herself very clearly. The best part though once again has got to be the fact that she writes her own stuff. So kudos to you Furtado for performing your own written stuff, and to every other artist that doesn't rely on someone else to write their tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa Nelly , Whoa","review":"indeed, this is by far the best pop album I have ever heard. This woman can sing, and not just about shallow, and piddly meaningless things either.If your a fan of artists who write their own stuff, and have depth behind their songs, than you have no choice but to instantly fall in love with Nelly Furtado. And if you like music that cracks the mold of normality than this is also the cd for you. Using beats that resemble Trip hop, more than Modern pop; in most instances Nelly Blends a style she formed in the underground scene. With deep lyrics and a voice that is mezmerising to say the least. Everyone needs this album!Standout tracks include. 2. On the radio, 3. Baby Girl, 7. Trryin , and 9. Well, Well. Not to mention her smash singles , Turn out the light, and like a bird.P.S :And if you get the Chance to see her in concert don't pass it up! She might be the most gorgeous of all the popstars. Buy the album, see the show, you won't be dissapointed I promise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa, Nelly!","review":"This is an awesome cd. I got it for christmas and have listened to it 5 times already. My favorite songs are:I'm like a bird- an awesome song, she really shows you how her voice can fly.Turn off the light- She is so fantastic in this song. She really lets you feel what shes feeling... on the radio- Nelly is cool on this song. I think its about how the music industry is based on looks nowadays.Trynna Finda Way- this is my fave on the album she can make the song high or lowI liked this cd alotgo buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly is Hot. Period","review":"Guys hate it (Well some do). Girls love it. She gets compared to this and that - to Christina Aguilera or to Jewel. Everyone is missing the point. The point is Nelly is 100% original. Once I listened to her album a couple of times, every song came to life. And I am convinced this is just a start. This is not an empty stylized Brittney Spears. This is an artist that will be with us for decades. If I were to compare her to anyone it would almost be a modern Janis Joplin. Just watch out. Nelly is only getting started. She will dominate music for years. Madonna? No, Nelly is better, she is even more talented. I could go on. I am really blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly refreshing!","review":"Amazing2 girl!Do not be fooled by simple, hippie-ish, Lilith type cover. This album has got class!!How often can you someone this young fuse thesounds of bossa nova,urban, samba, electronica and pure pop into one delightful package. Standouts incl \\"Hey Man\\" with its catchy violin samples, \\"Baby Girl\\" with that tight rhythm and cute cooing, the bouncy \\"Well, Well\\", the soaring \\"Im Like a Bird\\", and also the beautiful \\"Scared of You\\" whwere Nelly sings part of it in Portugese.If you are a fan of quality music, get this album!And this is coming from a rock music fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is simply an amazing album. Furtado's sultry vocal style blends effortlessly into the silky, trip-hop-inspired beats to create a truly engrossing sound. A solid body of work where every track is equally listenable.Part of the reason why I dig this album so much is that it's eerily reminiscent of one of my favorite albums of 1998 - Esthero's \\"Breath From Another.\\" Beyond the fact that both have matured on the Toronto indie-scene, Furtado and Esthero have a sensual vocal quality that's reminiscient of many great female pop vocalists. However, Furtado and Esthero each have a freshness all of their own.Overall, this album shows great promise for super-stardom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Good","review":"I think her voice is too nasal and it grates on my nerves after a short time of listening. I also don't like the beat box-sounding music in the background of most of these songs. They seem to also lack direction at times and fail to flow as a song should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly's Best Album","review":"Even though they used the vocal enhancers (whatever that effect is called) on Nelly's voice this is her best cd to date. unfortunately when this cd was released, I don't think Nelly got the recognition she deserved, despite winning a grammy for \\"I'm Like A Bird.\\" Don't let this album pass you by, this is for sure worth $15."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly Futado's Album Reaches To My Soul","review":"this album makes me happy. i absolutely love it. its one of those albums you can pop in the c.d. player and just flow along with the music. this is well worth the money! i swear!!!!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good for a debut","review":"Nelly Furtado has an interesting voice that can get a bit annoying if you listen this album too long. But still this is a great album if you want to hear an unique voice and good lyrics. My personal favorites are I\`m Like A Bird and Baby Girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really nice debut","review":"I was really surpised by this CD. It has good songs on it, and I was impressed by Nelly Furtado's talent. This is one of those CD's you can really listen to, and not just program certain tracks. Actually, my favorite songs are not necessarily the ones that get the most radio play. Legend has a mellow groove to it, ...On the Radio , a real \\"chick\\" song, and I'm Like a Bird are all great, just to name a few. I was disappointed that Alicia Keys won so many grammys when Nelly Furtado and India Arie had stronger albums. Only one thing...sometimes Nelly Furtado's voice gets overly whiny and grating. But the song writing is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Music","review":"I grew up on the same music Nelly Furtado grew up listening to. I'm also a musician. So, when I heard this album it completely blew me away! She articulates things that I can't even touch base with. Her style is solely her own. It's hip-hop and jazz with a latin feel. Yet that doesn't fully explain her music either. It's definitely got soul, that's for sure.\\"Whoa Nelly\\" is the first album in a long time that has captured my attention. The lyrics are captivating -- strong and full of heart. And the rhythms are wonderful! Nelly Furtado is a musician and songwriter everyone should know about. And \\"Whoa Nelly\\" is an album everyone should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Heartstopping Voice.","review":"I was walking through Blockbuster Music when I heard the most melodic and strange voice singing something I'd never heard...and I had to ask who it was. Yep, Nelly. She has the most transfixing voice...you really could just stare out into oblivion and let her wistful vulnerable, yet determined voice cut into you. Her music always seems to have the influence of some place far away, but it's very slight...and the focus really are her tremendous beats and rhythms. It's not slow music, but not terribly fast...though it makes your mind race when you hear her."},{"rating":"2","title":"whoa, nelly!","review":"a contemporary of esthero (who lends her considerable talents to this effort) and dido, portugese-canadian diva nelly furtado soars on this debut album. never has a more quixotic collection of songs flowed so seemlessly from one to another. furtado's voice, that of a fearless and sassy pixie, is capable of working magick on genres as disparate as folk and hip-hop. engaging lyrics and compelling melodies combine to make this one unforgettable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice surprise","review":"I bought this album knowing nothing about Nelly Furtado . I am usually very cautious about buying albums , and like to have heard (and liked !) at least 2 or 3 of the songs first . I didn't expect to be blown away by the album , I just liked \\"I'm like a bird\\" . Well , the album has not left my player since I got it home ! Nelly is that little bit different from the others out there , and I think she has real personality . This album is fab !"},{"rating":"2","title":"NELLY FANTASTICO!","review":"Nelly Furtado's \\"Whoa Nelly!\\" is one of those rare cds where EVERY track is good. You can play this cd back to back tracks and enjoy every last minute of it. I will admit this cd took awhile to grow on me, but now I have almost memorized it, and I love to play it in my car and just keep it in the player for days! My favourite tracks on this cd are \\"on the radio (remember the days)\\", \\"well, well\\" and \\"hey man\\", but actually I love all the songs, they are just so darn good. One of the reasons I love this cd so much is becuz the songs are so insightful to me. It seems like Nelly is singing about everything im going through in my life, I can relate to her so much. I'm looking forward to hearing more from Nelly Furtado. Thanks girl, I love your album!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, Nelly is RIGHT!","review":"Somebody has to stop this girl from making one more bad video in her way out of style clothes and way out of quality music. Her voice has that jazz quality like someone who should be singing \\"All That Jazz\\" in some bad remake of Chicago. I found Furtado's voice so annoying that by the third track, I was already looking for my receipt to see if I could return this piece of utter trash. Every song gets progressively worse. Her best song \\"I'm Like A Bird,\\" made me wanna look for a BB Gun. I don't mean to say that it's BAD. It's incredible written, but her VOICE! The album's basic problem isn't the music, it's the singer. They shouldn't have wasted such good material on such no talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nelly Furtado???","review":"The little obnoxious lady is just as obnoxious as her music!And she just was that way at the grammys and gave a real poor rendition of her hit song \\"I'm like a bird\\" no vox backups, no music support except for an electric guitar player.I can't understand what is the hooplah with this cd and this canadian who is obviously not from there. I give her one star for vocal ability. ...and she could have come up with a stage name other than Furtado. To me she sounds like a 5 year roll having romp-around in the backyard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make the bad, bad song go away","review":"I know Portishead. Portishead is one of my favorite bands. Thisembryonic nasally chippy is NO Portishead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly Potato","review":"I don't get the hype behind this girl. She's pretty, and the song I'm Like A Bird is not bad, but the rest of this cd is a mess. It goes off in too many directions and tried to please too many genres in the music industry. That song Turn Out The Light is annoying with the lyrics: \\"bubbly bubbly bubbly go down down down we're gonna turn out the light\\". I mean who the hell wrote that, a little child? And that other single about her radio is just garbage and ending of the song hurts my ears. Nelly's voice is horribly nasal and irritating to listen to. I'm embarrased to be Canadian and hear people say she's one of the most talented things to come out of Canada in years. If that's the case then i'm scared. REALLY scared! They hype this girl is getting is undeserved. My prediction is one more cd from her and then no one will give a damn about her any more. Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame, Nelly. Your days are numbered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dug this one out after seeing the video........","review":"I was given this CD as a promational give away. After hearing the 1st track I ejected it saying to myself this sounded too much like a Fiona wanna be. Never listening to another track, I added this to a pile of my almost never heard CD's. A week ago I saw the video and went scrambling for this CD for about 2 hours. Ms. Furtado, I'm sorry for not giving you a second chance. After 4 months of no-play, this is one of my most played CD's of the past few days. I can surly hear the soul pouring off some of these tracks from this CD. I'm lovin this CD now.....oNe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa Nelly!!! 3/10","review":"Well I feel there was too much hype surrounding Nelly Furtado when her album and single were blowing up. But believe me the hype is all not that good to my ears. Her first single I felt was okay and I got the cd because I figured I would give her a chance but I only came across two songs that I enjoyed \\" ....On The Radio (Remember The Days) and the second single \\"Turn Off The Light\\". I think Nelly writing all the songs was pretty smart but the songs stink so she should've worked with a few known writers and producers. Hopefully on her next album Nelly works with better producers and gets others to write her lyrics, because it's obvious she can't write good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, great voice and grooves","review":"I cannot stop listening to this CD. I discovered this artist on Rolling Stones article of the up and coming artists of 2001. My favorite spanish artist Shakira was mentioned in it and I thought if they mentioned her then I will give the other artists a shot. I was disappointed by most of the artists they mentioned, but instantly loved Nelly Furtado. Like Shakira, Nelly mixes various different sounds so beautifully and the grooves are easy to jam to. I love her voice and her smart lyrics. Buy this CD it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So different but SO GOOD!","review":"This is a truly great CD. Like many others, I bought this CD for the single \\"I'm Like a Bird.\\" I've listened to the song about fifty times now and I still don't get tired of it. That song got me hooked, but the rest of the CD is equally wonderful. It's a surprising mix of so many different elements. You get pop, hip-hop, bossonova, Brazilian beats, and even Portuguese.Nelly pulls all her influences into this CD and creates something so unique. That's why I think this CD is a must have. I've had it for about two days and I know practically all the songs already. My favorites are \\"I'm Like a Bird,\\" \\"Legend,\\" and \\"Scared of You.\\" I also love the instrumental introduction on \\"Hey Man.\\" Nelly is a really great talent and this CD showcases that. Get it and I guarantee that you will be humming all the songs within two days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope on the Horizon of Pop Music","review":"Just under the candy surface of pop music there are several artists lurking and waiting to break free. These artists have a thing called talent, something not many out in the open have. Nelly Furtado is certainly one of these artists. This is one of the more ecelectic albums released in a long time. If you listen close you can hear an immensly wide eray of world instruments, even a didgeridoo! Jazz, tribal, new age, hispanic, african, pop. This album lets you see its surface at first and then has you come back repeatedly to absorb the total amount of elements inside. Like I said, artists like Nelly give an indication that this black hole mainstream music is in is about to end. Thank the gods of music for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Britney, cooler than Christina","review":"Nelly Furtado takes the pop elements of Britney Spears and mixes them with the Latin infused music of Christina Aguilera with a voice like Macy Gray spread on top. With cool Latin vibes and trip hop grooves, Nelly Furtado is one of the coolest female singers since Dido. Songs like \\"On the Radio\\" drip with attitude while \\"Party\\" combines Latin greats The Mambo Kings with the likes of Morcheeba and there is the subtle scratch in Furtado's voice on \\"I'm Like A Bird.\\" Basically, what it all comes down to is that Furtado is no amatuer and her album's title is quite true. Whoa Nelly, you're no average singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a wonderful album!","review":"nelly furtado's album \\"whoa, nelly\\" is a great eclectic album! i love how many of her songs open with a beautiful orchestral sound and then her catchy lyrics kick in. i love \\"i'm like a bird\\" \\"like a legend\\" and \\"i will make u cry\\" the best. if you are looking for a different sound but songs that are still catchy and meaningful, then \\"whoa, nelly\\" would be one of your best choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, genre-bending CD","review":"I was a little hesitant to buy this CD, thinking that the singles \\"I'm Like a Bird\\" and \\"Turn Off the Lights\\" were the only good songs on the CD, as is the case with so many pop albums. But there wasn't a single track that I have to skip (although I'm still not crazy about \\"My Love Grows Deeper\\"), and the different styles of the songs go together well. Sometimes the production can be a little too much, but it usually works perfectly with the songs -- it certainly isn't like the typical overproduced album in which the singer's lack of vocal talent is disguised by digital enhancement. Speaking of Nelly's voice, many people have complained about it, but I don't think it hurts the music at all -- it gives it its own unique quality. I definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes music -- her honest lyrics, diverse styles and subtle sense of humor make it a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey man...","review":"I love this CD! I put off buying it for a long time, either because I wanted something else or I didn't have any money. I had my doubts about it. Finally I got it and I love it. The songs are all different from a lot of the processed cheese on the radio today. Nelly's music is up beat with a world flavor. She blends different genres into one to make an impressive debut. I hope the radio stations play more of her music because it deserves to be heard by the general public. She has an interesting voice, but not Macy Gray interesting...Macy gray is just kind of...well you decide lol Give this album a try, it could open up new musical possibilities. Be open to new things and not get stuck in a rut that went out 10 years ago. If you only like one kind of music, your missing out. Be open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, Nelly! Worst album I evah heard!","review":"This is bad, bad, bad. I didn't like \\"I'm Like a Bird\\", and when I listened to the other tracks at Borders, I could not believe they were charging money for this. Bland background music, and Nelly's half-talking half-\\"singing\\" performance ultimately equate to something you, the reader, could easily produce at home with a decent keyboard and the voice of a heavy smoker female who hates everyone. For God's sake, if you are intent on spending your money, buy ANYTHING else. ANYTHING. Don't let Big Music keep foisting this inane garbage on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, this album [stinks]!","review":"The production quality of this album is horrendous, the sequencing and flow poor. Her mediocre attempts to fit into every genre leave only a taste of insincerity in your mouth. A good artist experiments with different genres and makes them his or her own. A bad artist tries to be everyone's best friend and ends up with an album that feels like it was put together by twelve different people on a compilation that doesn't flow well from one track to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, she's cute, but...","review":"I could barely get through this CD. The problem is not the composing or the lyrics, it's her voice! The girl sings through her nose through every song. With her accompanying herself on background vocals, it reminded me of a kazoo band. I did notice that on several songs, she drops the nasally tone in a few the background tracks, proving that she really can sing, but for some reason she chooses to sing in this annoying way.But she is adorable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHOA! Nelly got a record deal!","review":"Nelly. Nelly. She is very good looking. Like other no-talent girl-clowns (Britney, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore..i can go on.) Her good looks and simple-catchy pop-fizz lyrics are getting her by. And people are eating her up. Where have we gone in music today? Down...Low...Waaaay Down Low... music like this is catchy...but lacks any substance. Yo, props to Madonna, keep it real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alanis Morrisette, Part Deux","review":"That's right. If you liked Naked Gun, you'll like Naked Gun, Part Deux. That's how I describe this album by Nelly Fartado. Sounding like Alanis Morrisette is a GOOD reason to stay away from this. Although a few tracks are good, it's not enough to turn the entire album around. I feel cheated when I buy an album and only one or two songs qualify as singles and the rest blow. Do yourself a favor and just listen to your little sister scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising debut but I will catch ya in a few years","review":"I was intrigued by the song \\"like a bird\\" and decided to take a chance on this album. There are a few standout songs, like \\"legend\\" and \\"Scared of You\\". She is daring in her vocal acrobatics however, some of the trite lyrics tend to get in the way.The album seems bogged down by too many conflicting influences and not enough depth. Nelly Furtado has a promising voice but I think that she will need a few years to grow as an artist. This is a pretty good album. If I picked it up a few years ago I would love it. The sticker prides her to be in the same veign as Fiona Apple but the voice is the only thing that is vaguely familiar.I will catch Nelly in a few years. For now it is back to my Fiona Apple cd that never fails to inspire and capture the deepest depth of emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hit Wonder","review":"Nelly's song \\"I'm Like a Bird\\" made me fall in love with her. It's an amazing song, I just couldn't get enough of it. However, and this is a big \\"however\\", the rest of the album is absolute rubbish (I'd like to use more powerful language). When you listen to the CD, \\"I'm Like a Bird\\" stands out by a mile as the only song worth listening to. All the other songs are like nursery rhymes, with really immature and stupid lyrics, they're very poorly written. I got so annoyed with the CD that I ended up using it as a frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK! Buy the single instead!","review":"I fell in love with 'I'm like the bird' only to be crushed with how lame the rest of the CD was. It's cross between music that sounds like it came from a synthesizer type keyboard with lyrics written by a freshman. I literally can't stand to listen to any other song on the CD besides 'I'm like the bird' - which is a truly great song. I guess this is one of those one hit wonder type of deals. At least in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"i feel like a traitor for giving her even one star","review":"am i a ... or something? honestly, i can't understand why anyone could like this garbage. nelly seems promising, but her songs lack any interst or flow. its all different, in a bad way. if you thought one song was good, chances are youll hate all the other ones. i really would like to be fair and say everyone has different tastes but this just ...! thank you for your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa Nelly!!!!!","review":"This album is so full of funk and everything good.I love it,great debut 4 a true talent fav song is onde estas.Nelly u rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really only one good song","review":"Turn Out The Lights is an amazing song. The lyrics were catchy & the beat is addictive. I was disappointed when I heard the rest of the cd only to find out no other songs were even remotely similar to this. The others are either just bland or have a strange rhythm that isn't my style. I'll probably add this song to my mp3 collection but forget the rest of the cd - it's a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her music, it grew on me!","review":"I'll admit when I first heard \\"I'm Like a Bird,\\" I hated it (It's tolerable now). I do like both versions of \\"Turn Off the Lights,\\" though I am more partial the original rather than the Timbaland. Well last weekend I was at a dinner party and this CD was playing. Well I liked what I heard. And I decided to buy it as soon as I found out who was playing. To my surprise, I found out it was Nelly Furtado, and I've been hooked since (I still skip over \\"I'm Like a Bird,\\" but the rest of the CD is good listening)."},{"rating":"2","title":"untouchable","review":"This is a must have album for anyone who likes music no matter what your taste. \\"Whoa, Nelly!\\" has everything.... awesome beats (very eclectic), clever lyrics, and every song is filled with soul. Nelly Furtado is the one to look out for in the months to come. This album is essential!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better as just a single","review":"I bought this CD for that ONE song I heard on the radio and liked. If you're looking for others as catchy and good as \\"I'm Like A Bird\\", you won't find them here. The rest are slow and boring and I felt robbed that I paid $20 for one song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Have to agree with the other reviewer - did not like the language on the cd at all. Felt it should have contained one of those stickers on the front for explicit lyrics. Totally turned me off of the cd. I'm not a prude, but going by the two songs on the radio, I'm Like a Bird, and Turn off the light, thought this would be a nice cd. She has an awesome voice, too bad she sings songs like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Weird For My Tastes...","review":"Take my review with a grain of salt, I'm in no way saying this is a bad CD or a bad artist (I actually think Nelly may have potential). I'm just saying I didn't like it at all, personally. I think she kind of reminds me of a poppy/youthful Jewel or Alanis. Her songs have messeges, I'm sure, but I don't understand many of them. And her lyrics verge on two extremes; either laughably corny and simple (\\"I'm Like A Bird\\", \\"I Will Make You Cry\\") to just weird (\\"Remember The Days\\"). But I do admit that \\"I'm Like A Bird\\" is pure pop bliss, a happy-go-lucky uptempo number with a beautiful orchestra opening and a catchy chorus. Nelly has a scratchy, deep and soulful voice, she reminds me a little of T-Boz from TLC. I didn't enjoy this record, but if you like adult-contemporary pop, you might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Voice??!!","review":"I first came across Nelly Furtado when she performed on Letterman or some other late night show. I was immediately intrigued by her apparent lack of any talent - her moves were amusingly awkward and her voice actually worse than the average person's. So much so that I had to check out this album. Well I guess it's passable music, but kudos to the sound engineers. If you see her live, you'll probably know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Canadian Britney Spears Who Writes Her Own Songs","review":"So this girl writes her own songs. Who says that just because you write your own songs you instantly have talent? I saw her acceptance speeches at the Juno Awards and find her to be obnoxious and immature. I'm Like A Bird isn't any more original than half the garbage out there today. I don't want to disrespect anyone who likes Nelly's music, but she just isn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeeech!","review":"I have to say first that I don't own this. I know..I know..so why am I complaining? I listened to it at work one day and thought it was awful. What really prompts this review is the cacophonic warbling I am hearing right now on the Diva special on VH1. It's amazing how anybody nowadays can get a record contract. \\"I'm like a bird?\\"...yeah maybe a bird that has been caught in some power lines. Sorry Nelly..good try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa Nelly is an Awesome ALbum","review":"Nelly Futado produced a fabulous debut album! Most people probably buy the CD for her big hit \\"I'm LIke A Bird\\" but others like Turn off the Light and Trynna finda Way and WEll, well are awesome songs as well. I love every song on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"50-50","review":"Half of this CD is good and the other half was wacked-out strange. The first six songs are really, really good, but the rest just seemed to lack. But with this said, the first six songs are worth buying the CD for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but it's the truth.","review":"I know that I am going to get some negative feedback on this one. But I do have something nice to say. I bought the album and really wanted to throw it out the car window. I loved the single, like everyone else, but the rest of the album literally lacks direction. Nearly every song sounds exactly the same. The beatss are cool, but for how long. I do think she is creative and does have a powerful voice. I also have to credit her for writing her own stuff which is always impressive to me no matter how bad the song is. I will wait and see what she comes up with next. the nice thing that I have to say is that I did see her open up for David Gray and she is much better live than on record. Hopefully she will be able to incorporate her stage presence into her sophmore effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's created a new genre of music...","review":"After hearing \\"I'm Like a Bird\\" and seeing the awful music video, I expected the rest of the songs to be the same. Hah! Shows how good I am at assuming. Each and every song on this album is different. Each one has its own special sound to it. This talented artist mixes pop, rock, a little R & B, and adds a Spanish/Latin - or Portuguese, for all I know - touch. And if you're sick of \\"I'm Like a Bird\\" or didn't like it at all, fear not. The other songs are extremely different from it. I mostly love this album for being so different. Her voice helps a lot. It's unlike anything I've heard, close to a moan but not quite. It's quite beautiful and intriguing. So I would say, give this a go. Being far more talented and original, Nelly Furtado is anything but a 'pop princess' but a wonderful, creative musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly is best new artist this year!","review":"I can't stop playing her Cd! Some of my favorite songs are scared of you, a beautiful ballad. I'm Like a Bird, the 1st single off the album, with great vocals and almost Erykah Badu feel to her vocals but with a Latin flavor only Nelly can bring. On the Radio, a very spunky song with a R&B flavored guitar riff. Baby Girl, a great song with a Latin beat. Heck the whole CD is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"shockingly good","review":"i just saw nelly furtado at the area one festivel and she blew me away. I was quick to dismiss her as another 20-something pop act, but she is so much more. Her music has so many different sounds, and her lyrics are well written. you should check out this cd it has something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Woah!\\" is right","review":"Nelly Furtado's freshman release, \\"Woah, Nelly!\\" is amazing! Furtado shows great potential at becoming the next big thing. The CD's best song has to be \\"Hey, Man!\\", mixing a bit of everything into it. Don't mistake Nelly as just another Britney, she's most definitly one of a kind! I strongly recommend you pick up this album if your looking fun music, uplifting beats, and great lyrics to sing along to. Go Nelly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' it in Portland","review":"It's a fun CD with good lyrics and original sounds. Nelly borrows alot from other artists but makes it her own. Her voice works well over the wide range of songs on this album. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spunky & Eccentric Debut.","review":"I fully admit that I have not listened to new types of music in a long while. I'm a fan of 1960's & 70's British Rock & Motown. I did not care much for the music of the 1990's. In \\"Whoa Nelly,\\" she bares all in her songs. swirling melodies, & open emotions, give her tunes a blend of bossa nova & folk pop. Her restless vocals kept you listening, even though the repititions grew tiresome. She reminds me a little of the alternative music from the 1970's with a 1990's twist. I liked \\"I'm Like A Bird & Turn Off The Light\\" the most. She certainly sounds like an artist that has some staying power."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just what you hear on the radio","review":"After putting it off for a while, I finally got this cd. I was scared to do so because I thought that it would be all poppy songs the way \\"I'm like a bird\\" is. (I like the song - but I wouldn't like a whole cd of them) WOW! This cd is so full of energy, that \\"bird\\" is probably the least of it's accomplishments. You feel while listening that it is musical gumbo - mixing all kinds of flavors in a beautifuly harmonious way. After hearing songs like Baby Girl and Trynna Find a Way - I am utterly glad I picked this up. Further, the only reason I score it a four rather than a five is that I know she's only going to get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical world view","review":"Simone captures the magical world view of the Native American better than any other author I know who does not romanticize the conflicts of the American West.To begin to understand a value system and set of traditions that allowed these people to live in harmony for thousands of years causes deep reflection upon our Anglo culture.As a scientist, Simone knows that magic will never triumph over a brute force armed with scientific knowledge and scientific technology, but he may be suggesting that it is too bad that it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yellow Cat","review":"Basically, I did not think this was a very good book.

They continue to bring intelligent Sci Fi with stories and characters that bring a true Sci Fi fan back for more. I loved season one of Primeval and season two although shorter than season one continues to hold my interest. This season introduces us to new characters and has us say goodbye to some others. We also learn more about the Anomolies and see possible future anomolies as well as the familiar past. There's also rival government agency interference to worry about too as if the anomolies and Helen weren't enough. With a cliffhanger ending, I can't wait for season three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primeval Rules","review":"Primeval Rules...as my son would say!!!! He loves this series and it goes right along with his interest in cryptozoology. I even like this series and watch it with my son. We do miss some of the old characters from the first series, but the new characters has added a new angle to the show. Looking forward to Season 3 (or 4) since the British number is differently than the American production."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent tv show","review":"Primeval is a pretty decent tv show. It will probably never be a classic, but you could do a lot worse.The acting isn\`t great, but better than you find on most tv shows these days. The writers are not bad either. Not great, but atleast the stories and plots are entertaining and (mostly) make sense. That in itself sets this show apart from most of the glopon modern tv. The special effects are pretty good for a tv show, but with decent stories and plots the show doesn\`t have todepend on them. A good story will always beat flash/bang special effects any day of the week. But a good dose of both doesn\`t hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great continuation of the series!","review":"While a shame Cutter was killed off, the new guy was a good addition to the crew.

It is just too infuriating to become interested and then to find that there is no resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last of the \\"really good\\" Primevals","review":"This one started off with a really good opening episode, a rift opening inside the British Museum, ( apparently filmed partly inside the museum) and lots of great location bits. If you liked Vol. 1 get this one because due to budget problems the last two rounds (Vol. 3) were filmed in Ireland and that really hurt \\"the look\\" of things, not to mention increasingly weak scripts. I liked it,but having killed off half the characters by season's end (and another character gone by the start of Vol. 3) makes me glad that at least the creatures were still well done.I wish this country would do shows like Primeval was at it's best, I'll miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good so far","review":"Package looks good.

He likes the action and story line of this program. However, there were only 3 discs in Volume 2, and I thought the price was a little high for the number of episodes. If there had been 4-6 discs, like in most of the American programs, I would have been much more satisfied. All in all, it was a positive experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Jumbo cot failure","review":"First time I used the cot on my camping trip the middle leg supports buckled and bent upward, I sat down on the cot to lay down and the leg gave way.

I am very disatisfied with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three strikes, you're OUT","review":"Like the other two reviewers, this item failed the second night I used it. Sat down to lie down and the middle leg just folded to the ground. I am 320 lbs so should not have been pushing the 500 lbs claimed rating.Unfortunately having a very difficult time returning the item as well so that adds insult to injury.Just a note, even if the cot had lived up to its claimed load limit, it is really not very practical. It IS comfortable once you are lying down, but it is too tall. I am tall, six foot six, but sitting on this cot, my feet do not touch the ground so I can imagine shorter users would really have an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap knockoff","review":"I totally agree with the other reviewer that this cot is way overrated. It's made with cheap, way too thin, materials. The center rod down the middle is because without it, this cot would sway back and forth even worse than it already does. Plus it's too tall so getting on and off is way uncomfortable on the underside of your thighs. Traded it in for the TETON Sports version.

And as I work at the Royal Library I find the descriptions of the house and its personel very amusing - and quite accurate...The author mixes fact, fiction and detective story elements in an entertaining way, he is a very witty and learned person who spices his concoction with bemused commentaries on this science and that philosopher...

This book has a lot of humorous and entertaining facts about the show, but it doesn't really make you think about the show in new ways. One of the great things about LOST is the way it invites viewers to create meanings of their own as they watch. From visiting a couple of the fan sites for the show, I know that most of the fans for LOST are incredibly intelligent, creative people who want a read that will stimulate their thinking about the characters in the show, the meanings of the \\"ancestor texts\\" in the show, etc. And for me, this book here just didn't cut it. I think it's pretty cool that the show is generating so much interest now in books about the show, but if I had to choose only one book, I'd pick Porter and Lavery's book. In my opinion, it is the better read, while this book here is clearly the \\"other\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST: The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to ABC's Hit Series LOST News, Analysis, and Interpretation","review":"I have never been so disappointed in a book. I love books and can almost always find some saving grace for any book. However, this book has so many typos, is double spaced (thus making it about 100 pages rather than 300), and, in my opinion, really doesn't come up with any new insights or ideas about the TV series. Another unauthorized guide, Unlocking the Meaning of Lost: An Unauthorized Guide, by Lynette Porter and David Lavery, is far superior.

They refer to Jack as \\"Jake\\" and even \\"Nack\\", have mismatched verb tenses, forget to finish sentences. I don't think there was a single page without an error on it. Each chapter starts with a plot synopsis that is basically the same as you can read on a million web sites. That's followed by a few quotes, a theory from the fans - again which you can find everywhere online, a \\"Sawyerism\\" - which is a list of nicknames he uses for other characters in that episode, and then the \\"Seven Degrees of Lost\\" which reminds us of really important things like \\"Rose and Jack sat next to each other on the plane\\".

If you are reading this, you have an internet connection... so use it to access the vast amount of FREE information out there. Take the money you would have spent on this book and search Amazon for one of the numerous books/stories that have been referenced in LOST/ or inspired LOST: The Third Policeman, Occurance at Owl Bridge, The Wizard of Oz, Stephen King's Dark Tower Series or The Stand, Bad Twin, Watership Down, etc. Buy one of those books from Amazon; you can thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost: The Ultimate Embarassment","review":"I am so glad that I was not the one who paid the money for this book. In fact, I am probably going to treat to dinner the person who bought this book for me, because they wasted their hard-earned money. They should have added \\"Unedited\\" into the title. This book has so many typos and flat out mistakes that I was embarrassed to read it sometimes. I'm not saying I'm the best speller but come on, if you're publishing a book at least have the foresight to proof-read it. There is even a point when the book names the same character, even though they are clearly talking about two different people. Aside from the apparent 3 mistake per page minimum the authors must have imposed, the book offers barely more than information that can be found in most any other Lost book or on the internet. Overall, this book is a waste, and should not have been allowed to be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!!!","review":"For the price this book is a huge waste of money.

The briefs on the historical periods during which these editorials were written could be improved with a little clarity on the author's part.Though this book was compiled in 1997, women are absent from this collection.

It's boring. Five two-page spreads (with one flap on each) attempt to recreate an edition of Elmo's World -- talking to Dorothy and a baby etc. -- but the result is kind of a mess. The text is supposed to be chatty but it is ill-suited to reading aloud. For example, one spread reads \\"Let's ask the baby how to catch a ball. Thank you, Baby! Watch Elmo catch a ball. Like this! Gotcha! Can you catch a ball?\\" The cardboard on the flaps is flimsy and easily bent out of shape.This is not an evil book, but it was disappointing and I don't think we'll get any more of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but poor construction","review":"I bought this book for my 1 year old niece, and she loves it! Any book that has flaps is a sure-fire hit with her. However, this book's flap construction doesn't live up to the rigors of a 1 year old. She's torn off 2 flaps already and she's only had it a month. I wouldn't consider her an extra strong toddler, nor is she hard on her toys, but the flaps in the book just aren't strong enough. For that reason alone, I'm giving the book 4 rather than 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only so-so","review":"This book is \\"all right\\"...but I much prefer \\"The Inflammation Syndrome, by Jack Challem, which came out first. Both books cover much the same material, but I think The Inflammation Syndrome does a better job of connecting the dots between dietary imbalances (caused by eating too many junk foods) and inflammation. It also recommends a very clear anti-inflammation diet plan, with easy to follow guidelines and recipes, as well as a number of well-documented anti-inflammatory supplements, such as the omega-3 fish oils, gamma-linolenic acid, antioxidant vitamins, and B vitamins. In addition to describing the big picture of inflammation, The Inflammation Syndrome also focuses on the top 20 or so inflammatory diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and arthritis, as well as inflammatory athletic injuries -- each with specific recommendations for eating habits and supplements. At the very least, you might consider getting both books and synthesizing their advice to suit your needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book just doesn't deliver","review":"I have developed a chronic inflammation and have been doing research. The title sounds good but it is totally inadequate. It's an easy read but adds very little true knowledge. There are several relationships to foods, spices, and herbs to relieve inflammation and very little is covered in this book. All of the author's credentials and nothing new. Lose weight, eat right,become a vegetarian, get your sleep, be happy is too simplistic. Still it's a good start for those at the very beginning of the road and those without any health knowledge or common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"- book has missed a fundamental point","review":"There is nothing new in this book and from an asthmatic point of view- it misses the most important aspect of reversing inflammation. There is very little mention about controlling hyperventilation or overbreathing.

We bought it for our daughter when she was five months old. Hey, it's never too early to start laying the foundation!The book is constructed of study board pages - they have held up very well to six months from our baby. The artwork is superb - every page seems captivating for our baby. The simplification of Wilkinson's \\"Secrets of the Vine\\" is masterfully accomplished - every line rhymes. The first page of text gives the reader the New King James Version of John 15:1-2, 5, 8, and 16.The thing I like best about this book is that every time I read it to my little girl I get a refresher of the Secrets of the Vine myself. It is a wonderful reminder to me that I am to bear fruit for God's glory - I hope and pray that my daughter will be a part of that harvest.I heartily recommend Secrets of the Vine for Little Ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe Everything you Read","review":"Dr. Ide should be given credit for his very easy-to-understand writing style. However, if you're looking for a fair and balanced portrait of Bush, you won't find it here. I was disappointed that Dr. Ide was apparently unable to look past his political views. What a pity he should conduct what seems to be very expansive research but chooses to litter his writing with personal sentiments.

These chapters cover a broad range of public policy issues (environment, education, tax cuts, religious right), which Mr. Bush acted on during his short but turbulent career in Texas. For anyone stunned by recent ultra-conservative administration policies that seem at odds with Bush's 2000 campaign rhetoric, this source illuminates the historical origins of America's most recent resident of the White House. It may also suggest that the most dramatic policies are yet to come.

He was a first-rate journalist in his younger days, and it shows. His economy with words and syntax is a marvel. Not a word is wasted, not a sentence tortured. Beyond that, the story is gripping and poignant. Just, like Greene before him, re-creates Vietnam on the page in a way that makes it startlingly real. The characters not only fulfill their symbolic function but also engage the reader on a human level. Finally, this is the book that makes you really feel what America did in Vietnam, as the U.S. is clearly the \\"Dangerous Friend\\" of the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor imitation of greater works","review":"I got two things from this novel; That the author likes A) France, and B) Anonymity. The narrator never emerges, but chronicles the activities of the protagonist beautifully. And that's the crux of the problem. Greene's (IMHO much better) novel, The Quiet American, did not allow for neutrality or pacivity on the part of the characters, or the reader. Just's novel allows for a certain level of detatchment that does not fit. This novel never surfaces any issues in any way that makes the reader question what they'd have done differently. And this detatchment is far too safe for the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Just's best book.","review":"I found A Dangerous Friend sexy and sad and incredibly moving -- you feel the ignorance and idealism of the volunteer Americans who come to Vietnam just as the war is beginning, and the terrible consequences of their ignorance. A stunning book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there","review":"There were some interesting aspects to this book, most especially the decision by the author to focus on the early days of the Vietnam War--a topic not discussed nearly enough. That being said, I nonetheless felt that the characters and storyline were underdeveloped. He could have gone so much deeper with this. I never felt I fully understood the characters, that is the deeper complexities undoubtedly harbored being in such a unique situation. In fact, I could not believe it when I realized I had only 50 pages left to read. It seemed like the story was just beginning to develop."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare gem","review":"The reader (at least this reader) is left amazed, ashamed, angry and very moved. Few recent novels have had such an impact. Ward Just has captured an era when so many Americans were Candides, wandering unwittingly about the world, little knowing the havoc their innocence would cause. This is one title for the permanent collection, but it doesn't bear too much thinking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This trio comes with three really pretty shades in it, but the lightest (and biggest) shade is barely noticeable. Perhaps it's just my skin tone, but you can barely see anything when you use the lightest shade, no shimmer or anything.I end up using the shade on the far right as a lid color, the middle color in my crease and the largest shade on the left as a highlight for a nice smokey brown look. That seems to be the only way that this trio really works well for me, and unfortunately that's a bit dark for me for everyday wear.When I do use though it looks great. The shades aren't super pigmented, but they're wearable and nice and they blend well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Britpop at it's okayist","review":"Kula Shaker were never my favourite band, but I like a few numbers they did and purchased this CD.

Gorgeous songs like \\"Heaven\\", \\"Objective\\", \\"Slow Dance\\" and \\"Love In The Night\\" should have made this CD a best-seller but the changing state of Urban R&B at the time coupled with inadequate promotion and publicity prevented Miles Jaye from becoming the superstar he should have been and this album from becoming a bigger success."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate soul balladier","review":"Miles Jaye (who was born Miles Davis but changed his last name for obvious reasons), started out as a soulful, deep-voiced soul singer in the mold of Teddy Pendergrass. On this album, he throws in some funky, new jack-swing style to go along with his already great singing. This is best exemplified on the title track. The best song in my opinion, however, is the smooth, laid back \\"I'll Be There\\" which was a #30 R&B hit in 1989. In the ensuing years, Miles Jaye started concentrating mainly on jazz, and in that venture he has tried several times to perfect the title track from this album by rerecording it in a softer jazz context, but I still think it sounds best like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a favorite","review":"In the fifth grade my class read this together and we absolutely loved it.

There were a lot of real feelings that I liked because I have experienced. This book also has a lot of real tradgedies that I have experienced ( well some of them anyway). There were also some humerous parts in it when Jess is being funny ( but I don't think he was meaning to)These are some things I disliked. There is a sad twist which made me start to not like the book. I also wish there was more about the school.

It was bitter and depressing, and left me with a more negative worldview. To me this book was about a damaged boy finding someone who could truly understand him and bring light to his life, only to have this happiness savagely torn away from him.

I can't tell you the plot though, because that will give away the ending, but I can't do that. This book will also never have the word isn't in it just the word ain't. I know it's good to have good voice in the story, but it over uses it. It would be different if it was in 1st person, but is in third, and they all talk like hillbillies. If the story took place in a swamp in Louisiana that would be different, but it doesn't, plus it's in the 1970's when the English was more developed. Please do me a favor, and don't read it.

I played with a pack of little boys, and I knew the worst thing that could happen to a person was for someone to see you cry. When friends were reading Bridge to Terabithia and reporting it as a sad, sad story, but very, very good, I ran away from it as hard as I could. We even played Terabithia in the woods together and I pretended not to mind not knowing the back story. Now I wish I hadn't waited 30 years to read this book. There's pain here, true, but also beauty and the hidden memory of what it was like to be 10 years old.

This book was required reading for her during the summer months and we decided to read it together. It is a wonderful story. It is nice to find a book that children can relate to on their own level, ie: nicknames given to teachers and the conduct of siblings. Because those things ring true throughout the book, a child can sympathize with other aspects of the story.Books are wonderful things - they allow us to reach into our hearts and transcend our own lives.

One thing I liked about this book is that the auther made good converstions between Jesse and Leslie.Another thing I liked about this book is that the auther gave Jese and Leslie such good imaginations.Jese and Leslie made an imaginative land called Terabithia.The story line was also great.There are also somethigs I didn't like about this book. One thing I didn't like about this book is the tragedy that occurs .It just caught me off gard.I also didn't like the sisters in the book because they anoyed me and got in the way all of the time.Another thing I didn'd like about the book was that I didn't like how the auther lacked diskriptivenis in the characters in the book.I highly do not recomend this book to anybody . A reason I don't recomend this book to anyone because its not deskriptive and the sisters are allways in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, uninteresting characters","review":"I have to teach this book to fifth graders. It seems this book was written solely to deal with death and the grieving process. I have no problem with it for independent or recommended reading, but not for whole class reading. The plot is very weak and the characters uninteresting. I, too, was annoyed by the excessive profanity (especially the use of the Lord's name).

This book was so boring. This book was boring because it had no point to it. Usually when I read I can understand what the authors message but in this book I could not. There's one part of the story that I didn't like and that is when Leslie and Jess built Terabithia I didn't like it because I didn't understand it, and I hope as read on to page 100 the book wiil began to get more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultra bad book!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Bridge to Terabithia is a realistic fiction by Katherine Paterson. The setting is in Virginia in the 70s. The main characters are Jesse and Leslie. Jesse is a boy who is trying to be the fastest kid in 5th grade. Leslie is a girl who just moved next to Jesse from Arlington and wants to be Jesse's friend. Those were the main characters. The plot is about a boy who wants to be the fastest runner in 5th and he meets this girl and becomes friends with them. Together they create the magical land of Terabithia. When faces a tradegy he relizes the strength Leslie had given him. This is indeed a boring book!I would not recamend this book. Personally I like books with action and funkey names and this book does not have an ounce of it! The only thing good about this book is that there is alot of forshadowing.

Parents are clueless that this book contains numerous uses of the Lord's name in vain as well as profanity; discontented and despairing children in an uncaring world; a pointless death with no redemption; and warped theology. As if that weren't enough, the book dispels the children's happy myth of Santa Claus (...there wasn't enough money to buy my little sister presents from Santa at Christmas), and a confusing sexual reference when the main character's sister tells him to look away while she's dressing (...I realized that she thinks I'm enjoying it).

Finn\\" or some other Classic, why waste our kids time on this stuff.This comes from a womans point of view and maybe that is why women enjoy it.

I think that the girls liked it more than the boys. My favorite part in the novel is in Chapter 2 wherein Leslie and Jess, the two main characters, meet.Katherine Patterson did a great job at writing the novel.She should make a sequal to this book, and it would be called Bridge to Terabithia II.

It has stayed in my memory because I disliked it so much. IT begins well, as a coming of age story between two friends, a boy and a girl, in their imaginary world. Then, just when the reader thinks what a nice and uplifting book this must be, it seems as though the author doesn't know how to let these two friends grow up together, or grow apart, or whatever they might realistically do, and kills off the girl. I don't think there is any reason for this, and certainly, kids in late elementary/early junior high feel bad enough about life in general, and themselves specifially.

Jess Aaron's parents are horrible parents and his sisters are the same, except for Mae Belle. The only uplifting point in this book is when he meets Leslie Burk, but that also ends tragically. I do not believe that the author did enough foreshadowing for the awful event that happens near the end of the book. It was a total shock! She could have done a better job warning the reader ahead of time, especially because this is a children's book. One of the main reasons that children read is for pleasure, and there is nothing pleasurable about this book. The tone was extremely sad throughout most of the book. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I like Katherine Paterson as an author and it is well written, but I really think she has many other better books out there.

As you seep further in to the world of Jesse Aarons, you find that a major disaster is about to occur. When you read on, you find the most important thing about this book: you find that no matter how much crises or disaster comes your way, courage and hope always seems to find it's way to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The book Bridge to Terabithia is a great book.

It was SO boring. I hate stories about idiot kids who make up fake places and think they're real. Or fake people or things, etc. It was a HORRIBLE book. I had no interest in it and every day when it was time to read I got SO upset because I did NOT want to read it! It was a HUGE waste of time. The only reason my class liked it is because there are some swear words in it and we thought it was funny to hear our teacher swear. Honestly, I don't know why we had to read it and why the teachers keep making us read it. Even if there is a good message. If the kids aren't interested in a book they won't retain it and won't understand the message. We kept reading it just so we'd know it would be over eventually. Among the other books I had to read in school that I hated: Maniac Magee, True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, Tuck Everlasting, and MAROO OF THE WINTER CAVES!

The book hints at some action between the two characters and some inhabitants of Terabithia, but doesn't get very specific.

The genre of this story is realistic fiction. Jesse Oliver Aarons is a fifth grader at Lark Creek Elementary School who lives in a small town located near Millsburg, Virginia. To be the fastest runner in the fifth grade is what Jess fantasizes about. A new girl named Leslie Burke moves in next door to Jess. This will change everything and Jess just shrugs it off like it's nothing. On the first day of school Leslie outruns every boy in the races at recess, including Jess. This sounds like a horrible start for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie become such great friends that they are together all the time. Leslie is seen as an outkast to others, but Jess likes her for who she is and her great imagination. Terabithia is an imaginary kingdom that Jess and Leslie create. This kingdom is a secret place only they know about. One day a tragedy occurs. Jess now realizes the strength and courage Leslie has given him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge to Terabithia","review":"The novel Bridge to Terabithia is a realistic fiction written by Katherine Paterson. It has two main characters, Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke and how the two misfits develop a wonderful friendship. They live in the Lark Creek community in the 70's. Terabithia is a magical kingdom where Jesse and Leslie are the king and queen.They can go there to feel safe, to have fun, and to make their friendship even bigger. Even though Jesse and Leslie had a great friendship, a terrible tragedy tears them apart. But Terabithia lives on.I think that this novel is outstanding. The things that I liked about this book are that it is a good novel about friendship and magic. Also, I disliked the part of the book when the tragedy happens.

I think it's good for others kids my age to read.This book is about a boy named Jesse and a girl named Leslie who created this place called Terabithia. Any enemies around them in their real life would become enemies in Terabithia. Jesse and Leslie had difficulties in their lives but they straightened them out. At the end of the story Jesse built a bridge to Terabithia in honor of Leslie. They were good friends.I had a lot of feelings about this book. I was sad because in the end something shocking happened to Leslie.

Terabithia becomes an escape for both children, a treasured and sacred place where worries beyond the banks of the stream no longer exist.You feel Jesse's pain as he is faced with a tragedy beyond measure. His tears are your tears. I know they were mine. The pain and anguish is real, his guilt is overwhelming. This is the first book in a while that has made me cry.Yet, even though the tragedy is so real and melancholic, Jesse's overcoming of his sorrow is the real gem. When you finish the book, you are left with a feeling of fulfillment, a joy. It's a sort of happiness that, even though life can be unfair and bitter, it will always go on and those who are gone never really leave us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge to Sadness and Strength!","review":"The Book I read is \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\". It is about Jess, a boy who wanted to be the fastest runner in the 5th grade. Then a new girl comes and her name is Leslie. Leslie beats Jess and all of the other boys. Leslie and Jess become great friends and they build Terabithia behind Leslie's house. Then one day Jess goes to Washigton, D.C. with a teacher, while Leslie goes to Terabithia. Leslie dies that day because as she was swinging across the creek the rope snapped. Leslie falls into the creek and drowns. At the end of the book Jess moves on from Leslie's death and gets new friends, but he never forgets Leslie. I rated this Book a *4*star book. I rated it that because it was easy to understand. It's not the best book in the world but it is still a good book. You can see what the author is trying to say. I can also picture Terabithia in my head while I was reading.

I have read many books. Written many stories. I'm a student in high school, and I still remember crying over this book when in grade five. It was so beautiful. Such strong friendship in this book...but then, like everything else it was lost. I believe the presence and way DEATH is portrayed is very wrong in this book. Death, as always, is portrayed with such strength and power, while hopes and dreams are shattered. I do not think a child should read this. It sends the message that nothing is real in the end, for death takes everything away. If you believe children should 'learn' about death then let your child read this book, but if you like to teach your child that hope and love truly exist in life then I do not suggest this book.

(I'm still reeling from THAT revelation.)This book was a birthday gift somewhere in the vicinity of my 12th birthday, and it is the one of the few books (from youth) I've kept into my adult life.Paterson weaves great intricacy into her characters. Themes like insecurity, loneliness, and peer rivalry in the pre-teen realm are articulately revealed. It speaks about loyalty and friendship, even in unlikely circumstances. The tragic aspect gives the story timeless depth.My edition features elegant blank ink watercolor illustrations-a great complement to the text.It's unfortunate that this lovely book has been elevated by educators to \\"must-read\\" status. That apparently is the kiss of death from a young reader's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Real, Emotional kind of book","review":"When I first read the book I thought that it was just an ordinary school book that the teachers read to you. But it was different because I could easily picture what the author was putting together. You could just visualize what was going on. The story was about a boy and a girl who made of this club. They pretended like it was a castle and they were king and queen of it. they build a little bridge to put over this river so they could get to the other side. They started to like each other and the boy also had a crush on his teacher. His teacher asked him to go to an Art Gallery Museum with her. Then when he goes, a real tragedy happens... But thats up to you to find out if you read the book. My favoriye part was when the tragedy happens. You'd never know that something like that would ever happen to kids so young. The end is very sad. It might even bring taers to your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cut Above What You'd Expect","review":"This film, made in 1986, is an enjoying flick. I don't agree that the musical score is overbearing or way out of date. It fits the time period well.Moore and the rest of the cast do a fine job. I especially enjoyed Moore, as she channels the personality of Laura Petrie from the classic Dick Van Dyke show. Christine Lahti plays Sandy, a woman who has a bit more in common with Moore and her husband, played by Ted Danson, than she thinks. The dinner party where they all meet (together with a very young-looking Sam Waterson) is quite amusing. It's also fun to see Waterson play a character very much different from his very somber, deliberate role in 'Law & Order'.Then tragedy strikes, and the two women confront each other in a new way.(I also want to mention how attractive and fit Ms. Moore looked in this role. She was 50 when she made this film, and in her stint as an aerobics instructor, she looked 20 years younger.)Overall, an enjoyable film.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to 'ambient' before there was such a thing","review":"Art of Noise scored some brief MTV airplay off this album in the mid-80's, then quickly faded away from America's music charts. That is unfortunate, as this album is one of the first of its kind. An amazing blend of true 'ambient' sounds (trucks, tractors, radio broadcasts) and electronica, Art of Noise was years ahead of the acid jazz and house music that we all take for granted in the 90's.Any fan of electronic music should check this out. Very relaxing at times, complex, and singular in its originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great watch!!!","review":"Boy was I happy to see the look on my husbands face when he opened this for Christmas.

I'm more then a little happy with this purchase, and would not hesitate to tell others how happy we are with this watch. I don't think he will find another one like it, anywhere around us anyway.

The story is about a small town with a coalmine and the conquering forces trying to get coal out of the mine. My issue with this story is that it was written in such a pedantic way that you never seem to make any progress. And at the end, are you no further along than you were at the beginning (you still have people being occupied).

The songs come directly from the movie. It is like they recorded the songs off the movie as the movie played. You hear the voices of the cast on this soundtrack...... I thought it would be more of a music soundtrack with full length songs and it definitely does not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mississippi Burining","review":"I loved this movie, especially the background music.

Russell's description of Nietzsche is laugh out loud funny and makes it hard to take him (Nietzsche) seriously ever afterwards. It is easy to see why the Bloomsburys were frightened of Russell's scorn and wit and avoided intellectual debate with him (and these were some seriously smart, snarky folks).Second, the book contains little less than the history of western thought. As daunting as this thick tome can appear, it is a far quicker read, and far more approachable than to read the collected works of thousands of years of the world's greatest philosophers (a term Russell uses liberally, expanding it to such figures as Byron for his influence on the tone of the time).If you like philosophy, or biography, or history or just want to know what all the fuss is about, and want a great read in the bargain: run, don't walk and buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive.","review":"A great overhaul. For those interested in the stages philosophy has underwent, it is very comprehensive and readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobo Philosopher","review":"This is clearly one of the best concise overviews of the major philosophers and what they had to say. It is right next to Will Durant's \\"The Story of Philosophy\\" on my reference shelf. Russell is witty, rational and easy to read. He makes many difficult concepts simple. This book is clearly written for the general reader. If you want to get difficult he has other books for the more advanced. I'm not trying to learn everything about all the philosophers but rather a little about some of the more famous. This book is perfect and objective. I am aware of many of Russell's controversial personal opinions and none are detectable in this work as far as I can determine. This is about classical philosophers and their philosophies. The general reader can not miss with this purchase.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame it is so popular","review":"This book is horribly biased and even downright wrong in many places. Recommended only for people very experienced in WEstern philosophy who are able to recognize and see past Russell's biases. This is a good book for a quick reference for writing papers, but DO NOT read this book to get a general understanding of philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too detailed for Introductory book","review":"My goal with this book is to get better understanding of what philosophy is. I found this book going into too many details and it was a hard read for me. If you what to understand the development of philosophy that could be a good book, but not as introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD HISTORY","review":"This \\"History\\" was a true disapointment. I had heard how wonderous this volume was, but upon reading it myself, I found it to be thoughly lacking in history and accuracy in depiction of the philosophers depicted. This has to be as bad as Durent's work on history of philosophy. I woudl give this book away, but I don't dislike anyone that much. Russell's depiction of previous philosphers was selfserving at best. All philosopher were to lead up to his philosophy. This books only should be used as a doorstop or kindling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable introduction from a non-theistic perspective","review":"I have enjoyed Russell's fluid style of writing very much and this single volume History of Western Philosophy is a good quick reference and relatively easy reading for anyone interested in the subject matter. Many works of this nature tend to be laborious and thus discouraging to a newcomer. Russell's book is a joy to read. Regardless of some personal differences in his treatment of certain philosophers I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not even finish reading","review":"This book, although admirable in its intention to place philosophy in its historical context, is too biased to be helpful and even factually in error. The fact that it is an introduction is particularly disturbing as his extreme biases and factual errors would not be noticeable to people who are not familiar with the philosophies and historical records he sites.I am quite familiar with Classical through Hellenistic philosophy and was hoping to educate myself more on philosophy of later times. Yet I found his treatment of the areas that I am familiar with so ill portrayed and actually in a few places factually wrong, that I am not sure if I should continue reading as I do not trust him to explain other areas that I am not familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and wholly partisan introduction","review":"Russell serves up a good read that will enable the intelligent layman to feel they know something about philosophy. His bias is obvious from the start and I imagine anyone who actually reads this book will be previously aware of it. The most refreshing debunking of Plato, Aristotle and other Greeks encourages the reader that philosophy is not the fossilised subject, unable to escape from the shadow of the ancients, that it once was."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON SKECHERS!!","review":"This was the 3rd time I bought Skechers, and I was very leary. I bought myself a pair a couple years ago, and in a very short time the elastic which acts in place of laces broke across the top. I NEVER wear out shoes. I own too many.Then I bought my 4 year old light up ones, and the lights in one shoe burnt out w/in 3 weeks. I've had Walmart brand shoes who's lights were still giong when the shoes wore out!Now a week ago I bought these shoes at Kohl's for my 10 year old, who begged me for them because the commercials are so cool. He wore them to school the first week. Friday he came home, and the stitching had come undone on the elastic strap on one of the shoes. I returned them today, and I will NEVER purchase Skechers again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look. Run a little big.","review":"This is a great looking shoe. However you can probably order a 1/2 size smaller than you normally would because they run big, true to all sketchers. My son was running into school and his foot slipped completely out of them.

I had a hard time putting it down. Nancy Drew to Mark and Neil's Hardy Boys?

The author Sophia Loren gives her opinions gently but firmly and she makes reading about her life both entertaining and informative. Here are some of the chapters:Some Thoughts on BeautyThe Pursuit of Beauty (in which she covers discipline, hair, skin, make-up, fashion and style, healthy diet, and exercise.)The Mystery of Beauty (in which she covers charm, men and love, pregnancy and motherhood, tranquility, and coming to terms with age.I certainly think any woman interested in beauty, especially women over 30 years of age would find much useful information in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction on Virtualization","review":"This was a good read on virtualization and was a good introduction to VMware products and Microsoft products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea!

Any old coffee mug would do just as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Progressive","review":"This is one of those rare albums that takes a couple of listens before you \\"get it\\" and then becomes one of your essential-to-life classics. My initial \\"yeah, great album\\" turned into a whole new understanding after a few spins and it's quickly become my all time favourite album. It has everything: brilliant melodies (for which Arena are famous), amazingly gripping vocal performances, not only by the main vocalist Rob Sowden, but the backing vocals are fabulous as well, fascinating lyrics (puts most other concept albums to shame), great sound and album artwork you'll want to use as wallpaper - on your actual walls! This is the ultimate \\"if you're going to buy one album this year\\" recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I purchased Arena's first album, Songs from the Lions Cage, when it first came out and was very impressed. I later bought their second album, Pride, and was so disappointed that I wrote off Arena and forgot about them until recently. I decided to give them another chance and picked up Contagion... and I'm very glad I did. This is an excellent album! The music is very melodic, emotional, diverse, and well polished. Although the music has it's own unique style, it has similarities to Marillion, Pendragon and Pink Floyd, although in general Arena is a bit heavier and edgier than those bands. Highlights: Spectre at the Feast, Bitter Harvest, Riding the Tide, Mea Culpa, Cutting the Cards, Ascension.After listening to Contagion, I completed my Arena collection and was also impressed with their other work. I still think Contagion is their best album but would also recommend Songs from the Lions Cage, The Visitor, and Immortal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"After reading the reviews posted for this album I decided to give this a spin. Some reviewers suggest that this will take a few listens before sinking in, but that was not the case for me. Nice guitar work, plenty of keyboards, great rhythm section and wonderful vocals make for one of the most refreshing albums I've heard in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2003!","review":"This CD amazes me.

Not one state of mind has concluded to liking it. This is as stale as month old bread.This actually sounds like a band was asked to write a caricature of a neo-prog rock CD. I keep buying each CD they release hoping it will all come together.Ingredients: Chunky rock-driven heavy riffs with the \\"angelic choir\\" keyboard on every song when the riffs kick in. A good singer in Rob that insists on over-singing with that Shakespearean theatric tone. This was like listening to mid-80's Sabbath or some other cheesy gothic rock band. I like Pendragon. I like IQ, Marillion and most of the bands that fit into this genre but this stuff is outrageously average.

I was dumb enough to buy both their EPs without hearing them first, based on all the reviews I'd read. BAD JUDGEMENT on my part. Weak and completely lacking in dynamics despite what any reviewer has stated. Not bad as much as just plain weak. The guitarist likes to let you know they own a flanger pedal...on EVERY song. Pour on the reverb and pair it all up with weak lackluster rangeless female vocals singing lyrics that sound like they were written by a community college art student trying too hard to be profound. Track down an old Strange Boutique album or Slowdive CD instead if you like this formula, they do it much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was introduced to these guys by a college buddy from Jersey...","review":"This is one class act in rock & roll...they are top notch musicians of the highest order and this is the place to start your collection...they ain't pretty but they get the job done and man, do they ever get the job done. A friend of mine whom I worked with in college radio turned me on to the track \\"Papa Poppa\\" with the comment, \\"Does this not sound like it'd be a GREAT Guess Who tune?\\" I closed my eyes and listened, and I was hooked immediately. Over the years I've lost a few of their other albums but managed to hang onto this one...I'm rebuilding that collection now that I know I can again!

Despite his creaky pipes, the man was at his best with nothing but a six-string and an urgent need to sing. This retrospective collection is a good overview of his life's work. He left us too soon. The songs work their way into your memory and stay there--the kind of music that gets you through the night. Like any compilation, this one isn't perfect, but it covers the span of his career, featuring the standards for which he was famous and some lesser known gems. Fans often note the dark side of his music, but there is something wonderfully affirmative in many of these songs--the tenacity of a human spirit that overcomes the darkness by naming it and refusing to quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has been ruined!","review":"I heard one song from this CD on the radio, Viente Anos. I thought the whole album would be similar: beautiful, old fashioned, and moving. Instead, the first 12 tracks were totally defiled by being 'modernized' with a modern giant band/orchestra added in electronically. How stupid and infuriating.

If you have to go out of your way to claim you're a celebrity, then you simply aren't a celebrity (Take \\"Fitness Celebrity\\" John Basedow for example). In the same way, if you have go out of your way to claim that the Post-modern Evangelical movement is relevant, then you're claim for relevancy is simply not credible. The Christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years. However pop-culturalizing Evangelical Christianity isn't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when Sandi Patty or Carmen ruled the Christian top 40. Does the fact that some Christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Relevant For Anyone","review":"I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but in a Society and culture that has lost all site of God, Christians need to take a very careful look at the contents of this magazine and the doctrine and philosophy behind it! I have seen it, and reviewed it, and have talked to many that have, and we all find it VERY offensive in how it portrays Christian principles and the Gospel message. The Gospel message is portrayed very loosely and un-emotional, while Christian principles are very frequently mocked or belittled. Articles in the magazine as well as advertisements make Christ's death on Cross little more then an irrelelvant event. This might be an ok magazine to show your teen or teach someone how to be discerning with God's wisdom and the Bible, but it is NOT a magazine that should be addressed as an awesome reverant picture of Christianity in God's eyes.

Her potential is still climbing, there is great stuff to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing stars","review":"After listening to this CD you'll be seeing stars. This woman bounces in a big way.

This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor story and quite racist","review":"Apart from quite a poor plot and weak story which, as most of the other readers commented, has the sole purpose of getting rid of Jason, the writers obviously have never been to Lebanon. Maybe they would like to know that Batman has a lot of fans there and all this story did was alienate them because of its prejudice and racism! Can't you stick to fictitous places and keep politics out of it guys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't blow your money on it.","review":"This book is an awful excuse for comic book writing. In it we find the second Robin, Jason Todd, in a search for his biological mother. He goes off to other countries to search for three possibilities. And both Batman and the Joker end up there for different reasons.After going through the first two women, Robin and Batman find his real mother. Then Batman goes off for a little while and Joker shows up and kills Robin and his mother.The lowest point in this is when Joker becomes the ambassedor of Iran. Which means Batman can't touch him. Superman tries to keep him in line.Truly bad, though it gets a star for the emotion showed by Batman, this should be skipped by comic fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important to Batman Timeline, but that is the only reason to read","review":"First, I want to state no graphic novel is going to get five stars from me. As much as I enjoy Batman, to give any of them five stars would be a stretch. After all, how many are on par with Twain, Fitzgerald, Hemmingway, ect.So, with that said, I have to state this is even poor for a graphic novel. The plot line is weak. The story itself is weak. If not for the killing of a key member in the Batman family, this would be unreadable.In other words, read it for the time line within the Batman realm, but do not think that you are getting a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time will tell","review":"It's been a while since the publication of this comic. A dreaded re-read only confirmed my very poor opinion of this comic.

So this story, being the worst Batman story ever, doesn't stand a chance. Robin was voted dead by Batman readers, and they pinned it on the Joker. If Batman ever finds out he's going to beat his readers down. You have been warned.Also Jim Starlin is the 14th worst mainstream comicbook writer of all time. (My super-computer did the calculations.) He's right below Steve Englhart and right above that Mraz guy who used to write Green Lantern. I wish my super-computer wasn't such a geek!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Homicide!","review":"The Joker killed Robin...maybe not Robin I,who was too old to be a Boy Wonder-but Robin II,who was too headstrong to be a truly efeective Boy Wonder. I wouldn't have had it done that way-but the genuine death of a lead character(so rare in comic books)adds more realism to the world of super heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic tale of loss and murder.","review":"This chapter in the Batman Saga is one of the best yet also one of the saddest. Batman has to deal with the loss of his second partner and it takes him over the edge (as seen in A LONELY PLACE OF DYING).Starlin's portrayal was realistic in such a way that it could not be distinguished from what happens in real life"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest, yet saddest Batman stories ever.","review":"While this story's fate was determined by Bat-fans, it is still a great book, featuring wondrous art by Jim Aparo, and the adventuresome writing by Jim Starlin. A shocking story which made the Batman into a different man, severing his ties with the concept of Robin, as well as his pseudo-friendship with Superman."},{"rating":"2","title":"1-800-NOROBIN","review":"Forget about the setup, this is an important story in the Batman mythos, the death of Robin II. Written with two possible endings in mind, the story affects continuity for years to come in the comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Best","review":"This is without a question the best Batman story I have ever read. Jim Aparo and Jim Starlin and Mike DeCarlo are the team for Batman. I would seriously reccomend buying some of the issues this great team did together. This creative team is also responsible for the '' The Ten Nights of The Beast'' storyline introducing the KGBeast. The aforementioned issues also have Mike Zeck covers so they are expensive. Back to the matter at hand this book is incredible and it puts The Joker in a class of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This simply has got to be the most important event in Batman","review":"What would Batman do if something were to happen to Robin?Well,finally,we have an answer.This is a must-buy for any comics fan.This is a completely new way of doing a comic!I loved it.It's got something to it that others don't,maybe Batman's silent grief,maybe the Joker's ultimate revenge or maybe the power of the story.If you see it,buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is very exiting and suspenceful.","review":"IT IS GOOD, I THINK IT IS A VERY INTERESING STORY.

I was particularly shocked to learn that the components of protons and neutrons, the building blocks of all atom nuclei, where the mass of atoms is concentrated, have very small rest mass so that practically all proton mass comes from Einstein's formula E/c2=m. In a sense we are all ethereal criatures. The other shocking idea regarding the Higgs particle, hopefully soon to be discovered at CERN, is that the Universe acts as a superconductor.However, the book is a collection of articles written, if not for experts, for scientifically sophisticated readers and laymen will find it hard to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track listing for this CD","review":"Legendes D'Or de la Chanson Vol. 1Disky #DC 866722Tracks are:1.

Waste of Money and Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected","review":"This book reveals valuable insights about the nature of each zodiacal moon sign, especially as the signs apply to men. Yet it's useful for more deeply understanding the moon signs in both genders. The perceptive nuggets of information contained in this simple paperback are more valuable than many longer relationship books I've read. The book is slightly mis-titled, as the information given is not sensationalistic or exasperated with men as the title suggests. It's down to earth and practical -- as well as potentially transformative for relationships if taken into account! I'd like to see another version of the book titled to get men to read about themselves. It's all well and good for women to gain these insights about men based on their moon signs, but relationships will further improve when both men and women become aware of and take responsibility for their lunar natures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but my EARS are bleeding...","review":"First, let me say I have NO PROBLEM with the content of this film. It is entertaining and educational. Plus, I love the idea of a female Hispanic role model for children. My problem is that I cannot stand the VOICES of the children on this video. They speak in the most extremely loud and shrill \\"broadway style\\" voices, I literally had a headache listening to this video after 15 minutes.Let me add here that I am an ELEMETARY SCHOOL ART TEACHER by trade, so I am very used to children's voices, especially loud ones working in my room, out at recess, in the cafeteria, etc. It's not that my ears are overly sensitive. When I went to work,I listened to children all day every day. And 95% of my days I did not go home with a headache.

Apparently when they edited and \\"simplified\\" the textbook nobody bothered to update the workbook. As a result, the workbook references incorrect page numbers in the textbook, and asks you to know words that no longer appear in the vocabulary lists of the text. This series also emphasizes learning kana and kanji more than other beginning books I've seen, which can be good or bad depending on why you are studying Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help practicing the language!","review":"I had this as an assigned text, along with the actual textbook. The practice is really good, but sometimes the exercises would drag on, and I'd think, \\"how many times can I practice this grammar lesson??\\" If you can get the kanji into your practice sentences, you'll get some better practice.

I do have an older Mercedes (1969), and I do my own work, and practically nothing in this book was helpful. There are some common problems that are covered, like replacing the rear sub-frame mounts on the swing-axle rear ends, or how to fix the climate control sliders that often break on older models, but this is all info that's available on the internet for free - with better photos! The factory shop manuals are very expensive, but if you're looking for a way to fix a specific problem on your specific model - they're the way to go. One other option is to buy \\"Glenn's Mercedes Repair\\" also available on Amazon (I did, and I love it) - for an older Mercedes reference, it's the best $13.99 you'll ever spend, and it was better illustrated and photographed than the Haynes manuals to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"New DIYer Review","review":"I am new to car DIY an hence to Mercedes DIY also.

The novel contains a range of human experiences which are woven with beautiful language and keen insight. The reader is reminded of Dickens as the foibles, cruelty, ambition and nobility of the players in the story are developed. The rich writing and examination of issues still of foremost concern (human cruelty, racism, bravery, sacrifice) will entrance the reader of literary fiction, the rich detail and authentic depictions will be of great interest to the armchair historian.

Apparently they've never used a REAL digital camera. Admittedly, the price is cheap. But so's the quality. The image quality is really bad, even for the low resolution. There's no zoom. There's no preview screen, and you can't delete bad shots. It eats through batteries like wildfire. The images aren't stored in a standard format, so you can only download them through the camera, not through a MMC reader. Now that wouldn't be so bad, but unfortunately, the JamCam software is quite unstable and crashes often during the download, which means that if you have more than about 40 images on one card, you'll never manage to get them out.Overall, I can only recommend you to stay away from this camera unless you really only need a toy for your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"JamCam has Multimedia Card Problems","review":"I own a JamCam 3.0.

It's a great teenager camera (which is obviously the entire point from just looking at the camera packaging itself and the name) because it's cheap and it does the job, but if you're looking for any pictures from your trip to France that you can look at 10 years from now and sigh over with your kids, this is not the camera.

It charted the conflict and confusion that the restoration leaders went through in discovering truth. Sometimes, I think that people in the church believe that thousands of people simply read the Bible a few times and agreed on every point of doctrine. This is certainly not the truth. The search for truth is difficult, taxing, and rewarding. There was significant debate concerning baptism, atonement of Christ, and even the divinity of Jesus.

Wlson (of Procol Harum) on drums and incredible guitarist Cliff Goodwin. I've heard Live tapes of most of the songs on this album, and they put the recorded versions to shame. Ruby Lee, especially, boasts one of the greatest guitar solos (by Goodwin) that I've ever heard. The cold, mechanical sounding rhythm section and uninteresting instrumental work on this album are the reasons for the lack of excitement.

The actual maps are well illustrated and generally easy to understand. The paperback version is easy to handle with only around a 100 pages. There is a good index at the back and the contents are also clear. A few of the maps are complicated and require quite a bit of concentration to grasp.

It starts out with an untenable premise. That is, the president of the United States can't fire a CIA director on his own accord. Then goes on to the usual plot line of an out of control goverment agency & it's director. He even takes the obligatory slap at the republicans and even that doesn't help the story. I found this book to be rather shallow and boring. Very unusual for an Archer book. I have enjoyed all of his other books.

Each character jumps from event to event without the smallest inkling of how any of this could possibly happen.

The Eleventh Commandment was the first Archer book I had read. I read for hours at a time and had to force myself to put the book down on several occasions. I will agree with others that some plot lines are less than believable, but let's remember, this is a fiction novel! Give the author a break! Not every single detail can be explained in every single line of text. After reading this novel, I sought out other Archer books, settling on Kane and Abel. This was an excellent book, which none of the Eleventh Commandment naysayers would find any fault with. However, several inexplicable outcomes in this book were the same as any other book.

For Archer fans( a category to which I also belong) I would advise better not to read the novel, and remember his thriller writing skills based on \\"Shall we tell the President\\" and \\" A matter of honour\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read but ultimately unsatisfying.","review":"How much you enjoy this book will depend on how much of a stickler you are for realistic plot resolutions. Many of the ways the author comes up with the plot twists are absolutely absurd. Case in point: the President's Chief of Staff must have had some incredible mind-reading training, because he sure as hell wasn't reaching conclusions grounded in any form of logical deduction or analysis with which I am familiar. Still, the pace is pretty quick and the characters are interesting enough to hold your attention for the long plane ride it will take to read the entire book. This is no \\"cracking good read\\" but it is better than being stuck in a center seat watching \\"Waterboy,\\" that's for sure..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly thought out attempt at entertainment.","review":"This book neither flows nor entertains. Parts of it are so poorly written that any attempt to understand the plot, or to try and visualise the characters are pointless. The characters are one dimensional, and scant in description.

His characters are unbelievabe, the plot dreary, his style monotonous. Maybe I've read too many similar books but I found it totally predictable. The ending is just too convenient, and rather obvious at that. All in all, a rather dissappointing book, but JA must be given credit for straying from his tried and tested formula..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eleventh Commandment","review":"Archer weaves a suspenseful tale of a CIA hitman who ends up double-crossed by his own Agency.

The chief protagonist(connor fitzgerald) is the the c.i.a's most deadly weapon who is on his last assingment before he retires from the company.After a successful mission in bogota the president orders an inquiry into the death of a leading presidential aspirant in bogota. Hellen dexter, the C.I.A boss discovers that the company's action might be exposed and the only way to save her skin is to do away with fitzgerald(the man who carried out the assingment). To dispose him, he is sent on another mission in Russia to assasinate another communinst presidential aspirant and from there its a hair rising drama that can only be left to the reader to find out for himself. the book is highly reccomended to those in love with international politics and the dreaded cold war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawless pageturner...","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

Unfortunately this had neither. With the exception of a grand sacrafice made for the main character by his best friend.Gone from this novel was anything that showed that the author honestly had a clue about the world he was writing about. From the unbelievable two dimensional director of the CIA to the sheer ignorance and gullibility of the hero's family this book leaves the reader wishing for more meat and less sizzle.If you a GOOD spy story, check out Clancy's latest Rainbow Six.If you want a children's spy story then perhaps this will suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, but not Archer's best","review":"After taking time to develop the plots in many of his books (Honor Among Thieves, As the Crow Flies, etc.) Archer writes this book as if he is coming up to a deadline and has to meet it.

The plot of the novel is tired and has been done before and since the collapse of communism in Russsia, a lot. The plot has to do with our hero being set up by his boss to kill the Russian President so the CIA won't have to face anymore budget cuts. Also, they want our hero out of the way so he can't squeal to the president about covert operations. If you have not read Jeffry Archer before, do not start with this novel. Almost anything else he has written is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Havent read yet","review":"I have not yet read this book, but find that paying 11 dollars for a book 200 pages long deplorable, especially when the print version is going for less than half that.

Archer is a true master of his genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy reading it at all.....","review":"Its Funny to think a person such as Jerrery Archer who has written books as Kane and Abel {which is almost a legend} to write a very mediocre book such as The 11th commandment ... The book starts off well but then it starts to the stuck in the same place for long moments and this is very frustrating and boring ...in short after i finished this book i felt very dissatisfied at the story and the very predictable ending that this book has...ahhh thats one more point the book is extremly predictable all the way .... I will not recommend this book .... look for another book from JA or many other good fiction authors ,i am not going to write a list here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read on a par with Archer's other books","review":"I found this to be a quick and enjoyable read. While not up there as my favorite Archer book (Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less), it had all the elements to keep me interested. With the fall of the Soviet Union, I worry that there might not be enough bad guys for today's fiction, but fear not, we learn of the Soviet mafia and one CIA agents loyalty to his president."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next best thing to being there yourself","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading 12 Red Hearrings and this was even better.

This was my first book by Archer, but it has definately inspired me to read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"Okay, why take everything seriously. Some of the people who wrote reviews need to stop being such stupid pendantics. This book is great fun, and had a very sad, touching moment. Although a lot is far-fetched and crazy, its still quick, interesting and engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book full of characters.","review":"I was totally engulffed when reading this book. This is my first Archer book and he did a generally great job. I liked the depth of the characters and their reactions to situations. I found myself making audible remarks to the way Connor's wife reacted. I also like the idea of the politics in Washington being leaded by the CIA. All of the political conspiracies really intrigued me. The only downfall was some predictability. Archer set up many surprises and I figured out the gimic a good majority of the time which is a rarity for me. I am a person that doesn't figure anything out ahead of time so this was a little predictible. Overall, a well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again, Archer delivers another fast-paced thriller!","review":"Jeffrey Archer created great characterization and the reading public will admire and sympathize with the hero and his family, while steadfastly dispising the antagonist and her cohorts. All the characters were believable. The feeling that developed in my gut reminded me of my fear of heights, boarding a plane or waiting up for my daughters when they were late arriving home from a date. I recommend The Eleventh Commandment to everyone who loves reading thrillers and suspense. You won't be disappointed. For those of you who don't enjoy thrillers, just try this one and you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eleventh Commandment","review":"The first Jeffery Archer book that I have read .

For some totally inexplicable reason, the aptly self-named \\"Idiots\\" at Mad decided to downsize Mad About The Fifties to 6-1/4\\" x 7-3/4\\" (48 square inches), a little over half the size of the original magazine. The print is much smaller, as are the drawings. In reducing the size of the drawings, much of the original detail is lost.

Soon after her arrival and through the spring of 1773, Anna kept a diary of her daily life, advances in sewing and writing and dancing, and social engagements. It's not scintillating, but it is a nice look at the everyday life of a young girl at the birth of the American Revolution. You will learn a lot about the lives of the 18th century well-bred women. Parts of it are unintentionally funny as the Puritan Anna, despite the religious imprecations to modesty, is just as fashion-conscious as any modern teenager.At barely more than 100 pages, Diary of Anna Green Winslow, A Boston School Girl of 1771 is definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apsolute Waste of Money","review":"What a waste of money.

Ronnie's guitar work is rip-your-hair-off incredible in this album, and I'm tempted to buy a second copy, because I know I'm going to wear this first one out. Earl's sense of the blues obviously comes from a lifetime of listening to his mentors and perfecting a clean, punch through style of his own.

I struggled to finish this mind-boggling farce thinking it might finally get better. Nope. Coonts not only avoids any serious character development in this made-for-TV gag, but also blissfully skips over any research into the nature of the people in the jobs he writes about. This lends nothing but a total lack of credibility in what these characters can accomplish, given their backgrounds and their government positions.

The chic \\"Unlimitedd Capacity for Love\\" and \\"Apple Stretching\\" are chillax disco classics too, which can still make it to a chill-out compilation , or a great background music for a chic house party. And Grace's vocals are also amazing, as she sings smoother than her previous vocals on disco albums such as \\"Fame\\", where she was singing notes more edgy and sharply. This album is great for fans and for those who met Grace with her new album, and wonders why she still sounds fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this","review":"I love this and other Grace Jones songs when she sings with force and demands respect for herself and her natural singing ability.

The songs are a good mix between boogie woogie and slow blues. Although I like Ronnie Earl's guitar playing and he is truly a master, I like his guitar playing better as part of the song versus the centerpiece of the song. Therefore I liked the songs with Jimmy Rogers singing better.Call it my age, but hard driving, loud electric guitar blues is just not for me. Give me a great soulful blues singer, like Jimmy Rogers, backed up with an acoustic or slide guitar any day.Jimmy Rogers is one of the all time great bluesmen and in this album he is backed up by a great guitarist - Ronnie Earl, harmonica player - Sugar Ray, and keyboardist - Dave Maxwell.This is a great album, worthy of six stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to Jimmy Rogers' Chess Recordings Instead","review":"For fans of electric Chicago Blues played by white guys who are Blues-Rockers, this is probably a great album. However, for people like me, who love the old Blues from the 1920s and '30s, and the classics from Chess Records, this album is a pure snoozefest. When I was fifteen years old, I would have loved the endless solo-ing on this album. These days, I'm looking for what I look for in the great Country Blues records of yesteryear: story-telling, meaning, emotive vocals, and, sure, expressive guitar playing.

If you're a fan of hers, this movie might be worth catching on TV just to see one of her earlier roles and hear the accent she does, which I thought was pretty well done. But other than that, there is no reason to watch it. The jokes are lame, the story is just rehashed, poorly written modernized Romeo and Juliet. The characters are flat and you have to reason to understand why these two fell in love, except for a physical attraction, and you find even less reason for their parents eventually agreement. Overal a huge waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renee Taylor is # 1","review":"This is the funniest movie. I just happen to find it while channel surfing.

One of the few songs on which she sung this strongly on is her 1987 Pop/R&B/Dance song \\"I'm Not Perfect, But I'm Perfect for You\\". Overall, I give the album a B-.

This is SO CAMP it should have come with a bag of marshmellos for toasting and a merit badge for anyone capable of sitting through the entire thing. The singles of course I still like.

But reading this book is a little like listening to a friend who enjoys malicious gossip -- embarassing, distasteful, and finally just boring. I get the feeling that some parts are whomped up; she's trying to raise questions that the facts don't justify raising. But mostly there's an edge of bitter glee here -- as if she's enjoying anything negative she can dig up. This isn't the kind of writer with whom I enjoy spending time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An alternative","review":"As I read \\"American Bloomsbury,\\" I found I lost confidence in it. For those with an interest in the Concord of the period Ms. Cheever is discussing, \\"Alcott in Her Own Time,\\" edited by Daniel ShealyAlcott in Her Own Time: A Biographical Chronicle of Her Life, Drawn from Recollections, Interviews, and Memoirs by Family, Friends, and Associates (Writers in Their Own Time), might be a more useful choice. In addition to the many contemporary views of Louisa May and her family, there are vignettes of the Emersons, Thoreaus, and Hawthornes; reminisences of Julian Hawthorne and Edward Emerson are included. There is an excellent general introduction, as well as introductions to each of the individual pieces--all very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book after hearing the author on NPR, but I am thoroughly disappointed. The writing reminds me of student essays shoddily constructed out of poor Internet research. Beyond the factual errors other reviewers have mentioned, the narrative is sloppy and needs a good edit. At times she leaves out critical information, referring to characters she has yet to introduce. She must not have thought anyone would read it to leave it in such a state."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Bloomsbury Disappointing","review":"I couldn't resist buying American Bloomsbury by Susan Cheever because the subject matter fascinated me. It's about the lives of several renowned American writers in Concord MA in the 1840's, including Louisa May Alcott, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. While the historical facts were indeed fascinating, I found Cheever's writing style to be more like a term paper than what could have been an inspiring and involved account of an amazing intellectual group of individuals who came together and influenced the literary history of our country. Even worse, as I pushed myself through the book, the time line and relationships were presented in a very confusing way, jumping back and forth over the course of a few years. I was glad to read about these incredible writers' lives, but I wish it had been in a more engaging and organized format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I agree with all of the previous reviews in stating that a lot of the facts are wrong. I'm currently reading The Concord Quartet: Alcott, Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau and the Friendship That Freed the American Mind by Samuel A. Schreiner Jr., and it's a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sympathy for the slavers","review":"This is an interesting book--about more interesting people.I must say that I find Ms Cheever's sympathy for the slave holders, antipathy for the abolitionists, and down right disgust for anyone who was moved by John Brown very disturbing. Her heart goes out to the 5 men executed by John Brown in Kansas, but not a word for those who died in the middle passage or more directly as a result of the 'peculiar institution.' She finds it difficult to understand why the Transcendentalists could have been so mislead. They weren't. John Brown was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste Of Trees","review":"Why does this site insist that I give one star to this unscholarly slander? The author was wise to pick on dead people who can't sue her! I suggest historical romance of the heaving bosom variety would better suit Ms. Cheever's mind set and meager talents. One star? Don't make me laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"I cannot recall reading a more poorly written -- and edited -- book. With such tremendous potential in the subject matter and the obvious interest Cheever had in making the characters come (back) to life, it is a shame this book was published before it was really completed. Some fact checks (see other posts by people more knowledgeable than I) and significant rewriting may have made this book readable -- and even enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG disappointment!","review":"After reading Megan Marshall's engrossing book about the Peabody sisters, I was intrigued by Susan Cheever's 'American Bloomsbury' and borrowed it from the library. Thank goodness I didn't buy it! A 'nice early review' quoted on Cheever's website (without a source) described the book as a \\"dishy romp\\" with the \\"Concord gang\\" and, indeed, Cheever has managed to turn one of the richest, most fascinating periods of American life and letters into a cheesy bodice-ripper. And it's so poorly written! Although Cheever purports to teach writing at the graduate level the book is full of cliches such as \\"Alcott's voice reached out through the century,....drawing characters that seem to come alive on the page...\\" or clunkers like \\"Thoreau...had already written a lot and graduated from Harvard.\\" Written a lot? After Marshall's vivid, nuanced and thought-provoking depiction of this circle, 'American Bloomsbury' is an embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This is really more of an historical novel; it reveals more about the sad state of the author's mind than it does the lives of any of the literary giants associated with Concord. American Bloomsbury should not be allowed to be classified as nonfiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cursory look at literary figures","review":"I had high hopes for American Bloomsbury after hearing Susan Cheever interviewed on NPR. Some of what she wrote was interesting and new to me, but overall the book was not satisfying. It was interesting to read biographical details, especially of Thoreau and Hawthorne, but I felt that she was just scratching the surface and not really delving into her subjects' lives or works. She also has the annoying habit of adding uninteresting tidbits about her visits to the authors' homes or towns which don't really add anything to the narrative. I don't know enough about these figures to know what I was missing, but that didn't stop me from feeling that there was more to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review. I am not overly-knowledgeable about the \\"Concordians,\\" but am reasonably literate. I'm much more familiar with the London Bloomsburians, and love literary biography. I am not qualified to speak to the alleged plethora of inaccuracies in the book, but even without that, it's a very disappointing book. Yes, it's readable and somewhat entertaining, but I'm learning very little about the thought and inner lives of the Transcendentalists. The book also moves confusingly between what would charitably be called analysis, and chronology. I suppose this is a fault of editing, but it makes the book less coherent. The only positive to having bought this is that I now plan to read some of the good books recommended by other disappointed reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash Tabloid \\"Literary History\\"","review":"This book reads like a series of front page stories from a trash tabloid. It is gossipy in tone with very little substance or thought. It is as if the author did a skimming summary of other works and through this book together in order to meet a deadline. \\"Chapters\\" are often 3-4 pages long. At times the leap between topics between chapters leaves one puzzled and confused.She would have done better to created a pot boiler of a 19th century soap opera graphic novel - that would have been worth seeing and would have put the book in the proper context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging, but is it fiction?","review":"I'm still scratching my head over this one. One the surface, its concept is fascinating: some of the greatest thinkers and strongest personalities of the 19th century presented in an engaging narrative format. Even so, it's hard to tell how much of this book is \\"story\\" and how much is \\"fact\\". Cheevers's attempts at presenting a linear narrative are also not so successful. I think it is this \\"fiction-like\\" presentation that confused me... Each scene had me questioning its authenticity or factual accuracy (even if it was true, it's hard to read it as such)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't speak english!","review":"Bu understand quite some Jazz, as it¡s an universal language and Open Air is pure poetry ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfume Guide","review":"This is an excellent book that not only gives information about the perfume itself but also about the Designer/Company that produces it. It also gives recent info what happened to the Company/Designer, who maybe bought the label etc. It also lists other perfumes of that company/Designer although that could be a bit more extensive. What I like about the book is that the standart info about development of perfume/perfume bottles, manufacturing process etc. is relatively short because just about every book about perfume covers that.

He seems dissipated, strident and awkward. The story and plot make little sense, and the humor all seems forced, with none of the natural flow of subtlety that characterizes all of Crispin's earlier work.If you've never read an Edmund Crispin book before, for God's sake skip this one and read any of the rest of them. He was a master of humor and mystery-writing, but this book written in his waning years is no way to experience him at his peak.

I called KBGear to see how I could get it fixed, and was told that they had none in the warehouse, they all go to major retailers. Because they had none and did not know when some would be produced, they would not fix, replace or otherwise try to compensate for their faulty product. I was told to keep trying back to see if they get any in, but if they don't I'm just out of luck. Their one year warranty is basically worthless. Just be warned if you get one, it's striclty purchased as-is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST camera I have ever used!!!","review":"I got this camera for free with a Gateway PC package. I thought that it would be a good camera, boy was I wrong! I got rid of an Intel Deluxe PC Camera (Highly Recommended) and I have been regreting it ever since. I take alot of still indoor pictures for auction items and frequently have to take numerous pictures of the same item until it looks half way decent. I have to stick my finger half over the flash or else the pictures will come out solid white! No flash, too dark. Using the on screen picture adjustments is a joke!!! I will be unloading this to a sucker on an auction and I will buy the Intel again. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera at a great price","review":"I got this camera for christmas from my husband. I really enjoy it. I get good quality pictures to send the grandparents. The software was very easy to install and the customer service is wonderful. my first camera died on me and the replacement was sent so quickly. The tech was VERY helpful. I have been using the same battery in the camera since I received it and still have plenty of juice left. The only thing I didn't like about it is the basic camera only holds 8 hi res pictures, but I was in the window for the free memory card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product","review":"I could not get the JamCam software to work on either of my systems: Windows 2000 or Windows XP. I have installed a lot of software over many years and it is obvious when a product is poorly designed. It is clearly not designed for XP. The uninstall removes system drivers that XP has to replace. Software should not be this difficult to install or use.

The price is amazing (new priced at $10 - $15 in the Marketplace or eBay), it has auto flash, and easy to download pics to the computer without wasting money on developing. The company did go out of business, but there is an amazing following on the internet and it is easy to find up-to-date software to download pictures (most of it FREE). The quality of the pictures is not great (outdoor pictures are pretty good; indoor with flash are over-exposed) but better than expected for the price. The camera is also powered by a 9v battery so no special digital camera battery needed. I really can't say enough good things about this camera. It is the perfect way to introduce your children to photography without investing a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth the trouble","review":"This is a word of advice to any would-be buyers of the jamcam 3.0: \\"Don't!\\". The product is a toy at best. But the real problem (yes, there is one worse) is the business practices of this company. Non-existent customer support (emails bounce), invalid toll-free numbers, and unclaimable rebate offers. There is defintiely something fishy going on. I would go as far as to say beware of KBgear in general. I learned at a price. I rate this product a one-star only b/c a zero rating is not possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly good for the price","review":"Before the holidays, I shopped around for an \\"inexpensive\\" digital. I hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (I already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) Amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did I have to lose. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (I am a comercial artist) Print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. Plus, I can use it on my Mac and my husbands PC. Installation on both platforms was super simple. You don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. I plan to buy another for my in-laws. It's no Nikon, but I'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Do not buy this camera. The software is terrible and the drivers don't install correctly in Windows 2000. After I finally got the thing installed, I took some pictures. It takes a long time to take one picture and you have to hold the camera still while you do it. Downloading the pictures from the camera to the PC via USB is very slow as well. The most disappointing thing about this camera is the picture quality. Quite honestly, the other problems were nothing because this camera is so inexpensive... but the picture quality is terrible. Even in the highest resolution it looks awful. Each pixel looks about 8 times bigger than it should be in the highest resolution. Worst digital camera ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Camera for the price","review":"We've had our JamCam 3.0 for about six months now. It's been great. Takes clear, reliable pictures. Using the flash helps a lot on indoor shots, but is not always necessary. The USB interface makes for fast downloads to the computer. We've used it to send instant pictures of the kids to relatives. Recently I added a 32Meg Multimedia Card, which boosted the image capacity from 8 to 130 in \\"hi-res\\" mode and to well over 400 pictures in low-res mode. It would be nice to have an LCD viewscreen or a lens-cover, but that would increase the price. This is a good, simple, inexpensive camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from it!","review":"This camera has been a complete waste of money. I have not been able to get it to work on any of three different computers with Windows 95, Windows ME or Windows XP.

I purchased a JamCam 3.0 for my 9-year old and tried moving pictures to a Dell 8200 machine. So far, no luck: XP Home complains about non-compliant software and drivers, KB Gear tech support offers updated drivers and updates to the JamCam software (both, incidentally, are needed to make XP happy.) Well, I followed all the instructions and advice - hours of work checking cable connections, USB ports, telling XP where to find the new updated JamCam drivers (c:\\\\windows\\\\system\\\\system32\\\\drivers) - to no avail! I am now convinced that the JamCam software is not XP ready. I'll try it on a laptop with 98 and see how it goes. Bad, bad, bad. It's really too bad because the JamCam is a nice piece of hardware for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera works great but forget about getting your rebate!","review":"I purchased this camera in July of 2001. The camera works exactly as described and is very good for home purposes. Unfortunately, the rebate which was a major part of the reason why I purchased this model still has not been paid.

I have to move the camera so the person or object of interest is in the right corner of the the camera just to get them centered in the pic! The software was, well ok I guess. Overall this camera should be recalled! ... In case you do buy it, for the best image quality you need to set the timer and put it down.

Where the product falls flat on it's face is the software that comes with it. There's no way to get images out of the camera without the software, which looks like it was done by a not-very-talented high schooler as their first 'real' program, and has the bugs and glitches to prove it. Electronic support is limited to the online 'knowledge base' and download areas - no mention of any customer support or other contact, other than the webmaster.

The first images you see are in the \\"JamCam photo shop viewer\\". Don't give up here! I think some people have seen these blurry blobs of grey and assumed this was the image they were stuck with. Not so. Be sure to \\"Download Picture\\" to thumbnail form. Also, I had to change my screen settings to 640x480 to see the controls properly. I might also mention my PC (586-133) is below the recommended minimum and I'm making out ok. The pictures are not bad. I am satisfied. Remember, this is a 640x480 camera, so don't expect too much. The flash is good for dark areas.

I also had some problems geting it to work under windows 98 through the native USB interface, but after it installs like 8 software packages one of them could talk to the camera.

Especially in shaded areas (but unfortunately not only there) the image has a lot of horizontal lines by different colors. I understand the limited resolution (for it's price), but I can't understand low quality of images. Another problem is that I obtain a fatal error of JamCam software application when I try to download images from camera at 320x240 resolution. I am not able yet to use 320x240 resolution even after I tried all drivers from their website. Also I can't understand why the speed of images download (using USB) is so low.

Worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the coolest X-Mas albums around","review":"I first discovered Charles Brown on Alligator's great Christmas collect. The track that is on that collection 'Merry Christmas Baby' is also the first track and the finest on this album as well. This is by no means a one or two hit wonder. This whole CD is fanastic! Charles Brown has a distinc vocal style, which is covered in a mellow smokey blues sound. His piano playing is sparse, but excellent and his backing band is very capable. Charles guitarist also plays a very sparse style as well leaving plenty of room for Charles great vocals. He sings like no other and willbring you in instantly. Listing to this album makes you want to spike the egg nog and start a fire in the fireplace. If you like the blue and\\\\or like great Christmas music buy this album. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Christmas CD of all time!","review":"I love this cd! I had a copy and must have loaned it out...obviously someone else loved it too!I was so happy to have been able to order a new copy and receive it quickly for this season. It was in perfect condition and helped my usher in the season. Charles Brown's Cool Christmas Blues is a must for any blues lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, with a caveat","review":"Charles Brown is a blues legend and this CD purports to present a selection of his classics. But beware: Though not advertized as such, several of his most famous tracks are later recordings and nowhere near as satisfying as the originals. Though his original Christmas album is unfortunately out of print, you may want to try and find it used somewhere else. It will be worth the effort as it is one of the greatest Christmas blues albums, along with James Brown's \\"Santa, Please Come to the Ghetto.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy if You're Looking for the Classic Please Come Home for Christmas!","review":"The sole reason I ordered this was for the classic \\"Please Come Home for Christmas\\" - even thought its Charles Brown, the version on this CD is different, its terrrible and is not the one that became the gold standard for R&B Christmas tunes - I didn't even bother to listen to anything else on the disc, Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A wonderful series in its heyday.A travesty in its transfer to dvd.

On some cuts, there is a nice bit of natural background noise. There is no man-made music. It can be replayed as a steady background. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sheets","review":"These sheets are great! They are comfortable. They are not too thick and not too thin. I would recommend buying two sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"Wambaugh is one of my favorite authors and I have read many of his books.This was my favorite.Great imagery of the Desert and generally good character development.My only complaint about the book was the all too familiar shallow bar scene that features several cops acting like idiots.The most prominent character is a detective named Sidney. His investigative technique seemed very clever and realistic.The conclusion of the book was not forshadowed and hits you like a locomotive.The story paints a very raw reality of life and the human spirit that keeps you thinking and even having dreams long after you finish.In some ways the story is a great tragedy, but it is also very touching to see the love and self sacrifice characters in the book show to a very wounded soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both one of Wambaugh's funniest and one of his most heart-wrenching","review":"This isn't quite up to classics like THE NEW CENTAURIANS, THE BLUE KNIGHT, or THE CHOIRBOYS, but I do consider it as one of his best lesser known books. The introductions to each of the characters are often hilarous as we see various \\"clowns\\" hired into the Mineral Springs PD by the title character. However, one might become a bit impatient since you need to get well into the book before you have a true sense of where the story is going. Buried under the many anecdotal type scenes, but ultimately rising into prominance is the common bond linkng the title character, the main investigative officer, and the millionaire who hires the latter, and it's this theme that gives the entire book meaning and rewards the patient reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wambaugh does it again.","review":"I like all of Wambaugh's books, but this one was really moving. It started out quite humorous but the ending was vey dramatic and moving. Like Fugitive Nights,Wambaugh's descriptions of the desert areas around Palm Springs conveys his love of nature and makes you want to visit. Even though I live in San Diego, I do not know and unfortunately have never met Wambaugh"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book get published?","review":"I finished this book last night and went, this afternoon, to AMAZON to check the reader reviews. I am surprised that people liked this book. The plot is silly, goes nowhere, and started from nowhere. Several of the scenes and characters are not even tangentially related to the story. I've never read any other of his books. I'm sure others have to be better or else this one would not have been published."},{"rating":"2","title":"DONALD REVIEW 12","review":"I PURCHASE THIS ITEM MORE THEN ONE TIME AND THE 6 VACUUM SEALER ROLLS ARE GOOD TO HAVE WHEN YOU BUY LARGE OR SMALL AMOUNTS OF FOOD AND YOU DO NOT WISH YOUR FOOD TO BAD.

He gets a groove going that will make you wanna dance (1,2,3,7, more) or he plays slower empathetic blues jams that place him on par with the greats (4,5,6, more). Luther's guitar style is solid but not intrusive (he was Muddy Waters guitarist for 7 years, so he knows how to blend). Shades of Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters and all three Kings.I think this is one of the most underappreciated blues CDs there is - a desert island disc. Luther is the real deal. Find out why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Underground Album","review":"This is a classic underground album that really brings back memories from the late 90's rave scene.

Even if you are not a tangusista, this CD will bring some lilt and a smile into your life.Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good tool","review":"Tool cuts great. The bottoming design makes it difficult to over do it reaming primer pockets. The stock handle is knurled for a good grip, although its small size makes my hand cramp after a while, which is the only reason this isn't a five star review. Chucking the cutter into an electric drill solves that little problem nicely. Like that, I was able to cut the crimps out of about a hundred rounds of lake city .308 brass in around ten minutes. I highly recommend this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty thorough on testing","review":"As a matter of fact, it is the only book I have found on testing loudspeakers. Ater presenting the basics of the T/S Parameters theory to some extent, the author presents the relative measurement techniques deeply enough. In general the most interesting topics concernig loudspeaker testing are covered adequately. The theoritical background is also included and presented in simple and absolutely comprehensible language. It is a must-have companion for the very popular \\"Loudspeaker Disign Cookbook\\" by Vance Dickason. In a few words I was overall satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid as a Rubber Rock","review":"Do not hesitate to buy this if you are worried that the ball will not hold up to the abuse that you are considering. This ball is solid and durable. It will even hold up to bouncing off the floor or a wall with no complaints. It's about the size of a #5 soccer ball so is great for goalkeeper or throw-in distance training. Excellent for core training and young players like the novelty of using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Summer Shoes!","review":"We love them!

Shortly after that, a \\"rivet\\" on my other sons pair broke. Two new pairs of shoes both broken within ten minutes of them being worn tells me that this is more than just a manufacturing \\"oops\\". The rivets are a design flaw and whatever cost-savings they are to the company, they just paid for in customer loyalty. I will never buy crocs again!BTW, for those of you who have this problem, there is a fix... Go to the fabric store and buy some Blue Jeans Buttons to replace the plastic \\"rivets\\".

A good summer investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crocs Rock!","review":"As a (former) Birkenstock regular, I can honestly say Crocs are the easiest way to protect your feet and still be able to venture around almost anywhere. Unlike Birkenstocks, the crocs hand all terrain without worrying about any leather or cork breakdown. Not quite as supportive as Birks, they still provide comfort during long walks. While I wouldn't rock climb in them, they've been on my son's feet in the mud and rocks around the house and he's never had an issue. They clean up easily and I always buy them a little big as those darn feet grow too fast and they do feel a little smaller when they've been in the sun on a hot day (100 degrees+).

I don't have money to throw away, and with the sizing irregularities, the next size up could still not fit (it's anyone's guess).

After my three year old daughter fell numerous times while running in these shoes, we limit her use of them to quick trips to the pool or backyard. She is not allowed to run in them and doesn't like to wear them as they make her fall down. She has a narrow foot, and perhaps this attributes to that a bit. These shoes are very wide and loose. Probably more suited to a child with wide feet or a child that doesn't run and play (do they exist)? I will not be purchasing these again, as I have found the Keen Newport to be a much better, durable, safer shoe for my child to wear all summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoe","review":"My kids have had crocs for the past 3 summers.

He has worn the classic style. I thought this would just be the next size up. But the sizing seemed off. We ordered a boys size 2. The size 2 was about 1/4 inch longer than the size 1 that he had outgrown. But the width was 3/4 of an inch wider in the heel area, at least and equally wide or wider in the toe area. The size was described by Amazon as Medium or M. I looked up the same shoe on the crocs.com website and it was described as their \\"roomiest\\" or widest fit of the three fit styles they listed. So I think this shoe should be listed as a W or Wide not medium, especially since Crocs run wide anyway. I had my son put one old shoe on and one new shoe on and took a picture. I was hoping to be able to post the picture so that potential buyers could see how wide this shoe is. This shoe would probably fit a kid with short toes and very wide or chubby feet. I am returning them as they do not fit my child's average size 2 foot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, comfortable, and convenient","review":"We live in a wet climate so the yard is often squishy.

Although it may not have been that way at the time they are now seen as mostly bad cinema with a few decent actors and plots found if you go through dozens of them.The action Movies of the 80s and 90s are now becoming viewed the same way as the B western. Underdog good guys vs powerful bad guy, marginal writing and acting, bad music, a formulaic plot that you can see a mile away......the only difference being a little more violence, cursing and nudity in these than the B western.This movie falls into that category. Some said this was Van Damme's best acting. Poor guy. Some decent action scenes give this the second star. Outside of that a way to spend a mindless 100 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for its Genre","review":"This is an older movie, which I owned on VHS. I always liked Van Damme during the time he was at the top of his game (although he has more recently made some movies that are highly lacking). Although this is a bit dated, it's a good story and Van Damme delivers. Beware that there are a couple of nude scenes, so it's not for the young. If you want a classic drama/action feature, where the good guy has faults, but is inspired to do the right thing and prevails in the end, then this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie point blank..","review":"its pretty good van damme dose what he dose best..!! which is fighting nd acting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one reason","review":"I bought a copy of NTR for one reason and one reason only: a single scene near the beginning, prominently featuring Rosanna Arquette.

It is sleek and modern with clean lines but isn't overt. It tends to blend in with decor more than stand out, which is why I chose it as an all around gift item. I can see it fitting in nicely as a retro themed item too due to the material.

It literally only says that if Christmas were every day, the clutter would pile up and we wouldn't get to celebrate any other holidays. It shows pictures of an exhausted mother, people throwing away presents, etc. Then the people dump the candy in the ocean and make the fish sick. Then, I'm not kidding you, they burn all the extra gifts. There is no mention of gratitude, giving to others - anything! There is obviously no mention of the true meaning of Christmas - God forbid! But even in a purely secular rendition of Christmas, the lack of anything meaningful, heart warming or kind was appalling. And the way the girl speaks is incomprehensible.

Other reviewers have complained about Ricks' punny style getting in the way of the reading. All it showed me was that he was having a good time writing about his subject. Reading the book brought me back to the Dylan songbook and I found myself wishing that Ricks had covered this song or that song along with the many ones he did analyze. If you don't know or don't care about a particular song, or find yourself getting bogged down, you can always skip the discussion of that one and start again somewhere else in the book. I found myself not agreeing with every one of his interpretations, but what the heck, isn't that what the interpretation of complex work is all about?

Great description of the country and atmosphere by a foreign and interested comrade. This is by all accounts a not-to-miss story of the blues, folk, and country music that existed at the time. If you are interested in ANY of these genres in any way, shape, or form, or the way this trip inspired Shirley to re-examine the traditional music of her own homeland (southern England, namely Sussex), this book is an ABSOLUTE must-read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I definitely read this whole book in two days. That is a testament to its greatness. Buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"godawful","review":"I'm amazed at all the mostly positive reviews! I have read the book and loved it, but this film makes no sense. Without Vonnegut's point of view there's no guiding force behind the zaniness, and it's hard to feel sorry for director Alan Rudolph because he changed the book around so much (in the book, Celia is already dead and Hoover is much more violent- less PC- at the end) I feel sorry for all the actors involved because they embarass themselves- the only bright spot is Mark Isham's moody, mind-massaging score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great effort, bad movie","review":"There was a lot of great talent on display in this movie - Bruce Willis did a great job with a nearly impossible character, and Omar Epps did well too. The technical aspects of the film were rather impressively done as well. Unfortunately, one has to wonder what the director's goal was. Movies are made to either entertain us or challenge us. This does neither. The only challenge was to keep watching it. I never read Kurt Vonnegut's book, and I shouldn't have to in order to like the film.... and well, I didn't. Maybe Vonnegut's story was good, but the story as presented in this movie is rambling and not worth the effort of trying to make sense of."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very, very bad","review":"This was a terrible film adaptation. The entire meaning of the story is lost in translation. It ignores some of the most important points that Vonnegut was trying to make and leaves out the most significant scenes. When making a book into a film, not everything can survive, but this film version has filtered out everything that SHOULD have been in the film and leaves only what could be ignored. This film is barely recognizable as having anything to do with Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"IGood companion to the book","review":"I just finished watching this movie with someone who has never read the book which gives the movie its name. She thought the movie was complete nonsense, and had I not read the book I would probably have agreed with her. The movie follows the plot better than most films based on novels and it even includes a few lines from other books by Vonnegut (e.g. Timequake and Slapstick). Personally, I thought this was a good movie, the only thing that really bothered me about it was the author's lack of presence in it. If you are a Vonnegut fan, this movie will keep you laughing or at the very least somewhat interested. I would recommend Breakfast of Champions to anyone who has read the book, if for no other reason than to see Kilgore Trout as played by an actual human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be afraid!","review":"Fans of the novel upon which this movie is based be warned!

I loved movies like \\"Being John Malkovich\\", \\"suburbia\\", and \\"the house of yes\\" yet this movie is beyond bizzare. Its not the good kind of bizarre, its the bad kind that just doesnt make any sense. There is so much terrible acting despite the good cast (this is possibly bruce willis' worst performance ever...just terrible.) it reminds me of a bad 80's comedy with a shoe-string budget. How the hell did they get bruce in this one? This movie doesnt have much of a plot. And i appreciate bizzare and off beat comedies, but this oen isnt entertaining in the least bit. And the critically acclaimed part?! 3.1 out of every 4 critics in the US slammed this movie as a terrible movie. Dont be mislead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rather They Hadn't Tried To Make This A Moovy....","review":"...and no disrespect to Vonnegut, I don't think he writes novels that are easily adaptable to cinema. I had BIG trouble with the \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" moovy. In this I found Albert Finney's Kilgore Trout the best thing about the moovy. He looks like someone who is as confused at the accolades as much as he is willing to get per diem from a bunch of middle class denizens whose major attribute is that they nearly know how to run a good stripmall. Barbra Hershey also does well as Duane's daffy wife.But, the other players? Children, repeat after me.

I looked forward for weeks to the release of the film version, only to leave deflated.What's so disappointing about the adaptation is that it works for almost the entire running length of the movie. The surreal aspects are handled well and the absurdity of life put forth by the novel is completely present.The deal is, \\"BOC\\" literally climaxes on the last page with a scene in which main character Kilgore Trout meets his maker, to wit Vonnegut himself. This crucial and absurd scene could have been adapted only literally, but it wasn't. It was reinterpreted, showing Trout melting into a sort of Maxfield Parrish painting. Maybe Vonnegut couldn't be had for this scene, or maybe he wouldn't agree to have an actor portray him. Who knows. This mis-done sequence, though, because it was so crucial, tainted everything that had come before."},{"rating":"1","title":"a horrible waste of talent, money, and my time","review":"I have read a lot of accurate reviews here, i.e., the negative ones.

Watching \\"Nashville\\", this longtime Vonnegut fan finds it easy to believe that it was created under the influence of Kurt. It's too bad Altman didn't get around to creating a formal adaptation; I think it also too bad that his protege Rudolph, in taking a crack at it, didn't achieve, doesn't seem to have aspired to the lightness of touch one sees in Altman's deft, curve-ball satire -- that one hears in Vonnegut's droll, imperturbable literary voice for that matter. So here's my recommendation: want to see a great adaptation of \\"Breakfast of Champions\\"? Watch \\"Nashville\\" (wry, sprawling satire of middle-american, mid-seventies mores and morals), and use some imagination. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"first off: i'm a huge vonnegut fan. i remember hearing that they were going to make a movie from breakfast of champions and thinking that it could never be done. the plot of the novel is secondary to vonnegut's rants on modern america and without his narration the plot falls completely flat. this is exactly what happened with the movie. please don't be turned off to the novel because of the film, it is one of the funniest books out there. the movie is very non-sensical and leaves out the suicide of hoover's wife which is really what sets him off. i was very frustrated with this adaptation, they should have just left it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breakfast of B.S.","review":"I ordered this DVD through Amazon.com It took a month to get here.

I know it sounds crazy but it yet again Patterson has produced another book that is very hard to put down. Cross as usual has many things going on. First is to stop the killings that are taking place in America. He is also have women problems, nothing out of the ordinary, in which he does not want another partner to meet their end at the hands of his rival, the Mastermind.

Once again we are treated to life in the Cross household including the wonderful Nana Mama and Cross's children but we don't honestly care all that much about the creepy serial killer. The lamest part of this book is about so-called vampires and their dialogue is so laughable that I was chuckling to myself as I was reading those sections.

I was even okay with his really far off premises in some of the others (kid's with wings...was he kidding?!), but this one is really dragging. This entire vampire premise is way out there and the same BS keeps happening to Alex Cross. I can usually plow through his books in a weekend, and I have had this one on my nightstand for well over a month. I read only a few chapters at a clip. This means I am BORED!

Not only are there lots of confusing references to his earlier books, but also lots of spoilers. Much of this book did not make sense. Also the 'sidekick' Sampson is always wasted in these books. It's like he's just waiting around to help Cross or console him and doesn't have much to do. Big disappointment compared to Spenser and Hawk (I recommend Robert Parker novels BY FAR over these.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of James Patterson","review":"I have read all of the Alex Cross novels except Roses are Red -- and I guessed almost immediately the identity of the Mastermind. This book was not worthy of the talent of Mr. Patterson. As I was reading the book, I kept wondering if someone else had written this book, like Mr. Patterson's teenaged child (if he has a teenaged child).

He was never up there with Sandford or Connelly but they were fun and quick reads. At some point I lost interest. I saw this one at a library sale for 25 cents and thought, \\"How could I go wrong for 25 cents?\\" Turns out I got ripped off. This book is ludicrous.

But I cannot say the same for this one. The vampire trend lead nowhere and was more of blood than of substance. His new series with 3 friends seem to be more engaging and fulfilling. He had earlier erred by unmasking the Matermind in Roses are Red. Maybe it is time to retire Alex Cross. Alex Cross has lost his edge. Predictability is not where one wants one's favorite thriller author to go. But Alex Cross seems to be going there. It is time to infuse new blood into your writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violets that need watering!","review":"This story was a huge letdown! Although, I'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. Which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. Just the way I like em, so I thought. But, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. The story completely dies. No suspense, what so ever, not a typical Patterson novel. And, furthermore, to make things worse, in an effort to pick it back up, which, should've been another story altogether, we discover who's the Mastermind.

The vampire plot is vacuous and features a seemingly endless number of violent, mindless, gratuitous murders. In fact, it is an insult to vampires.The Mastermind operates behind the scenes in a most tiresome manner.

All done by vampires no less. It is so bad. No real story except Alex trying to catch them. Just killing after killing. I really hate this. I liked James Patterson so much.

Yet, when all is said and done, he has a great character in Alex Cross. Cross is a fully realized character who has become familiar in many of Patterson's other novels.I feel that the shortcoming in Violets Are Blue is the effort to reuse previous \\"bad guys\\" again and again even when the faithful reader is pretty likely to know \\"who done it.\\". In addition, Violets is fairly unbelieveable as stories go, as well as bloodly and gruesome.While I remain faithful to Alex Cross, I would like to see this character get some better attention in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson phoned this one in","review":"There was very little of the real suspense here that I've come to expect from Patterson's novels. It started off promisingly enough, but quickly deteriorated so that before I was 1/3 through the book, I felt as if he must have written it during the commercials of Survivor. The Mastermind is pretty easy to pinpoint -- Patterson is not subtle in his clues this time around. And really, Cross' women-and-dating dilemmas are getting stale. I recommend this only as a part of the Cross series, but it's disappointing on its own merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"Patterson used to be pretty good at writing an entertaining novel.

His writing quality has gone decidedly downhill over the past few years. He probably believes \\"If you write it, they will buy\\". I see James Patterson going the same route. This was to be the sequel to Roses are Red and the pursuit of the mastermind. What it ended up being is a romp through vampire rituals and very little regarding the mastermind.

As I read I noticed much of his writing is straight forward, no flowery language or overuse of deadword words: typical he said she said. Figurative language was not a strong point in Patterson's writing either. His style did include strong sense images though, especially sense image-sight. I especially appreciated the detailed descriptions of the events Cross encountered. The vocab was also not too challenging, but the choice of words was appropriate for the novel. Overall I thought his style was very intriguing and not overshadowed by unnecessary or overwhelming expressions or wordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good argument for book burning","review":"This may be the first Patterson book I read, but it will certainly be the last.

Unfortunately, he has become a prisoner to the style that made him so big: the quick chapters, the short, pained thought-bytes of Alex Cross, and the ubiquitous Nana. But for him it has gone even further, and his writing has become a caricature of his former style.

In fact, I'd consider it good had it been written by anyone other than the modern master of suspense, James Patterson. I found Roses Are Red to be one of the best books in the Cross series, and was really anticipating the release of Violets Are Blue, and ended up rather disappointed. The ending is quite anti-climactic for those who have read Roses are Red. The whole vampire plot sounds good when you read it on the jacket, but turns out to make this a weak entry in a great series. The ending is anything but thrilling, making the reader miss the quality writing exhibited in Kiss the Girls. Hopefully, Patterson is not falling into the trap of sacrificing quality for quantity.

For those of you who like Vampires, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last James Patterson book.","review":"It's hard to believe that James Patterson is a best-selling author. This plot is ridiculous! I like vampire stories as much as the next reader, but as I was reading I couldn't stop thinking this one was a farce. Furthermore, this writing is second-rate. Maybe I was expecting too much from this mystery novel- things like being able to participate in the story, suspense, character development, a little bit of actual unease (as opposed to laughing at the thought of circus performers acting as vampires under the cover of night).On the other hand, as a writer, maybe I'm jealous that Mr. Patterson can successfully get away with such mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Alex defeat vampires?Maybe, maybe not read and find out","review":"The sequel to Roses are Red, this one isn't as good. This doesn't mean it's not worth reading though.This one introduces the supernatural world to the serial killer genre. Vampires are in this one and Alex must stop them along with the killer from Roses are Red, The Mastermind.How can Alex defeat vampires you ask? Well maybe he doesn't. Maybe this is where he meets his match. You'll just have to buy this book, read it and find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"One book too many","review":"James Patterson is an excellent writer, but sometimes, you have to know when to tell your publisher you don't have any great ideas to continue a popular series. This book features two intertwined stories - each competing to see which could be the most preposterous. First, we have the silly tale of a sub-culture of modern \\"vampires\\", who are killing at an alarming rate, sometimes with the help of a tiger that only they can command. This story alone made this a pretty sick book. Finally, Patterson attempts to bring some closure to some of the earlier Alex Cross books by disposing of the \\"Mastermind\\", who really killed many of the victims wrongly attributed to other mass murderers in the previous books. The identity of the \\"Mastermind\\" was very dissappointing, and even laughable. Forgive me, but I couldn't take this book seriously. Please Mr Patterson, do not tarnish your reputation by continuing to pump out unimaginative trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Quit, James","review":"We found it difficult to believe that James Patterson, or his agents and publishers could even release such a poor mystery.

Not a Patterson \\"good book\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross At His Best","review":"As the author of \\"Born to make the Kill,\\"I know something about serial killers. One lived in my head for more than a year. In this sequel to \\"Roses are Red,\\" Patterson brings back the Mastermind to taunt Cross with his unveiled threats while Alex works a serial murder case with the usual, can't-figure-it-out-until-Patterson's-ready twists and turns. This one's a page turner. It keeps you guessing right up to the end.

When I started to read this book i was dissapointed because the first 100 pages were gory, grussome, and bad written. I mean how much can you describe. But as the book went on it got way better. It didn't focus as much on the murders and focused more on the investigation. Unlike the first half of the book. I also liked how Alex Cross was getting stalked while trying to solve the mystery. The twists were very good and when I finished the book I was barely breathing. So this instalment in the series was very good,but not for the faint of stomach or heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action, predictable conclusion","review":"I made the mistake of reading this Patterson book before any other.

Although not the highest rated of Patterson's efforts, I went through it quickly and thoroughly enjoyed it. This book grabs the reader early and does not let go, effectively weaving together two main storylines (a cross-country murder spree and the Mastermind's pursuit of Alex Cross). Clearly, however, the book is not for the feint of heart - the body count is substantial and the vampire murders are described in graphic detail. Delicate subject matter notwithstanding, Patterson kept me turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More!","review":"The first novel I read of James Patterson's was Along Came A Spider and I was caught in his web. I went on to read several more of his novels and enjoyed most of them. However, with this book, I couldn't make it beyond page 68. It sickened me. It would take a great deal of convincing to entice me into reading any of his future novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cataclysmic grammar","review":"If not for the horrible writing and sentence structure, thismight have been worthwile reading.

Violets are blue is not all that bad. But it greatly lacks of depth and this is a serious flaw in book writing. If you torn the page off right from around page 240 onwards, voila!!! you have 2 novels. One's about the vampire and one is about the payback with the so called Mastermind in which it is absolutely irrelevant. My opinion is, he could've just add a couple of pages more on Roses are Red and finish it off and start with clean sheet with whatever title he would like to put. Having it like now is just utter silly. But I really like the short chapter although some of it are just meaningless and looks like he's writing that chapter after a bad night or day"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alex Cross Embarrassed","review":"This is the worst Alex Cross book ever, had to force myself to finish it.

I have been a James Patterson fan for a long time; have read all of the Alex Cross novels and enjoyed them. But Violets are Blue was a huge disappointment.

Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Would order from this vendor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires? Oh, no....","review":"While this may not be James Patterson's worst novel, it is not his best either. I just can't accept the premise that there are vampire cults or cells across the country and that these weirdos actually kill people to drink their blood. I could accept it in Bram Stoker and Anne Rice, who wrote romances, what ifs, in artistic fashion. I was able to suspend my disbelief mechanism for them, but not for this book.Another serious problem is the re-introduction of the downright silly villain, \\"The Mastermind\\" from \\"Roses Are Red.\\" It felt as if Patterson couldn't deal with the blood suckers any longer and still had pages to fill, so he tossed in a second plot that wasn't really connected.In the rush to get books out, perhaps the writer is not thinking these plots through. Or maybe the editors just aren't paying much attention in their drive to get another best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad, I am slamming it AGAIN!","review":"...

An obvious ploy to stretch the number of pages by means of 115 pages that had only 1/2 page or less of printed content.

Personally I always enjoyed his earlier books, they were more meaty. In this book Mr. Patterson proves that no one can write more than one book a year and be good at it. Violets are Blue is a terrible book. Before the book is half over we have figured out who the bad guy is and why. He's writing to a formula and like Robert Parker, with Spenser, his main character has been been lost to the lure of big money, i.e. multiple publishing deals and movies. Mr. Patterson owes his readers and his characters more. All three of his new books are mediocre, this one is down right bad! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Ok-I love and have read probably all of his books. I love his style-short chapters, fast moving, insights into the killers! But vampires? Nope, gave me the willies and I didn't want to read it for fear of bad dreams! Seriously! I can read killings with no problem, but there was something about the whole vampire aspect, \\"drinking and feeding\\" that was too much for me!

The prose was choppy, disjointed, and jumped from one thought to another with no thread in between. My ten-year-old writes with more continuity and interest.

The sentence structure reads like something out of a \\"See Spot Run\\" book and the storytelling isn't much better. Supposedly, Cross has been pursued by some person called the Mastermind... However, the secret to the identity of the Mastermind is so obvious from the first 10 pages of the book that it's not really any fun to keep on reading and find out if your suspicions are confirmed or not. As for the rest of the story--involving Cross investigating a series of murders based around a vampire cult and maybe falling in love with his co-worker...well, it's pretty much yawn inducing the entire way around. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart Burn","review":"Among the three reviews I had read, James Patterson is considered a talented writer. Using a style not often seen within long novels. Patterson uses small chapters barely seven pages long at the most. Designed to keep the reader reading without being bogged down by a never-ending chapter. These shorter chapters also afford Patterson the freedom to change time lapses and scenes often, without confusing the audience.Unfortunately in my opinion that was about the only clever decision Patterson made in writing this novel....I found that the book could in fact be consumed very quickly. Actually the book had only taken a day to \\"consumer\\". And like most fast food it left me with heartburn.While reading, the audience discovers more about the \\"vampire brothers\\" then they do about Cross's character. Even though the majority of the story follows Cross around as he discovers more murder scenes, goes on a bad date and tries to make amends with his children for being a workaholic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding as Usual","review":"Really cleans up Roses are Red.

Of course he and the reader get to be really confused as he is abducted by aliens and later transported a la Star Trek into the Fairy Realm.The love Henry and Blue feel for each other is exploited in this and Blue is having a hard time dealing with the pressures of being the Ruler.While these books are about fairies and magic they have alot more of a tomboyish bent to them than a girly froofy fairy tale. Some very fun scenes happen and clearly this is not the last book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I was expecting","review":"I must say I was disappointed when I got this and the compiler it included is an Introductory Compiler. Whenever you compile any program it pops up a nice little window that informs you that your license agreement does not allow you to redistribute your programs. This bothers me somewhat because when I develop programs I like to compile and test each new bit of code that I add. The book on the other hand dives right in and if you have no programming background then you will feel like you are drowning in information. However, the author does do an adequate job of explaining what he is trying to teach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"It is speaker wire.

Bnois King is also quite good on vocals and on rhythm guitar. The other tracks are a mixture of 'not bad' to 'awful'.

I don't want to be a jerk when this is probably his passion project, but serious sci fi fans should stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"I love time travel stories and this is one of the better ones I have read.

If you prefer to be surprised and left wondering, then pass this one by. While I found the writing to be fair, the story lacked substance. I did finish the book, but I had to force myself to continue reading and when I finished I was unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont' care for the writing style","review":"This story was not quite what I expected. First of all the reader does not get to experience time travel at all; the story is told from the perspective of characters who are witnessing the effects of travel.

Their conversations, for example, felt scripted and artificial rather than being a natural exchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Plot Twists","review":"The Time Ship is probably the 50th book I have read about time travel, and this one had a lot of surprises and plot twists.

Mick Hucknall established a reputation as one of the best blue-eyed British pop/soul artists of the 80s and 90s. Yet, the band reached a musicall lull in the latter half of the 90s with forgettable albums like \\"Love and the Russian Winter\\". Considering their track record with the last few albums, it would be difficult to have any expectations from \\"Home\\". No one would have guessed that Simply Red was yet to unveil one of their finest albums ever and the best single of their career - \\"Sunrise\\". The other highlights of the album include \\"You make me feel brand new\\" (a cover of the Stylistics) and \\"Something for you\\". I hope Mick Hucknall is able to continue with his renewed musical streak for years to come.Songs for the casual listener: SunriseSongs for the Simply Red fan: Home, Something for you, It's you, You make me feel brand new and SUNRISE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD - Mick never sounded better.","review":"Soulful and smooth, HOME is a great album of songs especially the Hall and Oates inspired and sampled \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Money In My Pocket\\".

In an age of Clay Aiken and Josh Groban sugary pop, it's great to hear a real blue-eyed soulful voice like Mick's! Never better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Red's magic \\"Home\\"","review":"This record is just perfect. From the very start to the very end this is a smooth delicious sailing.

Perfect timing.","review":"I don't purchase many cds, but when I bought Simply Red's \\"Home\\" last weekend I was so tremendously impressed and pleased with my purchase that I felt it crucial to spread the word about this amazing new album. Yes, it is random, but it flows well and although there is a lot of new work, some techno beats, this cd is wonderfully nostalgic. I think of Earth, Wind, and Fire, along with Bob Dylan, along with Marvin Gaye, along with Sting. This is such a great sound and it is so refreshing to hear new music that doesn't sound like new music. Buy this cd, a bottle of wine, and just chill out on the sofa for the night with someone special, or at least someone who will aprreciate some very special music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Release from Simply Red","review":"While this CD was okay, it was more restrained than earlier Simply Red releases and I was disappointed with the content. Maybe it's because they're aging. Many other musicians have fallen short of their earlier works with recent releases, as their CDs yielded only 1 or 2 bankable songs from the likes of Michael Jackson, George Michael, Lionel Ritchie, etc. Simply Red's remake of Dylan's Positively 4th Street was sad to say the least; it's like doing a Stones' or Beatles' song ... don't go there.Simply Red's first US release surpasses this. Picture Book gave us tunes that are unmistakingly Simply Red, songs like Money$ Too Tight to Mention, Holding Back the Years, Sad Old Red (great jazz), Jericho, etc. Their second release, Men and Women, wasn't bad either. But I never liked any of their other works as much as Picture Book because I saw them do it live in Chicago and the show was awesome. Keep looking ... you can surely find a better Simply Red release than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"average&by the numbers","review":"back in the 80's I use to really dig Simply Red but as time wore on I noticed they got stuck in a formula&haven't changed one bit.now Mick Hucknall is a Cat that I respect His Vocals but even he can't make Average Material sound Good.since the 80's they have had songs that I have dug but nothing I'd break the Bank for.this Album is fairly run of the Mill&they have done far better in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE Sunrise... hate the rest","review":"I bought this CD because of Sunrise, and was hoping for at least one or two other original fun songs. I am sadly disappointed. The rest is drippy, unimaginative crud, so sorry to say. I still love Sunrise, though. Should have downloaded the song instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hits and more","review":"Okay, the hits on this one are nice (especially Sunrise), but isn't \\"Home Loan Blues\\" the real classic here: deeper soul from a white guy is hard to imagine, a voice without limits!A nice debate is of course the classic soul version of \\"Fake\\" on the album instead of the \\"modern\\" single version (on the bonus DVD which is included if you're lucky). I prefer the soul version but some others may be disappointed.Some mediocre as well as excellent tracks after number 5, overall really enjoyable music with a strong feel to it. Buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising integration","review":"I was driving somewhere when I heard \\"Sunrise\\". (If I am not listening to dance music, the smooth jazz station will be on in my car.) Then, this song came on and I could not believe that it was from Simply Red. I am not a huge fan of sampling but with this song, the integration of an old Hall and Oates tune had me hooked. There is something different about the lead singer's voice though. It varies from his sound in \\"Holding Back the Years\\". If anything, I wished that \\"Sunrise\\" was included in the greatest hits album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent record!","review":"This is Simply Red's best album since Life and Stars. The music grows on you from the start. The best tracks are \\"Sunrise\\" (includes a Hall & Oats sample) \\"Home\\" and \\"Fake\\".

The song \\"Sunrise\\" is my favorite, it is mixed with a Hall & Oats classic song, no wonder this is a top 10 hit in the UK. Overall the album is perfect for a dinner party, it is an excellent production and i dare to say its one of the best pop albums i've heard in a long time. Simply Red are Simply back at its best this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Red - Simply the Best!","review":"This is the best album that Simply Red has done since Stars! The title track \\"Home\\" is great, and reminiscent of \\"Holding Back the Years\\". I normally don't like sampling, but in their song \\"Sunrise\\" it seems to work really well! The Hall & Oates tracks blend in well, and this song is already topping the charts here at no. 3 on one radio chart! Another great track is the cover of You Make Me Feel Brand New, my favourite Stylistics song! Mick Hucknall's voice is superbly suited to this song. I also love Lost Weekend. You can almost feel the pain \\"blowing away\\" as you listen to this song. Something for You starts off really great, but gets a little boring towards the end. I would like to hear that great chorus at least one more time. But, overall the CD is great and Simply Red are definitely back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"This is exactly why mp3 downloads should be legal. This CD is [derivative]. Nothing new here. Hall & Oats clone. The Dylan song and \\"you make me feel brand new\\" remakes......neither one as good as the original so why bother. These guys would be great in a lounge in Vegas but don't try to sell me a CD with remakes. The ladies will like this I'm sure. Soft pop tunes. La la la la la.

One would think that the creator of such a unique and intriguing song, Sunrise, would have a better cd that captured the flow and feel of that in Sunrise however this is not the case. The song Sunrise is completely out of place in this cd. If one didn't know better they would assume that this cd was made in the 80's, and not in the Blondie/David Bowie/Oingo Boing 80's but the maudlin sounds of Michael Bolton 80's. I rate this cd a capitol P capitol U."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrendous","review":"This has got to be, quite simply, one of the worst albums I've ever had the displeasure of hearing. Boring and utterly worthless garbage from a band (now a one-man band, anyway) who lost it a long, long time ago.The better moments (and I use the term very loosely), such as 'Fake' are forgettable, run-of-the-mill pop.

Metabolize helped me lose 28lbs and create a new attitude that has given me the energy I had hoped for. The book is a lot like Ken, POWERFUL and EFFECTIVE!

I have not put into practice the diet for my type as I am trying to conquer my candida issues. I will however follow this diet probably for the rest of my life.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"METABOLIZE CHANGED MY LIFE !","review":"I am so thankful for Ken Baum and his book Metabolize. The whole concept of Metabolic individuality is logical and realistic. My past failures at dieting are well docomented in my mind, Nutri-System, Jenni Craig, Protein Power, The Zone, Volumetrics, and out of desperation I even tried Richard Simmons and failed. Metabolize wipes the slate clean and shows you how to change your thinking about your past and create a new weight loss strategy for the future. Ken has wonderful techniques to integrate powerful thought and body changing action. This is so much more than a diet book. Metabolize teaches you how to eat, think, move, breath and supplement for healthy, permanent weight loss. My life has changed and so has my body. I will forever be different and no longer have the cravings for the junk that was polluting my body and making me fat and lazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

I was kind of just reading the cover and was impressed with Mr. Baum's explanations and credentials, so I picked up the book.

Most books try to sell you menus as an add-on, or upsale, this book gave them to you right there on the pages!Most importantly of anything though, is the immediate results I'm seeing.

Learning how supplements work saved me a lot of money because I can stop taking the ones I don't need.All this makes Metabolize so much more than any diet book on the market Metabolize is a total program for weight loss and I recommend every body try it.

I honestly did not know what to expect when the disc started spinning. I listen to alot of Black Metal and the first thing i heard was Black Metal riffing. I was instantly hooked by this album. The guitar work on this album is a unique as it is crushing. This band may have started out playing the proto-typical Metal/Hardcore style of metal, this disc is no where near that style. I don't know how to label this band, so i am not going to. They play some serious, evil, face-melting metal on this disc. Maybe i was drawn in because of the Black Metal riffs being played, but i consider this one of my all time favorite albums. If you enjoy solid, well played, extreme metal, this album is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Have To Be Fair Here","review":"I really enjoy the music of Dead To Fall. True, you can certainly consider them a metalcore band, with its hardcore influences and Swedish influences, but they're a band that can execute the two style perfectly without sounding polished or like a churned out replica.Now, onto the album. This is their worst work that they have done, but it's not the worst thing I've ever heard. It seems the band got a tad bit sloppier in their songs, like \\"Chum Fiesta\\", thus I can't give it a 5. However, \\"All My Heroes Have Failed Me\\" is an addicting track that sounds different from the band's previous works. Other tracks, like \\"Womb Portals\\" and \\"Smoke and Mirror\\", well, I like them, but they somewhat have a rushed feeling to them. However, I can tolerate it and listen to it, and I'm a respectable and open minded music fan. It's certainly not a classic by any means, but there's worse out there. Believe me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not good.","review":"I am a fan of metal in general, and bought this album on the recomendation of a friend, and I have been dissapointed. The only thing keeping this album from being a failure is the cool riffs that are at the start of most songs. Sadly, after 30 seconds the songs are almost impossible to tell apart due to the fact the lyrics sound the same, and the rest of the song is very repetitve.If your a fan of the band I suggest you pick it up otherwise avoid it and wait for their next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"A lot of the reason why people do not like dead to fall is because all they want to listen to is mainstream metal. They aren't really fans of the music but more so, fans of what is popular. I would consider myself a fan of music and I really like this CD. Granted it could have been better, but i thought it was worth my money. The guitar and drum solos on this CD are sweet. This band to me sounds like a mix of atreyu and darkane.

Will I say that it was one of the best books I have ever read? No, I did not like it. I read this book twice to see if I could see the logic that Dicken's was coming from. Yes, I can understand that the revolution was harsh times. But, the way Mr. Dickens wrote the book it cannot translate to our generation. It just can't. Half of our class made it through the book partially with the help of cliff notes to this book. Do I hate denouncing a book by someone considered a great author? Yes, because I have simple respect for a man who is still being remembered after almost a hundred and fifty years. Will I recommend buying the book?

On a reading comprehension test, my reading level was determined to be that of a high school graduate, so I thought I would have no problems with this book. However, I found that Dicken's style of writing was impossible to understand. I had to go back and read paragraphs two or three times before I finally understood their point. I asked myself many times: \\"Is this book written in English??\\". Maybe when I am older I will learn to appreciate this story, but right now I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end just doesn't justify the means.","review":"The symbolism and plot of the final three chapters of the book made what I consider to be one of the best closings of all time. However, the 300+ pages of drawn out language and wasted talk before the closing makes this book somewhat tedious and annoying. I'm a sophomore in High School and was forced to read this book for my Honors English II class. I must say that I consider myself to be an above average reader, and I would have gone crazy had it not been for the intervention of Cliff's Notes. Furthermore, I feel that the same points that Dickens got across about the French Revolution could have been expressed in half as many words. The characters wandered aimlessly among each other until they finally collided in one big bang at the end. In closing, I loved the final 3 chapters, but the immense amount of time wasted in getting there and figuring out where I was really spoiled the total experience for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great expectations","review":"It's the book that turned me off of Dickens. I still shudder when I think of being forced to read it in high school. The descriptions just go on forever...make it stop!Pip, an orphan, meets an escaped convict and treats him kindly. This simple action will change Pip's life forever. Pip falls in love with Estella, a cold-hearted girl, who, thanks to bitter Miss Havisham, has been well-trained as a heartbreaker. She is wealthy and looks down on Pip, a poor boy with no expectations.When a mysterious benefactor gives Pip a fortune, Pip is sure that becoming a gentleman is the way to win Estella's heart. Pip spends most of the novel feeling ashamed of the people who love him and sacrifices everything to pursue Estella, who couldn't care less for him.I have never been brave enough to pick this one up again, even though I may well appreciate it now. This book is perfect for readers who enjoy a writer who uses twenty words when one will do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Sorry If You Are Forced To Read This","review":"I thought this book was tedious and unimformative with the most action at the end which was barely any.

Boring.","review":"Perhaps it's my lack of enthusiam for classic English literature, but I found this book dull and very unamusing. I purchased this because my English teacher wanted us to read it, and while I don't regret buying it, I highly doubt I'm going to read it again.Though, keep in mind I'm but a teenager, and not a fan of the classics. I'm sure if the classics are your thing, then you'll love this book. The included appendix and notes help out a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A note to Sean Brocklebank","review":"I am really disturbed by your review saying to \\"ignore disgruntled English students that have Dickens prodded into them by the school system.\\" How do you know that those students didn't try to like the book? Perhaps they couldn't understand because they had an incompetent teacher. And you also say \\"Without their reviews, A Tale of Two Cities would have a five star rating.\\" Look at other reviews. Are they they only ones who don't give this a review that dosen't have 5 stars. It dosen't matter if you have been an English teacher for 45 years with 2 PH.D's in the subject, please get your facts straight before you go posting that every single teenager is a lazy, unintelligent punk not interested in school. This is a great book, however. Worth buying if you've got the Cliffs Notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read","review":"I recently read this book for my tenth grade English class, and was totally blown away. This is a great story, set against a very interesting period in history, the French Revolution. I admit the beginning is a little bit slow and confusing, but after reading about halfway through, I could not put this book down. The storyline is amazing, and I was very impressed by the way all the characters were linked together. The story also reminded me of my favorite movie, Casablanca. I hope that other people enjoy this book as much as I did. I reccommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a magnificent classic for all time","review":"I love when I'm able to adore a text I've heard about my entire reading life that has been described a masterpiece. Charles Dickens one of the best writers ever. I had to get over my fear of being disappointed over something that has been exhaulted.

I envy those who haven't read it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Charles Dickens is a great writer. This is my favorite Dicken's book. Let me tell you about this: The first time I read it, I struggled with it up until the end. Some of my friends have never made it past the second chapter. Keep up with it.

I was optimistic in the first few chapters, hoping that a real plot would soon develop. I soon realized that there was no such hope. I have never heard about Dickens being paid per line, but that would certainly make sense. With the exception of Sydney Carton, the characters were flat and too good to be true, especially Lucie. The redeeming feature of this book was the ending, which, I admit, made me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels I have ever read","review":"This book went right to the heart, my heart. The ending had such an effect on me I cannot describe. I unfortunately, identified with Sydney Carton and the sad tragic life he lived. In fact though, it was inspiring. If someone reading this has not read the book I would not want to give away the ending. Beyond that it is an historical novel of immense foresight. We can look back on it when reflecting on modern political crimes on humanity and see that it can and still does happen. But as simply a literary novel, nothing compares as far as I recall in my readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"great ending but a slow beginning","review":"I had to read this book for my history class.

This was written in a time when authors got paid by the word, and you can easily tell that. That, and the language level make this book very hard to read. But, I am glad I got a chance to read it. I understood the book pretty well, and Dickens does a good job of illustrating the cruelty of the law at that time. The ending of the book is so sad. I cried when I finished reading it. This is really a great book if you have to read it, but a rare person will finish it without being forced to."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should actually be less than 100 pages","review":"This book virtually had no recognizable point for the first several hundred pages.

Too much plot excess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't knock a book just because you don't understand it","review":"Fortunately for him and his generation, but not for us, Dickens probably got paid by the word since much of his works were serials. A Tale of Two Cities is very \\"wordy\\", not unlike many of his other books. However, the deep meaning that Dickens conveys cannot be missed. He wanted to expose the social injustices that happened around him as well as to him when he was a boy. He is the ultimate advocator of the poor and thus respect should be given to both him and his work. His charaters are some of the deepest and most developed that I have seen in literature"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I didn't know what I was getting into when my ninth grade Honors English teacher assigned \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" to the class.

I'm sorry, but I am not a fan of extremely intricate plots and multiple themes and allusions gallore. \\"Why did I read it then?\\", one might ask. The answer is simple...school. I disaprove of the way literature is taught in high schools. Reading is a must, but, in my opinion, the subject should be completely up to the student. This is most certainly not a book for younger readers, with all it's confusing elements and violence. People who heave completed their education might enjoy this book...or not. I can see why people would like this book, although I didn't, and even though I loath \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\", I respect it greatly and believe that it has had a mostly positive effect on society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tale of Two Cities","review":"The tale of two cities compares the actions of the rich on the poor people living in the slums of Paris and London. It is a very depressing story, but is also a story that illustrates the power of the human sprit wnen ordinary people do extraordinary deeds. The depressing lives of the poor people who live in the slums are very well described, and are compared to the extravigant and opulant lives of the \\"Aristocrates\\" who would view a poor person in the same light as they view a stray dog. Human life has no value. When the poor begin to rise up againist their oppressors, the poor treat the aristocrates in the same way as they were treated, namely with the gillotine. Bloodshed, death and unfairness are the three words that describe this book. I enjoyed this book, but I will not read it again. Many words used are out of fashion and it is difficult to understand the language used and the structures of the sentences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defies description","review":"I am in awe of this book. It is so complex, yet so easy to understand; so strangely written, yet so beautiful to read; so filled with darkness, yet so brilliant with light; so saddening, yet so joy-bringing.I loved how Dicken's showed sympathy with all sides but would not allow evil and wrong to go under any other name. The symbolisms and parallels throughout the book are beautiful to read and understand as well.I can, though, understand other people having difficulty reading this book as there is comparatively little dialog and it could easily be confusing.I read it when I was fifteen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful work","review":"Dickens is hands down a master of the english language and in this, one of his cornerstone works, he is at his best.

It was an ironic tale filled with suspense. It had a great historic background and from reading this book, I feel that I have become extremely eductated on the life of the aristocracy and proletariat of the French Revolution. There were many twists and turns in the story that mad me want to keep reading until I reached the end. The end of this magnificent tale was worth all the wait. The story finally made sense.

A Tale of Two Cities is an incredible book. I do not wish to ruin this story (and this would be quite the book to summarize), so I will not reveal much of its plot. I will merely say that it is set in both England and France during the time just before and then the beginning of the French Revolution. The political details are quite accurate, the characters (even secondary ones) are well developed, the narrative is amazing (uplifting, depressing, humorous, terrifying, and poetic), and the love story is pure and beautiful (i.e. marriage), not something obscene and disgusting.'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...'Those immortal words describe this book.You will (probably) enjoy the best of times while reading this book.You will miss out on one of the best of times, and thus almost suffer the worst of times, if you pass on this story.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"rating":"1","title":"no comment","review":"I am currently in the middle of reading this book for my english class and it is very confusing which makes it very boring.

I really loved the compassion for Doctor Manette from Lucie. I also thought at the very end that Sydney Carton was a hero instead of a depressed, unexiting character as I once thought him to be.

I am getting tired of mindless tv and am getting back to reading more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these characters!","review":"This masterly crafted tale is chucked full of characters that you can't avoid feeling strongly about. This story is made of long sentences, full of dependent clauses that can make reading seem laborious for some readers because they have to read to the very end of the sentence carefully (and perhaps slower than usual) to grasp it's meaning. Similarly, the story deposits a plethora of seemingly superfluous details, but as the story unravels, those details ALL become connected and begin to matter. And just like all of those loose sentences, true meaning doesn't come until after reaching the final period. Don't judge this one based on disgruntled readers (students) forced to digest this work as a right of passage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsurpassed...yea right","review":"According to historical sources, Dickens was paid by the word for his books. Thus, I infer that the long, winded and boring passages Dickens exhibits in A Tale of Two Cities must indicate his greediness. Though I'm only 16, I can still identify well written books. If one is seeking a great novel, I suggest 1984 by George Orwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic dickens...great literature!","review":"How much would you sacrifice for the good of others? This classic tale of life, death, and the many nuances of existence takes the reader through France and England during a very turbulent time. Charles Dickens, a very detailed and meticulous author, does a splendid job of developing compelling and fascinating characters. The book is not short, and has considerably slow rising action. But no fear, the last 50-75 pages of the book are worth the first few hundred! A great read by a great author"},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than any other novel","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are \\"better\\" than any others, and the concept of a \\"great novel\\" is an intellectual hoax."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tale of One City Would Have Been Plenty","review":"Dont buy this book!

It was slow and obnoxious in its slow pace. Lucie Mannette wasn't an admirable character and like a previous reviewer mentioned, pathetic as the single most mentioned female in the book.

Frankly, I'm surprised Dickens could publish this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great talent","review":"Even after more than 150 years after it was first published, A Tale of Two Cities is still a novel many people enjoy reading.

Best book ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Re read of A tale of Two cities","review":"I studied this book in great detail while preparing for my GCE exams many years ago. However, re-reading it was quite a different experience, an eye opener for the mature reader. Now I am able to appreciate Dickens' writing far more and I shall certainly re-read more of his books. The details of the French Revolution were very educational and scarey in the sense that the atmosphere of fear and suspicion in France at the time of the Revolution still exist in many parts of the world today. It is a story of courage in the midst of chaos and distrust. It is also interwoven with love between father and daughter, husband and wife and, unforgettably, Sidney Carton's for the heroine.A Tale of Two Cities is a book than can be read several times and still give renewed pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of Two Cities","review":"is really a wonderful book, and I enjoyed it immensely. So immensely, in fact, that I immediately searched for an appropriate edition that would do the book justice, and I am glad to announce that I have found it. If you are to purchase a copy of this great book, get the one that is published by Vintage Classics. Not only does this book have a wonderful, colored illustration of a certain character (readers who have read this book know who), the cover and pages are thick and durable, not to mention acid-free (many publishers like Penguins do not use acid-free paper). Also, the binding is thick and very sturdy, and the font is of a comfortable size, unlike the mass-paperback editions. This book can make a wonderful gift to someone special, or a wonderful gift to oneself. In either case, it is best to keep in mind that this edition is really the best to get of this tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some rough spots, but worth it in the end","review":"It is a mere stylistic issue that keeps me from giving this book five stars. Parts of this book are too heavy on dialogue (a Dickens trademark), leaving the reader wanting in terms of plot development. With that small caveat, this book is an exceptional read. The ending is one of the most memorable of any book I have read. Stay with Dickens through the slow parts and you will enjoy a literary treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Documented Edition","review":"I read this edition with a student I am tutoring. The introduction by Gillen D'arcy Wood is well written and helpful. The footnotes and endnotes provide just the right amount of information and background to the story. This is a superb student edition of a classic tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"...liberty or death.","review":"Dicken's lengthy account of the French Revolution remains an historical pillar, perhaps literary as well? Regretfully, I never read this in school, nor had the opportunity to dissect and analyse its elements. The Tale of Two Cities ridicules France's distaste for nobility and aristocracy with humour while revealing the gruesome bloodshed that tortured liberty and civil rights. Dicken' s Tale of Two Cities exhibits some of the time honored cross channel nuances that continue to sustain this curious English-French relationship today. This wonderful story is a must read for any English speaking student of French Language and History."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing","review":"I love Charles Dickens and his ability to transport you to another era, this is no exception. An enjoyable read but my favourite is still Great Expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Times","review":"I'm thirty-seven years old, and now I read Dickens. I didn't read this book in high school, and didn't go to college. That I've read it now, and not twenty years ago, is for me due course; I'm a strange one who believes in a time for every book.What strikes me deepest, besides the unashamed redemption in this book--something Dickens would not get away with in this day--is the power of truth in fiction. The power of parable. This is a book I will ply to my fact-lovin' friends; I will read what they say to get them to read this. Like no other book I've read, \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" will show them the power of story as truth.It's a far, far better tale than I have read in a long, long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great literature, poor formatting.","review":"This edition simply did not display properly on my Kindle 2. Long lines alternating with short lines (frequently only one word) made this edition just unreadable for me.A Tale of Two Cities (Penny Books)comes out just fine. Perhaps the lesson learned for me is to download a sample first, but the failed formatting of this edition was an unpleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa H.","review":"Upon reading \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" by Charles Dickens, I personally found myself somewhat confused. I have read many books in my lifetime, yet none of them seem to compare to this world-famous piece of literature. I am usually very good in understanding and comprehending literature, but the wording of this book actually did confuse me. It is no fault of Charles Dickens that I could not understand some of the wording, but that really was not the main problem. The plot to this book is really very enthralling, just very confusing. It sporatically changes setting from England to France. Also, the years go jump up in clumps of at least 5 years at a time. Although I did find this to be very confusing, I also enjoyed it, and to be honest, I am not sure why. It is a great story packed with a magnificent story-line and I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a little bit of complication."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's School, what can I say?","review":"This book, being required by my sophmore english teacher, wasnt quite as exiting as I would have imagined.

It was a good book...I enjoyed it in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent - try it again!","review":"I read this book in my tenth grade year of high school. I was fifteen years old. That was the era where learning English literature did not mean reading the stories and talking about fate, or irony, or peripateia and how the story draws from earlier tales. Instead, we went searching for deep, often sexual meaning (strawberries were a dead giveaway, usually. I don't recall if A Tale of Two Cities had strawberries.)We excavated the writers' personalities through their works. So I suffered through this book, made my usual A grade in the class, and finished the year. That summer I thought, \\"This book can't be as bad as they made it out to be.\\" I pulled it off the shelf (well... I purchased a paperback) that summer, sat down and read it.This book is magnificent. Read it. If you start to bog down, skip the chapter. You can go back and read it later. It is one of the finest novels ever written, and the ending was moving enough to leave me in tears. It still does.

It took a long time to get into the book and I found it extremely hard to understand. It had way too many antonyms, and it swirled around and would talk for 2 pages about somthing easily told it 3 sentances. Extremely boring and uninteresting. When I saw that Charles Dickens wrote it I thought \\"Hey this is going to be good, I mean this is Dickens one of the best, most talked about writers of all time\\" but now I think very little of the name Dickens as a writer. I hesitate to read Great Expectations, or Oliver Twist for the sheer lack of a waste of time. 100 pages into the book and I still have no idea what it is about. There was 2 good things about it 1)Where Mrs.Mannette finds her father and 2)When I quit reading it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ending to what otherwise I found stale","review":"It always takes me a while before I really get interested in any story. Unfortunately this story took until almost the end before it really grabbed me. It may not be that bad for you, but I found some of the sentences extremely long. After reading David Copperfield I'm put off by his diction or older cliches, as long as the story is compelling. Many of his descriptive narratives were just too long and drawn out. I think there might have been some clever metaphors that I was just to lazy to think about; or as an excuse I don't know that much about that time in history. The end was full of action and suspense, I don't know if it was more disappointing that the story ended or that the first five-sixths of the book was flat.

I have read Carlyle's History of the French Revolution, Dickens' main source, and find this much the superior. My wife and I read this in high school and now in our seventies appreciate it more than then, and we appreciated it then, too. Dickens' engaging style remains with the reader. A few years back we walked by the few remaining stones of the Bastille and they seemed redolent of the novel. Reading this book was more than entertainment, it was an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, romantic, tragic","review":"This book had me enthralled from page one. Dickens allows the characters and their inner workings, feelings, and motives to present historical views and an affecting story. A wonderful example of the romanticism that is present in 19th century literature. It's called a \\"classic\\" for a good reason.As to those who don't appreciate the book because it's too long: you obviously don't read very much. Just because a book is long doesn't mean it's a bad story. But, if you're still convinced that the length of a book determines its worth, then do not read \\"Les Miserables,\\" an amazing novel by Victor Hugo.

The story-telling is cumbersome and sometime confusing; there are large chunks of narratives about irrelevant details (such as the chapter \\"The lion and the jackal\\", it does little to advance the plot). The dialogues are pretentious and unnatural -- the characters speak with a lot of parenthesized texts. The actions of the people are also to some extent unexplained and unexplainable: why does Carton sacrifice himself to save Darnay? Because of his love for Lucie? At the end he is portrayed as some larger-than-life hero and martyr, but I find some hollowness and unbelievability in that.Dickens' contemporaries and French counterparts, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas, who also wrote a few books using the same backdrop (the French Revolution). I think they are both better writers and story-tellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excessively long, boring book","review":"This has to be one of the worst books we've ever read. Dickens spends entirely too much time describing unimportant details and events. What should have been a 50-page novella was extended into a masterpiece of boredom. We don't understand why this book, like so many others, is hailed as a classic, when the ideals portrayed in the book could have taken up much less space. It is a typical Dickens composition: long and boring. Though better than Great Expectations, it was still paralyzingly boring.

The book is slow for the first half, but then things start to get more interesting. There are twists and surprises that when you read them you think, \\"no way\\" or \\"A-ha\\". Plus, you learn about what it was like to be in France during the revolution. What a time that must have been--the people were nuts! It took a while to get into the writing style because it is old English, but after you read the first few chapters it isn't as hard.

It explores powerful issues of class, as played out against the backdrop of the French Revolution. Certain of the Dickens' characters in this novel have become emblematic of the times, such as Madam DeFarge, the probably insane working class woman who knits and cackles as she screams for others to be executed by guillotine. And Sydney Carton, the drunken wastrel whose bravery and self-sacrifice crown the story.This is a must-read classic. The question is, in what edition should you read it? This \\"Enriched Classics\\" version is excellent, especially for first-time readers of the novel. In addition to a quality text, the edition includes a number of helpful features, such as an historic timeline, analyses of the novel by contemporary critics and a discussion of key plot points and themes to help readers understand the novel's context. Overall, an excellent edition of a towering classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"timeless classic wrought w/ mistakes (publisher review)","review":"The back cover does not match \\"look inside\\" picture - I received a condensed version of Dickens' story consisting only of train/mistress story.

I would recommend this book to more advanced readers because the story is written in old english so parts of it are more or less impossible to read (seriously... the first paragraph of the story is one sentence!)

In the time since I have never forgotten the touching and memorable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Edition Of Dickens","review":"The Dickens volumes published by Duckworth Press and based on the classic Nonesuch editions of his books are great bargains. They're big, with sewn bindings and include the original illustrations for the books from Dickens's time. In some volumes, the text isn't printed as crisply as one would like -- my copy of \\"A Tale Of Two Cities\\" had that problem -- but all in all these are superb reading editions, which you will appreciate all the more if you've ever tried to get through one of Dickens's books in a paperback edition with tiny print.There are better modern reproductions of the Nonesuch editions -- such as those of the Folio Society -- but they are very pricey. For the cost, these Duckworth versions are hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never read this in high school or college","review":"I don't think I can say anything about this book that hasn't been said. I thought the characters, the plot and the historical backdrop were terrific. I'm not sure why I never read this in school, even as an English major. This is the kind of book that will stay with me forever.Having said that, I don't think most high schoolers could ever fully appreciate this book. I read this at the same time as my 10th grader, who did not enjoy it. I think it's a struggle for most younger readers to understand the plot and Dickens' writing style. If you have to read it for school, try to appreciate it and think about reading it again when you are older - it is very much worth the effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy the book, nor did I find it informative.","review":"\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is tedious and time consuming. While many people say that it has plenty of action, Dickens spends too much time in description for it to be truly enjoyable. The language is too grand for most audiences today, but this is understandable. What is not understandable is the lack of life put into the words. Certainly the book is somewhat realistic, but it lacks realism. Too many characters maintain their high ideals in a time that is essentially war and chaos. I would not, under any circumstances reccommend this book to either an adult or a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK SUCKS!","review":"My teacher made me download this and I never got past the first chapter.

Dickens is a very brilliant writer, practically a genious. But, the book is very boring to read, it is almost unbarable! I wouldn't even give the piece two stars if Dickens wasn't a legenday writer.

Dickens' masterful writing style with his intricate details and vivid descriptions is present here. Characters are especially well presented. I am a high school senior and I really didn't enjoy being forced to read this lengthy piece of (somewhat) historical literature 8 weeks prior to graduation, (thanks Dr. Sims) but T2C is certainly a work that should be read by all, if not for pleasure, then for the sake of reading this \\"classic\\". You might even learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone interested in The French Revolution.","review":"I tend to divide Dickens' work into two fields - the straightforward novels, and the socially relevant ones. This belongs in the latter category, which means it is slightly less fun to read. However, the worst novel by Dickens is better then most author's best. This is a great work and when I think of The French Revolution and The Reign of Terror, it is A Tale of Two Cities that I usually imagine. Also, it contains two of the most famous passages in all of literature: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\\" and \\"It is a far, far better thing I do now than I have ever done...\\" It is a great novel to be sure, but it should not be your INTRODUCTION to Dickens."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was difficult to at times but good plot","review":"This is one of Dicken's finest works of writing. It diplicted the French revolution tremedously. Many the chapters were hard to understand but with a good english teacher like Mrs. Lee (Fort Morgan Colorado) I found it to have a great plot. When I was finished with the book looking back on it I realized what a great job dicken's did forshadowing the book and using great detail and repition to get main points across. Themes of the book though written a very long time ago still apply to life today. The only things I really disliked about the book was that it was drwan out and had at times too much info that was not nessicary. This was a great book and everyone should read it just to see a new style of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic","review":"I don't think I can say anything about this book that hasn't already been said better.

Now that I have a different perspective I see Charles Dickens in a new light.The language is a little difficult to navigate, but the period, his desciptions, and Dickens character development are a wonder not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This review has no title","review":"How do you describe a classic other than to explain the writing? How do you explain the writing without having to explain the upsetting circumstances surrounding the characters involved?The last part is easy, as is the case with the classics, most know already that A Tale of Two Cities is set in the time of the French Revolution. It begins in good times, but ends on the opposite end of the spectrum, while still finding a way to give hope to those turning the pages of history.There are visuals within these pages that will touch any reader, clear and beautiful in their wording. However, in keeping with the dual nature of things, there are also visuals that will touch the reader holding the sadness and horror of what had come about during the time of multiple executions.Life changes for many this book touches, that includes those holding it in their hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rip off","review":"I ordered this, then later found at Sams club same maker (Coffee mate), but liquid form of hazelnut cream.

Accurately capturing the messiness and immaturity of youth, Sayles still manages to involve you emotionally with his characters. He gets career best performances out of Spano and Arquette, and while his film is quite rooted in reality he still manages to pull off a first rate romantic ending.

It really is a superb piece of historical investigation. Shame the public didn't catch on to this one instead of Dan Brown's rip off. The key point of the book is that the real indentity of Christ, as far as the Knights Templar and other heretical groups were concerned, was not Jesus, but John the Baptist. The implication being that they could not have been as interested in protecting the so-called bloodline of Jesus as the Holy Blood, Holy Grail writers have suggested. The only down side to the book is that they get lost in Isis-Osiris speculation half way through it, and are at a loss to explain the significance of Mary Magdalene to the heretical tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!","review":"With the proposition of finding information concerning the secret identity of Jesus Christ, the last thing I considered was not being able to finish the book. Sadly, I couldn't! This is writing at it's most stultifyingly boring. References to divers works, writings, paintings, religious characters & secret societies, randomly picked from history, followed by mysterious & nebulous \\"could it be\\" type conclusions. Sorry, this book is truly dire! Unless you are a complete Templar-phile & absolutely obsessed with this subject, just save your money. I dearly wish I'd saved mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Research","review":"I love these kinds of books. However, in this particular book the authors present sloppy research and lots of it to prove conclusions which were already obviously predetermined. They quote their own work as if it is proven fact. There is a lot of repetition and the book is just boring! I suggest you purchase anything else in this genre rather than this sloppy piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revelation Rubbish","review":"As a Christian I was intrigued with the sub title,\\"Secret Guardians of the True Identy of Christ. Having no knowledge of Masonary, I thought this book might have some interesting information. After reading the first chapter I knew this was a bunch of [stuff]. The Authors take great liberty in assuming Leonardo da Vinci had somehow left subliminal messages in his paintings, especially the Last Supper. How can they assume such things painted Centuries before without speaking to da Vinci himself. If you are a Christian dont waste your time, stick with authors who are well respected in the field of Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of the best books I've read on this topic. The authors researched extensively themselves as well as unified the works of others. Though their ideas are unorthodox, they are well supported by the evidence.

Look, just read Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are slowly getting nearer to the truth!","review":"'The Templar Revelation' forms a kind of trilogy with previous authors works such as 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' and 'The Second Messiah'. The current work opens with a fascinating disclosure about Leonardo de Vinci, and closes powerfully with the 'revelations' about Mary Magdalene and the 'initiates' of a Jesus-Egyptian mystery school. Prince and Picknett point out that some of Jesus's own disciples didn't really understand what he was teaching, and this book takes us one step closer to the reason why the Templars and Prieure de Sion venerate Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist above all. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspiracy Theorists Will Love This, I Did!","review":"Jesus and John the Baptist may have been rivals, The Knights Templar may have worshipped some pagan god named Baphomet, and the Knights Templar and Masons worship John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene over Jesus. These are just a few of the theories found in The Templar Revelation. Oh wait I forgot the one about Mary Magdalene possibly being a priestess in an Isis Cult and Jesus being initiated into the High Magick mysteries by her! If you are into conspiracies you'll love this book.Its a fun read for people who don't take their Christian roots all too seriously. But I can see how its totally offensive to those who do. The one downside is the book can take a while to get through.In the end they come to no real conclusions just a lot of crazy theories which are quite entertaining. Some other titles that may be of interest are Jesus and the Lost Goddess and The Jesus Mysteries by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy, which I would trust more for facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this book","review":"There is a lot of fiction written about the supposed history of the Templars and if you like that kind of thing, all well and good. However if you want to know the true facts about the Templars, as apposed to speculation, I would suggest that you look elsewhere at other books, such as those written by Barber or Piers Paul Read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly new, and brilliantly accurate.","review":"What great books are coming out now on the Templars,Cathars,Christ etc etc This is yet another book I cannot put down. Like the Tomb of God, the logistics are refreshing and new. Almost to the point of being simple. I simply cannot get enough view points on this subject matter and am interested in setting up a web chat site. Its great that Amazon have such a readily available library with book reviews from ordinary people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure conjecture","review":"This book began well, particularly with its dissemination of da Vinci's religious art. However, it went rapidly downhill from there as it went of on bizarre tangents regarding Mary Magdelene as some sort of priestess in the Eygptian cult of Isis, with Jesus as one of her acolytes. Its interesting, but where is the evidence to back it up? At no time do they produce any concrete foundations on which to build there argument. There were many times when I could have shredded this book in frustration!Come on Picknett and Prince - treat us as if we have brains!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction 1; Scholarship 0","review":"A fine example of the growing illiteracy in this land, Picknett and Prince declaim at length with neither proof nor documentation. We are expected to take their word about numerous events and accept their interpretations of various actions. They provide much interesting fiction, but present it as possible fact. This book is a complete waste of time and money. In a sensible age, this trash would be published at the authors' expense. To paraphrase the great Jon Carroll, this is the sort of tripe you read if you read this sort of tripe. I tried to give it zero stars, but the imbecile programmer won't let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Boring, Sleep-inducing","review":"I think the most pages I was able to read without either daydreaming or actually sleeping was 7.

The sequel by the same authors, already available in Europe, takes one to the next level - sharing the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculative but fun.","review":"This book should not be read as a serious history book, but rather as a fun conspiracy theory, for all those intriguing blanks in \\"official\\" history. The lack of serious scholarship is most clearly seen when examining the notes, which are supposed to lend the work an air of credibility. But when they reference supposed historical facts to \\"as told in conversation\\" with so-called experts, the whole argument falters. The templar bit is ironically the least convincing, as several dodgy sources are cited. The part about jesus being an egyptian sex-magician is fun though.Summa summarum; read it at your leisure, but do so with a critical eye. In fact, read instead the \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", which has more facts, more fun, and almost as whacky and incoherent conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conjecture, Claims, Leaps of Imagination, Silliness","review":"The authors must have been paid by the word.It is not sensational or new or compelling. It is a pop faux history book with some rather thrilling leaps of imagination and conclusions. It is a dull rehearsal of a fascinating topic.Still, it is worthwhile in that it challenges us to examine what true Christian history might mean. Don't expect much in the form of real conclusive history here and you won't be disappointed. Even more tedious than Holy Blood Holy Grail.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rationalised Theories","review":"I purchased this book whilst in London, and believe it to be a rather amusing and quite cleverly written book. The messages it conveys, in my opinion, are cunningly sketched, as are the rationalised theories, which for me, have too many holes in them to actually believe. Decide for yourselves.Prior to reading this book, one ought to have their foundation in ancient/Templar history sorted, especially when it comes to the Blue Apples. For it is quite easy to be swayed into another's perspective, especially if one has minimal information on the subject at hand. Again, one must decide.***The Truth speaks to many of us in different ways, and is not always found in the written word, or the research of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masonic mumbo jumbo...........","review":"This book is a lot of fun but generaly contains a series of mis-matched facts and stories. If you liked 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' then you should enjoy this book too.The conclusion is interesting and very funny. It seems like the authors have strung together all this mysterious secret mens business info to argue the following :1. Established religion does not care for the modern female and her rights2. There is a long standing western mystery traditionBoth facts that are well known by most people but its seems that Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince had to spend 8 years researching and travelling around Europe before they could discover these profound revelations.Upshot is that its a lot of fun but best read like a Sunday paper - skim through and don't take it too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrendous!","review":"This book was perhaps the weakest \\"history\\" book I have ever purchases. The \\"research\\" was thoroughly disappointing (e.g. siting the \\"Passover Plot\\" as a credible source) and totally incomplete and inaccurate (e.g. failing to notice that \\"eli, eli...\\", as spoken by Christ on the cross, was a quote of Old Testament scripture).The authors have let their anti-Christian bias completely compromise their research and results.I returned this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and very well researched","review":"This book has kept me riveted for days on end. After reading it I am anxious to research many of the issues it touches on. I also appreciate the tone of the authors: they don't talk down to readers from some pompous tower of academicism. Most of the other books on this topic feel much more like Holy Blood, Holy Grain for dummies. Each hypothesis these authors put forth seems at least possible, and then they go through the most extensive historical research to prove it. I should say it is long, and very detailed, but if you are interested in the topics it seems to read itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Revelations inside The Templar Revelation","review":"Typical of similar books that promise a lot but reveal little. Lots of information relating to religion, free masonry, etc., but it revealed no real purpose of the Knights Templar group or any significant accomplishments. This is not surprising since much of the information was about religion, at best a myth and at the worst a terrible imposition on human progress... just as it is today. Not a book to keep as a reference or to ever read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bites off more than it can chew","review":"The book reads fast but like most psuedo-conspiratorial literature of its kind it gets imprecise. The New Testament is relied on when beneficial to their argument, but other parts are dismissed as fabrication. I find it hard to pick and choose as they did; thus as a whole I am sceptical of most of their conclusions. Also, themes that were important in the beginning of the book (i.e. the role of Mary Magdalene) tend to lose their weight as the book ends (if she was important to Jesus, and Jesus is not who the world thinks, why is she still important - it's hard to discuss without revealing spoilers!). In this vein, why is it so vital for the Priory to guard the lineage it guards? Had they addressed these and other contradicitons the book would have been too long and less compelling.Overall, the book was entertaining - a fun bit of subversion for Templar hunters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I enjoyed it.

Eco works in so much non-fiction that one reviewer said the novel needed an index!) and does not pretend to be non-fiction. Eco's format allows much more scope for exploration of the issues of this genre beyond the mere construction of theories of conspiracy and revisionism and succeeds in entertaining, informing, and above all not taking itself too seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another hard to read book by over used vocabulary Phds.","review":"Why do historial or scientific writers feel they have to use the biggest words they can find in their books? I'm an educated man and I had to stop at least twice every page to look up words in the dictionary. I don't feel like doing this for the entire book.Most of the heavy words could have easily been substituted with single word replacements. I can use a thesaurus to find the biggest word to use too... I just choice not to in my writtings so readers can enjoy and understand rather than trying to show them how educated and well versed I am.My overall review is that this book would have been much more enjoyable if egos didn't get in the way of the topic being illustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked your junior history class","review":"I think this book rambles, it does not focus on a particular line of thinking. It sounded a little to much like a text book for my taste"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Interesting subject matter for sure. Nevertheless, when you make so many leaps, you have to start to wonder why nobody else reaches the conclusion these guys do.I wonder how much the authors' perceived hatred for catholicism jaded their research. My guess is quite a bit.After writing this review, I suspect some of the brainless sycophants out there who take one snippet of information and exclude the rest (like the authors), will now find my review \\"unhelpful\\". That's great--no big deal, but maybe ask yourself why is it that these two individuals, who can't read ancient greek or aramic, or hebrew, are suddenly able to seize upon the conclusions that have been missing from the world for 2000 years? Because they are as selective in their research as the church was at editing the bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustration","review":"By the time I reached page 106 of this book, my frustration with the authors and their suppositions, caused my interest level to drop to zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Subject - Poorly Written Book","review":"This is an extremely interesting subject. Unfortunately, this particular book is poorly written. The book lacks organization and support for their arguments. It reads like it was written by a committee of high school students.The logic goes something like this: DaVinci's paintings, through symbolism, show an unorthodox view of Jesus and John. Cocteau's paintings show an unorthodox view of Jesus and John. The logical conclusion is that they were both members of the same secret society.Perhaps they both were members, but it does not logically flow from the suppositions. The entire book is filled with these logical fallacies. Although I tend to agree with many of their conclusions, it's not because of their arguments.An extremely interesting subject that is best explored in other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Templar Revelation","review":"While i agree with Mr. nomo23, a reviewer who sounds very learned, about the pettiness between authors, I found the book very intriguing. It brough to light alot I didn't know about the dead sea scrolls, and Madonna worship among other things. However, I wonder just how far some things were 'stretched' to make a point at times during the book. I also must agree with one of the other 'Reviewers' that it DOES tend to leave you feeling 'beaten up' at times, as well as seeming to be 2 different books..the first 1/3rd and last 2/3rds. Over all, I'd still recommend it as a good read for anyone with an open mind, and curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging, yet not very convincing","review":"I totally enjoyed reading this book. It provides an engaging and interesting perspective on Christianity and, as other reviewers have pointed out, turns our culture today upside down.While it is interesting however to imagine the world if that theory was true, the book definitely does not have the authority to do that. Poor research, unattributed STRONG statements, sources that are as valid as \\"a secret newsletter distributed on the streets of Paris in 1890.\\" At some passages of teh book I felt insulted by the authors for failing to support their conclusionms by evidence or by using their own assumptions as evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"When did Jesus live?

I really recommend reading the two to gain a better understanding of history and chronology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross inaccuracies, a \\"con\\" job!","review":"The book is full of unproven suppositions. They make a poorly proven case for a point in one chapter, then in the next, they allude to it as \\"as we have proven previously\\". Most of their\\"revelations\\" are such: Poorly proven.One example: They say the \\"Gospel Of Mary\\" refers to Mary Magdalene, and say it says so. They don't provide the quote. Well, I HAVE a copy of the Gospel Of Mary, and it clearly states it was wriiten by Mary, wife of Joseph, mother of JEsus.This is only one example of shoddy research writing. They fail to prove any of their points in the book, in fact they should make a discerning reader very skeptical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh This bad.","review":"Over produced, too much emphasis with orchestration to cover up the poor vocals.

Many musicians are content to simply impress their friends with local recordings or pub performances. While I can't rank this CD with specific artist CD's, this is still a strong example of what the U.S. would declare as \\"undiscovered\\" talent. If this is your introduction to traditional Irish music, this is a good start. Please see my other reviews of \\"undiscovered\\" groups such as Nomos and Arcady.

Most of these tracks are the new-age approach to celtic music which are not traditional. Irish music is my favourite music of all, and here are my recommendations:Dolores Keane with John Faulkner - Sail Og Rua (simple, gorgeous minor-celtic harmonies that send shivers down your spine)Dolores Keane - A Farewell to Erin (fantastic)The Chieftains - Anything, start with Best Of or Greatest HitsThe Dubliners - The Best Of (my 2-cd set came from Holland through Amazon.com and it's fantasticThe Johnstons - Barley Corn (gorgeous husky female voices, great fiddle & guitar playing)The Johnstons - Bitter Green (their version of Lord Thomas and Fair Ellender, in 3-part harmony, is one of the most haunting things I've ever heard)Happy listening - slainte!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people do what they like","review":"And Robert Palmer did indeed do that.This album was released in 1976 after pressure drop.It rather good lp by robert some tracks I don't likethats just me. overall I give it and 8.9Robert did what he wanted without question in the70' and 80'sHow many artists can say that now of these daysand stay with record comapany for 1974 to 1985thats 11 yrs .

I am happy to say that Ringo Rama is his best CD since Ringo. It is hard-rocking, creative, sentimental...His voice sounds better than ever, and his underappreciated drumming is in top form. It is very Beatlesque. Highlights include \\"Never Without You\\"(a wonderful tribute to George), the warmly sung \\"Missouri Loves Company,\\" and \\"Instant Amnesia\\" (I've never heard Ringo like this). Buy the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ringo Masterpiece","review":"I Highly recommend getting this CD . I think its Ringos best . The album is very enjoyable to listen to .

Superb songs, artistry, sound, arangments, and voice.","review":"This ranks as one of the best post Beatle's albums to date; either by John, Paul, George, or Ringo. And INSTANT AMNESIA is the best Rockin' tune for sure. One can listen to it over and over and still hear something new and exciting. The lowest ranking song is WRITE TO ME only becuase Willie Nelson's singing isn't that great (what else is new). The rest of the songs are five stars. Ringo gets excellent help from Dean Grakal, Gary Burr, Mark Hudson, Barbara Starkey, and Steve Dudas in every song on this collection. In an interview while making this album, Ringo claims that he had the other musicians recorded the songs while in one small room. He says he believes playing togther while recording is better than in seperate rooms and by overlaying tracks. With this recordings I agree. The feel and sound of a collection of professional rockers and artist comes through. Way to go RINGO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ringo Rocks!","review":"Ringo is the greatest rock drummer to ever walk the earth. His playing style enhanced every Beatle recording that he was ever on. Not all of Ringo's solo albums have been great. Some have not been very good at all. With this said, Ringo Rama is the most \\"complete\\" album that he has ever done. I did not expect to like it as much as I do. From the first track to the last it has me singing along and smiling. I have always loved Ringo's drumming, but he has outdone himself on this album with thoughtful, creative fills and beats. It make me very happy that the most recent albums by George Harrison and Ringo Starr are among the best that they ever recorded. True \\"Starr\\" power never goes away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One!","review":"Ringo's on a role. I feel his last five releases have been outstanding.

Yes, he played the drums for one of the most famous bands ever, but that does not make him a great drummer and what's more his songs don't need great drumming. 'Nough said.While I really enjoy some of his past hits, Ringo is not something I have much for replayabilty. And this album is fits right in. It was OK to listen to, but unless your a true Ringo fan, this album is not much to keep in the player to hear over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"Like McCartney, Ringo proves the theory that multi-millionaires have literally nothing of value to say, since saying or not saying it makes no difference to them.Full of stillborn attempts at Rock, Pop, and Special Guests a-plenty, Ringorama lacks any RingoDrama, and probably won't be of any value to anyone except Ringo apologists and yer RingoGramma."},{"rating":"2","title":"RINGO Hits the mark!","review":"Who would have thought that one day RINGO STARR would release a product that surpasses any recent release from PAUL McCARTNEY!RINGO RAMA is a CD that will appeal to any die hard BEATLE fan.The overall production on this CD is timeless and yet very trendy and radio friendly. Guest appearances from Eric Clapton and Shawn Colvin are a welcome addition and help raise the quality bar on this collection of songs. Willie Nelson is paired with a RINGO, both appear to have the same vocal technique in delivering their lyrics. The songs are mostly \\"up beat\\" and \\"NEVER WITHOUT YOU\\" is a great ballad that could have been classified as a BEATLE classic.A trip back in time delivered by a CD that is well worth the price.Very pleasent surprise !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A low blow","review":"First, if you haven't already picked up Ringo Rama, DO SO! Especially this deluxe edition. You won't be sorry. Why only 1 star? Well, as an earlier reviewer explained, this is the second time within 1 year that this album has been released and us Beatle people are feeling mighty taken advantage of. I'd never heard any of the three new tracks until I heard \\"Blink\\" in a music store today. It's a really good song, and I immediately headed right over to the Ringo section (yes, some stores still have Ringo sections!!) of the CD rack. Then I saw the price.Sorry, Ringo, but as George said, \\"You can lead a horse to water ...\\"And Mark, if you read these reviews ... how could you, a huge Beatles fan, allow this to happen?

Then the English system would be similar to metric in ease of readability. Like: 1/32, 2/32, etc).Anyway, this tape measure fixes that problem for me.

This video gives an interesting overview of the Louvre's history, but spends disappointingly little time on the art. The lighting for much of the art shots is very poor, and the angles make it difficult to see. Much precious film time is wasted on viewing spectators instead of the building and its contents. A good view if you would enjoy the historical background of this wonderful building, but as one who has been there, a disappointing view of it's architecture and treasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good history of the Louvre and France, disappointing art tour","review":"I do not consider the description accurate, as I would expect a \\"tour of one of the world's great art galleries\\" to mostly allow one to view the art of the museum. But it is mostly a history of the building. I did find the history very interesting, so I did enjoy it. But I wish it had focused more on the art. The few paintings it showed were only on screen for a brief moment (of course you can pause to view longer) and very little information was provided about the paintings. If you are interested in the history of the Louvre as a building and France's history you will enjoy it. If you want to see quality images of the art of the Louvre you may be disappointed. Also, this was originally filmed in 1978 so the quality is reflective of that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"old school, but pretty good","review":"3.5 stars, actually. kinda yellowed and dingy, but the narration is good. if you don't know the history of the building, here's your chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bit too simple","review":"A bit too simplistic for the HS physics student. This book, instead, seems more aimed towards pre-HS students seeking a healthy head-start on physics concepts w/o being innundated w/ physics problem sets or mathematical equations and confusion. A small glimpse of the concept w/ emphasis on practical applications clearly present physics in a earnest manner to readers. Serves home-schooled students extremely well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid; 3.5 Stars","review":"Lyall is an under-rated thriller writer. His best books are probably the Harry Maxim series, some of which were made into BBC TV shows. This series, which focuses on the British Secret Service on the eve of WWI, is solid, above average entertainment. Lyall does well with good character development, solid plotting, and reasonable attention to historical detail. Hard to obtain in the US because these books were published in Britain, well worth a few dollars in a used bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"all honourable men","review":"I rather liked this book -- a bit different from Gavin Lyall's others where the heros tend to be aeroplanes. Interesting to read a novel set in a forgotton segment of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few decent ideas underneath all fluff","review":"Basically this album plays like a vanity project, and it shows, giving credence to the sentiment raised by cynics of the avant garde genre as being nothing but experimental pettiness. Amongst the half baked ideas lie some predominately aimless noodeling, with unjustified changes, overshadowing what remains as a ghost of a shell for an amazing album here. For every subtly smart move, there are two cheaply implemented moves to stimulate the edginess that this popster was in over his head making. Too bad the lack of direction kills this, for some reason it's synthesis of production elements made it fascinating to study the textures, and sadly wanting much more, length-wise as well.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"five minutes that saved the film\\" category","review":"The only reason to watch this film is for Quentin Tarantino's homoerotic speculations about \\"Top Gun.\\" Other than that, the film is complete waste of talent (Stoltz, Meg Tilly, Shelly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a fun,fun movie.it has the makings of a cult classic","review":"dont make the mistake of taking this movie too seriously.!! this movie is hillarious!! although the plot line of a love triangle is an old one,this flick is more about the characters and their quirkyfunny,yet normal(for californians)personalities.there was a lot of care used by the writers in developing all the different characters,and keeping them consistant,yet reacting to the story.each time i watch this movie i see something new and appreciate it more.give this movie a look and you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated But Hasn't Lost Its Touch","review":"This is no reflection on the quality of the film, but Sleep With Me loses its edge after ten years. It's full of witty, 90's style banter. This was a great film when romantic comedies were in. The actors were hilarious and I enjoyed Craig Sheffer for the first time ever. I don't watch a lot of his films but this one is entertaining. I saw it in 1994 and was hooked on it then. Since then my tastes have changed and I've gotten attached to other films. This is the perfect date movie providing a realistic, comedic look at the differences between women and men and the problems that can surface within a circle of friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moments of genius","review":"This is a good movie, but the final 15 minutes are almost pure genius. the story comes to an emotional head, with some great dialogue, and superb acting, but Tarantino nearly steals the show with his cameo.

Oh, for rap to step back to these days.I had the original version of this album, but I am getting married, and want Regulators to play at my reception.

Rochefort & Cobb: \\"The Politics of Problem Definition\\", Baumgartner & Jones: \\"Agendas and Instability in American Politics\\", Cobb & Ross: \\"Cultural Strategies of Agenda Denial\\" and Jones: \\"Reconceiving Decision-Making in Democratic Politics\\" should all interest you once you've fallen in love with the thoughts of Schattschneider. Your view of politics will never be the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic account of western democracy","review":"This often-quoted book is one of the most classic works of 20th century political science. Despite its age, published in the early 1960s, this brilliant little book is still astonishingly fresh. Schattschneider's account of the expansion and privatisation (contraction) of conflicts, and his description of the structural biases of modern western democracy, is eye-opening. The book is very accessible, yet scholary. This is one of the best, most important, and in a strange way morally refreshing, books on politics I have ever come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Overrated but Overpriced","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this book is as great as political science gets -- I grant you that such is faint praise.

Not interested in vocals, then this group is for you! Well recorded and produced.

The bass strap was WAY short and the guitar strap only works totally extended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing...suspend your disbelief","review":"You know it's fiction but it's believable and could have happened.

I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fantastic Philippa Gregory book!","review":"I got hooked by reading \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", then enjoyed \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" as much if not more if that's possible. If you want to get into this whole great series, it starts with \\"The Constant Princess\\" but the \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\", and \\"The Queen's Fool\\" are the most compelling.If you want to know about the time that was somewhat skipped before \\"The Queen's Fool\\" you can read \\"- The Last Wife of Henry VIII by Carolly Erickson\\" (my rating - 3 stars) and \\"Innocent Traitor: A Novel of Lady Jane Grey\\" by Alison Weir (my rating 4 stars) before \\"The Queen's Fool\\" (my rating 5 stars).

Phillipa Gregory is a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bolelyn Inheritance\\"","review":"It was very interesting to learn the history of Henry VIII's other wives. they were somewhat a mystery compared to Ann Bolelyn.The story of Ann of Cleves told the story of her arranged marriage to Henry & how she managed to evade the beheading that befell the other queens. Also the story of the teenage Kathryn & her demise. It is a novel with historical facts. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far my favorite Gregory book","review":"This is my 3rd Gregory book and definitely my favorite. I don't usually like stories that alternate narrators but this time it worked well and I liked it. I was completely enchanted by Gregory's portrayals of Katherine Howard and Anne of Cleves (the two of Henry VIII's wives about whom the least is known). I'm more impressed than ever at Gregory's faithfulness to history and her confidence in making up what can't be proved through research. In this book she made history and fiction blend beautifully. No one would ever believe that I--a high school and college history hater from way back--have become so fascinated with these historical figures that I just can't put these books down. Where were these books when I was suffering through dry, boring history classes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Turned out to be a pretty good book. It was a little confusing at the start since there are 3 characters points of view, but once you get to know the characters it gets really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction","review":"Nicely written follow-up to The Other Boleyn Girl. Interesting insight into the lives of relatively unknown women. The narrative style of all three women's stories added another dimension to their personalities. Very enjoyable and left me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"As addictive as chocolate.","review":"I enjoyed this light bit of fiction as much as I do nice chocolates. I could not put it down. Am glad that I had read The Other Boleyn Girl and The Constant Princess first. If you like reading fiction about Henry's wives, then you will enjoy this book. A little racier than two aforementioned works of fiction, it's still not a romance per se. So, if you're looking for a\\" bodice ripper,\\" this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great author","review":"A friend recommended this author (and this series) and I've loving it! I'm disappointed that Queen Jane (the 3rd wife) was skipped and the last wife seems to be skipped (in the series). But, all the books thus far are great, including this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First person narration effective","review":"I've always enjoyed history and, in the case of The Bolyen Inheritance, I particularly liked seeing the historical facts unfold through the minds of the main characters. Some of what came out was startling and sent me to google for more facts and confirmation. Why they did what they did, in the face of ample examples of persons who paid the ultimate price for daring to cross the line, still eludes me. Unfortunately, I can't seem to rid my mind of a visual image of a fat, flatulent and putrefying Kind Henry who killed at will, just because he could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigued","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance is an even more intrigued and interesting read than The Other Boleyn Girl. A must read for anyone who is interested in reading friction intertwined with rich historical background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Great read and great story!

For a first time Henry reader I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Slant on Two of Henry's VIII's Wives & Lady Rochford","review":"Enjoyed this book immensely. Finally, more written on Katherine Howard & Jane Boleyn (Lady Rochford). Lady Rochford finally gets hers in the end after what she did to her husband, George, & sister-in-law Anne Boleyn she deserved what she got. What a scheming wench! Poor Kat Howard was not innocent in the biblical sense, but was an innocent in her mind. Anne of Cleves also starred in this novel; she was the lucky one. She avoided the plots & deception in Henry VIII's court & the madness of Henry himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"In The Boleyn Inheritance, Phillipa Gregory takes a unique and thoughtful approach in her characterization of these lesser known figures from Henry VIII's throughly examined life. The story is told from the viewpoint of three women all trying to survive in the harsh and unforgiving environment of a tyrannical madman's world. An interesting perspective. The three separately reveal their thoughts, motivations and ambitions during the time following Anne Boleyn's death and leading up to the execution of Henry's fifth wife, Katherine Howard. The author does a very credible job in imagining what must be going through the minds of Anne of Cleves, Jane Boleyn and Katherine Howard while their lives are in Henry's hands. I've read a lot of fiction set in Tudor England as well as nonfiction and I always enjoy Phillipa Gregory's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"Don't be fooled by the other reviews boasting of the excellence of this novel; it is a great disappointment to anyone who has read The Other Boleyn Girl, The Virgin's Lover and the The Queen's Fool. Much like the Constant Princess, this book is full of repetition--so much so that it is a wonder that Ms Gregory's editors let her get away with it. Her characters did not grow or change as a result of their ordeal, but, again and again repeated almost the very same words as those said in the previous chapter. While the conceit of the story is interesting--telling the tale from the point of view of each of the 3 female protaganists, the execution is amateur. In truth, this book should be no more than a few chapters long. As I said, a great disappointment that must be laid at the feet of Ms. Gregory's need to publish a book each year. This is my 6th Gregory book and the last that I will read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings the story full circle","review":"You have to read this before you read the Queen's Fool or the Virgin's Lover. It runs along the lines of the Other Boleyn Girl and completes what you have missed before The Boleyn Inheritance. I can't say more or I will spoil it. I loved the whole series and would read it over and over again. I also wish that I would have read The Constance Princess first. I found I had less compassion for her without the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book challenged me ...","review":"I've done quite a bit of reading and research about Tudor history, but this book challenged me to learn more, especially about Anne of Cleves. While everything in this book is not 100% historically accurate, Gregory fleshed out her characters very well - and made them truly come to life. I admired Anne of Cleves and felt truly heart-sick about poor Catherine Howard. While she may be right (or wrong) about Jane Boleyn, she presented a vivid characterization. After reading Julia Fox's dismal book about Jane Boleyn, I realized just what a great job Gregory did with the same material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gregory Book!","review":"Every book of Gregory's that I read always keeps me entertained and wanting for more! When I finish one, I cannot wait to pick up the next. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Servere Letdown","review":"This book moved sooooo slowly. it was nothing at all like the other boleyn girl.

They were very excited...and ready to share it when they were finished. I'm on the list for sharing, so I can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"I like reading historical fiction because it gives the facts and creates a story around it. It's normally easy to read in the sense it's not dry like most regular history books. This book started off well, and when I wasn't reading about Lady Jane Rochford, the book was easy to read and enjoyable. The chapters that were in Lady Jane Rochford's voice, however, were so off base it was impossible to read. The writer made Lady Rochford sound innocent and nice, rather than the vindictive and malicious woman she was. It would have been easier to read if she hadn't been portrayed as pure as she had been portrayed. She may not have been as malicious as some people believe, but she wasn't guiltless when you consider her testimony sent her husband and his sister to their deaths."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY inaccurate!","review":"I LOVE history and historical novels, but it really bothers me when an author takes real historical people & events, and completely changes the story! If you want to write absolute fiction, then do that!

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS AUTHOR TO ANYONE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wriiten for a simpleton","review":"This book could easily be edited down to 1/4 of it's length. It is extraordinarily boring, slow moving and deeply repetitive. I do not have amnesia nor am i a simpleton. I do not need to be reminded of mundane details every 3 or 4 pages. I kept reading this book only to see if anything was every actually going to happen. I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best!","review":"I found this book boring and an awkward read. Phillipa Gregory's other books were MUCH better and more interesting! Wish I had waited until it came out in paperback OR had a higher discounted price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved The Other Boleyn Girl, but in my opinion The Boleyn Inherityance is not nearly as good. The story is told by 3 people--Katherine Howard, Ann of Cleves and Jane Boleyn (George's wife). These 3 are not nearly as interesting as Mary, Anne and George Boleyn were in The Other Boleyn Girl. Also, Henry the VIII in The Boleyn Inheritance is grossly obese, has a smelly leg wound and is using his power to behead and persecute lots of people, so there is no real love story as there was with Katherine of Aragon; Ann of Cleves and Katherine Howard both find him repulsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd chapter structure","review":"I like the use of descriptions to describe the dress and atmosphere. I was not prepared for the way it is organized. It switches from the viewpoint of three different characters. So it tells of an event through one character and then switches and tells the exact event again through the other two characters. So you are basically reading the same events three times. It is nice to see the different viewpoints, but after a while it gets predictable. I became bored with the same event being told three times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Philippa Gregory has done it again.

I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinforces other books I've read","review":"I've read alot of books about the Tudors (long before the show came out)and this discusses some of the people surrounding Anne andHenry VIII.

Not the case at all. In both books, I became totally engrossed in that period of history.

I plan to read more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"I bought the audio book for a road trip that I made recently.

Being a fan of \\"The Tudors\\" I did not think I would find anything new in this book. How wrong I was! Reading about the lives of Anne of Cleves, Jane Seymour, and Kathyrn Howard in the first person is a wonderful way to enlighten the reader about these lesserr known figures in the Tudor court. I highly reccommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divorced, beheaded, died...","review":"divorced, beheaded, survived. For me, at least, this book combined as a little history lesson about two queens one does not often read about in this genre and some great fiction. I was impressed by Ms. Gregory's development of her characters and the way she allowed the reader to see the Tudor court from three distinct perspectives. I found this book to be superior to The Virgin's Lover, and somehow more tragic than the Other Boleyn Girl. Perhaps it was the youth of Katherine Howard or the seemingly inescapable tyranny of the Henry that is portrayed in this novel, but I found this one particularly sad and intense all at the same time. Overall, an engaging read for any Philippa Gregory fan or a fan of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wives of Henry VIII - the saga continues........","review":"I found this book to be a riveting continuation of the story of the wives of Henry VIII. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" was the beginning of the saga and should be read first. This story is an in-depth treatment of Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. Both books are written in a style that is easy to read and successfully pulls you into complete involvement with the story. It's hard to lay the book down to take care of things like dishes and laundry! I highly recommend this and look forward to reading other books by Philippa Gregory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at three lesser known females in Henry VIII's court","review":"I believe this is my fifth Philippa Gregory book and, while (to me) it is not nearly as good as The Other Boleyn Girl, it's an entertaining read nonetheless. The Boleyn Inheritance is told from the alternating first person perspectives of Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard and Jane Boleyn, each short chapter jumping between these three lesser known females who inhabited Henry VIII's court. I enjoyed Gregory's exploration of sweet and simple Anne of Cleves (Henry's fourth wife), dimwitted and self -absorbed Katherine Howard (Henry's fifth wife) and scheming yet tormented Jane Boleyn (lady in waiting to Anne and Katherine as well as sister-in-law to Anne Boleyn). Anyone who enjoys historical fictional, particularly involving Henry VIII and his wives, will likely enjoy this book ... but just do not expect to enjoy it as much as The Other Boleyn Girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It Read It! But Read The Other Boleyn Girl First!","review":"Wow, what a book! Life in 16th century Europe was some kinda scary. Read this sequel, find out what happens to everyone at court after the death of Anne Boleyn.

But there's more, much more! Don't miss out! Get one today."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Sequel","review":"I enjoy Hickam. I found The Keeper's Son to be a particularly good read; it was believable, well crafted, exciting and informative. In short, all the things one likes in a book. The Ambassador's Son was touted to be its immediate sequel. Perhaps. It struck me as contrived, formulaic, short on logic and long on suspension of belief and coincidence. In short, a major disappointment. This book is a miss. Too bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you believe this story, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you...","review":"This was perhaps the most contrived and ridiculous story I have read in many years.

Plus cannibals and naked native girls. The only character missing was Elvis."},{"rating":"2","title":"ncoutlander","review":"I guess like previous readers of the Keeper's son I didn't know what to expect. I just knew I looked forward to reading about Josh Thurlow's new adventure. The first 50 pages were hard to get through, but the table has to be set sometimes, before the main course can be served. I would recommend that one read \\"The Keeper's son, in order to know more about Josh Thurlowe and crew. I did miss the characters of Killakeet, but came to really enjoy the new ones in \\" The Ambassador's Son\\". Pongo, Dave, Felicity and Penelope where a great additions. Even Nick, I must admit was a fascinating person and I'm a big Kennedy fan myself. I loved the portrayal of Shafty and the tragic story about Rosemary. Once Josh was given his mission, things really started to take off. Homer took us once again on a another wonderful and exciting adventure, giving us a history lesson along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too cute","review":"I gave up after reading 2/3 of the book.

I was looking forward to the sequel. This one is not quite as good as the first book, but enough action to keep the pages turning. If possible, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.I do have to say that I did have to suspend disbelief on several occasions as Hickman tried too hard to work two famous real life characters into the book. We spend a lot of time with John F. Kennedy, who joins Thurlow's crew after PT-109 is sunk. And Richard Nixon makes a couple of appearances as well. It's true that they both served in the Armed Forces in the Pacific Theater during World War II, but the story would have worked just as well without them. If you can overlook this stretch, and liked \\"The Keeper's Son,\\" this book will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"More!

There are heroines, scoundrels, and comfortable companions (both feline and human) scattered throughout. If you are a cat person, this is a must read. If youre not, reading this book may make you one. The art work is incredible! The author painted her oil images on plate glass and then carefully lay paper over the glass and gently rubbed a wooden spoon in small circles around the paper, thereby transferring the images in an unusual, blended manner onto the paper.

Some great explanations and examples, but most are at a very introductory level.The chapter on ASP.NET is well organized, and everyone interested in using ASP.NET will learn something. There is a great section on data validation and a clear explanation on how to use the Application, Session, and Cookie objects. ASP developers should have little trouble ramping up to ASP.NET quickly. Be aware that the coverage of ADO.NET is sketchy at best.All in all, Programming Visual Basic .NET is a good book. Not the best book you'll ever read on the subject, but a good beginning level book. If you've every had any experience with Visual Basic or ASP, most of the examples will be very easy to pick up on.

This is one of the finest books I have ever read and I couldn't put it down. While the first book had a steady pace and introduced most of the characters, the second and third books were intense. Mr. BeauSeigneur uses character point of view to great advantage, and he puts great detail into this story. It is a brilliant and inspirational book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid ending to a great series","review":"BeauSeigneur accomplishes a difficult task--ending this sophisticated, urgency-packed end times trilogy. Those familiar with Christian end-times fiction know how the book has to end. The author exposes evil, applauds righteousness, and mourns the multitudes who are deluded by the most ancient of enemies.While the author does better than most, in this genre, I found the first two books moved at a better pace than number three. This conclusion had slow spots, and occasionally was more obvious in exposing the author's viewpoints, than the previous two had been.In the end, I loved this series and hated to see it end. My sense is that the author felt the same way. I hope BeauSeigneur is discovered by the big publishing houses. Who knows, maybe he will do a similar series on the Tower of Babel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"After reading the first 2 books in this series, I eagerly jumped into the third.

Additionally, the end of this third book is a complete let down. Contrary to the reviews printed on the book jacket, there is little erudition and the author's interpretation of many of the referenced passages in the Bible are highly questionnable. This is not fiction, this is propoganda with a false hook."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTS OF GOD","review":"I WAS READY TO THROW AWAY ALL THREE WHILE READING BOOK TWO OF THIS TRILOGY, BUT FELT LED TO CONTINUE ON TO THIS ONE, THE LAST IN THE TRILOGY.

The fabric that's supposed to be \\"welded\\" tight over the entire surface of the pad like skin has pulled away from about 30% of the surface, and is continuing to do so.I called Belkin - which was no fun, btw - and they're going to replace it ... AS LONG AS I first send them this faulty one, paying the postage. That means I'll probably have to go for a few weeks without a mouse pad.

Another reviewer says it's too reflective and the mouse doesn't track on it, but I haven't had that problem. My optical mouses (all cheap ones) seem to work fine on it.

The quality is entirely different and cheap now. The weight is much lighter (the top corners don't even lay flat), the gel pad feels like a brick, and worst of all the surface is so reflective that my optical mouse does not track properly on it. As mouse pads go, these are pricey (but used to be worth it) and so I am very disappointed to see Belkin cut quality like this and rip off a longtime (now ex-) customer.

I CANNOT use ANY wireless optical mice on this surface. I tried 3 and the mice stop responding when used on this surface.Also from what I can tell, it causes a LOT of friction which means it takes more effort to move the mouse across the pad. I can actually HEAR the mouse when I move it around.The only positive feedback I can give is the shape,size, and feel of the wrist support. which is exactly what I was looking for.In the end, I cut off the pad area from the wrist support and stitched my old mouse pad onto the wrist support.seriously tho... a mouse pad that doesn't work? wtf?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like an Oil Refinery","review":"This mouse pad smells bad like an awful oil refinery.I let it air out in the basement for a month and it didn't help any.I wouldn't be surprised if the odor is toxic.Mine may be may have been stored in a bad location before it was shipped,But either way they one I have is worse than useless.

Like other reviews, it's true that the rest is hard and more like a foam insert rather than a gel insert, but the most annoying thing to me is the indent in the rest which makes positioning my hand feel awkward.

I bought a black one in 2012, and the wrist rest is a little firmer than the old one, and the pad itself is a terrible mousing surface. My optical mouse will not track consistently. The pointer often gets stuck in one spot, and I have to pick the mouse up and set it back down to get it moving again. The black pad I bought this year was less than $7, so I was willing to gamble.

The wrist rest is quite comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"Just got this today, 2/21/12, and it is absolutely horrible! This will likely cause you wrist pain. The wrist rest is hard as a rock and not built well. It also reeks like nothing else and smells heavily of chemicals. I usually trust Belkin's products, but this is a piece of crap. Will be buying different brand from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pad but not great","review":"Good for what I needed, but ive used better. For the money I would think It would be a better mouse pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Inexpensive","review":"I spend a lot of time on the computer for work and school, and I also have a lot of hand pain as a result. Because of that anything that is a little more comfortable is good in my book. For me, it is more comfortable than a plain, flat mousepad. I haven't tried it for gaming get, so I'm not sure how good it is for that. Plus, my old mousepad was really gross after 5+ years of use, there aren't many things what we put up with being dirty for that long (take a look into your keyboard, too). For about ten bucks, it's well worth it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chalk up another \\"I got a junker.\\"","review":"Since there seem to be some reviewers who are happy with their mouse pads and others who got junky ones that are nothing like earlier models, thought I'd chime in: I got a junky one. Used the older version happily for years, and these are lightweight, and worse, stiff under your wrist. However, I don't notice a particular smell unless I stick my nose right up to it. So, I dunno if they're being made by different manufacturers, but junky ones are definitely in circulation as of November 2011.I'm glad I didn't toss my old one out - even worn out and dirty, it's better than the new one. Next time, I'll look for a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Pad but It Smells!","review":"I bought an identical pad 6 years ago and have enjoyed the comfort it affords my wrist. I'm still using it -- nothing wrong with it! After buying a new computer I decided to buy another one of the Belkin WaveRest pads. It looks and feels exactly like the older one but upon removing it from the packaging, the room suddenly smelled like a warehouse full of tires! I've been airing it out for several days now and the smell isn't quite as strong, but I haven't started using it yet. I suspect the odor is a result of it being manufactured in China, but that's only a guess. Except for the strong smell, this is a 5-star item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Quality Product","review":"I bought this in 2004 and I still have it.

I would recommend trying something different. Mine started to break after only a few months and it wasnt as comfortable as my old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"New... and TERRIBLE.","review":"I've always been a big fan of this mouse pad and recently ordered a new one for my home office. Like other recent reviewers note, this is NOT the same mouse pad Belkin used to make--the quality of it has significantly deteriorated.- The wrist rest is hard and uncomfortable, and the slight dip in the middle is now essentially a hollow space. If you squeeze it, you hear plastic crinkling inside.- The pad itself is much thinner.- The edges are not crimped to keep the layers together; I can see this peeling apart in no time.- Like another reviewer mentioned, the surface material is also oddly reflective, and it makes my mouse freak out (I use a Logitech Performance MX).Compared to the one at my office (which is years old but still works perfectly), this just feels thin and cheap. Guess I'll be moving on to the Innovera mouse pad now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels OK, does NOT track well","review":"I haven't had too much of a problem with this mouse pad, but I have to say it is extremely frustrating that it doesn't track laser mouse as well as it claims. I get better traction on anything other than this mouse pad. I am disappointed to say the least and certainly will not be buying any more belkin products.Feels cheap, and the cheaper mouse pads my cheap employer uses work 10X as well.

It's a nice logitech bluetooth mouse that works everywhere else, but as other reviews have mentioned an optical mouse doesn't necessarily work with this mousepad. Be caution before you buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort at work","review":"Love this wrist pad. Soft gel makes it a comfortable way to spend long hours at the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"New one is too firm for me","review":"I have used Belkin gel mouse pads for many years and agree with the reviewers who commented that the latest product feels different. I have owned about 10 of these. The old ones have a white \\"Belkin\\" inside a white ellipse at the top while the new one has a silver \\"Belkin\\" with no ellipse.The old ones were softer under the wrist, which was better for me. The new one is much firmer, which is both less comfortable for my wrist and makes my hand uncomfortable because it is higher above my mouse.I won't be using the new one because it is just too uncomfortable, and I will be looking for a new brand of mouse pad to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Have been using this for 4-5 months now both at my office and home.

The wrist rest on the first was basically a plastic \\"balloon\\" filled with some type of gel. While it served it purpose well in warmer weather it would actually make my wrist sweat. In the end I virtually wore thru the \\"plastic\\" and the sticky....VERY STICKY, gel started leaking out. Duct tape only works for so long so it was time for a new one. I chose the Belkin solely because it is cloth covered rather then just some flexible plastic material. I've only used it for two days and already I will only consider another of this type should I somehow manage to wear this one out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just purchased this -- NOT WORTH IT","review":"So, I just bought this laptop mouse pad for school because I left my razer mousepad at home. This mousepad is awful, it's made of cheap materials, the rest feels stiff and uncomfortable, and optical mouses have a horrible time tracking across the cheap surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it -- wrist pad too firm, poor contour","review":"This is nicely made, but my hand and wrist did not like the wrist rest. The \\"gel\\" pad is too firm for my taste, and it's contoured in such a way that it put too much pressure on my wrist.I threw it away and bought a Fellowes PlushTouch Mouse Pad with Wrist Rest (UPC 043859638802) which I like much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this thing out of here","review":"This LOOKS like the original Belkin WaveRest (which cost $8). Looks only. The material is different. Not as fine or nice. The pad? Not as soft and gel like. Too lame. And what's with the bar under the pad? Why is that there? I can feel it under the pad. It's annoying.I still have an original WaveRest from a decade ago. I'm using it right now. The way to identify an original is that it will have \\"Beklin\\" in which at the top with a white oval around it... just like the product image above; however, that is NOT what you receive. You receive a cheaper, inferior version sans oval.Sorry, my friends. I am still looking for a replacement (or original) WaveRest. Out there somewhere there is one for sale, and I'm going to buy it. I'll let you all know if I find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a \\"gel\\" pad","review":"My old Belkin gel pad, after about 6 years of use, had worn down to the point where the center of the gel wrist rest had developed an indentation that was too low to be comfortable anymore. I was thrilled to find what looked like an exact replacement online; however, upon receiving the item, I was disappointed. This product advertises itself as a \\"gel\\" pad. My old one certainly was. The wrist rest was a gel soft enough to conform to your wrist, but still offer support to keep your wrist elevated. This new product's wrist rest is made of a much stiffer material, and although you can make a depression in it with your fingers, when you rest your wrist on it, the feeling is as if you were resting your wrist on a hard piece of plastic.If you're looking for the comfort that comes with true gel, this isn't the product for you. I'll be buying another mouse pad today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, this wrist rest didn't last 90 days","review":"The gel pad, the main reason for buying this product compressed to half its original depth in under 90 days.The discounted price (this now sells for about 65% off original retail) should be a giveaway to potential buyers.I'm looking for a replacement, possibly one with a 'bead' fill.Conclusion: The pad is the poorest quality wrist rest product I have used. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"I have used mouse pads with built in gel pads before and found them to be very comfortable.So I was surprised that after some light use I was already feeling discomfort in my wrist, which was a surprise as the whole point of the gel pad is to support the wrist and reduce wrist strain. I decided that well maybe it was just me and went about my business not wanting to admit to my wife that I bought a boat anchor. To my surprise several days later she also complained of the same issue, so we turned it sideways and now use it without the gel support. I went back and checked my son's mouse pad with gel support and found his to be slightly softer and allow more compliance, and made this one seem very stiff in comparison.In summary the mouse pad itself has a good surface and works very well with a Logitech High Performance Optical mouse, just didn't like the gel wrist support, so probably not worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gel? Doesn't feel like it.","review":"Compared to my last gel mouse pad, this feels like a rock. My wrist has been hurting after a week of use. Then entire mouse surface is cloth (lycra?) as well, which isn't necessary with most laser/led mice being produced these days. It's just going to trap dirt like crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Optical Mouse (Is there any other kind today?)","review":"My Logitech Cordless Optical mouse works better on the table surface than on this mouse pad. In fact it works better on almost any surface, including my sofa. A waste of money for an optical mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Do not read this book unless you have never even heard of the Human Resources profession. The book covered such basic concepts that anyone with a little common sense could have figured out on their own. I wanted to learn more about the laws that govern H.R., recruiting and sucession planning. There was a simple introduction to a few of the laws that affect H.R. policies, but nothing in depth.

What I was able to see was TERRIBLE. Far beneath the talent of Meryl Streep.

I was quite surprised that an actress of Meryl Streeps stature would even dignify this \\"piece of crap\\" with her presence!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"Though this political thriller makes its sympathies clear from the outset, it raises numerous issues that will make you think about the policies a democracy should condone in the name of fighting terror. It's not as black and white as it may seem to either side in the torture debate. The script here is intelligent, the acting very fine and much of the dialogue is in subtitles, lending some authenticity, even if the trick is becoming more and more of a film cliche. This is a very taut drama.

He's secretly shipped off to a country where torture is the norm while his pregnant American wife (Reese Witherspoon) tries to find out what happened to him and is lied to at every turn. The only hope her husband has is with a reluctant CIA agent who doesn't fully believe torture works, and as time goes on, realizes the man they're holding is innocent but will never be able to prove it to the satisfaction of the governments involved. A very sad truth surfaces in this very bold movie. It reminded me of another movie 'Goya's Ghosts' where torture is used during the Spanish Inquisition.

This movie laid its cards down since the word action. Its whole intent was to object to the actions of the government in the post 9/11 world. It had some promise but it stayed true to its message and made a villain out of everyone but a victim that was manufactured by writers. I want the politics to end. If it is going to take a Democrat in office then get it over with. I want my movies, TV, and other forms of entertainment back from the overwhelming support of those with money in Hollywood. If they agree with something they sure want to make sure everyone on this continent agrees. I am not saying I disagree, but c'mon! Please make a good movie or show for once. I am tired of this!!!!

I'm also sure that when authorities are out looking for suspects and leads, they undoubtedly come upon some that are false. I don't think they s/b tortured, but they shouldn't be given rights as US citizens either. I think this movie portrays the exception - a person who's been in the US for 20 years. What should be done? In this case he s/h/b brought in for questioning and detained. then released and watched.

The entire film feels like it is shot behind a scrim which keeps us at arms length emotionally and morally.

Sorry it didn't catch fire for the amazon reviewer, but the restraint with which this film treats the subject is responsible and works well.Especially since--despite the director's political position--the script does harken back to the early years of LAW AND ORDER, when the strongest arguments of all sides of an issue were voiced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and depressing.","review":"How much you enjoy rendition will largely come down to your political and ethical feelings about the war on terror.As for the acting and the writing and directing, it is a great movie, and perhaps I am an old paranoid patriotic American, but I found the message, that America is evil, not quite accurate or helpful while we are at war.

The book was fast paced and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good attempt","review":"The fetus angle was silly and overdone. The fact that the mystery writer practically steps on someone near the scene of the crime who was outrageously attired and doesn't make the connection later was irritating. The humor was pretty good as was the way the author moved the story along (at least towards the end of the book). I found it unreal that an attractive woman like the protagonist seemed to view dating with the jitters of a woman who had just ended a 20-year marriage. Geez, she was only twenty-nine years old, surely she'd gone out a few times since high school!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a so-so read","review":"The story line was so predictable that I felt I had read it before.

I'm going to comment on the sound quality. I bought it on the assumption that it was different then the last Gull remaster.It is, and quite a vast improvement. This is very true to the original mix, but it seems to have some re-mixing done. You can now hear Halford's vocals with extreme clarity, like never before. They sound very life-like, not unlike the latest Rolling Stones remasters.A different vocal take is used on Victim of Changes, although I'm not sure which take I like better, they're both very good.You can also hear the leads and bass with new clarity.Anyway, this is a must-have for anyone who is a fan of Priest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Smart Reviews Gary Smart","review":"Beatle Jazz is totally excellent.

The guitar playing is of course ultra-flashy for those who like that kind of thing. Coming at the time from a new wave angle (i knew him from his work with the Talking Heads), this was somewhat surprising and even not politically acceptable music to like back then when it originally came out. Of course it turns out he would record with King Crimson, another guilty favourite. It is very fun music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and Annoying","review":"For such a little fan it sure makes a ton of noise. The power is inconsistent and will start blowing harder and then softer for no reason. It rattles like a car engine. I would not recommend it for anyone. I think it was a waste of money. If I still had the box I would return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful but LOUD","review":"This small fan is quite powerful but extremely loud. As far as moving air, it's great. But, it's sound is distracting even on the lowest of four speeds and on high it dominates the room. Also, the remote should include the oscillate function.

The fans work great for me !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic","review":"Don't buy this fan, unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed. Also, if it has green lights(like my blizzard fan did), it will light up a dark room at night. Also, you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling. Low speed is quiet enough for sleeping, but high will disturb you. The angle tilt adjustments are not precise, and are difficult to do. There are better choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic fan","review":"This is the second fan of this type I have bought. I've had my other for a couple of years now. Very reliable. The only negative I would say is that at the higher speeds, it's a bit loud. Don't know if this is the case with most fans - it may be. Otherwise, I love the tilt control and choice of stationary or oscillating. I really love the remote. Great for when you're in bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Purchase of all","review":"I ORDERED THIS FAN 3 YEARS AGO FROM AMAZON. I LOVED IT SO WHEN IT BROKE I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE. THIS TIME IT WAS SOLD BY POLSTEINS HOME & BEYOND. WHAT I RECEIVED WAS A USED BROKEN FAN AND NOT THE ONE I ORDERED. IT WAS JUST THROWN IN THE BOX LIKE A PIECE OF GARBAGE. AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS TO HOME AND BEYOND, THEY FINALLY SENT ME A RETURN LABEL AND I WAS REFUNDED THE FULL AMOUNT. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THAT COMPANY AGAIN.

I was extremely disappointed. My impression was it was equivalent to some music graduate student's thesis on the statistical analysis of how often chord progressions are used - in the author's sampling of about 2000 songs.I was expecting more of an evaluative examination, some insight, some relative importances, and some categorization. Maybe I was expecting too much.It doesn't separate the chord progressions into any useful categories such as pop, rock, country, gospel, etc., it just lists out chord progressions and how often they appeared in this sampling of about 2000 songs. How is this useful?It's collecting dust on my bookshelf - Virtually zero usefulness, and I have about 10 books on songwriting, and another 15 or so on music theory and composition."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 8 year old loves reading this to his 9 month old sister!","review":"I just popped on here looking for some new touch and feel books for my 9 month old and saw this. We have had this book for years now, and my 8 year old still loves it. He is a very advanced reader, reading chapter books already, so I think it may be mostly nostalgia that he still enjoys it. He was reading it to my 9 month old the other day. A flap or two is missing, but it's just as fun. It's sweet to see him share a book that he loved so much as a baby with his little sister now.

Too small for my 11 month old to use, and a little difficult to find. I'm still going to give it four stars. The illustrations are very colorful and fun. The location of the flaps with-in the pictures is very well done... it's just a shame they are so small. I'm sure my son will really enjoy this book in 5 months or so.*** For a better young age appropriate lift the flap book, try \\"Hide and Seek Farm\\", by Grandreams books.

I bought it for my 14mo old after seeing how much she loved her older brothers' lift-the-flap books. She was way to rough to be able to play with the older kids books, so when I saw this one I just had to get it. She loves it and I love that she gets to help open the flaps.

The pictures are simple, bright and clear. She loves to lift the flaps and see which animal is waiting for her and we both giggle our hearts out as we make the sounds together.

ABC realized they had made a mistake by canceling Galactica so soon, so they quickly revived it as Galactica 1980.As much as I loved Battlestar Galactica, Galactica 1980 was a laughably horrible sci-fi show. Fortunately, Conquest Of The Earth is made up of two episodes which were among the best of the series. I think it's an interesting movie with some good points.

However, these expensive wireless headphones were a major disappointment. First of all, the optical wire did not work (hooked up to a Sony Bravia HD TV!).Instructions said to use red/white analog cable (not included of course). Luckily I had a set. Once that worked, all seemed to go well until I turned up the volume. Interference/distortion came from every room I went into. If that wasn't enough, it knocked out the router signal - my laptop became useless. If Sony can't get it right, who can? The processor from what I can tell is made to sit in one location, assuming your stereo and TV are both there.

This book might suffer a bit from character bloat.

This book does a great job at evoking the feelings of isolation and contempt for greater society the standard mutant outcast fiction never quite accomplishes. We are made to feel the fear of normal humans as well as the barely-containable desire for revenge and untapped and perhaps unlimited power of our heroes and anti-heroes.Great execution and wonderfully written prose had me turning the pages as fast as I possible could.

Now we get 3 of Sturgeons's stories rebranded into a slim and slick little softcover for four bucks a story. Such a deal.Baby Makes Three, Morality and The Fabulous Idiot are the three stories here. Good stories they are. Good writing they are.

The multiple characters had a compulsion to meld in the beginning, and in the end it is not even the characters we expected and they do not meld at all in my opinion, only mish-mash into a single character with a weak explanation of \\"themselves\\" as humanity. Pah! A mere 188 pages, this none the less took me three days to slog through. Save yourself the trouble and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"I was pretty amazed the first time I came across this book. It is structured in 3 parts - novellas/novelettes, or what have you.The basic premise is that Homo Gestalt is coming. Children that develop and relate to people differently than Homo Sapiens. The characters here included a telepath, a telekinetic, a couple of teleporters, and an infant genius.Broadly speaking, the first part, as you would expect, is about their coming to be, the second, exploring what they are going to do, and the third, more about their influence on society.It is rather more hopeful than the feared and hunted X-Men type milieu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like X-Men from Faulkner","review":"Havine read the much-anthologized \\"Baby Is Three\\" multiple times, I've just read this entire \\"novel.\\" Coming right on the heels of a very impressive revisit with Bradbury's _Martian Chronicles_, this book's dark and violent tone is very striking and well-crafted. Within the first 40 pages or so, there's incest and child abuse, S&M, suicide, telepathic idiots, child geniuses, and a young telekinetic girl. Set in what I take to be the 1950s, the book strikes me as what the X-Men would have been like if created by William Faulkner .... perhaps channeled many years later by David Lynch. This isn't typical science fiction of ANY era, much less the 1950s, when the genre was struggling against its pulp-action tendencies. Rather, this excellent book should appeal to readers of horror, gothic, and quality literature of the Burroughs and Bowles sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best SF book ever...","review":"The title of this review says it all.

Thomas Henry Tibbles devoted the later half of his life to fighting the federal bureaucracy which was systematically murdering the remanants of the Ponca Indians. The book tells Mr Tibbles story from his youth as farm child in Ohio and Illinois, his adventures in bleeding Kansas before the civil war, the years he spent with several tribes in Kansas and Nebraska and finally his winning fight to free the Indians from the corrupt reservation system. The story of his time with the Indians is well worth reading.

So imagine my surprise when I opened the box from Amazon today to reveal yellow flannel sheets covered in an awful lilac and vine pattern!

My personal favourite tunes are \\"Sol\\", \\"Want A Toffee?\\", \\"Twee\\", \\"Liquid\\" & \\"Ninoska's Waltz\\".

He is such a magnificent musician, technician, and an unmannered performer. He plays the Rachmaninoff song transcriptions as probably no other musician can or perhaps ever will. Why do I give this recording 4 instead of 5 stars? Here again, a personal view. The songs are mostly similar in intensity, style and mood. They have little variety as played one after another. I believe that the record played a few pieces at one listening gets an emphatic 5 stars. IF one attempts to listen to the entire disc from beginning to end--one's attention begins to wander and the experience of great performances (which they are) is diluted by the nature of their content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propagating the Myth","review":"Unfortunately, having done a lot of research on the subject, I find that this book only furthers the gossip and myths surrounding Rasputin, rather than expounding on the less sensationalist reality of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Horse, rip","review":"We were truly saddened to learn of Harry Horse's death earlier this year; his books, especially the Little Rabbit series, have brightened our household's nighttime reading sessions enormously these past three years. All the Little Rabbit books are wonderful, but to us _Little Rabbit Runaway_ stands alongside _Little Rabbit Goes to School_ as the best. We've returned to these over and over, in large part I think because Little Rabbit's character is so endearingly representative of most children -- by turns mischievous, petulant, but ultimately generous and lovable. There are morals to these tales, to be sure, but never to the point where they diminish children's sense of fun and adventure. Horse had a unique gift in this regard; our household will continue to treasure his memory by returning to his works in the months and years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"We LOVE Little Rabbit, but the content of this title might be frightening for wee ones","review":"My daughter (almost 4) adores the Little Rabbit books.

I have used Milwaukee, Bosch, Hilti, Makita, Dewalt, Porter Cable, just to name a few, and none of those machines even comes close to the Metabo in terms of power and smoothness. This little Metabo can grind as well as a bigger machine from the competitors. The Metabo might be a little more expensive than some of the other brands, but if you are looking for a long lasting powerful machine used by steel tradesman, the Metabo is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it was a very dull book.

He went away and the animals ran away tring to go home. The house keeper came and found part of the note and figured the guy had taken the animals with him. And that's the last thing I remember because I got bored and stopped reading. I don't like books that don't interest me.

I think it is probably something in the authors writing style that I just can't enjoy.The first time I tried I got about 30 pages in and gave up. A few years later I got a bit further than that. Eventually I managed to finish it but promptly forgot that I had read the whole thing so I tried again a few years later and remembered that I did read the whole thing.

Amazon refused to do anything and Delta's site question service just said they didn't have these in stock yet Amazon is still taking orders via one of their allied vendors. Shame on all of them.Update, 23 Aug. Now I am convinced that Amazon gave a really late ship date to get people to cancel so they wouldn't have to honor the $166 price instead if getting $250+.

For taking notes an external mike and speaker is too bulky.2. It does not work when powered by the USB port. You have to unplug it and run off two AAA cells (put in backwards) to play or record.3. There is no USB driver either in firmware, on the CD, at Panasonic or built-into Windows 7. So could not use the computer software to edit sound, or convert sound to text, or manipulate the clips in the device.The notes talk about Win2K and XP. I suspect this is quite an old design, and they have not kept up to date with drivers.Operating is easy. You hit record, talk, hit stop. Hit record, talk, hit stop. Each time you hit record it starts a new numbered snippet. You select which clip you want to hear by spinning a wheel, then hit play.

I was very surprised listening to this CD that there is not one song on this CD that is in the R&B vein. This is a straight up Pop adult contemporary album. Lisa is in fine voice as usual, however, the production and selected material leaves a lot to be desired. And judging by the U.K.'s lackluster reception for this CD, many of her fans feel the same. And I'm sure once again, this CD will fail to gain a domestic release. For those of you looking for the 'soulful' return of this songbird, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still great","review":"The Moment is different from Lisa's other CD's, but not at all in a bad way. This is a wonderful CD, which grows on you after the first listen through. In my opinion all of the songs on here a worth listening to more than once. I love this Cd not only because I'm a huge Lisa fan, but because \\"The Moment\\" is really, really a great CD that I never get tired of hearing. I cannot wait for Ms. Stansfield's next Cd, which I've heard is in the works, but this time with her husband Ian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...","review":"But not as good as her previous work - if you are expecting her trademark R&B; sound. It's not on this album. Nothing wrong with that, but I really wish she would have put a bit more \\"funk\\" in the album. We all have different tastes, and straight up pop bores me - unfortuantely much of this CD bores me.Having said that, Lisa's voice is incredibly good and as beautiful as ever. The songs are professionally crafted pop. The whole thing is well done. It's just the song/style selection that leaves me a bit disappointed. But hey, it's still better than pretty much any new music on the radio right now. Lisa is a stellar talent, even singing weak pop material.It's really best if you go into this album pretending that you've never heard any of Lisa's prior CD's. If you think of it like that, it's really a very good effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lisa Goes Pop!","review":"This CD won't win over any new fans for Lisa. Her past work was soul with a hint of pop. This is probably pop with a touch of rock. When she sang a song you could feel the emotion behind the lyrics. Whatever she was singing about you somehow thought she was living through it herself. You just don't get that with this record. Of course Lisa's voice is top notch as usual and I applaud her for wanting to change her formula but there is also an argument for fixing something that ain't broke. There are many artists with booming voices that suffer with singing weak pop material ie Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. Lisa has the voice to take an old soul standard and make you forget about the original \\"You Know How to Love Me\\" and \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\". I give it 1 star for her golden voice and 1 star for \\"If I Hadn't Got You\\" which is the closest to her older material. Please leave the pop to the Pop Divas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Poems and great Poet Translating","review":"The Five Tang Poets covered in this book are wonderful.Wang Wei excellent landscape poems take you to places which are wonderous while not over iydllic.

A few tunes resemble the Pogues of albums past (tracks 2, 10 & 11), but they lack the energy and conviction. The rest of the album is, as the title infers, complete hippie-inspired garbage only comparable to the worst of the Grateful Dead.The production is quite different from what you may expect as well, with the trademark banjo, cheerful flute, and MacGowan's vocals toned down or nonexistent on most tracks.If you love early Pogues, do yourself a favor and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I watched this movie on a plane.

The plot was too much to handle all at once, homosexuality, racial tensions, and spouse abuse, alcoholic. Not to mention how neglected the children were in this film.

Moore does a bang up job portraying happy housewife Mrs. Whittaker. I loved the quality of her staying formidable and solid in public while the turbulence is stoking beneath. She let s on to no one except her closest friends the types of problems that goes on in her household.Dennis Quaid, just as brilliant, is supposed to play the archetypal solid father figure, but his character is very weak compared to his wife. This is personified in the end when he breaks down in front of his wife and children.

The film takes you right to the mid 50's, the costums, the settings, the whole atmosphere is that of the late 1950's. Julianne Moore gives an outstanding performence, you can see her expressing so much through her eyes alone. Dennis Quaid was excellent too, you can see the plight in which the charecters are. Nevertheless, Dennis Haysbert delivers an excellent performence as well, the chemistry between Haysbert and Moore is quite strong in the film and you can smell the attraction in the air. The conclusion is reasonable. One of the very few drama based films worth appreciating, watch it for the strong charecter developments and chemistries, watch is specially for Julianne Moore, words alone wont describe this wonderfull film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to overlook","review":"On first glance this film does seem like it is borrowing too heavily or is some sort of vanity piece.

But while the acting in this film is great, it really leaves you feeling empty and somewhat confused.

I thought it was an ok movie, but it wasn't resonanting in my mind very long as other movies this year did. I thought more of the story about how Julianne Moore's, who did do an excellent job, charcter felt about her husband's extra-marital activities could have been explored. When she found out, it was like she didn't really care. Maybe it was, because she already knew insde, but that was never conveyed to the audience. I thought that the 50's thing became too cheeky. I wasn't sure if the movie was supposed to be funny or serious. A little of the \\"swells' and \\"pops\\" would have been fine, but, to me, it crossed the line to being too much.

How unworldly and repressed they were. How unlike ourselves, we of the modern, cosmopolitan, hyper-educated elite. Aren't we so much cleverer than they were?This movie was incredibly tiresome. It was smug and conceited. It painted two-dimensional characters and then maneuvered them through a dreadfully obvious plot that shed no light on the past, and reflected painfully clearly the self-satisfied smirks of the people who put it together.Movies and their creators need to respect their subjects and their audience. This movie does neither. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious and cliched","review":"Whether you like this movie will depend upon what you value in movies. It seems to me (and I don't mean disrespect here) that the people who like this movie exhibit what I think of this as the \\"film school\\" approach to movies. They appreciate a movie for its technical merit, and for references and homage to other movies. (For example, note all the references to Douglas Sirk in the positive reviews.) Coen brother movies often fall in this category.I have to say, however, that I found Far From Heaven to be an overwrought, mechanistic, shallow, predictable, cliched piece of tripe. The actors are terrific, the sets are amazing, yet I found this movie almost completely unwatchable. There was one scene where Julianne Moore leaves the house and runs into Dennis Haysbert in her yard.

Just could not stand the saccharin sweetness of Julianne Moore (loved her in The End of the Affair) nor the doofus-ness of that portrayal of the era. I was a wife/mother at that time and never saw anything even vaguely similar to what this movie depicts. What a disappointment; I really wanted to see a good movie that day, not a grade B melodrama.

I don't think anything like this ever happened, one at a time maybe, but racial conflict, homosexuality, social gossip, abuse, alcoholism, etc, etc, etc all at once? And suprisingly, she handled all too well. Oh, and I would never let a 13-year old watch this. It needed a rating of R. Not to mention, where was the ending of this film? Just has it FINALLY gets around to loading her life with every problem imaginable, the movie simply stopped. I think that it was WAY beneath any actors dignity to do this, but especially Dennis Quaid whom I used to like.

You tell me how entertaining or educational it is when you see a certain father deny his family, both his wife and children, and pursue his selfish, wicked, disgusting lifestyle. ... Secondly, it is EXTREMELY boresome.The negative message the movie presents--hedonistic values--out balances the positive value and norm of our society. ...Anyway, if you haven't seen the movie yet, I suggest you keep your luxury of not exposing yourself to a great deal of unspeakable stupidity in the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What about Quaid?","review":"\\"Far from Heaven\\" should be the film that puts to rest forever the debate over whether Dennis Quaid can really act or just looks good on the screen.He can really act. He's nothing short of spectacular as the conflcited husband in this stylish 50s set piece from director Todd Haynes.Haynes' personal muse Julianne Moore is also good here, but I question why she received the lion's share of the attention at Quaid's expense. In fact, the excellence of the film drops off notably in the second-half, where Quaid's internal battle is overshadowed by a second storyline involving Moore's relationship with the son of her long-time gardener (also wonderfully portrayed by Dennis Haysbert)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julianne Moore shines in Far From Heaven","review":"One of my high school teachers recommended I see FAR FROM HEAVEN shortly after it came out.

I'm from a suburb of Hartford, which is where the film is set (but it is mostly shot in New Jersey), so that was of particular interest to me. The story was really heartbreaking. Julianne Moore is absolutely believable as the suffering housewife. You sympathize with Dennis Quaid's character while at the same time hating him--it's very powerful. Aside from the wonderful story and acting, I would recommend this DVD for the excellent commentary by Todd Haynes. It really provides insight into the thought process behind the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darned Pretty","review":"Except for the wonderful period costumes and props, the loving lush wide-angle shots of New England fall foliage, and the always expressive features of Julianne Moore and Dennis Haysbert, this is not a good movie.

The Kaces bag does the trick. The elastic that surrounds the base of the drum is a nice feature. It gently grips the drum,and it also helps the bag to collapse when it's empty. The drum loads in and out of the bag without too much fooling around. It has a good handle and straps, plus a nice-sized pouch with a Velcro flap.I own several other drum bags, cymbal cases or stick bags from Gator, Beato & other manufacturers.

But this concert shows these four musicians/singers to be one great band with all the requisite hooks, harmony, personality, looks and charm to keep most of their material from being time-warped and restricted only to oldies shows. The songs are still strong today (even with the exception of the overly cute \\"Walk like an Egyptian\\") and the new material is easily equal. With loyal keyboardist Harpo, the Bangles state their case that they weren't a formula band, not some clever marketing idea, but a real life rock and roll band.

And from the \\"Doll Revolution\\" selections I wished \\"Tear Off Your Own Head\\" and \\"Something That You Said\\" were played. Now to the hits that they did perform that I like, most weren't perform in its original way. I don't mind if a song or two gets a revamped, but not most of them. Maybe it was just me, but it sure didn't sound like they originally were. Maybe because it's performed live, or I need a few more watching to get used to. Those were my only two gripes, if it weren't for that, this would have been a 5 star rating for me. The special features are good, get to see more of Susanna Hoffs in an interview and perform a couple of acoustics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bangles A Great Concert On This DVD!","review":"I've been a fan since the eighties and got to see them live at the Orange County Fair 3 years ago (where they were GREAT!!!), This concert is very good too... I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated","review":"in brief: Pink Floyd's masterpiece.in keeping with the general trend of the very best of the arts being relegated to the least read, least listened to, and least gazed at; in keeping also with the best of Pink Floyed remaining the least listened to (how often do we hear \\"Time\\" on the radio followed by the album track it segues into on the album itself, \\"The Great Gig in the Sky,\\" featuring the amazing operatic vocals of Claire Trevor? likewise, how often are we given all seven parts of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\"? never), \\"Animals\\" is without doubt the most fluid and auricularly amazing of Pink Floyd's post-\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" work. as long as i'm spouting, let me toss this question out -- am i alone in think \\"The Wall\\" a somewhat tedious, inbred, and overlong piece of self-indulgence? the two discs of \\"The Wall\\" may have made a fantastic single disc if only there had been a bit more creativity and self-critiquing and a bit less chest-pounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another concept album, Floyd strikes again","review":"Genius. Wilson, Byrne, Young, Lennon? Add Waters to the List. With a Pythonesque infatuation with animals, he and his equally-if-not-more talented bandmates Mason, Gilmour and Wright give the world something to think about again. With only five songs, and in a sense only three, they made one of the top 100 albums ever. Imagine being a Floyd fan then. Between 74-78, you only got two albums and less than a dozen songs. Even so, they deliver. Bigtime. The story is intriguing, with the usual slow paced Floyd jams. Then they hit you with a rocker Zepplin could only dream of matching. With the lyrical/musical mesh on Sheep, the album goes back to the Pigs on the Wing and fades, leaving the listener satisfied with the album and disgusted with the human race"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album,well worth getting.","review":"Another work of art from the Floyd. I have every Pink Floyd album and this is the one i listen to most. Every song has a meaning and conveys a message. My favorite song would have to be \\"Dogs\\" simply because even though it lasts about 20 mins i cant get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Theme-atic Album","review":"This is one of Pink Floyd's crowning accomplishments. Pigs On The Wing, which begins and closes the album, shows Floyd's style of beginning and ending and album with the same sound and serves its purpose as both an introduction and an afterword. Dogs is a great song attacking the politcal \\"dogs.\\" Gilmour has great guitar solo's in this song, the Waters' lyrics are amazing as always. Pigs (three different ones) attacks the selfish pigs in society. Part 2 Focuses on a women (the \\"bus stop rat bag\\") who tried to pass censorship laws in England. It attacks three pigs in our society with a somewhat angry yet sarcastic perspective (\\"hah hah, charade you are.\\") Sheep is a great song attacking the followers in our society who eventually over come the dogs. This is a crucial album in any fan's collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Floyds","review":"This disc only makes you concentrate on 5 tunes, Pigs on the wing being duplicated and a short one that dosen't require much thought. Dogs, Sheep and Pigs are another story. Of the 3 my personal fave is Sheep, I just love the slow bass buildup in the into until the vocals start, proceeding to insult the poor sheep, for being sheep. The close is great, Gilmour's power chords on the fade are clear and hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Thanks for the extra cd. I would be glad to buy from you again.

Imagine that.","review":"I once saw the 8 track of ANIMALS at a flea market. It was kind of weird, because the song DOGS was split in two to fit in TRACKS one and TWO on the 8 track. The listing was like this:1. Pigs On the Wing Part 12. Dogs Part 13. Dogs Part 24. Pigs5. Sheep6. Pigs on the Wing Part 2I don't remember seeing POTW3, but if it was on there I wish I bought that 5-dollar thing.I'm not gonna review this album, because it simply is a great album. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end of the Floyd","review":"A good half of the songs on this album are in the key of G; sit down with the guitar and figure them out yourself. Why? Because Roger Waters wrote a majority of them, and came up with the lyrics, which are beginning to show the vile pomposity that made \\"The Wall\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" impossible to listen to. Waters' second-rate junior college philosophy class existentialism, and his attempts to be up-to-date by pointing fingers at social problems just like the punks of the day, sounds terribly dated now, as does the meandering, aimless and dull songwriting. The best thing about this record is David Gilmour's singing and guitar playing. Other than that, there is very little to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Commercial CD from Pink Floyd","review":"This has to be the worst CD Pink Floyd ever put out. I compare it to trying to watch a bad movie and after 10 minutes viewing you just have to shut it off. PF has done much better.

Nothing (well, maybe \\"the final cut\\") came close to the lyrical venom expressed here. Waters' lyrics are pure poison (and the bass intro on \\"Sheep\\" is marvelous!). Gilmour's playing here is simply his best. \\"Dogs\\" contains Rick Wright's last, majestic synth program. Mason's drums are steady and take prevalence on \\"Pigs: Three Different Ones\\". The greatest album Floyd ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Um, Perfect","review":"Why don't you own this CD, you useless excuse for a music fan?The album is perfect. The sequence of Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep is better than any other trilogy in existance...dare I say it even rivals the critically acclaimed American Pie trilogy. Nay, it rivals even the lucrative Revenge of The Nerds series. Even possibly the Land Before Time saga.But seriously, this album is the easily most underrated PF album. Waters' and Gilmour's voices are fantastic and Rick Wright's keyboard playing, especially on Pigs, is brilliant.The guitar and keyboard riffs on Animals are hauntingly spectacular.Buy this CD immediately. You disgust me for not already owning it.Also, buy the rest of their albums. They are amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware !!!!!!","review":"WARNING: I have two copies of this CD and they both contain an audible \\"glitch\\" during the song \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\"... which makes me wonder... is this a fake CD with EMI labels on the cover, intended to look official (it's hard to imagine EMI releasing something with such a clear sonic deficiancy).Furthermore, the recording level of \\"Animals\\" is much much lower than that of \\"Saucerful Of Secrets\\", which is a great deal louder (it makes you jump out of your seat when one album closes and the second one begins...!!). Anyone else agree....??"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boot","review":"This is a bootleg album, not an official release. Made in an European country and sold here pretending to be the real thing.

Too deep? WHY? Probably because the songs titles sound a little goofy (really, who wants to here a song about a group of dogs battling with sheep?) But if you listen, and you dont need to listen hard, you'll hear the animals are just a metaphor for the groups of people we all fit in with. Its strange, because even though this is a \\"forgotten\\" album, you will recognize at least one part from every song especially \\"Sheep\\". A long (but great) experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back when records meant something...","review":"Animals is a lovely and sprawling meditation. In my opinion, it must be listened to from start to finish. Skipping around to songs like \\"Dogs\\" and \\"Sheep\\" (which are both amazing songs, mind you) doesn't offer the same fluidity and emotional intensity that the segues do. Pick up this album and let it run behind a small get together at your house. It's an intimate yet grand record. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A somewhat overlooked masterpiece","review":"Because it essentially contains only three songs, \\"Animals\\" is not as popular as the other albums from Pink Floyd's heyday. But it is a classic almost on par with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall.\\" The lengthy instrumentals are never boring and the dark, cynical lyrics by Roger Waters achieve a kind of demented poetry. Downcast music simply doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"With sound and spirit","review":"Beginning and closing with the powerful \\"Pigs on the Wing\\", Animals is one of the best PF albums ever made, the same class where are \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", \\"Meddle\\", \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and last but not least \\"The Wall\\". \\"Dogs\\" is a pure listening experience, beginning with the keyboard/guitar intro, leading to Waters' powerful vocals. and most significantly the scorching Gilmour guitar solo. \\"Pigs, 3 Different Ones\\" continues this same style, to the second best song with \\"Dogs\\", \\"Sheep\\". I can't say much more, you got to hear it. I just love everything in this album, but the solos mostly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence","review":"One of my favorite albums of all time. Item arrived fast and I listen to it almost everyday! Any Pink Floyd fan will love this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely worth the money to buy the remaster","review":"I have always thought this is a great album. As for the remaster, to my ears, it is the best that I have heard so far of the Pink Floyd remasters. I've owned this on LP, as well as the original Columbia late-80's \\"silver\\" disc and the circa-2000 remaster. Listening to the 2011 remaster, there are details about the songs on this album that I never heard before. It's the small details that stand out, the drums sounding more powerful, the man whistling for the dog on \\"Dogs\\", little things your ears probably never picked up on prior editions. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesser known but an excellent album","review":"When you hear Floyd, people think of Dark Side or the Wall. I am expanding my floyd collection and I have stumbled onto a gem entitled \\"Animals\\". I have never heard any of these songs on the radio probably because each of them are very long 10 minutes plus. There are 5 songs on this CD and all of them are excellent. If you are a Floyd fan or just getting into their music this album honestly rates up there with dark side and the wall. The only downside is that there are basically 5 songs on the CD. Those 5 songs are great though."},{"rating":"2","title":"here piggy piggy","review":"From the classic Storm Thorgerson cover to the chilling images of isolation inside, it is apparent that Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" is no happy go lucky pop-album. Animals is probably the first sign of a Roger Waters dominated Floyd. His messages of isolation, fear, paranoia, are all in the forefront. This does not mean that Animals does not have its uplifting moments. The beautiful \\"Pigs On The Wing\\", David Gilmours soaring guitar work in \\"Dogs\\", it all makes for a wonderful, if unsettling listen. This is one of the best records of its time, and it will stand up to repeated listens. Get it. Live it. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundation for \\"The Wall\\"","review":"If your a Floyd fan, then you already own this one. If your here because your only exposure to Floyd has come via \\"The Wall\\" then this is a must. Very similar in structure and sound to \\"The Wall\\", this was and still is a favorite in my album collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of the Best","review":"Had to change my star rating becasue 1 star only had 7 and 2 star had 8 and I felt bad for 1 star but now I feel great.

I consider all 4 to be masterpieces not to be missed. Oh eye its great to here this Album almost total ly live on In the flesh- amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal's is not all it's cracked up to be","review":"This over-ambitious prelude to The Wall is, well...boring. There are 4 songs on the album )no variety) and all of the songs are like 10 minutes. THis would be a good thing but Pik Floyd has a tendency to fill up time with boring crap. The middle of Dogs is like this (and so is all of sheep). Pigs on the wing really is pointless. The only song that stands out is Pigs (three different ones). THis is a great song. Bottom line-If you are a diehard floyd fan get it for pigs. otherwise dont waste your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals Review","review":"Animals is Pink Floyd that focuses mainly on a single guitar. The album isn't quite as good as Wish you were here, however most songs are quite well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd-Animals","review":"A grossly under rated Pink Floyd album. One of their best with interconnected songs! A 'must have\\" for any Pink Floyd fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a note out of place..","review":"There are very few records (yeah I still like to call them records)released in the last 30 years that are note for note perfect for the entire album. You know the ones where you don't feel the need to skip past a song or part or a song. This is one of them and Wish You Were Here is another one. Not sure why this album doesn't get the recognition The Wall gets but honestly I pull this one out more than that one. This is just brilliantly written, played, and produced, a genuine classic that still sounds as good today as it did on my 8 track player in '77."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ha Ha It's Not a Charade Anymore...","review":"The 2011 remaster of this reflection of humanity and politics that is Animals is well done. Although Animals may not be for the Pink Floyd beginner, it is one of their most complete albums musicly. The remaster adds clarity and lifts the veil that was present. In all, it's worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album from one of the greatest rock bands","review":"Animals is one of my favourite rock albums and I rate it as one of the best after WISH YOU WERE HERE,MEDDLE,THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and THE WALL.HUGELY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilmour's guitar never sounded better!","review":"Wow, this album is amazing. Even Gilmour who sang a bit on this album complained that lyrics were all too often complaining and let Roger Waters do it for the most part. I think Gilmour sings only the first half of Dogs and thats it! But his guitaring is exemplary. I think the solos on Dogs and Pigs kicks most of the top rock guitarists off the page and places Gilmour firmly where he should belong: At the top. I like Roger as well and his lyrics certainly ring true (it leans a lot toward paranoia and socialism). Pay close attention to Rogers' bass guitar on the outro guitar solo on Pigs on the wing - Part II. There is a rumour that Gilmour recorded it for the album, but Roger composed it and played it live. But it is good.. Buy it if you like the Floyd. Don't expect to get used to the music in your first listen (It is not disco for chrissake)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is definitely one of their best. With my personal favorite being Pigs (3 different ones) this is just a soothing sounding album. Dogs is long and has some Gilmour's greatist guitar playing. Sheep is my 2nd favorite with it being the only jamming song on here. Pigs on the wing 1 and 2 are also very good . A must buy for any Floyd fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb album","review":"An excellent album...extremely ambitious. I would have to say that every time I listen to animals, it grows on me further. However, I would have to rank this album along with Dark Side Of The Moon, and not quite up to the standard of Wish You Were Here, but slightly better than The Wall. Dogs is phenomenal, in that it keeps me engrossed for the full 17 minutes; Pigs(3...) is simply a masterpiece in cynical, critical satire without being too pretentious, and Pigs On The Wing are too very brief but very emotional opener and closer. I often think of Animals to be one extreme of the Floyd, with Wish You Were Here being the other extreme. The only reason I prefer the latter is the mellow mood of the whole album, whereas Animals is basically Waters in full-fledged attack, which is sometimes frigtening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Wild","review":"One of the great things about Pink Floyd is that each of their albums has its own distinct personality. Obscured by Clouds is nice on a lazy day, Ummagumma is great for tripping out, and Dark Side is good, well, just about anytime. Animals is the album you want to listen to if you just want to go crazy and rock out.Though bookended (in true Floyd style) with the soft and simple \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" tracks, the central 3 cuts offer about 40 minutes of energy that just doesn't let up.Dogs is a phenomenal 17 minute rocker that will make you angry at any fatcat that has tried to step on the little guy. Luckily, in the song, said fatcat (fatdog?) dies an agonizing death.Pigs (Three different ones) and Sheep don't let up either. The latter is my favourite song on the album. It starts off nice and quiet and you think its gonna be a snoozer, but it picks up pretty quick. And just wait til you get to those riffs at the end....aaah, they're so satisfying.So yeah, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"very underated album","review":"Animals is one of pink floyd's most underated albums. It's a powerful pieces of music that lashes out at everyone. It's roger waters simply being roger waters, but in this case, that's a good thing. But don't leave out David Gilmour whose guitar work is classic, especially on \\"Dogs\\". That song is to me, the best on the album. I'm usually a type of person who doesn't like really long songs. I get bored half-way into them. there 's only 5 songs on this one, and 3 of them are over 10 minutes long each. But in this case, the balance between long organ parts, sound effects, guitar solos, and lyrics is extremely good.you can't get bored while listening to these songs.A great album. period."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gilmour's Magnum Opus","review":"While it may be true that Roger Waters' songwriting ability truly shone in The Wall, David Gilmour's guitar playing on this album is absolutely staggering. This CD truly shows off the highly underrated ability of Gilmour, as well as the drumming skills of Nick Mason and the keyboarding ability of Rick Wright. It is a heavily guitar-dependent album, so even those who find Floyd too spacy (crazy though you are) will enjoy this. It is their greatest album, but is often forgotten in the name of The Wall and Dark Side. If you buy this, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy metal Floyd","review":"For Pink Floyd, this is probably the consistently heaviest album they ever made. Lots of furious energy in this one. The 'Pigs on the Wing' songs introduce and conclude the concept of the album, and are not bad in that context, wisely kept short. 'Dogs' has some very good solos by Dave, but isn't their strongest compositional effort (and is half of the album). The second side opens with Pigs (3 different kinds), an excellent song - good bass riffs, and an original arrangement, with a blistering guitar solo at the end that I feel is Dave Gilmour's finest moment. 'Sheep' opens with a nice electric piano solo but turns into a freaky hard rocking tune, replete with hypnotic middle part and ends with another excellent Gilmour solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Notch Below Their Best","review":"This is no Wish You Were Here, but it's damn close. Animals is great and infinitely better than the sum of its parts. \\"Dogs\\" is the most underrated Pink Floyd song (even by the band itself), truly one of their best. \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" and \\"Sheep\\" are both very good also and have particularly sharp guitar work. The lyrics are very strong on this album -- vividly descriptive and so caustic that you just have to laugh. The guitar is excellent, and the music overall is quite different -- heavier and punklike. Indeed, this was released in 1977, the year the punk movement broke, and no doubt it had some influence. This is as close to heavy metal that Pink Floyd ever got. Of course, it still has their trademark progressive sound. The lyrics also have political overtones, if you're in to that. Though not their best album, this is quite close, and you should get this masterpiece if you like Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"El disco mas Poderoso de Pink Floyd","review":"Sere breve, este disco es el mejor disco de PINK FLOYD desde mi opinion personal, ( se que es dificil quedarse con uno peor bueno ), la energia de este disco es desbordande y el juego de \\"Juez\\" que toma waters es interesante, la division del mundo en CERDOS, PERROS y BORREGOS es muy buena, la guitarra de Gilmour es fantastica y la volcalizacion de Waters llega a su punto mas alto......un disco fundamental para ver el camino que PF tomaria en sus siguientes 2 discos (the Wall y the Fianl Cut)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You f**ked up old hag","review":"I love this album.

No surprise, each is a classic in its own right (although I'm not always so sure about\\"Wish...).After the success of \\"Dark Side\\", the band seemed to think that they had to get profound, and that just made them dreary. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" gets away with it, its a Requiem, but \\"Animals\\" goes off the deep end and there's no turning back. After that, its terminal dreariness for Pink Floyd. Or so it would seem.FYI - The main songs from both \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Animals\\" were first performed on Pink Floyd '74 \\"Dark Side\\" tour. The tunes \\"Raving and Drooling\\" and \\"You Gotta Be Crazy\\" became \\"Animals\\". Both were better than the later versions that appeared on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"My friends mom calls pink floyd drug music and i said YEP if you listin to this cd and you are in an altered state of mind you will think you might be on a farm its pretty cool. but this cd by itself without the drug influence is one of the best pink floyd cd's made and should be held highly with the best pink floyd cd ever The Wall or well nevermind they are all great. bye"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Animals is perhads the worst Pink Floyd album I ever heard. The songs seem to go on forever, the lyrics are bad, and Roger Waters' singing is not much better.

I love the Floyd PERIOD! But as you said \\"Digipak.\\" DigiPak Sucks.... Notice now that these are made in Mexico? Whats up with our recording companies outsourcing masterpieces in Mexico? What next China? I will tell you one thing, I will quit buying music if this crap doesn't stop @ once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A turning point indeed....","review":"Well, it's like this. I'm mainly an admirer of Pink Floyd's old-school work if anything. Their first hit single (and known released song far as I know) \\"Arnold Layne\\" still is my favorite if I had to pick just one. That having been said, \\"See Emily Play\\" was great too. My absolute favorite is debatable between Dark Side of the Moon - the 2nd best selling album ever behind Michael Jackson's Thriller ...or the very touchy thought provoking \\"Wish you were here\\", particularly it's centerpiece track - especially parts 5/6/7/8/9. Animals was good, 1 or 2 songs better than others but as was definitely the case with 1983's \\"Final Cut\\" this just sounds more like a Roger Waters solo album versus Pink Floyd as they're defined by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animals","review":"Of course, the early Floyd stuff is undeservedly obscure compared to Dark Side and The Wall, but this one is a little underplayed too. A classic-rock station in my neck of the woods occasionally plays \\"Pigs on the Wing,\\" but that's about it. Considering that the two tracks which begin and end this CD aren't really songs, at least they're like insignificant ditties tossed in for no good reason. I don't get the concept of this record; maybe it doesn't stand together sufficiently or maybe there is no theme to it. Why listen then, but for the songs? What songs? I think The Division Bell and the other non-RW stuff is patterned after this--if you want to see that phase as more than just self-parody. It certainly doesn't have the memorable songs of Wish You Were Here or even The Wall, or the concept which linked the songs on those CDs together. In fact, I see Animals as a real insult to fans who might unfortunately buy the hype over Pink Floyd. But if they liked it, everyone wins, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, lousy ,wish Barret was here","review":"This album has very few songs. Two of the songs are the same. The song dogs does not sound finished in my opinion. I hate this mode of Floyd. It's just so dull and depressing and Roger says so much less than he thinks he is. The only good thing about this album is that it does not have a song that sounds like Eclipse which sets it apart from the dull Meddle and the equally dull and lousy Ummagumma. I wish Syd Barret would find Waters and beat the hell out of him for taking a once great band and turning it into a pile of dung. Barret's songs were so enegetic effortless and playful. Water's songs are forced, dull and depressing. He needs to talk to Opra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute.","review":"Dogs, Pigs, Sheep? Cute. There is such a thing as taking a concept album too far and missing out on the main point, which is creating enjoyable music. If that appeals to you, buy Animals by Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLERC !!!!","review":"Excpet the masterpiece \\"The Wall\\", this so called \\"masters of music\\" never did anything real good at all. Their indulgent music, blended together with sounds and weird instruments, leads to nowhere, it has no punch, it has no real rock on it!! They're an experimental band and, like so manye experiences, a lot of them are merely blunders!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so good as the previous albums","review":"DOGS is maybe the best PF song ever made, only comparable to \\"Shine on you crazy diamond\\" from Wish you were here. But the entire CD is not so... I would say... enjoyable as Wish you were here, Meddle, and of course, Dark side. Get these first."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best classic rock albums ever.","review":"Of all the Pink Floyd albums, this one seems to get the least amount of attention. \\"Animals\\" is a masterpiece musically and especially lyrically, showcasing Roger Waters' incredible cutting edge songwriting. Though Waters wrote nearly all the songs, the entire band shines in their playing. Richard Wright's eerry opening organ on \\"Pigs ( Three Different Ones ) \\" sets the stage for a crunching guitar attack by David Gilmour and a cracking drum beat by Nick Mason, all supporting the firey bite of Roger Waters angry singing. Even more so than \\"The Wall\\", \\"Animals\\" best displays Waters' visionary writing which sadly began to slip into the silly after \\"The Wall\\". Although the album has only five songs, every one of them is great, especially the Gilmour-co written \\"Dogs\\", which contains his best ever guitar solo. Even if your only a moderate Pink Floyd fan, don't pass up \\"Animals\\", its one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, atmospheric music with disturbingly brilliant lyrics","review":"The opening and closing pieces, which are essentially identical, set the tone well with their lulling guitar chords. \\"Dogs\\" is absolutely brilliant--it haunts me every time I listen to it. Do \\"Dogs\\" with headphones and the lyrics for the full effect. \\"Pigs\\" is good, but I've always thought it was overrated. Waters' vocals are especially grating on it. \\"Sheep\\" is also brilliant. The CD is certainly a must for anyone who is still discovering Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album, very underrated","review":"this album was no dsotm but it was great. by the time this album came out, the press had been bashing the band and the reviews were biased. it would have done better but the songs may have been to long (for the avg listeners). i personaly listen to floyd albums, not floyd songs b/c they are all part of a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"have to be hard and give it a 4. And i'm extremely biased.","review":"Mostly because I own most of Pink Floyd albums. My fave is sheep. The way they mixed Roger's venomous vocals into synth and guitar sounds still sends shivers up my spine. And this was 1977! Where floyd lacked in musical ability, they made up tremendously in experimentation and production. They know good sound. They listen and create from scratch. The walk into the unfamiliar and pull out something interesting. Roger's concepts make it accessible to the mass audience. Pink Floyd is always about 'a feeling'. It's a certain mourning that morphs into anger, rage, sadness and madness at times. I guess personally I feel a lot of that 'feeling' in this album but not as much as 'wish you were here' and 'the wall' hence my 4 stars. Still that's not the only definition of Floyd. Floyd in a sense has always been about 'no definition'. That's why it has lasted so long. Syd Barrett dreamed it, the rest crafted and moulded it. Absolutely brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good buy","review":"Classic Floyd experience. Most of the album makes chronoligical, evolutionary, etc sense- its a mixture of wish you were here and the wall for floyd fans. Roger does all the singing, but the lyrics are top notch as usual. Gilmour shredds on the guitar on dogs and pigs. Wright doesn't get a lot of airtime but he does have a jazzy keyboard solo on sheep.Albumwise it's actually my favorite of Floyd's, but thats not because it has my ultimate favorite songs (Numb, Time), its because the flow of the music and the power of the words are better than all the other albums.Things I might recommend to improve the album-read Animal Farm (it's what the book is based off of)and listen to it loudThe only bad things I've experienced is that the album flows so well that it feels very short. While there are 17 minute songs it still flies by too fast.That's it. Go buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album to wow your buddies","review":"I remember the first time I heard this album many years ago. I first thing that poped into my head is why it took so long for me to hear the album for the first time. One of THE, if not, the most overlooked albums of the modern rock era. This is a great album to show off to your buddies who think they know it all. Only true PF fans will know this album. This is a great one to pull out at the end of a long night to wow those who are left standing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most beautiful swan song","review":"\\"Animals\\" is truly the last great Pink Floyd album & perhaps their best one.from start to finish, there's no bad track on here.\\"The Wall\\" will be steps backward from this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing, soothing, & well-written music!","review":"This is definitely one of those CDs you don't skip around to various tracks. Like a lot of Pink Floyd albums (& a lot of Classic Rock albums), it was made for listening from beginning to end. The recording industry doesn't work that way anymore, & it's a cryin' shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PF's WORST album ever","review":"I firmly agree with the previous poster who called this album \\"mediocre\\". Perfect choice of words- this album is, indeed, quite mediocre. Of course, the post-Waters albums are worse than this, but that's not saying much. This album is total crap. CRAPOLA. The vocals are wooden and uninteresting, with warmed-over 70's heavy metal. Obviously, \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" 1 & 2 is nice, but as has been pointed out, can be obtained on the Internet in combined form. Of the three central compositions, \\"Pigs\\" is the only very listenable track, but like the others, it suffers from its needless length. \\"Dogs\\" is absurdly turgid, and \\"Sheep\\" is unconvincing and ill-concieved. When you come down to it, this album is nothing more than three insanely bloated compositions that would've been better as five-minute songs each. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANIMAL MUSIC","review":"I only like one song on this album: sheep. All the rest are just really not that good. I think this was an album to do good and in a way it did i suppose. I would have hated to be at the particular concert where Roger Waters spat on that young lad.All in all it is just another brick in the wall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Political - But Their Best","review":"This album could almost be seem as commi! Attacking conservatism on all sides, Waters' anger can literally be heard on what, in my opinion, is a better album than Dark Side.. I suppose the downside is that Waters went on to believe that he was so much the dominant force..... Well, that's history. For you American fans, the reference \\"Hey, you Whitehouse\\" on Pigs three different ones, refers to Mary Whitehouse. She was the chairman (or chairperson) of a pressure group in the UK called the viewers and listeners association. They lobbied to enforce decency in the media. No-one has heard of her now, of course, but in the late 70s... Anyway, I think it ironic that when Pink Floyd produced this album the punks all slammed the group; and PF were were the ones crying out against the establishment. Sometimes you can't win."},{"rating":"2","title":"...a shelter, from Pigs on the wing.","review":"If you like music that will haunt you for the rest of your life, get Animals, and listen to it alone or with a friend, all the way through. Any less is an injustice to the music, and to yourself. As with any classic, once you experience it you'll see the world in a new light.When I finally go over the edge, I'll be singing Animals, and I'm sure they'll lock me away for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"let it never get popular","review":"Well whenever you hear a Floyd song you hear the same old, same old. For anyone who lives to listen to great music this is the album. It was the beginning of the end for pink floyd. Roger Waters was slowly taking over the band and Richard Wright didn't right any of the music (first album he didn't write on). Dave Gilmour's finest guitar to date, I don't think he will ever top it. Listen to the two octive solo's on Dogs. It will make your hairs on yoru neck stand. I have listened to maybe bootlegs of the different versions of these songs and man they hit them right in the studio. This album was the beginning of the end for a talanted rock band. I would suggest buying it, this is my favorite album in floyds second musical stage (the late 60's being there first stage). This album is better than Dark Side and will show you the power of this great band. Matt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"This album was Pink Floyd entering their peak as musicians. With just five songs, Roger Waters was able to make a recording that was as close to perfection as one could get. Moreover, with \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\", Waters gave us a hint as to the brilliance that awaited us with \\"The Wall.\\" To me, this will always be the quiet masterpiece that so many other \\"fans\\" overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Wasn't This Album More Popular?","review":"If not for the somewhat out of place opening and closing tracks, I'd give it five stars. The three lengthy tracks are well textured and way ahead of it's time. I think Dogs is probably the jewel of the album, but the other tracks are fairly good as well. Probably my favorite Floyd album next to The Final Cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 cents","review":"Just adding my two cents and my 5 star rating. This is my favorite album. I had to buy the CD since i cant listen to my 78 in the car, and it probably stays in the CD player non stop. Some complain the songs go on to long and don't have any singing...well... so what? That adds to this album's greatness. Its pure mellow Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST FLOYD ALBUM","review":"This is Pink Floyd's best, most ingenius album. The mix of vocals, guitars, synths, etc... is astounding at the very least! The lyrics are absolutely powerful. If you buy albums for just one song, this probably isn't a good one for you. However, if you like concept albums that you listen to throughout, this is the album. We all know DSOTM is a masterpiece, another five star album, but it takes a back seat to ANIMALS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must have\\" classic","review":"A highly underrated album that was a fantastic follow-up to Wish You Were Here and Dark Side Of The Moon. The songs though few in number are epic in length and full of rich textures and intense musical stylings. The highlight for me is the outrageous guitar work of David Gilmour throughout, as clearly evidenced by his soloing on the track \\"Dogs\\". Rick Wright's keyboard work was also a standout on this album and with Roger Waters inspired lyrics, this is one to not pass up for any reason. Still a favorite 25 years later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals Review","review":"This albumb, Amimals, I consider to be one of the most significant works of Pink.
